[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is the patient be more calm and last year when one person build its very first team is in India it's QC knees premium TVs they were priced at seventy thousand rupees and one lakh rupees so yeah the price kind of killed the height now one per seems to have realized that India is obviously a price conscious market and they're one we knew you CDs and V series of TVs which are fairly affordable now this is the oneplus tvu series and it brings some great specs and like oneplus TVs it brings some really cool sorta tricks on boards so we are going to talk about everything let's get started so this is what the 55 inch EU series 1 plus TV looks like on a table and well it looks sleek I mean as you can see the bezels on the front are so narrow and well it looks amazing now the bezels are playing all round but at the bottom you do have a slightly thicker bezel with the oneplus logo on also the right bottom you get this light and a button below to turn on the TV manually the TV itself is pretty thin - I mean if you ignore the base most of the TV is just six point nine millimeters thick yeah this looks really cool and very modern I also like the minimal design on the back which is similar to the first one plus TV it's got the glossy black finish on the top and the carbon fiber texture on the base and as he saw clean and nice supports I hidden right here in this box and when you open this box you get three HDMI ports a USB 2.0 port USB 3.0 port an Ethernet port an optical port RF and a B so that's pretty much everything you need and even the whole design looks premium and sturdy as well these good looking kind of stands come in the box and there's no wall mount in the box but according to one plus the wall mount will be available if you opt for a during the installation process now coming to the front again the displays obviously the highlight of every single TV out there and the one to Stevie you see these Springs are really feature pack display similar to the Q Series last year it's a 55 inch 4k UHD LED display and like the flagship wants this TV it's got a whole lot of tech this display has a 93% DCI p3 color space HDR 10 HDR 10 plus h LG and Dolby vision support and it has the gamma in general during speeches like M EMC noise reduction super-resolution dynamic contrast etc now before I get into these let me tell you that this is a gorgeous display I've been watching a lot of Netflix on it especially peaky blinders which I had been thinking about you since quite some time and well this is a show that has HD r10 support and dolby vision as you can see and well it looks amazing on this display I mean I have a 4k ifalcon TV in my bedroom and the difference in picture quality between this and that is very noticeable I mean obviously the one person Eevee is going to be prized a lot higher than that so it's not really fair comparing these two but let me tell you that this 4k panel is top-notch I mean this is the 4k panel that's right it's very sharp and the colors look vibrant to be honest it's hard for me to go back to my personal TV now coming to its Gama engine features the M EMC feature if smoothness videos is obviously something you notice since it's enabled by default but let's raise it motionsmoothness looks and natural when watching TV shows or movies when you're watching sports it does make a nice difference but yeah you can't choose to turn it off so that's good I also notice the noise reduction feature actually works on my 4k TV there are times when shows with low-light shots look a bit noisy and that's when the one person even looks better in my opinion apart from that there are a lot of display options here in the advanced settings you can tune things like adaptive contrast dimming noise reduction smooth motion etc so also different display modes like a I picture quality with a paling custom and more anyway enough about the display on the sounds front want to steamy you series comes with 4 30 watt speakers there are two full range speakers and two tweeters in a bottom firing design and it has support for Dolby Atmos or the audio and DTS HD we're talking about the sound quality the audio quality from these speakers are really nice there's good clarity and the bass isn't gonna blow your minds but it's pretty good I'd say and one thing I noticed about the sound is the fact that this TV isn't very loud I mean it's decent but even when I put the TV above 80-minute of the volume the sound wasn't crazy loud I mean it shouldn't be a problem if you're using it in your room or your hall but yeah just listen for yourself right now it's around 50 [Applause] [Music] it's not at the display and sound around let's come to the smart in the Smart TV I mean like most Android TV Smart TVs out there the wonderfulest evu series comes with android TV 9 and it honestly kind of makes me wonder where is android TV 10 or even android TV 11 anyway it's talked out of TV and quite surprisingly the TV has a number of apps pre-installed there's the usual Netflix prime video and Google Apps and one perhaps like oxygen play File Manager Bluetooth stereo but there are also apps like eros now Hungama played geo cinema go7 MX player shemar ooh Sony life Spotify boot and deeper yeah that's a lot of apps pre-installed and kind of surprising coming from one place anyway this is a wondrous TV and you all know that one does the software really well so obviously there are a number of cool software tricks there's a new data saver plus feature here which lets you control the data usage you can set the bandwidth control set alerts for data usage and manage data taken by certain apps and also the new kids mode where you can select the apps you want to allow two kids live at the time your kids use the TV and enable eye protection the TV also supports the great one plus connect app which you can install on five phones now and there's also an iOS app available plus there are the features you can turn on or off the TV with the app you can navigate the you are using the trackpad in the app and this is my favorite feature the multitasking multitasking is a big issue in Android TV and well this fixes this you can switch between different apps just like this also we all know how annoying it is to type on Android TV and type sync in the connect tab works smooth and nice you can also use the apps take screenshots just like this now apart from these features Android TV on the oneplus tvu series comes with Google assistance obviously but you can also enable Alexa via the LX app for that is created now there's also chromecast support as well as DLNA support and there's a new content calendar feature as well so yeah this TV is kind of feature pad on the socket will come for the performance the you series 1 plus TV comes with quad quad cortex a53 MediaTek empty 588 7 chipset with 3gb RAM and 16 internal storage the specs are fine because there are 4k TVs with faster cortex a 55 CPUs so this is nothing extraordinary anyway I've been using the TV for a week now and so far the UI has been smooth and decently fast I mean I wouldn't say it's a crazy fast TV but so far it's been really good as for the remote this is the new remote you get and I like the fact that it's bigger so it's easier to hold but I'm not a big fan of the layout I mean the d-pad on the top is kind of fine but the home button below the back button is annoying because on every other TV I'm used to having them side by side so I almost always accidentally press this one plus buttons anyway you get keys for Netflix Prime video Google assistant and this key that brings different settings you can go to quickly I like this one lastly even comes with connectivity the oneplus TV has support for both 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi and there's Bluetooth 5.0 so I think there's no problem there well that's pretty much everything about the new one plus TV u series and if you ask me it's all about the price really I mean compared to the sub 40 4k 55 inch TVs in this price range from the likes of me or vu the one person you see this TV has the more beautiful display with support for high-end features like the camera in general Galba vision it is fairly powerful speakers with Dolby Atmos support which all these TVs lacked in a sort of features that are just really useful and very unique and it's also pretty sorted on the connectivity front so like I said it all depends on the price if price right this new you series 1 plus t me could be what the Q series flagship want this TV couldn't so let's wait for the price and see how it goes but that was our first impressions of the ones that CVU series so what do you think of the new you series V series and I will be pinning down the price in the comment down below so make sure to check that out and yeah give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it with your friends lastly
