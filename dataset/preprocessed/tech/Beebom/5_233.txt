[Applause] so [Music] hey guys this is the page from v1.com and i'll be honest with you i've been using miui for a long long time in fact i first used me ui on my galaxy ace back when me miui was a very popular custom raw i mean back then mio was super popular among android fans because it brought some really cool features in a really nice looking ui something you couldn't say about stock android in fact miui had features that even other skins lagged so yes it was awesome so over the years miui has kind of grown and when xiaomi arrived in india people were obviously excited for the xiaomi hardware but one of the reasons why everyone wanted to buy these new me phones is me ui miui was kind of the big selling point but cut to today that's not really the case see me ui of today has kind of become the drawback on xiaomi phones it is infamous in india for two things the ads and the bloatware which xiaomi has introduced in the platform over the years and that has kind of ruined the miui experience i mean in the past i used to recommend xiaomi budget phones to basically everybody without any hesitation but today say my mom wants to buy a new budget smartphone i'm hesitant to recommend her a new xiaomi budget smartphone because i don't want her to go through all the ads in the ui get spammy notifications because right now this is the truth of me why i'm sure you can relate to this comment down below if you've experienced this in miui anyway so let's remove all the ads all the bloatware from xiaomi phone and if you have a xiaomi phone well you should watch this video very closely so take the redmi note 9 here for example there are two types of bloatware on this phone type 1 the apps you can actually uninstall like these ones as you can see these you can just uninstall without any issues type 2 is the type of load where you can't uninstall in fact you can't even disable them i'm talking about apps like the miui app store called get apps the cleaner app the me music app me mover share me etc now there is a way to remove these apps so all you need is a laptop or pc with adb setup don't worry it's fairly easy and we have a very good guide on adb that you can follow in the description so check that out from the link below you also need to enable usb debugging on your phone in developer options now the last thing you need is the xiaomi deep loader tool that you can just download from the link below now once you have these tools ready it's pretty easy i can just connect the note 9 here to my laptop via adb and as you can see it's connected after that i can just run the xiaomi deep loader tool and as you can see it lists down all of the apps in the phone as you can see there's every single app all the me apps like me browser me drop me cloud me mover me credit me music me video and other stock me ui apps like cleaner scanner get apps etc now what i can do is i can just select the apps here that i don't want yep i'm getting rid of all of these apps from the note 9. and once i've selected these apps i want to remove i can just hit the uninstall button right here and as you can see on the left side all of the selected apps are being removed and that's it done now let's check the note 9. yep as you can see all of the bloatware on the redmi note 9 is gone and it's very clean nice and you know what this can be very important on low end phones which have 16 or 32 gb storage because after i deleted these apps i cleared almost 1gb of storage in fact i also did the same process on the redmi 8 and here's a before and after screenshot of the storage so i basically feed more than 1gb of storage if you take a look at the storage taken by apps so that's pretty awesome so honestly you should do this on your miui phone and if you want a detailed guide i'll leave a link below so check that out moving on i also got rid of the ads now you don't have a single switch or a button to just disable all the ads in the ui in the apps see i know xiaomi promised a single switch to disable system apps that we even saw in early miui 12 betas but the miui 12 update that arrived on the redmi note 9 recently just does not have any such option as you can see maybe we'll get it in the future update but it's not here right now anyway so the point is you'll have to disable ads app by app first up you can disable most of the system ads by deleting the app msa which is basically the me ui ad services app via the deep loader tool i showed you or you can go to settings password and security and disable msa from here however this will not disable all the ads and miui so what you need to do is whenever you find an ad in an app or a page just go to the settings of the respective app and turn off recommendations you'll find this option everywhere now there's another ad that i really hate this one so i can just go to the settings and turn off recommendations and you know what i hate this page itself so i'm going to turn it off by disabling the scan apps feature so that was the ads in the bloatway but there's also the very annoying push notifications so obviously i disabled that too so basically there are two ways to disable annoying push notification you can either press hold or notification when you get one and block them or you can go to settings notifications and disable notifications from the apps you don't want like this it's pretty easy so now that everything is done this here is a xiaomi phone with no ads no bloatware and it's to clean me ui we all want see a lot of people always say that they want a stock android phone in the budget segment when actually they want this a feature pack experience that's also clean and lightweight like me ui without all of the cringe so ultimately the point of this video is that xiaomi should be making an effort to you know fix all these issues i mean i get it xiaomi can not totally remove all the ads all the bloatware especially on low end or budget smartphones because they're obviously making money out of it and i understand that because they launched their phones at very competitive prices but the least xiaomi can do is simplify things so you know what xiaomi can work on bringing a simpler way to get rid of all the bloatware the ads a way that anyone everyone can actually use to get a cleaner miui experience now if you're a me or user or if you have other people in your family who are charming users just go ahead use these methods and clean up your phone and clean up the phones of your family members go ahead do it and if you want a very detailed step-by-step guide we have a link in the description so go ahead check that out as well anyway what do you think of this what is your experience with miui tell us in the comment section below also make sure to
