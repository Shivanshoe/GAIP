[Applause] hey guys this is paige from vm.com and it's time for some vintage bebop see always talk about cool new android apps on the play store but here's a statement open source apps are the coolest why well they have the community the code is publicly accessible the big boys don't track you in these apps and these apps are mostly free so today i'm going to tell you eight super cool open source android apps that are not very well known but like i said they're super cool let's start [Music] first up is floris board which is an open source and privacy focused keyboard i mean with apps like gboard you always know that google is tracking you at all times and this is something that everybody wants i mean nobody wants nobody wants that now this is where open source keyboard apps come in and floor this board is the best of the lot it mostly has all the features you see in apps like gboard or even swiftkey like number row one handed mode gesture typing custom height built-in clipboard etc it even has teams including a g board one if you really miss it badly i also like the options in the top bar there's select all cut copy paste and you press this and you get the undo redo buttons and more it's awesome now this is a keyboard app that supports most of the global languages but there are no regional languages so that's one thing to know [Music] so iphones have this really cool ask app not to track feature which even if you're an android fan you still have to appreciate it i mean i know it hurts but let's appreciate it now android has no such feature obviously but you can still stop trackers in apps with traffic control see this is a great open source app that lets you control the data collection the tracking and apps see when you turn this on it starts working as a vpn tracking the network communications apps are using then it divides trackers into essential social etc so if you see a third-party tracker or something weird you can just block it like this i also like the fact that you can also completely block internet access to specific apps and there's also a traffic log which shows you all the apps using of the data and which ip addresses they are connecting to so that you can see if they're connected to any viewer servers now this will also help you see if any apps are using data or tracking you in the background this is useful right [Music] see i'm someone who tries out a lot of cool new wallpaper apps so i'm not someone who will be impressed with your usual wallpaper app but you know what prism is one app that has been super impressed first off unlike a lot of open source apps this does not have an outdated ui i mean it looks modern and great and the wallpapers here range from beautiful to very cool as you can see there are so many wallpaper categories be it flat shapes amulets stock abstract etc and it's all free plus i like the features too i can tap on each wallpaper get a different color version i can edit wallpapers with different filters including a blur filter which i think a lot of you guys will appreciate lastly it has these super cool home screen setups from the community with the wallpaper icon pack and widget apps mentioned so yeah super cool [Music] see there are times when i need to convert a video for better compatibility and you know what the apps on play store are just weird they have these big in-app purchases full-page ads it's not a great experience well enter this this is an open source app called video transcoder i know generic name and also very generic ui but it works really well this uses the open source program ffmpeg and it lets you change formats there's mp4 avi webm and more i can also change the codec the fps the resolution and even change the audio settings now i have tried it out with even 4k 60fps videos that it works well and one more thing you can also use it to extract audio from videos which i think will come pretty handy for a lot of people [Music] now i know launcher is a fairly popular launcher app that brings the whole pixel experience look on any android phone now for those who don't know launcher is actually an open source app and i'm not talking about the launch launcher 2 that's available in the play store i'm talking about launch at 12 which is still in its alpha state but that brings the whole material you pixel experience look on any android phone even the phones with the older android versions i mean this is the launcher and as you can see you get the whole material you themed icons also the whole launcher ui also changes the accent depending on the wallpaper i can just change the wallpaper and see how the accent changes beat on your app drawer this pop-up menu on the home screen the folders etc now this is the launcher so it's not as elaborate as proper android 12 but it's nice if you want to get a slight taste of material you plus it helps the launch air 12 is feature packed and it's free [Music] see after the whole es file explorer fiasco i have trust issues with free file managers in the play store but you know what material files is different material files is open source it's secure and it's really clean and nice i mean here's the app and look at how simple and minimal this is it's great and this supports material you now this is open source for free but along with the usual file manager features my favorite feature in material files is support for multiple windows see i can open up a new window like this and this will open up multiple instances of the app and so i can just move files between these windows pretty easily apart from that i also like that the app lets you create home screen shortcuts for any files or folders yeah it's handy next up is aurora store now for people who don't know aurora store is actually an open source google play store client so that means it's super useful for anyone who wants to do google or anyone who has a custom rom which does not have the google services now i have mentioned this app in the past but i'm mentioning it again because two things it's got a really nice update recently and second it's very useful see the ui now is better categorized with proper app sections and there's a new floating search action which is cool there are also new themes with the pitch black theme which is my personal favorite now this new ui is definitely nice but you still get all of the useful aurora straw features be the app listings that show the trackers that app has the ability to download apps without logging in or be the ability to change your device to download apps that are maybe not available for your phone so yeah auto store is great so i'm gonna end this list with a very simple utility app called next track now this is an app that lets you do one thing and that is change tracks via the volume button so here's the song playing on youtube music now when the screen is off i can double click on the volume up button to go to the next track i can also double click on the volume down button to go to the previous track now this is something i've seen in a lot of custom roms so it's interesting that this works without root on every single phone i mean this is handy because there are times when you quickly want to change trash without looking at your phone screen the next track is obviously open source and it's free to install but some of its features are locked behind an in-app purchase of 180 rupees overall this list kind of proves my point open source apps are the coolest now all of these apps are free and some of them are available on ebroid but you'll find some of them also on the play store as well either ways i'll leave all the links in the description down below also if you have any other great open source apps that you know that we missed out on make sure to comment down below so that people know also give this video like make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech
