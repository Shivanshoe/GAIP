[Music] [Applause] [Music] so hey guys this is from v1.com and we have already made two videos on the much hyped galaxy s21 ultra but i think the galaxy s 21 also deserves a lot more height well this is the galaxy s21 not the plus radian not the ultra just the s21 and i think this is a very good flagship phone why do i think that let me tell you all about it so here's what i think i feel there are three things about the galaxy s21 that make it my favorite s21 of three variants first up the color options second the size and third the fact that it has most of the important features from the s21 plus and s21 ultra so taking it one by one the colors now i've always been someone who likes bold fancy colors on phones and the galaxy s21 comes in some really cool colors so i have the galaxy s21 phantom violet here which looks really striking it has the golden frame that carries over the camera bump which by the way is a lot smaller when compared to the humongous bump on the as21 ultra and also has the nice matte finish boiler that just looks really cool to me now there's also the phantom black very which is like the batman phone because it's black and minimal and i think it looks really classy now we also have the phantom silver variant which i haven't unboxed yet because i wanted to unbox it in front of you guys so this is the box let me just open it so this is it this is the phone right here and there's quite a few stickers and yeah removing them is a lot of fun there's one more right here on the camera bump yeah this looks good right so basically these are the three galaxy s21 color variants that we have and i personally am confused between the phantom violet and the phantom silver because i think they both look really nice and premium but the majority of people in our office like the phantom black mod because you know matte black oh and by the way there is one very important thing to note here unlike the galaxy s21 plus and the s21 ultra the s21 does not have gorilla glass vectors on the back instead it's a classic pack and yeah i knew about this but it just does not look or feel like plastic it's just very premium i mean when you tap on it you get the idea that this is not glass it's plastic but trust me the feel of this matte plastic back is very similar to the matte glass back on the s21 ultra apart from that the s21 has the same bigger faster fingerprint scanner that the ultra plus have and i think that's a very important improvement and yes it works with wet fingers or you know wet screen now coming to the second reason why i like the s21 so much is the size see there are people who like smaller phones and then there are people who like big phones and then there are people like me who like things somewhere in between and the s21 brings exactly that see it's not big like say the galaxy 21 ultra and it's not small like say the iphone 12 mini i think this is the perfect size see i've been using the galaxy s21 ultra and coming to this after that it's a big difference as you can see it fits perfectly in my hands and the in hand feel is just great because it's also very light compared to other s21 phones at just 169 grams look i've always been an advocate for compact more handy phones and i think the form factor of the galaxy s21 is awesome coming to the galaxy s21 features now how is it different to the s21 plus and the s21 ultra now there are obviously differences here and there but i think the galaxy s21 comes with most of the important features on board first up here's the display that you get it's 6.2 inches of dynamic amoled with the adaptive 120 hertz refresh rate and this gorilla glass victus here but the resolution is fhd plus like the s21 plus also this is a traditional amoled panel that does not go as low as 10 hertz like the new ltpo panel on the ultra but this is still a great display i mean it looks really good and it has 1300 nits of peak brightness and even though the ultra display is slightly superior this is still a flagship amulet panel now one more thing this is a flat display which i know a lot of you guys prefer so that's good too anyway when it comes to camera the galaxy s21 comes with the same camera setup as that of the galaxy s20 from last year a 12 megapixel main camera the 64 megapixel telephoto lens and a 12 megapixel ultra wide angle lens now this is not really a bad thing because samsung has improved things with the software here are some photos we have taken from the s21 and some of these photos are actually very very good the details and colors are very good in good light and i did notice a bit of over saturation at times but i don't think it's a big deal i also noticed improved low light performance and yeah this auto night mode so the photos turn out really sharp and nice and it's not just the main camera the ultra wide angle camera seems pretty good too the color tone is maintained then the dynamic range is very good i mean some of these ultra wide angle shots are really good right there's also a telephoto lens capable of 3x hybrid zoom and it's decent there's no 100x zoom or 10x optical zoom like the ultra but the zoomed in shots look good enough on the video front there's 8k support and here's an 8k video i shot from the phone now apart from 8k video there's also the 8k video snap feature that lets you capture high quality photos from an 8k video and yep it looks very detailed and nice now apart from that i like that most ultra features are present here too there's director's view that lets you use all four cameras at once and i think this is a really cool feature by samsung now one difference i did notice in the s21 is that 4k 60fps is available on the main camera the telephoto lens and the front camera but not on the ultra wide angle lens now moving on to the chipset it's obviously the new 5 nanometer exynos 2100 chipset with lots of ram and storage and having used the s21 ultra as my daily driver i'm fairly positive about its performance on the s21 here especially since so far the phone feels really smooth and fast but yeah disclaimer i'm yet to extensively test this phone as for the benchmark scores the s21 fares similar to the s21 ultra which is kind of expected on the battery front the s21 has a 4000 mah battery and yeah it's smaller compared to the plus and the ultra but i think it should be fine considering the smaller display fhd plus and the new five nanometer chipset oh and there's no charge in the box if you did not guess that already lastly it has all the other flagship features like the ip68 rating fast wireless charging reverse wireless charging stereo speakers and yeah just to let you know it has no micro sd slot so that was a good look at the brand new galaxy s21 and honestly i get it the galaxy s 21 ultra is the best of everything and i get the hype around it but i think the galaxy s21 is super appealing too see the galaxy s21 looks really nice and premium the size is perfect the cameras and performance seem high-end so what's not likely plus it has a lower price tag going with it and if you pre-book the s21 right now there are no cos tmi offers instant cash back of 10 000 rupees with hdfc cards up to 10 000 rupees on exchange additional 2 000 with samsung shop and four months of free youtube premium we have that's a lot of offers look personally i really feel that this the galaxy s21 is a very solid flagship phone and like i said at the start this phone deserves a lot more hype lot more attention than it's getting right now and what do you guys think of
