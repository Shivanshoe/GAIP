[Music] this is the xiaomi 20 pro and this is running the latest miui 13 update so i'm going to show you all the miui 13 features and changes in action and i'm going to talk about miui 13 for india which is very important so don't miss that part so here's the phone and it's running the miui 13 stable build and i'm gonna start with the visual changes first of all me white her team brings cool new live wallpapers there's motion glass which looks like this and this there's more but the highlight has to be the new crystallization wallpapers which shows crystal formation captured on a microscopic level i mean here's one of the wallpapers in action yeah this is cool right here's one more yeah i like these wallpapers anyway the big change in miui 13 if you ask me is the new home screen widgets there's tons of new widgets as you can see for example i have the clock widget the weather widget and the calendar widget on the home screen right here and i like how they look and i like that they change colors depending on the light or dark mode enabled sure most of these widgets take inspiration from ios but at least xiaomi is taking widgets more seriously i mean here's the widget picker and almost every widget is available in these different sizes now there are a ton of widgets here and a lot of them are from chinese apps but i think the basics will make it to miui 13's global and indian version like the steps widget these notes widgets the me home widget to control different devices the mi gallery widget etc apart from this the lock screen miui 13 is slightly tweaked as you can see from this comparison and i like this design especially with the new me sans font which looks minimal and nice the screenshot editors ui is also updated and i think it looks more modern another change i noticed is that the miui launcher seems to support third-party icon packs from the themes app i think miui 13's india version should support icon packs from the play store now these visual changes are fine but right now there's no material you even though this is based on android 12 but apparently a new china miui 13 build is bringing dynamic theming as you can see so i'm hoping we'll get wallpaper theming in miui 13 in india anyway miui 13 also brings interesting app updates i mean there's no huge revamping apps but there are new features in a lot of apps for example this is the camera app and first of all the shutter lag while taking a photo is insanely low just look at the camera app on the xiaomi 12 pro next to the camera up on the me11x and yeah it's really cool now this could be a xiaomi 12 pro feature but i'm hoping it's new at 13. now one cool feature i noticed in the camera is shoot with screen off basically you can turn this on and say you're recording a time lapse video well after three minutes the screen will go off like this to save battery but the video will continue recording yeah this is great the camera app also has this new dynamic shots option which is basically live photos or you know motion photos [Music] next app update is the new clock app here it is next to the clock app on miui 12.5 now the new app has a refined ui with text instead of icons on the top plus there are a couple of new features you can add your sleep schedule so that you can get reminders to go to bed and to wake up this will also track your sleep and bring you stats there's also a morning report feature which brings weather information the first alarm is turned off the gallery app hasn't changed much but i like this new button to switch between all photos and photos from camera only there's also a new recommended page where you get all the features like collage clip video editor etc which were previously the three dot menu button this page also brings you memories just like google photos then there's the new file manager app which i think looks much better now it opens up with the recent page which shows you the you know the recent files then there's the storage tab which seems a bit cleaner now and you also get the folders there itself yeah i like this new file manager look the search is also better with these categories there's also downloads right here the cloud storage and cleanup options are moved here on the top and there are a couple of handy options in the settings you can enable encryption for files in the private folder you can choose to not show photos in reasons which i think makes sense so i like the new app updates in miui 13 but let's talk about miui 13 features now so starting off with something simple the battery page has new performance modes so there's balance which is what the phone is set to by default then there's a saved battery mode which turns off these features to get you extra run time and lastly there's performance mode which will do what it says but it can lead to overheating issues which will lead to throttling issues you'll get this if you've seen our video on the xiaomi 12 pro and 8gen1 if you haven't make sure to check it out also there's a new performance mode toggle in the quick settings which by the way hasn't gotten the whole ios treatment we saw in miui 13 leaks next up in the display settings in the color scheme page there's this new adaptive colors option which basically changes the colors in the display depending on the light around basically this is xiaomi's true tone feature and i think it's a good addition although we'll have to check how well it works the one-handed mode in miui 13 is also better if you remember the current one-handed mode in miui only works when navigation buttons are on the new one-handed mode in miui 13 is simple i can swipe down from the bottom to bring the ui down yeah kind of like ios's reachability feature apart from all these there are a lot of interesting new privacy features in miui 13 which is interesting because it's miui privacy this privacy camera which basically means miui 13 will make sure to detect only faces and hide your lower body when using face recognition there also these bunch of privacy protection features to protect your clipboard data enabled approximate location yeah this from android 12 and also require approval before an app accesses your phone number miui 10 also brings android 12's privacy dashboard in its own ui as you can see which is fine overall it's kind of clear that the miui 13 update is not a huge update it brings widgets some ui changes a lot of refinements but when it comes to miui 13 for india i'm expecting more see the mirror 13 features i've talked about should make it to miui 13 in india but there are three things i'm expecting from the indian release number one no bugs see xiaomi has talked about fixing more than 400 bugs in miui 13 and i know a lot of people in india dislike me why because of its bugs so this is important second i'm also hoping we finally get miui plus features here in india i remember miui plus was announced with miui 12.5 and brings these cool laptop and phone connected features now with me laptops getting popular in india it makes sense third a clean experience see xiaomi has been launching high-end phones in india now and they deserve a better experience see features like face moji keyboard the glance lock screen the sneaky app recommendations these need to go so xiaomi if you're listening just make these changes to me y13 in india and trust me when i say that this will become the best miui update ever yeah this is important if you agree with us make sure to hit like and share this video everywhere so that reaches xiaomi and they do these changes for me ui 13 in india also comment below what are the features you want in miui 13 in india yeah comment down below also subscribe to our channel for more
