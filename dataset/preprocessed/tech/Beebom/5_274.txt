[Applause] [Music]  dissipation vo mom and if you think about the two great Android flagships available in India right now it has to be the one plus eight Pro and the galaxy s2 any plus or the s20 I know there's the estimating ultra as well but that is a bit too expensive anyway coming to these phones these are high-end flagship phones with premium features but what really makes the difference in flagships is the cameras so which of these is the better camera phone well I've been testing out both these phones and the cameras extensively and it's time to find out which of these is the better camera phone also we did a blind test on Instagram with these phones and I'll be sharing the results later on so stay tuned for that now coming to the camera comparison first up it's obviously specs time so both of these flagships have quad cameras and the both have their advantages on paper actually as you can see the 1+8 pro has the higher resolution 48 megapixels main and ultra wide-angle camera while the galaxy has 20 plus has the higher resolution telephoto lens now you all know that these numbers are great it sounds great but these don't really matter a lot what really matters is the picture quality so let's start with the main camera of these phones first up the photos in good light here's a comparison and here you can see that the galaxy story plus photo is the more striking obviously of the two I think it looks beautiful the oneplus a pro shot on the other hand is a bit more contrasting I think it looks a bit too dramatic maybe to achieve a more natural tone but I don't think it's stat successful the SNe plus just looks better here but the 1-phosphate pro has one redeeming thing and that's the detail yeah let's zoom it yep right there now you can see the difference right anyway let's check out another shot in this comparison again the galaxy has 20 plus gets the right vibrant exposure because I took this in the gold in our time so it's a little one the oneplus 8 Pro photo again has made things too dramatic and compared to the s20 plus it seems a bit muted now this is the case in most photos see it's not like the oneplus a pro is bad in fact most of the times the 1 plus 8 pro photos have more detail when you zoom in just check out this comparison I like the overall punch in the colors in the S Tony plus shot it's a little subjective but yeah the s20 plus photo looks a bit more attractive to me however the 1+8 Provins on the detail front just check out this 3 any you can see the details are better on the 1+8 Profoto it's sharper now if you take a social media angle to it because most of us use these photos for exactly that which photo would look better say Instagram will I posted a comparison on my test Instagram account and I honestly like the galaxy's 20 plus photo here as well it's just more social media ready now since I am talking about data in photos both of these spoons have the telephoto lens and both of these can do 3x hybrid zoom and 30x digital zoom so here are some three exhume shots now tree exhuming the s20 pluses telephoto camera does a better job at the colors the 1 + 8 pro photo is sharp too but it's a bit too bluish I think here's another 3x zoom shot and as you can see things are close but I prefer the galaxy s 20 plus here again I also took a couple of 30x shots with these phones and well both of these photos looks ok the 1 + April is obviously the most sharper although yeah I don't think I'll be using 30x on any of these phones anyone comes to low-light things are pretty close first of all you should know something and that's the fact that both these phones turn on the night mode automatically when things get a bit too dark and I did not think of it that now let's take a look at low-light shots from all these ones ok so here are some comparison shots and when you take a look at these one of these phones take very similar photos at times but you know what the 1 + April just has an edge see even though both these phones take good low-light shots if you look closely you can see the 1 + 8 pro photos are sharper just look at this shot if you zoom in a little you can see that Q dog looks sharper in the 1 + Sean here's another comparison and here just look at the surface and the walls on the left the 1% pro shot is better here are some more low-light shots from these spoons and in low-light yeah I think the one per se pro is just better but so far things have been pretty interesting right but stay tuned because things are going to get even complicated and you know close time for the ultra wide-angle lens check out the comparison shots and this is surprising because honestly I expected 1% Pro to do well here in terms of detail and pretty much everything else because it has the Sony I am x5 8640 8 megapixel sensor here but turns out the s 20 + is better see the one proceed pro takes good shots but just look at the s 20 + short side by side the s 20 + photo is Stefan the most stunning one in fact here's another photo and again the s20 plus is brilliant when it comes to overall exposure the 1+8 pros photo looks a bit over processed and it lacks the detail which is surprising here are a couple of more ultra wide-angle shots and yeah the s20 plus a little surprisingly is the winner here then there's the portrait mode where the galaxy is 20 plus uses the time-of-flight sensor or the telephoto lens for the depth bouquet effect on the other hand the 1 + 8 pro also uses the telephoto lens and if you want to wide a shot it uses just softer booking anyway again in the portrait mode sauce the s20 plus just handles the overall exposure better mostly just look at this comparison this is a comparison we posted on Instagram - and most of him like the S - any Plus photo it's just better the 1% pro has just messed up the white balance and the edge detection is super messy even detail and sharpness wise the s20 plus photo is better here's another shot and granted the 1 plus 8 Pro photo looks kind of cool I like the Estonia plus shot way more now remember I said that the galaxy s 20 plus is mostly better because sometimes the s 20 plus adds a warm taint overall making they want this 8 pro shot look a little better but to be honest I'll take the galaxy s 20 + / the aid program comes to these bouquet shots plus the s 20 plus has these cool blur effects which you can choose from and they are pretty fun flavor now the 1 + 8 Pro also has an additional 5 megapixel color filter sensor but since it also works kind of like an x-ray it's been disabled by an update so it's kind of users right now when it comes to videos Galaxy s3 + can shoot stunning 8k videos but the one per se Pro can only shoot up to 4k at 60fps so here's a 4k video from both these phones now I've taken some other videos from these phones and if you ask me as a video camera they are pretty evenly matched both of these videos look stable because they both have oh is and the quality and colors wise - I think they are pretty similar having said that if you look closely you'll see that the exposure is more consistent in the s20 Plus video also a small bump in the beginning is better handled by the s20 so to be honest it's not a big difference but the s20 + may be a little better also if you're wondering about the my performance in videos from both these phones here is a selfie video I shot from both this and listen to the audio hey guys so this is an audio test from the galaxy s 20 plus and the 1% row and this will give you a good idea about how the mic works on both these phones does the video quality on the front camera from the looks of a the one cuz the intro is shooting overexposed video on the back where the one galaxy is 20 plus has got in the background pretty well so let me know how the audio is in the comment section below I think the audio on both the videos is pretty good the s20 plus has less noise but the 1 + 8 Pro seems a bit louder apart from that I also like the s20 pluses additional video features like live focus video aka portrait mode video which is something the 1 + 8 Pro does not come with lastly how can I forget the selfies when it comes to space you have a 16 megapixel sensor on the 1 + 8 Pro and the 10 megapixel sensor on the galaxy s2 ne+ here are some selfies to compare and when it comes to the use with non portrait mode selfies the s 20 + adds a slight yellow tone to the selfies but the dynamic range it offers is unmatched just look at the buildings in the background having said that the 1 + 8 Pro selfies are more dated he has afforded more selfie comparison and the 1 plus 8 Pro is clearly better zooming in on the face the one press photo is more detailed and the edge detection is way better here's another selfie and again the 1 plus 8 pro selfie sharper and more detail so yeah on the selfie front I'll pick the 1 + 8 row well that's pretty much all when comes with camera comparison between these phones so it's time for the verdict the 1 + 8 Pro or the galaxy s 20 + which is the better camera for well to be honest I've really enjoyed taking photos from both these phones but there can only be one winner and that to me is the galaxy s2 NE + C the galaxy a stony plus is just the better camera phone when it comes to photos and good light portrait mode shots ultra wide-angle shots video and my capabilities this is a camera phone I can rely on more yes the 1+8 pro does well in low light and in selfies but other than that I think the galaxy is 20 + is clearly the most consistent camera phone that takes shots that are more pleasing more social media ready and just all-around great the s20 plus is the winner for me that was our camera comparison of the 1 + 8 pro and the galaxy
