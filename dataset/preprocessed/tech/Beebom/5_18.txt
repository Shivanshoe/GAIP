this is the samsung galaxy tab s8 ultra and this is basically samsung's answer to the ipad pros now i think you already know about the specs of this tablet but there are some cool samsung ecosystem features which i will be showing you so yeah watch this video till the end let's begin so the first thing i notice when i unbox the tab s8 ultra is how big this tablet is it's the biggest tablet i have ever used i mean here it is next to the galaxy tab 8 to give you an idea about the size and you can see the difference the screen size here is 14.6 inches which is basically the screen size you expect from laptops not tablets now this size means using this as a tablet takes some getting used to but the flip side of the size is that you get a massive super amoled panel that looks absolutely gorgeous it's the ultimate display experience just look at it it's a big bold display with very narrow bezels the colors are beautiful the blacks are really deep and this has an aspect ratio of 16 to 10 which makes it app for watching shows and movies and boy the movies and shows look stunning on the screen there is obviously the wide wide animal license and there's also hdr support in apps like netflix so it's got everything covered now if you're wondering i think this display is equally good for productivity the text looks sharp it's bright the color accuracy is good if you want to do some photo editing or video editing plus it's a very responsive touch screen with the 120 hertz refresh it it's not ltpo but at 120 hertz on this huge screen everything looks super smooth plus there's haptic feedback on the screen which is very subtle but it's still pretty good because you don't get haptic feedback on most tablets including the ipads as for the design i like that samsung has managed to keep things sleek and nice i mean the diabetes ultra has a premium feel with the metal body which samsung says is resistant to bends and scratches there's also the armor aluminium frame here and this tablet is 5.5 millimeters thin that is quite thin as for the weight this is 726 grams it's not the lightest tablet out there but that was kind of expected with this size anyway the power and volume buttons are on the top in landscape mode there's the accessories connector on the bottom and when it comes to speakers the squad speakers tuned by akg with dolby atmos support and the speakers here are absolutely phenomenal they're loud the sound has a lot of detail and there's also some bass i also like that the four speaker setup has been divided into left right format and it is well balanced and dolby atmos actually brings a cinematic surround sound experience here now there is no headphone jack if you're wondering and there is a micro sd slot with the sim slot apart from this the fingerprint scanner is in the display and works really well and i like its position because it's accessible between landscape or portrait now it's the accessories and software experience that make a tablet amazing and first of all the s pen comes with the diabetes ultra in the box and the experience it brings is amazing see i like this mode pencil pen like design and like the s pen in the s22 ultra this too has an improved latency of just two eight milliseconds and honestly it shows or well does not show because the pen is super smooth to use and has virtually no input lag whatsoever it's very close to what the experience is on the apple pencil apart from this the pressure sensitivity is excellent the palm rejection is very good plus there are all the features we already know and like we screen off memo which is even more handy which is a big screen estate to draw and doodle on there all these shortcuts they're all the s pen gestures beat air actions or this gesture to create a new note quickly there are also the s pen friendly apps like pen up clip studio paint available for free for six months on the tab asset ultra note shell which is free on this tablet and there's obviously the very good samsung notes app so the s pen is great on the tab set ultra and it charges from the back of the tab magnetically but you can also attach it at the top to use it on the go another great accessory of the tablet ultra is the kickstand plus keyboard case and this is sold separately and costs 23k so expensive but it's good the kickstand cover attaches magnetically from the back and i like that it is designed with the s pen in mind the keyboard also attaches magnetically from the bottom and i like the sound it makes i also like that attaching and detaching this is pretty seamless anyway this is the keyboard and this is actually good i like that the keyboard does not feel restricted there's ample space between the keys and while the key travel is decentish the typing experience is fast and good i also like their shortcuts for volume brightness finder and you can even set apps for these keys to open quickly this is cool right there's also a dedicated key for samsung dex which actually makes this keyboard a lot more useful i mean there's so many useful shortcuts you can switch between apps with all tabs you can snap windows to the left and right you can go home with the keyboard shortcut yeah these are very handy there's also a fairly big touchpad here and this works exactly like a laptop touchpad with sport finger gestures such as pinch zoom the three finger multitasking gestures yeah it's pretty cool so the accessories here are good and coming to the software experience the tab s8 comes with one ui 4.1 on top of android 12 and there's the promise of four years of major android updates and four years of security patches which is great as of the specs the tab s8 ultra has the a gen1 chipset with lots of lpddr5 ram and lots of ufs 3.1 storage here the benchmark scores of the tablet and yeah these are obviously good and what was interesting is that the tablet did not throttle in any of the tests we did it is always over the 80 mark which is impressive considering agent one has had its issues on some devices and we come into the deal with performance one ui 4.1 seems fast and well optimized and even the games run smoothly and look beautiful on this massive screen here's asphalt in action which is very smooth and yeah you can see how good it looks bgmi also runs well on this tablet and there's also support for high refresh rate in supported games like pubg new state now with the size of this tablet gaming for a long time it's not very practical but the game performance is definitely very good in fact the good performance is something i noticed even while using the one ui 4.1 tablet specific features c1up 4.1 is optimized for the bigger screen all the apps have a dual pane design and there are a lot of interesting multitasking features you can use the sidebar here to open apps in full screen or open it up in a pop-up window like this you can also use this to open two apps in a split screen mode and what's cool is that you can actually open three different apps at the same time plus you can have an app in a floating window on top of these three apps this is insane i mean i can have a tab open on chrome watch a youtube video check the math score and i can also type in the notes app at the same time the best thing about this is i encountered absolutely no lag whatsoever while doing all this apart from all the multitasking features there are some really cool samsung ecosystem features i mean you already saw samsung decks in action which brings the whole pc-like experience but there's some really advanced features too the samsung multi-controller which is samsung's answer to apple universal control what this does is it lets you use the galaxy books keyboard and touchpad on the tab asset ultra like this you can even move files by dragging the move from the tablet to the laptop this is good there's also tablet keyboard share i can use the tab s8 ultra keyboard and mouse to control the s20 to ultra type on it and yeah practically control it the timer set ultra can also be wirelessly used as a second screen for the galaxy book i know like apple's sidecar here it is in action and what's great is that this actually works without any lag apart from this there's samsung quick share for file sharing across samsung devices galaxy but's auto switch basically lets you use the earphones with two devices at once and yeah you can shift seamlessly there's also samsung's auto framing feature which is very similar to apple center stage so you must have noticed this notch on the front it has dual cameras a 12 megapixel main camera and a 12 megapixel wide camera now the samsung water framing feature focuses on the person in the frame and adjust the view depending on the movement it also widens the frame if there are multiple people it works in most video calling apps too so that is actually useful as to the camera quality i found the selfies to be quite detailed and well exposed and i like that it supports 4k video recording hey guys this here is our 4k 30fps video from the front camera of the tab s8 ultra and i can also switch to the ultra wide angle like this yeah this is wide and nice hit like if you're enjoying this video so far there's also dual camera setup on the back with a 13 megapixel main sensor and a 6 megapixel ultra wide angle camera now here's some photos from the main camera and the ultra wide angle camera side by side now i'm not a big fan of taking photos from tablets but these cameras should come in handy to scan documents or take a photo of receive you'll get the idea coming to the battery there's an 11 200 mah battery and there's no charge in the box i mean for a tablet that costs one lakh rupees it is a bit sad anyway the battery performance is something i'm still testing but the tablet did last for a day for me on most occasions to give you an idea i played a 2-hour netflix movie at max brightness and max volume and the tablet lost 37 battery and as for the charging it supports 45 volt charging and we charge the device with a 45 watt usb pd charger which took the tablet from zero to 100 in one hour 15 minutes which is actually very good given the size of the battery on the connectivity front there's wi-fi 60 bluetooth 5.2 and this is a cellular variant of the tablet with 5g support and also has carried aggregation so no problems there apart from this you can make calls with this tablet and we've checked there's gps support as well now you already know the pricing of the tab a6 ultra rupees one lakh eight thousand nine triple nine for the wi-fi variant rupees one lakh twenty two thousand nine two nine for the wi-fi plus 5g variant so the tab s8 ultra is in the ipad pro segment of high-end feature pack tablets now we don't have an ipad pro to compare this with but this does bring some major usbs the massive 14.6 inch amd display is amazing it's awesome be it for multimedia productivity the speakers are loud and great the performance is flagship great the software experience is well optimized for tablets be it for multitasking or for productivity especially with decks and the effort to create an ecosystem is noticeable in features like multi-control keyboard share etc plus the accessories are great be the keyboard or the s-pen which comes in the box now there are a few quirks too the price is obviously high and this size is obviously not for everyone there's also no charger in the box the keyboard cover is kind of expensive at 23k and some android apps like reddit or instagram still don't play well on tablets having said that there's one thing that i'm sure of the galaxy tab s8 ultra is the most powerful android tablet you can get anyway i want to know your thoughts on the galaxy tab s8 ultra do
