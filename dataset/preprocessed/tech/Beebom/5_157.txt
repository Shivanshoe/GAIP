[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is paige from b1.com and this is the new poco x3 pro and this is the phone that's all hyped up because of the fact that it's said to be the poco f1 successor and that's because it's all about the chipset here i mean the snapdragon 860 at rupees 19k already makes the poco x3 pro a great value for money phone but is it as good as it seems how does it compare to the very good redmi note 10 pro max or even the likes of the real me x7 well this is a poco x3 pro review so let's find out so starting off i know you guys want to know all about the high end performance of the poco x3 pro and i'm gonna get to that but first let me just get the design out of the way so clearly the poco x3 pro looks a lot like the poco xc that launched last year but there is a slight difference see the poco x3 pro has a plastic bag that's kind of divided into three the middle with the big poco logo has the glossy finish while the sides have a matte finish now when i first started using the phone it did feel a little strange because there is a how do i put it a certain friction between the mat and the glossy finish but yeah i did get used to it so that's there apart from that like the poco x3 this is a big and slightly hefty phone i mean 9.3 millimeters thickness and 213 grams of weight make that pretty clear see the poco x3 pro like the poco f1 of the past has a pretty basic functional design if you ask me the redmi note 10 pro max is definitely more premium with its glass back and it's also lighter anyway i said the design is functional because there's a very rare notification led right here on the top and yeah it's very tiny apart from that you get the ir blaster right here the headphone jack on the bottom dual sim plus micro sd hybrid slot you also have the ip53 rating for some splash resistance and apart from that there's dual stereo speakers one speaker at the bottom and one speaker at the top in the earpiece so it's all there and if you're wondering about the speaker performance the speakers here are quite loud and the secondary speaker in the earpiece offers a fairly good amount of depth however do note that the secondary speaker here isn't quite as loud for example so this is with both the speakers and this is just the secondary speaker so you have to make sure that when you're gaming uh the volume will not be quite as loud because the second speaker the primary speaker kind of gets muffled up while gaming as for the display it's more or less the same display as the poco x3 a 120 hertz ips lcd with gorilla glass 6 which is an upgrade now to be honest a 120 hertz ambulant like the note 10 pro would have been you know killer but the ips lcd here is good it has good brightness levels so i did not have any issues with outdoor visibility it's smooth with the higher refresh rate the colors look good and the blacks are as good as you can get in an ips lcd in this segment plus i remember people talking about touch ghosting issues in the x3 well i did not notice that in the hd pro's display overall this ips lcd is good no doubts about that but let me just make this clear that this is no match to the amoled in the note 10 pro or the pro max now a few other important display points to note there's no issues with hd playbacks and netflix or prime video but one thing is even though the phone supports hdr10 i did not notice the hdr tag in movies and shows on netflix so the design and display are out it's time to talk about the big deal in the poco x3 pro the performance so let's get the specs out of the way the powerful snapdragon 860 chipset with the adreno 640 gpu up to six or eight gigs of lpddr4 x ram and 128 or 256 gb of ufs 3.1 storage now i know what's the most exciting thing here snapdragon 8 series chipset i mean it's probably the first time since the poco f1 that a phone brings an 8 series chipset under 20k now first up let me make this very clear that the snapdragon 860 is basically the snapdragon 855 plus i mean just look at this yeah there's no difference between them whatsoever they're basically the same chipset now this means that this is an 8 series chipset from a couple of years back but that's not a bad thing because it still beats every other mid-range chipset in the market right now now here are the geekbench and antutu scores of the poco xc pro now these are some good scores but let's compare first up snapdragon 732 g and the 750g and yeah the 7 series chipsets are not even close between geekbench or antutu the snapdragon 860 is just way ahead now here the scores compared to the slightly more powerful dimension 800u and yes the snapdragon 860 easily beats the density 800 u2 so clearly the snapdragon 860 is a beast in this price range no doubts about that but how is the real-world performance of the poco x3 pro well first up i did a heating and battery drain sort of stress test on the phone i played cod mobile continuously for an hour on the phone and that's at very high graphics and max frame rates and the battery drain was around 18 which is pretty good and as for the temperature the phone did get warm especially around the top and of the back of the camera region and that's kind of expected the temperature was around 40 to 43 degrees which is a little hot but it wasn't unusable or you know uncomfortable to hold the one thing i did notice is that the phone did cool down really quickly after i paused the test which might be because of the cold cooling system that poco has talked about in the x3 pro i also did the cpu throttling test and the performance was kind of location the phone throttled the 64 percent of its max performance which is not poor but not very good as well now those are all the tests that i did but when it comes to daily day-to-day performance the phone has been pretty consistent for me see i've been gaming a lot on this phone and i haven't noticed any major frame drops or stutters not gaming performance has been pretty solid too see the point is people in my family still use the poco f1 and even though the phone has gotten old it does have a few issues here and there it remains fairly good in terms of performance and that's due to the snapdragon 845 chipset and you know what i'm just hoping for the same in the poco x3 pro in the long run anyway there's still a lot to talk about this phone first up yes the performance is awesome but i did notice a couple of weird me up bugs in this phone first up when i'm playing a game and i switch to the home screen the home screen once in a while gets stuck like this another thing i noticed is that instagram did crash for me a number of times especially while viewing stories now this probably might be an instagram issue because instagram is said to be very buggy on android but yeah it's something you should know other than that it's all good it's me uh 12 with android and it's me ui for poco so no ads here as for the bloatware they're obviously xiaomi apps but other pre-installed apps include me credit netflix prime video amazon facebook and linkedin so it's not a lot and they can be uninstalled as for the cameras they're sort of downgraded from poco xt but we all know that numbers don't really matter a lot and i say that especially because the camera performance is pretty good here i certainly had no expectations because the whole downgrade to a 48 megapixel sensor but it did not really feel like a downgrade in good light the x3 pro's camera takes sharp detail photos that have nice contrast and kind of look good i mean this photo is really good right now the dynamic range could have been a little better but other than that it's mostly excellent in daytime in low light the phone automatically enables the night modes for photos of bright but overall i'd say it's decentish i mean the photos are fairly sharp but the details are kind of lacking in low light now individually the poco x3 pro's main camera is overall good and that's the case with most other xiaomi phones in this price segment in fact when compared to the redmi note 10 pro max the poco x3 pro does fairly well mostly see the note 10 pro max does take the more richer more pleasing photos at most times but the poco x3 pro is not far behind sometimes it takes the more natural shot than the redmi which is good in low light though the redmi note 10 pro max is definitely the clear winner the note 10 pro max's low light photos are just sharper detailed and overall better exposed to be honest it's not a big difference but quite expectedly the note 10 pro max has the better camera as for the ultra wide angle lens in the x3 pro it's fairly good there is distortion in the edges on a few shots and the details are okay but other than that the colors are well maintained and the dynamic range is overall decent when it comes to videos this is a 4k 30fps video from the phone and i like it the video is sharp the stability is good enough and even though the contrast seems a bit boosted it's overall pretty good if you're wondering about the selfies the poco xc pro does add a slight warmth to the selfies but it mostly gets the overall exposure right also the details and sharpness are well on points so no problems here moving on the battery on the poco x3 pro is fairly big and there's also a 33 watt fast charger in the box now the battery performance is good in my usage which included an hour of gaming some google maps some calling lots of youtube social media the oneplus watch which i'm testing connected all the time i got a screen on time of around five to six hours which i think is good as for the charging speed the inbox 33 watt charger is pretty fast it takes the phone from 0 to 100 in around 70 minutes which is fairly fast now a lot of you guys always ask us if a phone supports usb power delivery charging and well the poco x3 pro does support usb pd so you can use other usbc charges to charge this phone lastly let me answer a few questions that you guys asked us on twitter camera aggregation support well yes the poco x3 has support for camera aggregation as you can see here the phone is connected to multiple frequencies here with the jio sim card by the way also check with atl and vodafone and yes scatter aggregation is indeed support can a transition impact smoothly at max settings see i've never really played junction impact but i checked things out by default the game is set to medium graphics and i think the game runs fine on that i did try out the highest and high graphics too but i noticed some frame drops so medium it is display visibility under direct sunlight but the display is fairly visible in direct sunlight it's not a problem but if you want to compare things the amoled panel on the note 10 pro max is a tad bit brighter well it's time for the verdict so the poco x3 pro starts at rupees 18 triple nine for the six 128 gb variant and you know what one thing is pretty clear this is a phone that absolutely destroys the competition when it comes to performance just like the poco f1 see let me just put it straight away if you want the most powerful smartphone in this price range the poco x3 pro is an easy choice especially because it gets all the other basics right too the design though kind of big and bland is functional the display is a good ips lcd the camera form is good too and so is the battery so yeah get the poco s3 pro if you want a good phone with high end gaming performance however there's one more option i want to talk about the redmi note 10 pro max is also a very good choice it's obviously not as powerful as the poco x3 pro but it makes more sense for people who want a more sleeker more premium looking phone a 120 hertz amoled panel and slightly better cameras so that's my wording but i want to know what you guys think of the poco x3 pro and how it compares to the redmi note 10 pro max so comment down your thoughts
