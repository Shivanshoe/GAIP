[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys today we are doing something different something we've never done before so here's the story so samsung recently sent us this this super cool briefcase that honestly gives me bond values anyway what do you guys think is inside this is it a brand new smartphone earphones smart safe charging break because you know never seen before cool tech is it a bird is it plane it's a bird it's a plane superman well do pause the video and comment down below what you guys think is inside this mystery briefcase comment down below now i could have opened this but i think there's something really cool inside this mystery box so i wanted to unbox it in front of you guys anyway let's not waste any more time let's end the mystery let's open this box now i said that started this is a super cool briefcase not because of the looks but because of the fact it has some super cool tech like a fingerprint scanner built right here so i have already set it up so i can just do this and yeah it's a lot so what do we have inside well it's actually a wallet so yeah this is the wallet in the box and is it a smart wallet from samsung well i think there's something inside look let me just check okay so in one of the pockets there's this ssd i think this is the latest ssd from samsung the samsung t7 touch it's written right here and yeah this is super small because it fits in one of the wallet pockets like a credit card so it's super small super cool and yeah it also has this fingerprint scanner that you can see so the briefcase has a fingerprint scanner this has the fingerprint scanner see to tell you the truth ever since the t7 touch ssd launched in january this year before the whole lockdown era i've been wanting to get our hands on this ssd because we've been using a couple of t5 ssds on an everyday basis i mean we use the t5 to share files across the team and we are always out of storage on our editing laptop so what we do is we create the whole library on the ssd and even render our videos directly on the ssd so it's a very seamless process now i've been using these t5 ssds for more than a year almost two years i think and these have been working really well so it'll be interesting to see how the t7 compares because this should be a big improvement and yeah let me just check out the specs online first because first of this is a super sleek s8 is just eight millimeters thick and weighs only 58 grams now coming to the important details this is an nvme based ssd which is a great upgrade because the t5 is a sata based ssd plus the t7 supports usb gen 3.2 and that means it's said to have some awesome speeds of up to 1050 megabytes per second read and thousand megabytes per second write speeds that is awesome because as far as i remember the t5 has speeds of up to 540 megabytes a second so this is almost 2x faster so it's a good upgrade so all the specs sound great but i want to see the real world performance so let me just do some tests so generally all our libraries are around 50 to 100 gb in size and it depends on the video lens so let me just plug in the ssd and move one of the libraries to the t7 as well as the t5 to see the difference so here's the galaxy f41 library 44 gb in size so here's the library being copied on both the ssds now the d5 took around 1 minute 30 seconds to copy the file which is fast but the t7 touch took only 55 seconds to copy the file which is a lot faster this is great but i'm gonna do one more thing i want to know if there's any difference in the rendering time so here's the same video being rendered on the t7 touch and the t5 with background rendering turned off and when the t5 takes around 11 minutes 55 seconds to render the file and that's decently fast but the t7 touch did have a difference it only took 10 minutes 7 seconds to render the same 4k video file so yeah the t7 touch is actually a good upgrade on the speed front now do note that you need a laptop with a usb gen 3.2 port to actually get these faster speeds on the t7 touch overall it's pretty clear that the samsung t7 touch or the t7 is an incredibly fast ssd and that's compared to a already fast t5 ssd i mean if you compare it to a regular hard disk your usual hard disk this should be crazy fast with a big difference so yeah this is very speedy but there are two more things i like about the samsung t7 touch and has a design and security see the t7 touch has the aluminium metallic design which by the way makes it short proof and durable and like i said in the beginning i really like how sleek and light this is plus it looks great this is the silver variant of the ssd but it's available in a black variant too and there's also the t7 without the fingerprint scanner that's available in three colors so yeah you have a lot of choices i know it's just an ssd but it's one good looking ssd this is the fingerprint scanner here like i mentioned before so that's a nice addition over the t5 and that's all there's also an led light around the scanner which lights up when the ssd is in action now coming to security i want to use the fingerprint scanner here so when i first connect the ssd to the laptop there's this software which i need to install this is available for both mac os and windows so i can just open it up and i can just set up a password and then i can just add my fingerprint which is a pretty fast process and as you can see there's support for multiple fingerprints here now let me just plug in the ssd and as you can see the ssd is a read only partition right now along with aes 256 256-bit hardware encryption to lock down the biometric data and the files in the drive so it's pretty secure and i can unlock it like this yeah how cool is that i mean this fingerprint scanner isn't any different to the scanners we've used on the phones because this is very fast and very accurate see at the end of it all like i said we've been using the samsung t5s and they've been working really well so the samsung t7 even better that it's very fast faster than the t5 it's very sleek and portable and it has things like the fingerprint scanner i mean if you ask me if anyone is looking for a portable fast and reliable ssd i'd recommend you to go for the t7 or the t7 touch blindly because it's just very good the t7 is available in multiple storage variants 500 gb 1tb and 2tv now we use the 1tb version of the t5 for editing as well as rendering but you can get the variant you require now coming to the pricing during the sales season with the big million days and the great indian festival sale the t7 touch starts at rupees 9 for the 500 gb version while the t7 is available for a starting price of rupees six triple nine so all in all the samsung t7 touch and the samsung t7 ssd makes sense if you are looking for fast portable and you know premium looking ssds so yeah i'd love to know what you guys think of the t7 touch and the t7 and also this whole mystery unboxing
