this is a budget windows laptop running chrome os yeah you might have heard about google bringing chrome os to windows laptops and macbooks with its chrome os flex and this is it right here now i can tell you this that this is a game changer a lifeline for your old windows laptops your pentium celeron laptops you get it this laptop here has these specs celeron dual core cpu uhd 500 graphics hdd 4gb ram and the windows 11 experience on this is absolutely horrible this is actually a brand new laptop that came with windows 11 out of the box and it's funny because we started seeing issues with the very first startup here's a video i recorded from my phone there's no apps running and i hit refresh and just check out the cpu usage it went to 100 now here's another video and you can see how erratic the cpu graph is and that's when the system is idle in fact here i am opening and closing the start menu just for fun and see how the cpus are just rockets up to 100 percent yeah it's crazy not just this chrome crashes with just two tabs open edge does not crash but it's super laggy booting from shutdown takes three freaking minutes see we bought this laptop for 28k because we wanted to try out chrome os flex on a budget windows laptop and after seeing windows 11's performance on it chrome os flex just makes perfect sense for this laptop now let's face it we all have these old windows laptops with a similar experience and we just want to throw them out and this is where chrome os flex comes in see before i get to the chrome os flex installation let me tell you chrome os on this laptop is a far far far better experience than windows 11. see i'm someone who's personally used a lot of chromebooks in the past i mean back in the b-bomb days i used to write a lot of articles on chrome os yeah i did that too but i can tell you this that the chrome os performance on the cenron machine is actually better than a lot of budget chromebooks and it's on a whole different level first of all from almost a three minute boot time with windows 11 chrome os flex boots up in flat 30 seconds now that's a huge difference i ran a focus 60 fps video and also ran an 8k video and a phase minus stutters but it's still better compared to not even being able to run chrome on windows 11. next up i have these 10 tabs open up in chrome and you'll notice that there's absolutely no stutter i can move between these tabs easily put chrome into split screen start the built-in screen recorder and it's all not a problem the performance is just really impressive coming from windows now what's even more impressive is how the subscribe button turns from red to gray try it out if you're enjoying the video so far the battery life seems to be better too on windows when the battery was full on the laptop it was showing me around five hours of runtime on chrome os flex it's a lot better on chrome os flex i'm at 84 battery and it's showing more than seven hours remaining again huge difference now i'm not sure of this number but after using the laptop for around 1 hour it only lost 15 battery so yeah the battery performance seems promising with chrome's flex now chrome os as you all know is all about the web apps chromosplex here is based on chrome os 100 and it has these usual chromos apps google web apps pre-installed now there's chrome the the chrome web store so you can install all the web apps you want you also get this system app that shows your device specs and there's the play store icon but it's not working right now it just takes you to the play store on the web yeah you cannot run android apps right now and google hasn't confirmed it yet but i'm really hoping that we get android support in chrome os plex because that'll make these budget windows laptops even more useful as for all the basic hardware features of the laptop be the wi-fi bluetooth speakers camera the ports everything is working perfectly with chromer's flex the keyboard and trackpad are working fine too i can use chromers keyboard shortcuts on it and the touchpad sports chrome os gestures so basically everything is working and if you've used chrome os you'd know that the chrome os plus android integration is very good and you get that experience with chrome os flex you can share files between the phone and pc with nearby sharing you get your phone notifications in the laptop and you get these different phone controls and the overall status of the phone here in the chrome os notification center so the integration is actually very good plus you get all the other chromos features like google assistant and i also like that chromosplexia has full fledged linux support which is really good because you'll be able to run linux apps and do a lot more to conclude things chrome os flex is a very good step by google it's actually giving fresh life to your own laptop and we all have those old windows laptops which are super laggy stuttering all the time barely holding on to life and with flex they can actually become smooth and nice which is awesome i mean students can use it for media purposes and to attend classes professionals can use it for meetings parents can use it to browse the web see a lot of people just dump their own laptops and it becomes unusable resulting in e-waste with the chip shortage laptop prices are increasing day by day and not everyone can afford to buy a brand new laptop chromeosplex is solving all these issues let me know in the comments if you have an old laptop and you're planning to install this on it also share this video with your friends and family who have a laptop that desperately needs chrome os flex also if you're wondering chrome os flex is available for free and it works with most laptops out there which
