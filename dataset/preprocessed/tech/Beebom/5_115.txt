[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is the page from b1.com and this right here is the brand new me tv 5x now i know a lot of people are interested in this brand new me tv series because this is the successor to the very popular me tv forex now the big question is what's new in the me tv 5x well actually there are upgrades almost every single front be the design the display the sound the connectivity but is it as good as it sounds well i'm gonna tell you all about it let's begin okay so i have the me tv 5x 55 inch version but do note that the 50 inch version has the same features and specs and there's also the 43 inch version which has slightly smaller speakers but that's the only difference okay so this is the tv and the first thing to notice is that this looks a lot like the me q led tv and that's a good thing because the metal frame with the sharp cut edges looks very premium and i like that this metal design is everywhere beat around the frame or even in the stands i also like how narrow the bezels are especially on the sides and the top the bottom bezel is bigger to you know incorporate the new xiaomi logo and there are leds below it but even with that the screen here has an awesome 96 person screen to body ratio and yeah overall it just looks beautiful now talk about that screen it's a big upgrade it's a 10 bit 4k direct led panel with the 60 hertz refresh rate 178 degree wide viewing angles but unlike the me tv 4x there's support for dolby vision hdr 10 plus hlg there's memc it has a wide color gamut with 94 dc ip3 coverage and there's xiaomi's vivid picture engine too now the vivid picture engine 2 is supposed to enhance the color the contrast the brightness depending on what's playing on the screen and yeah it sounds good but what's most interesting is the new adaptive brightness feature so the tv actually has a photo electric sensor that automatically adjusts the screen brightness depending on the light in the room now this is a feature that i've seen on more expensive tvs so it's nice that the 5x brings this as for how it works here's brooklyn nine-nine playing on the tv with the lights off and now i can just turn on the lights and there's a very subtle difference in the display now i'm not sure if it's visible on the camera but i did feel jake and charles's face brighten up a bit i also checked it with wallpapers and i did notice that sometimes it takes a couple of seconds to adjust the brightness but yeah there is a slight difference either ways it's a very subtle feature so you probably won't notice it every single time but yeah it's interesting because there are a lot of times when you switch off the lights and the tv feels too bright i think you can relate to this anyway the adaptive brightness feature part the display on the me tv 5x looks very good but it has a pretty good contrast ratio of 5500 is to one and i'm not aware of the peak brightness of this panel but it looks pretty bright as for the colors the display seems more natural with the standard mode but there's also the vivid mode and that's what actually brings out the vibrancy of this panel there's also hdr 10 plus and dolby vision support like i said and sporting shows support the different vision modes and hdr modes now i personally noticed better colors and blacks when watching an hdr or dolby vision supported show there's also memc support which is basically motion smoothing and that's a feature that i don't like much even higher in tvs but it's here on the me tv 5x and if you're wondering how it works well it works like it's supposed to i mean i did notice that shit's creek are very popular on netflix has this weird stutter when memc was on but that's the only show i faced this issue with i turned off memc and the show was playing fine so yeah i think mmc was the problem there moving on to the speakers unlike the me tv 4x which only had like 20 watt speakers the me tv 5x has 40 watt stereo speakers that are full range and down firing and the support for dolby atmos and dts hd now compared to the 4x the speakers are definitely louder and more crisp here i mean still lacking on the base front but that's not something you expect on tv speakers [Music] next up one feature that the me tv 5x brings is hands-free google assistant i know a lot of tvs these days have this feature but it's still interesting now hands-free google assistant is turned on by default but there is a physical switch below these leds if you want to turn it off as for how it works let me show you hey google open netflix and play money heist okay opening netflix let me give you another example hey google turn on the ac okay changing the ac2 on so yeah that works moving on i want to talk about the software so the me tv 5x has patchwork 4 with android 10 and there are a couple of new features that i feel are slightly work in progress first up there's imdb integration which was personally something i was excited about i mean i always check imdb ratings before watching something but the imdb integration here is kind of patchy right now see some shows and movies have their imdb dating listed but a lot of them don't which makes it very unreliable another new feature as far as i know is support for more than 77 free live channels now some live channels play directly without any additional apps but a lot of these channels require you to install different apps now most live channels are from z6 so you'll have to install it and once you do the stream fine now coming to the performance the me tv 5x is powered by a quad core cortex a55 cpu with the mali g52 mp2 gpu 2gb ram and 16 gb storage now these are standard specs in most tvs in this price range so nothing extraordinary but yeah an upgrade over the forex anyway as far as the performance goes i wouldn't call this the fastest tv ever but it's been fairly responsive be rav loading or app launching or you know just crawling through to be honest tv performance can only be judged via long term usage and to give you a clear idea i've only used the stevia for two days so i'm not making any judgments as of now lastly the other ports and the connectivity the me tv 5x has three hdmi 2.1 ports with one of them supporting earc there are two usb ports and a 3.5 mm jack now below this is the av input optical port and the ethernet port apart from that the support for both 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz wi-fi and this bluetooth 5.0 and there's also an auto low latency mode that automatically turns on when a console is connected to the tv as for the remote it's the usual minimal midi mode as you can see nothing has changed here well coming to the pricing now the new me tv 5x 43 inch version is priced at rupees 34k the 50 inch version is priced at 42k and this 55 inch version is priced at 48k so these are not entry level budget 4k tvs these are fairly premium 4k tvs but the question is is the me tv 5x a good upgrade over the me tv 4x well it definitely seems to be look i personally feel that the improvements here are very good the metal design is just more premium the display looks a lot better with support for different high-end standards and there's a really cool new feature in the form of adaptive brightness there's also hands-free google assistant support the speakers are better the ports are sorted and the specs are in line with what you get in the competition so it's all pretty good i mean the new patchwork features are well patchy but apart from that the me tv 5x brings good upgrades all around anyway these are sort of my early impressions of the me tv 5x and like i said i'm yet to test out the performance so that's something i'll be checking out in the future anyway i want to know your thoughts on the new
