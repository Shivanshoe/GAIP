[Music] [Applause] [Music] so hey guys this is paige from vm.com and we kind of always talk about how xiaomi phones have great hardware they look good they feel good they have great specs and honestly that's what makes them so popular and appealing but if there's one thing that xiaomi hasn't really perfected it's the software i mean i know a lot of people who are okay with me why and it works on a budget xiaomi phone but they won't buy a flagship or say a high-end xiaomi phone because it has me ui so how is the miu experience different on say a budget smartphone and a flagship smartphone has xiaomi done something to make me ui better in its higher priced phones well time to find out okay so this is the redmi note 10 now this is the phone that starts at rupees 12 499 this is running miui 12.0.3 stable and on the other hand is this the me 11 ultra that costs 70 000 rupees this is running on miui 12.0.2 so yeah both these phones are pretty much in the same ballpark now the first area where i wanted to see the difference in the whole miui experience is the phone setup process because a lot of times companies push their services their recommendations in this whole setup process [Music] so first up i factories of these phones and went through the whole setup process as you can see both phones have the face moji keyboards privacy policy enabled by default i mean there's no mention of optional in any of these phones when it indeed is optional yes you can untick this and just go ahead it was just surprising to see the ultra have the face moji keyboard as its default i was expecting gbo the rest of the setup process is similar to including connecting to wi-fi network signing in your google account and me id now once you've done these steps you get this additional settings page on both the phones now generally people just tend to go ahead with these settings but i like disabling a few of them for example you might have missed out on on the glance for me option glance from me aka wallpaper carousel is basically a lockscreen wallpaper feature that pushes out news and stories from third party websites like this one or this one yeah you swipe left on the lock screen and you get this this is basically an ad it's obvious it's at and yes it's present on even the 70 000 costing me 11 ultra anyway the rest of the additional settings are the same to both these phones and yeah i'd recommend disabling a few of them as well now both of these phones get this apps recommendations page from xiaomi's app store get apps yep this whole page is basically a mix of popular apps and apps that xiaomi wants to promote and yes it's there on the ultra too as you can see in fact when the setup is complete and both the phones you get this ad like pop-up from get apps saying need get apps and you also get the same notification asking you to try out the wallpaper carousel feature on both the phones honestly i am fine with these things on the redmi note 10 but on the mi 11 ultra this just doesn't feel right anyway let's move on [Music] so the miui setup process kind of remains the same in both the budget smartphone as well as the flagship xiaomi phone but that's not all the miui experience remains the same when it comes to apps as well both the phones have load where as you can see the redmi note 10 has four apps and the mi 11 ultra has five bloatware apps both the phones come with almost the same number of xiaomi apps 22 on the redmi note 10 and 21 on the mi 11 ultra the media ultra does not have the fm radio app but the rest of the apps as you can see remain the same now both the phones also have the same google apps the me 11 ultra here too has one more app than the redmi note 10. anyway i also wanted to check if there's any difference in app permissions because xiaomi apps have been infamous for taking up unnecessary permissions and i wanted to check if xiaomi has done something to fix that in its flagship phone so check the permissions each and every system app takes and it was similar and that's not really a good thing i mean the security app takes every single permission in both these phones even when i haven't even opened up the app once and yeah you can't deny any of these permissions there's also one strange thing the cleaner app obviously once again simi ui's cleaner app has been known for being connected to the shady cheetah mobile in the past and then we talked about how it takes up every single permission but i think i remember xiaomi fixing these things but it seems to be back to square one here on both the redmi note 10 and the mi 11 ultra the cleaner app takes up every single permission already i haven't even opened up the app previously and do note that both these phones are running on the latest updates so yeah xiaomi clearly hasn't really fixed things so overall it's clear that you can buy a 12 000 rupee xiaomi budget phone or you can get a 70 000 rupees flagship xiaomi phone but you'll get the same miui experience i was honestly expecting a little better on the meal and ultra compared to the budget redmi note 10 but yeah it's the same really see previously we used to say that xiaomi phones include ads and bloatware because its phones are cheap affordable but a phone that costs 70 000 rupees isn't cheap it's a premium phone and on a premium phone like this software plays a very important role i mean xiaomi is taking on oneplus and samsung flagships in this segment and creditreads do oneplus offers a fairly clean experience while samsung offers things like three years of major android version updates so i was actually expecting the me 11 ultra to come with a more cleaner more streamlined new experience because let's face it we don't really buy a phone for its specs we buy into the experience see the point is the hardware the specs that's not enough i mean the mi 11 ultra has a great hardware it's actually a very good premium smartphone but it's the software the miu experience that kind of makes it lacking and this is what xiaomi really needs to work on if xiaomi really wants to compete in the premium smartphone segment they need to fix their software they need to work on the overall experience well i want to know your opinion on this do you guys skip xiaomi flagships because of me why comment down below also if you have a xiaomi phone and you want to remove the bloatware ads and things like that we have a video on the same so check it out from the link below also give this video like share it and yeah stay safe guys hope everything will be normal soon thanks for watching see you the next one [Music] you
