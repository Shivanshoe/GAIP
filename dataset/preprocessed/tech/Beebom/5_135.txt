[Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is from b1.com and a few days back i went hands-on with one of the most craziest smartphones i have ever come across i'm talking about the oppo x 2021 now this is the oppo x and it's a crazy concept smartphone with a rollable display yeah here it is in action see unlike a lot of foldable smartphones out there be the galaxy fold or even the huawei mate x the oppo x 2021 does not have a foldable design instead it has more of a dynamic sliding design let me show you so on the oppo x you just double press on the power button and the screen automatically extends like this i can just double press again and the screen just goes back in seamlessly i mean this looks crazy right i mean this means that you have a phone with a 6.7 inch oled panel and with the double press or even up gesture on the power button the phone turns into a 7.4 inch tablet this is awesome and every time the sliding mechanism happens there's this cool mechanical sound listen to this it's also super fun to just watch the display extend and retract so smoothly i mean here's how it looks like from the back now here's how it looks like from the sides yeah i had the phone for a day and a lot of my time was just spent watching this because yeah this is so addictive anyway this is all cool and futuristic but what's also cool is how the ui adapts to the two different screen sizes as well as aspect ratios i mean here i'm using the oppo x and see how the ui adapts to the bigger screen it also adapts quickly when i switch to the smaller screen i mean the text the icons everything just expands or retracts paste on the screen now color os on the oppo x is obviously designed to adapt to the extended display but it also works seamlessly in apps like youtube here i am watching a video from the weekend on the device and i can just double click on the power button and there is a slight pause in the video but i think the video adapts to the bigger screen and the different aspect ratio brilliantly let me show you another example this time the youtube app is running in portrait mode and i can just again extend the screen and yeah it works very well so the oppo x simply means you have a phone and a tablet available to you all the time so when you want to use a phone you just use a phone but say you want to watch some videos or even play games you can just expand the screen easily now the biggest screen can come in handy for gaming and i did try it on crd mobile as you can see the gameplay and the controls look fine and i honestly wasn't used to playing with the bigger screen but the increased real estate makes this a lot more fun so the opex 2021's rollable form factor is very cool no doubt but how does this tech work where does the screen actually go so actually there are three major parts first the polit panel here is flexible and it just rolls under the phone when not in use the screen has opposed warp track laminate which increases the elasticity of the display which makes sure that when bends it does not break in fact the screen is guaranteed to last for over 100 000 retractions and extensions without resulting in any creases second important part is the two in one display support deck with a dynamic frame and a fixed frame so as the display changes in size the sliding frame and the battery cover on the back move off the display now third key component is oppo's custom built roll motor powertrain which features two drive motors and that is what powers the display extending and retracting yeah there's a lot more tech here and oppa is apparently applied for 122 patents with the oppo x and 12 of them are related to this whole rollable mechanism now this whole mechanism is said to make sure that the screen has no creases and i'll be honest unlike a lot of foldable phones there's no big crease in fact from the front with the screen on it's just your usual flat display you can't notice it but you know what you can actually notice a slight crease when looking at certain angles where the display just roll backs inside i also noticed some dust gathering on this part of the display which is always a concern with devices with many moving parts see there are obviously a lot of questions with the oppo x 2021 as it is with most concept phones or experimental devices for example there's no word on how much toll this whole system will take on the battery life plus right now the device is pretty bulky so is there a way to reduce that or that's a sacrifice we'll have to make what are the specs of this device oppo has not revealed that there are also a few key things missing for example there's no volume rocker here look at the end of the day the oppo x2021 is a wild concept phone but i'll tell you this this has a lot of potential and i hope oppo refines this and we actually get to see this in the market if you ask me this is something i can actually see myself using a phone that just turns into a tablet with a swipe or a double click yeah it all seems so seamless and magical really think about it the oppo x can be a good answer to all the foldables out there this could be the next step in the world of cool unique smartphone form factors well i'm really impressed with the oppo x but i want to know what you guys think what do you guys think of this cool rollable display sliding form
