[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and motorola recently launched a number of new tvs in india but the most high end of the lot has to be this the motorola rivo 55-inch 4k tv now this is a tv that looks very premium very high end but what exactly makes this a premium 4k tv i mean the three most important factors when it comes to a tv becoming a high end tv are the picture quality the sound experience and the smart features so how does the new motorola tv do on all those fronts well i'm going to tell you all about it so let's get started so first up the picture quality now this is the display that you get and this is quite a feature pack display so this is a 55 inch 4k uhd led display and a lot of you guys have been asking us about other details like panel type contrast ratio etc so here goes the panel type here is 10 bit ads the max brightness is said to be 350 nits the contrast ratio is 3 000 to one static and the tv supports 178 degrees wide viewing angles now apart from these numbers and specs the display has almost all of the features the tech and display standards you can think of the support for dolby vision and hdr 10 and i like that i can choose between the different dolby vision modes which i haven't really seen in other 4k tvs in this segment so as you can see i can choose between bright dark and vivid and it shows me the impact in real time so you can choose the one depending on what you're watching it's nice another cool thing is the autotune x plus tech which automatically adjusts things like contrast brightness and hue levels based on what's being played on the screen as for the color gamut it has 91 ntsc so you get the wide color gamut there's also support for smart dimming which handles the contrast dynamically to make sure that the dark scenes in movies and shows are actually dark and not great so the display here is packed with a lot of stuff but it's not all about that i like the display quality as well i mean first of all it's bright right now that i had no problems viewing it in my living room which gets a lot of natural light second when it comes to colors i found them to be a bit over saturated by default but i played around with the settings and it was fine overall so far i think the colors look great on this display and the viewing angles are no problem either and 4k hdr and all division content looks good on the screen so that's pretty good as for all the tag i did find the smart dimming feature work very well with the dark scenes when i was watching the haunting of blind maynard on netflix so yeah that seems good so i personally think that the motorola tv is pretty sorted on the display front i think apart from the display quality which is very good by the way i like the fact that it has support for high-end display standards which is very good for a premium tv now moving on to the second big factor the sound so you've already seen this samba and that means the sound experience should be pretty good when it comes to specs there's a four unit config here with two high based speakers with two high octave tweeters making up for an output of 50 watts yeah that sounds awesome and the speakers sound well awesome too these are very loud very clear speakers and there's very good bass too something you don't get in a lot of tvs plus there's also dolby atmos support which you can turn on or off and also choose from the different dolby modes so you get the whole surround sound impact there's also dts surround studio support and i like the control and offer now do note that you can only use either dot view atmos or dds surround studio at once anyway these features are good but it's the sound that matters and so far i've been impressed with the sound just listen to this let me just increase the volume [Music] so thanks for the built-in sound bar the sound experience is actually pretty good so next up let's talk about the smart features and the overall experience so this tv comes with android tv 10 which is more optimized while including all the features we know like google assistant and chromecast built in see this is the first tv i have used with the android tv 10 update and while the ui does feel smoother and more responsive thanks to android tv 10s memory optimizations and other performance improvements i also noticed that tv boots are faster here's the tv booting up and yeah it takes a bit of time but it's definitely faster than the other tvs i've used now it's not just booting up it also wakes up faster see so android tv 10 is all about performance upgrades and i did notice that coming from the tv i use at home plus i like the fact that motorola has promised timely upgrades to tv so that's good to know now part of the smooth and fluid performance so far is also due to the specs on board mediatek's mt5660 chipset the mali g52 mc1 gpu 2gb ram and 32gb storage now along with these specs the tv also has the rtc e-tec aka response time compensation engine which is generally part of gaming monitors and this makes sure that the motion blur is reduced a lot now apart from that i know a lot of you guys want to know the pre-installed apps so there's netflix a live tv app a media center app for local files youtube play movies play music play store play games and e-manual app and app to play audio via bluetooth and apps like eye-casting tv lean key keyboard and this browser now if you're wondering about other otd apps like prime video don't worry i had installed it via the play store and it works as you'd expect it to so this is a very stock android tv experience which is good but yeah a special moto lab maybe with features like multitasking gesture control would have definitely made it nicer anyway also part of the whole android tv experience is this remote so you get this kind of massive remote with the tv with a lot of buttons like a lot now along with the usual tv remote buttons you also get dedicated keys for netflix play store youtube z5 and google assistant so that's good and the buttons are tactile too and you get the remote batteries in the box so that's nice too so all that is great but there's one more thing that makes the rivo tv a premium 4k tv the design see this looks like a high-end tv all along like i said at the start especially with the very unique and cool looking metal stand the sound bar built into the tv and the fact that the screen is almost bezel-less i also like the razor thin panel thanks to the od 18 millimeter design that motorola is using here and as for the ports you get the av input the antenna in a couple of usb a ports one usb 2.0 and one usb 1.0 three hdmi ports a digital audio out and a lan port apart from that when it comes to the connectivity options there's 2.4 gigahertz and five gigahertz wi-fi supported along with bluetooth 5.0 so that's pretty sorted so that was everything about the new motorola rivu 55-inch 4k tv and coming to the pricing this is price rupees 40 triple nine but there's also a 43 inch version priced at rupees 30 triple nine so yeah you have the options anyway if you ask me i like the new motorola rivo 55 inch 4k tv so far i like how it looks how the display looks and how it sounds which honestly the key things in any tv now i know you can get 55 inch 4k tvs at a lower price but this is motorola's premium tv and i think that's the reason it's priced higher anyway i'd love to know what do you guys think about these new motorola tvs tell us in the comments down below also like this video share it around and
