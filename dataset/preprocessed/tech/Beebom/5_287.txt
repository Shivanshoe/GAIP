[Music] hey guys impatient be boom calm and when the load of started VRD guys to share your screen on time on the phones and the results were crazy I mean some of you use Instagram for eight hours a day yeah that is crazy anyway it is locked down and we are all using Instagram a lot so how much some really cool hidden Instagram tricks and setting that you're going to love yeah we're going to talk about that today and yeah the clicks get better as they go along so make sure to watch the video to the very end and you have to give it time on the fourth one because that's my favorite and so for the video or feature in Instagram anyway let's get started I know there's a way to create collage stories in Instagram through this layout option but the problem with this is you cannot use your previously captured photos I mean what if I wanted to create a collage of photos from Las Vegas from the good old days well that's where this super cool trick comes in handy to add kool-aid stories here's what you need to do just open up the first photo you want to add in the collage and take a screenshot crop it and save it now go to Instagram you go to the story's page and just create a plain background I like a solid black background so I'm gonna go with this now just add the text you want and then again use the text tool press hold here and you will see the option to paste use this and voila picture add it your screenshots are automatically copied so yeah I can take the screenshots of the photos I want in the collage and paste them one by one and that's it the collage is ready yet this looks super cool right now this is way easier than iPhones and I if you just copy affording the Photos app and it will automatically show up in the Instagram story space super convenient now since we're talking about stories here's a pro tip for b-bomb fans so in stories in the stickers page you can just search for b-bomb and look at this b-bomb stickers are now live as you can see there are a bunch of them and this akshay sticker is my favorite well go ahead use these stickers and taggers and we'll share your story on our page so go ahead do it and also make sure for us [Music] okay Instagram recently introduced a custom status feature that not a lot of people know about and apps because it's kind of tricky so check this out this shows my status as chilling and it is automatic and uses your location to let your friends know what you up to I'm at my home right now like all of us so does the chilling status now if you're wondering how did I set up the status well you can't set it up on Instagram you need the threads app for this so just install the threads are for Instagram and here to select the friends will be able to see your custom status and then set your status to automatic or any of these or even create your own custom status now once done your friends will see your custom status in Instagram and the best thing your friends don't need to install the threads I have to see your status yeah it's pretty cool because this is something we have always wanted the ability to unfollow a lot of people really quickly people you don't interact with much well Instagram now has an option for it you can just go to your Instagram profile here just check out the following list you can see here that there's a new least interacted with section right well this shows the list of people you least interacted with in the last 90 days now here you can just quickly and follow people of pages quickly like this and yeah it's pretty easy now it's not just this there are a couple of new options in the followers page as well you can see these two new options here right accounts you don't follow back and least interacted with well I think a list that show people who don't follow you back might have been more useful but you can check these out if you want [Music] okay this is my personal favorite this is another cool trick in Instagram that again is pretty new and kind of perfect for this time when we are friends all of us are locked up so let me show you so when you're on a video call Instagram you can see this media option right well you can use this to browse posts with friends yeah it's super cool so you get these three tabs where you can see your light posts saved posts and recommended pores now say you wanted to talk about a certain post with your friend where if you just select one of these posts and it will show up on both yours and your friends screen you up like this so you can open up a picture you want to show to your friend or you know discuss a photo yeah this is super cool and like I said perfect right now when we just can't meet our friends or parents [Music] so recently Instagram took a big bold decision to start hiding likes now some people can still see the likes while some people like me don't see the number of likes anymore well there's a very simple trick to see the lights gone so say I want to see the number of likes on our ninth anniversary post then I can just copy the link of this post open Chrome open the incognito mode and just paste the link and why not you can see the lights count it's pretty easy right now there's one more trick to view the lights count so you can use this Chrome extension on your PC or Mac that shows you the like and comment counts you can just install this extension and just open up Instagram comm now you can see the number of likes as well as the number of comments right on top of a post it's pretty handy what do you think I've always noticed in Instagram is that there is no way to view the profile picture again the DP of someone in full-size now tapping on the picture does absolutely nothing well how about a trick to see this picture in full size so all you need to do is just open up the profile who's deep you want to see and just hit the tree dot menu button and copy the profile URL then go to Chrome and again paste this link now don't go ahead just add 0 at the start before Instagram like this now just go ahead and once the profile loads up to step on the DP and you should be able to see the profile picture in HD glory yeah this is great now apart from this you can also use a website like insta DP that lets you search for profiles and see the DPS and full size [Music] let's face it we all have that Instagram friend who cannot blog but we also don't want to see their messages or don't want others to see their comments on our pores where Instagram has this restrict feature just for that so Akshay is one of the people I hate really so I can just go this profile hit the three dot menu button and tap on restrict yeah which brings up this prompt now this is only I and Akshay will be able to see his new comments on my posts and his chat is now in my message request yay sorry Akshay but how to do it so you can use this to to make sure you can ignore people you know body everytime someone you follow goes live or Instagram you get a notification like this now it is handy when you actually enjoy life sessions from a certain account like us but with the log down almost everyone is going like these days so these notifications you'll get a little too much well here's how to disable them you just go to Instagram settings here go to notifications life and IG TV you just turn off notifications for live videos and yeah it's done you'll no longer to seem liable if occations and you can live with peace I guess but those are some really cool and useful Instagram tricks and settings are you should definitely travel and smartphone but there's a lot more and we have a dedicated article on the same check it out from the link in the description or go also do not that are some of our equipment is lot of us to do all of my equipment is also get
