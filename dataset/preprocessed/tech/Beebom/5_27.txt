realme pad has been the best tablet under 20 000 rupees chances are you watch the video and now this is here the real me pad mini which is priced even lower at just 11k so is this a good 8-inch tablet stay tuned to find out and also i'll be doing a comparison with the samsung galaxy tab a7 lite and the moto tab g20 so don't miss that so here's the readme pad mini and it looks like a smaller version of the redmi pad which is not a bad thing there's the same aluminium finish with the ream logo at the bottom although these lines which are probably antenna bands are horizontal on the top and the bottom as for the weight and size this is pretty sleek at 7.6 millimeters thickness and it's 372 grams in weight now one of the big differences between this and the bigger redmi pad is obviously the size here are both the tablets and you can see that the mini is much smaller in fact holding the dmi pad meaning the hands feels like holding a slightly bigger phone i mean this size is just much more easy to use as for the functionality there's the power button and the volume buttons on the side the headphone jack is here and there's a dual sim plus microsd hybrid slot yeah this is the lte variant and there is a phone app here so you can make calls on it and if the screen is an 8.7 inch ips lcd with the wu xga resolution which is close to hd and to be honest the display is an area where it does feel like a low-end tablet see i would have liked the same high resolution as the redmi pad screen but this is a lower price device so really hard to cut corners in the display now this display has its positives for example the bezels are not too big the colors look decent and there's an option in display settings called video display enhancement which works in apps like youtube and this does make the display a bit more vivid when playing videos which is good the tablet also has the wide wine l1 license and movies and shows and apps like netflix run it hd so no problems here about home days the blacks are good too as far as lcd panels go and i noticed that even though this is not the brightest display it's still brighter than the bigger real me pad as you can see from this comparison and as for the negatives of the display the viewing angles are kind of average and the low resolution is also noticeable sometimes if you ask me these aren't exactly deal breakers at this price point now the display does not have stylus support and there's no keyboard case just like the bigger really bad when it comes to speakers there are dual speakers in a top and bottom config and they are direct audio certified and there's also adaptive surround sound the speakers here are fairly loud not as loud as quad speakers obviously but it's good as for the quality it does get a little flat at max volumes but other than that it's fairly crisp and nice now what i really liked about the readme pad mini is that realme hasn't compromised the performance on this tablet these are the specs and the uni soc t616 is basically the same chipset as the t610 we also saw in the nokia t20 tablet and that means it's almost on par with the mediatek g80 on the bigger enemy pad i mean here are the benchmarks and like i said the pad mini scores are very close to the og really bad beating android 2 or geek bench which is really good i also checked for cpu throttling and the performance was very good as you can see the real-world performance of this tablet is pretty good too the usual apps like chrome facebook instagram youtube all work without any lag or stutter and there is some lag when the battery goes low but other than that the performance is good this is also because the software here is very minimal there's readme of a pad based on android 11 and it's the same experience as the big really bad i mean it's not the usual feature which really ui it's fairly bare bones but it was the same with the redmi pad so i guess it's okay plus this ui has its advantages there's no bloatware apps no ads no weird lock screen features it's all clean and nice now there are useful things like the kit space from google and the youtube kids app if you plan on buying this tablet for your kid apart from that it's pretty much the phone ui expanded for a tablet you can put apps into split screen from the recent screen but there's no docker gesture the navigation gestures from android are here but like on the readme pad you can't switch between app by swiping on the bottom i mean this should have been fixed right what do you think plus there's no promise of updates i mean you asked realme and they said that they'll be pushing out security updates frequently which basically means no major android updates i mean i know that this is a budget android tablet but at least it deserves android 12. what do you guys think let us know in the comments do you think this should get android 12 or 12l so the software remains kind of simple but moving on to the gaming performance it's oakish asphalt and its default graphics settings was a little inconsistent laggy at times but lowering the graphics mostly fixes that same with cod and is the same with bgmi bgmi supports hd and high settings are smooth and high and at hd the game was not very smooth but at smooth graphics the performance is a lot better and much more playable coming to the cameras there's an eight megapixel camera on the rear and a five megapixel camera on the front honestly it's high time companies prioritize the front cameras and tablets because that's going to be used a lot more anyway the front camera only shoots 720p video and here's a video to give you an idea about the mic and the front camera this is a video shot from the front 5 megapixel camera of the redmi pad mini and i know the quality looks kind of oakish let me know what the my quality in the comments the battery is a 6400 mh1 and there is this 80 watt charger in the box which is really good for this price range now we did a couple of tests on the battery we played a youtube video at 1080p with the screen set to match brightness and volume at 60 for an hour and the battery drain was 14 which i think is pretty good we also played cod mobile at the max settings established supports for an r and the battery drain was 21 so the battery performance seems fairly good so far on the realme pad mini and one thing to note the device does not ever get too hard when it comes to general usage or even gaming lastly talking about the connectivity the readme pad mini has dual band wi-fi five bluetooth 5.0 gps at least in the cellular version but there's no camera aggregation which is kind of expected for a budget tablet like this to conclude things the real me pad mini has launched india rupees 10 triple nine for the wi-fi only variant and the wi-fi plus lte variant starts at rupees 12 triple night now if i'm being honest with you if you are okay with bigger 10 inch tablets and if you have a slightly higher budget i'd still recommend you the real me pad the bigger one it's still a better device but if you want a smaller tablet and your budget is slightly lower this still is a very good option i also say this because if you compare the readme pad mini to the galaxy tab a7 lite and the moto tab g20 the real me pad mini looks better the moto tablet is the lightest the real me pad mini is the slimmest but very importantly the real me pad mini's uni soc t616 is more powerful than the helio p22t it also has faster ufs 2.1 storage compared to emc storage on the samsung and the moto tab it also has the better front camera a bigger battery and a faster charger in the box sure the software on the tab a7 lite will probably be better because it's samsung but i will take better performance so overall the readme pad mini is good value for money although i still think they'll be should give at least one major android update for this anyway do you want us to buy these eight inch tablets and do a proper
