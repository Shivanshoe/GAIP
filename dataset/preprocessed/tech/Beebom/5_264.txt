[Music] no-no-no let's just stop [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is location b1 calm and I'm just gonna get straight to the point this is the redmi note 9 pro plus some tidbits of the redmi note 9 pro global version and that equals the brand new PO core M 2 Pro yeah that's pretty much it now I'm just not sure what's the point of this phone why does this one even exist I mean like I said this is just the redmi note 9 pro rebranded but here let me get it retail ok so the biggest way the po po m2 pro differs from the redmi note 9 pro is the design and to be honest it's not even that big a difference as you can see on the back the phone has this textured look also the camera module is a little different but don't confuse this for an original design that's not what Poker does these days the back right here is from the global version of the redmi note 9 pro see this yeah so again the poco m2 pro is another rebranded phone from poco now the back of the phone might be from the redmi note 9 pro global version but the rest of the stuff is pretty much like the indian variant of the redmi note 9 throw scratch that it's basically they let me note 9 Pro T Brandon so let's just check out the dimensions of the phone compared to the redmi note 9 pro as you can see the height the width the thickness even the weight it's identical I mean just look at both the phones side by side there's no difference from the front just look at the sides now the bottom it's all identical beat the side mounted fingerprint scanner both of the buttons so the back was the only difference reading let's move on from the design to the specs and when the specs are basically the exact same as the note 9 pro so the program 2 pro comes in IPS LCD display with Gorilla Glass 5 that's exactly the same size the same quality as the redmi note 9 pro there's even the same center punch hole on the top and yes there's no high refresh rate both the phones are powered by the Snapdragon 720 G chipset with up to 1 to 88 GB storage and up to 6 GB that both the phones have the same camera setup a forty eight megapixel primary camera and 8 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens a 5 megapixel macro lens and a 2 megapixel depth sensor on the front they both have 16 megapixel sensors when it comes to the battery both these phone come with a 5000 mAh battery but there's one difference here the poco m2 Pro comes with a 33 what fast charger in the box so just look at the spec sheet of both the phones they are basically the same phone and yeah the charger and obviously like I said the bag design is the only difference no software here is obviously me you I just like the redmi note 9 pro but yeah the poco m2 pro comes with a poker launcher but of late I've noticed some really important issues in me why that I want to talk about first of all both these phones have the recently banned app hello pre-installed that I understand was pre-installed on the note 9 probe but the popo m2 is a newly launched phone and it has arrived after the government directive so they should have removed this but that's all the cleaner app on these phones is a big privacy issue when you open up the app for the first time you get this problem cleaner needs to upload the file names of the location data files to clean masters servers yeah the cleaner app is part by clean master the notorious app made by cheetah mobiles the infamous Chinese developers and by the way clean master is on the list of banned apps in India so again Xiaomi should have removed this plus we recently got this to each showing how the cleaner app and me you I takes basically every single permission and it's true I mean I just hit I agree and the app did not even ask for any permission and if I go into the permissions page of the app just take a look it has permissions to basically everything calendar location might physical activity details storage telephone why does a cleaner app require all this to be honest a more apt question would be why is a cleaner app installed on a phone in 2020 it just does not make sense and this is an app that's installed on almost every me y device now there are more things that notice while setting up the phone see on the first terms and conditions page the I have read and agreed to face moji privacy policies already ticked by default I mean shouldn't the user have the choice yes I went ahead and untagged it but a lot of people will not notice it and just go ahead with it now coming back to the poco m2 probe let me just say this it's disappointing see when Pope came back with the poco x2 I did not like the fact that it was the redmi catotti rebranded but at least it was exciting especially because of its 120 Hertz in fresh rate that was really new in this price range now I really thought that after the x2 poco would launch something more exciting in India but now the poco aimed to pro has arrived and it has just killed my excitement this the phone that does not really deserve to be launched there's literally nothing new it brings now the question is why would a company launched its own competitor the answer is probably they're all for the note nitro did not work out so they're trying to sell it under a different name the poco m2 Pro I mean when you search for the redmi note 9 Pro on Flipkart right now it's unavailable and at the top you can see the introducing poco m2 Pro banners so it's clear they won't replace the note 9 Pro with this see honestly the poco m2 pro might not be a bad smartphone but I'm just disappointed with this whole rebranding the fact that poco is now just releasing redmi phones it's pretty sad what do you think of the new poke way to pro tell us in the comment section below are you okay with the whole rebranding Xiaomi has been doing tell us in the comments and yeah make sure to share this video so that it reaches to Xiaomi people so that they know about the privacy issues that we talked about in
