this is the motorola h30 pro a proper flagship phone with snapdragon 8gen1 at rupees 49 triple nine yeah that is an interesting price for a flagship phone like this i mean if you look at other agent one flashes in india there's the iq 9 pro that starts to be 65 000 there's the galaxy s22 that's coming with engine one and that will be launching at 73k so the motorola h30 pro at rupees 50k is way more affordable i mean 50k is the sweet spot for android flagships if you ask me so basically there are two questions is the motorola h30 pro a good balanced flagship are there any cost cuttings to get to this price well i'm gonna answer both of those questions but let's start with the first one so the motorola h30 pro does have features that i expect in a flagship phone first of all this looks like a high-end phone there's the matte finished gorilla glass 5 back and while the color is blue it has this sort of gradient which sometimes makes it look black and sometimes even green when there's light falling on it i also like that the phone is very sleek and it's below the 200 gram threshold which is what i like now the power button is a bit too high but maybe i'll get used to it now i said flagship features because this has support for wireless charging as well as reverse wireless power sharing yeah that is good i mean this is one feature i always expect in a flagship i also like that even though there's no headphone jack or micro sd slot in typical flagship style it has a usb 3.1 usb c port this is important because a lot of recent high-end phones like the oneplus 9rt or even the ico 9 or even the flagship icon 9 pro have usb 2.0 usb c ports so this is good also the phone has a stereo speaker setup i mean this is one feature that i was badly missing in the edge 20 pro so i'm glad that this phone has it the display is flagship p2 it has this amd panel and here are all the specs and this is actually the same display as the h20 pro and that's fine because this is a bright sharp and very vibrant panel and it's got the very fast 144 hertz refresh rate which makes the ui seem super smooth there's also hdr template support in apps like prime video which is awesome i mean i watched some hdr shows on prime video and it looks very crisp and nice then there's the flagship snapdragon chipset agent one under the hood along with ufs 3.1 storage lpddf5 ram all flagship specs and the benchmarks obviously show that this is a very powerful phone now i know with engine 1 there's obviously the hold out of thermal throttling issues and i checked it on the h30 pro see sometimes the phone does well in the test as you can see throttling to only 93 of its max performance but the performance numbers seem limited sometimes it does decently throttling to 72 percent with no red in the graph and sometimes it does throttle as you can see in the screenshot so the agent one on the motorola h30 pro is a bit inconsistent when it comes to the thermal throttling when it comes to real world usage though the phone feels like a flagship when you use it everything is just very responsive with scrolling multitasking using different apps there's no lag i also noticed that the camera app is faster the shutter lag is super low no matter which camera you're using and gaming is good too bgmi at ultra hd graphics and ultra frame rates is smooth and nice it's basically the experience you expect from a flagship phone look i haven't put in my sim card in this phone to use it as my daily driver but so far the performance is good as for the thermal throttling issues hampering the day-to-day performance that hasn't happened yet but i will be testing it in the long run to get a better idea there's no cost cutting on the battery or charging front fairly good size battery as you can see and motorola has finally brought a very fast 68 watt charger in the box this is a charger and i like that it's a usb pd charger because one this means the phone supports usb pd charging and two you'll be able to use it with other devices as for the charging speeds 10 to 50 percent in 15 minutes and 100 in around 15 minutes coming to the cameras the main camera is a 50 megapixel sensor with ois omnidirectional autofocus and and even the ultra wide angle sensor is a 50 megapixel sensor now the photos from the main camera look like they've been taken from a good high-end phone with a lot of detail punchy colors in low light it's not the best out there but the photos are bright and sharp anyway the rear camera has support for 8k 24 fps or 30 fps videos and there's also 4k 60 fps support the ultra wide angle camera is good too unlike a lot of other wide sensors it does not totally wash out the details and it matches the colors of the main camera most of the times which is pretty good the selfie camera as you can see is pretty interesting a 60 megapixel sensor on the front with the quad pixel tech and you can take 60 megapixel shots or you can choose between 15 megapixel and 8 megapixel i took photos in the recommended 15 megapixel mode and the selfies are actually very sharp and detailed the front camera also has 4k video recording support and here's a video i shot and it's good just look at the details and the sharpness now one of the big usps of motorola is the clean software experience and it's even better on the s30 pro because it has android 12 on board and the experience is actually pixel-like i mean you get the material you themed quick settings and notifications there's also the settings page analytic motorola has implemented the dynamic theming feature here in the personalization page you can choose between the different colors for the theming or you can pick the colors from the wallpaper like this there's also the new android 12 widgets be these cool clock widgets the new youtube music widget the gmail widget or more seems a true android 12 experience especially with all the cool animations and it just makes using this phone so much fun now there is the motorola app with all the really cool gestures and there's also the ready for feature which also works wirelessly as for software support motorola has confirmed android 13 and 14 for this phone and there's three years of security patches there's also no cost cuttings in the connectivity there are 13 5g bands wi-fi 6e 3ca support with 4x4 mimo and bluetooth 5.2 now what exactly are the cost cuttings in the motona h30 pro well there are a few first of all the frame of the h30 pro is plastic not a big deal but yeah also the fingerprint scanner is in the power button i mean it's fast and nice but i would have liked an in-display scanner in a flagship phone like this another cost cutting if you ask me is the ip52 rating most flagships have ip67 or 68 water and dust resistance and ip52 is just splash resistance there's also no telephoto lens which even the s20 pro had so i'm guessing what will escape that to get this price for the h30 pro also one last thing the h30 pro has most of the sensors except for barometer which all flagships have now to conclude things the question is is the motorola h30 pro a good balanced flagship or are these cost cuttings deal breakers well personally i think the 50k price tag of the motorola h30 pro is very good and by the way motorola is also offering rupees 5000 discount on sbi credit cards so if you happen to have one you can basically get this phone for 45k look motorola has skipped a few features to get this great price but i think they have managed to get the basics the balance of a flagship right snapdragon 8gen1 is the latest and greatest even with its thermal throttling doubts the battery is fairly big there's very fast charging with wireless charging supported and the audio tool experience is great no other flagship in india has this pixel like experience so the motorola h30 pro seems like a good deal but i want to know what you guys think of this phone the price comment down below also give this
