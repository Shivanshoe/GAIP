hey guys this is paige from bbm.com and offline geo has been pretty much everywhere i mean i've noticed that i'm pretty sure you have too the geo is entering a lot of different market sectors with a lot of different services but but it's also cloning a lot of popular apps so the big question is is jio truly a super power or is it a copycat well this is a question i'm gonna answer today so let's get started okay so listen there are two types of companies in the world one which come across a problem in the market and then does the research find a solution and creates a product to solve that problem second type of companies are companies which look for opportunities the moment they see an opening an opportunity where they can capture a big market share they just jump right on it jio is in this category of companies let me give you an example so ever since the long run began we saw zoom the cloud meeting app getting crazy popular all across the world because of its 100 person meeting groups now geo saw this as an opportunity this sorted zoom is getting popular and before zoom could capture the indian market jio created jio meet in just two months yes jio only took two months to create this app which already has five million downloads it's crazy now g only took two months to create this app because this is jio meet next to zoom yes just look at these screen shots geomet is basically a copy of zoom now for all the copycat claims you did update their app to look slightly different but it wasn't a big change see the point is if geo would have gone for a new app from the ground up with the unique design and unique features it wouldn't have been possible in just two months and after a few months zoom would have been too popular to beat same is the case with geochat the messaging app that looks a lot like whatsapp the resemblance honestly is uncanny let me give you one more example so at the recently held agm jio announced a new platform jio tv plus which would be a one sign-in one-stop solution for all the streaming services like netflix prime video this is hotstar sony live and more it sounds great but the ui well it's a lot like the apple tv plus ui as you can see well it's pretty clear that geo does not really care about the uniqueness of a product or building a product that's out of the world because they know it'll take some time and that might lead to missing a big opportunity jio is all about business i mean just look at the investments in geo a lot of different companies have invested in jio but some of them are very good strategic partnerships especially the two biggest investments that we've got to know of recently let me explain so due to the whole core with 19 pandemic the lockdown people working from home the demand for hyper local services delivery services has gone up a lot and jio sensed the opportunity here and launched the jio mart and now that facebook is its biggest investor with freaking 5.7 billion dollars jio can now use whatsapp and his user base for geomark under the great strategic partnership is with google which invested 4.5 billion dollars i mean we all know that there's a big campaign going on right now for made in india smartphones and the partnership with google can be a step towards that jio has already announced that they are working with google to create a new os for budget smartphones and there's also qualcomm which invested 97 million dollars in jio and we don't know right now what this partnership will result in but i'm guessing it's something to do with 5g chipset for low-end smartphones i mean jio5g has been announced so it all kind of makes sense you know what these partnerships make we think that jio will be entering the indian smartphone market maybe in 2021 but they'll bring a 5g budget smartphone made in india possibly the cheapest 5g smartphone and that might be a big threat to chinese manufacturers like xiaomi and realme i mean they already have google facebook and qualcomm so they're pretty sorted on the os the apps and the chipset as for the rest of the hardware required for a made in india smartphone we might get the news of more investments and partnerships as the year goes on so it's all pretty exciting but that's not all if you analyze jio's products you'll know that they are going after a lot of different companies let me show you so with geomart they're taking on the likes of big basket growfors and they plan on selling almost everything in the future so it will take on flipkart on amazon there's jio meet to take on zoom microsoft meet and google me there's your sovereignty to compete against a ton of music streaming services like spotify ghana wing prime music youtube music and more jio money against paytm and google pay empire jio's education platform to take on the likes of baijus geohealth hub against practo and medlife geogate the society security app against mygate gatekeeper so just look at all this jio basically equals the indian startup ecosystem i mean it has a service or product in almost every market segment out there on the internet see the reason jio is entering a lot of different market sectors is because it wants to create a system let me give you a practical example to show you what jio is trying to achieve here so in the future say you live in a society and you enter the society using the geogate app you order food and different essentials using geomart using internet from geofiber on a jio smartphone wearing jio glasses that's not maybe you're using jio smart lights your smart appliances you get the idea see the possibilities are endless and right now geo is working towards the possibility to create a complete system and ecosystem and all in one platform for every single thing now coming to the big question is geo a super power or is it a copy cat well it's a bit of both and that's not really a bad thing see the user base js trying to capture does not really care if an app is the copy of another app not a geo like i said jio does not really care about the uniqueness of its products jio is all about business and they're good at it and all they care about is becoming a superpower see their apps and services are basically taking on every single market segment all the companies it has partnered with they all suggest the same it's a geo a series about business about creating that ecosystem where everything you use is from jio and you know what if jio is successful it will most definitely become a superpower well what do you think of jio its latest investments all of its services and
