[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys I'm option from be Lancome and Auto Expo 2020 is currently underway and there are a lot of car makers on the floor showing off everything from facelift to electric and concept cars and even Chinese cars well we went to the expert to check it out for ourselves and here are the coolest electric cars from the show but before we get started how about you hit the bell icon so you don't miss out on any of our awesome new videos now that you've done that let's get started first up this one is excited the gwm r1 is an electric car from Chinese car manufacturer great wall motors and it's going to be the cheapest electric car in India the company hasn't announced the pricing yet but the spec sheet is great it has a range of 350 kilometers and a top speed of 102 km/h it can also charge from five to eighty percent in just 40 minutes which is incredible the company hasn't announced formal pricing for it yet but according to its Chinese price it should be priced somewhere around 7 to 8 lakhs in India well he is hoping that electric cars follow this trend of being more affordable Kia Motors also showed off two electric cars the sole Evy and the Nero keep the Nino evey comes with a 64 kilowatt hour battery that kia claims has a range of a whopping 250 kilometers so that's really great plus it has a top speed of 167 km/h so it's no slouch there either the car can charge from 0 to 80 percent in just around 54 minutes and the motor pushes a max power of 204 PS the sole evie also has the same specifications but it's slightly smaller than the Neel unfortunately the company hasn't said anything about the launch dates or the expected pricing of the cars next up we saw the Mahindra xuv500 which I know it looks just fine maybe it's just the color I kind of wish the showcase this in black because it does have the potential to look my people anyway the exu is 300 is a pre-production car Samantha wasn't really giving away any tech specs it still I've driven the XUV 300 and I liked it so I'm hoping the exc be 300 brings all of that awesomeness in an electric package minor also launched the EK UV which is priced starting at 8.25 lakhs and it will be available by i really so we also checked out mg stall at the expo and it was by far the best one to see they had the new Marvel extra but what really caught my eye was this this is the vision eye concept car from mg and it's just really cool it's a concept so clearly it's never coming out but it shows what mg sees in the future for cars it's fully autonomous although there is still a steering wheel inside and the doors open in this majestic way that I found really interesting Renault also showed off an electric version of the popular Quaid called the kz e as you can see this looks very much like the kwid does but it's electric and there are subtle changes all over the place it comes with a twenty six point eight kilowatt hour battery pack and an electric motor which produces forty four PS of power not the mostly saw in electric cars at the event but it has never been much for power so it's no surprise really according to rain or the case and he can charge from 30 to 80 percent in just 30 minutes which is a pretty decent charging speed and the car is expected to go on sale in India by 2022 that seems fun but yeah that does mean that we might get a formal launch at the next Auto Expo so yeah exciting times ahead for sure Darden launched its next on Eevee a few days ago and it was on full display at the event as well this is one of the few electric cars that are already in production and available to buy in India it looks like an exon which is great because the next one has a good design the next on Eevee though comes with a bulky battery that forces a 312 kilometer range and it comes with 60 minute fast charging as well it also comes with a variable key so you never forget your car keys anywhere that's good right the next on Eevee starts at 14 lap repeats so this was the coolest looking car there this is the Suzuki future or a concept car and damn it looks good doesn't it as the E in the name suggests it's an electric concept car but Maruti will be using this more as a design inspiration for future SUV coupe type cars so we can hopefully expect some really cool midsize SUVs from India's biggest car maker in the future other than that they were a bunch of other electric things there was the Mercedes EQ CEV a couple of electric buses the hero electric bike which looks really cool and an electric scooter from Vespa called the Vespa electrical as well so there was a lot of electric cars buses bikes and scooters at Auto Expo 2020 personally I really like the mg vision I the future of E and the necks on EB but which car excited the most and do you really think 8 lakhs is an affordable electric car let me know in the comments down below also give this video a like and shape with your friends who are interested in electric cars
