the motorola h20 that launched last year was a pretty good phone but it had a couple of features missing now this is here this is the motorola h30 and this does three things it lowers down the price to 27 triple nine and it brings some really meaningful upgrades and it also cuts down on a few things i'll talk about that but let's check out the biggest change from the h20 the design so this is the new motorola h30 and the design here is a big upgrade if you ask me why well i like most manufacturers who are making their phones bigger and bulkier motorola has done the opposite the new h30 is smaller more compact than the h20 i mean just look at this comparison honestly i've always liked compact slim and lightweight phones and the h30 is exactly that it's not as small as say the pixel 4 or 4a but i think this size strikes a very good balance especially because it's crazy lightweight at just 155 grams and it is the slimmest 5g4 in the world at 6.79 millimeters thickness this means that even though this flat frame is pmma thermoplastic unlike the h20's aluminium frame i think it looks fine because it's so slim i mean here's the frame in comparison to an iphone to give you a better idea so the size has gotten better in the h30 coming from the h20 but the looks have also gotten better wouldn't you say i mean the h20 is flashy gradient back is not something everybody liked and the h30's most subtle color looks a lot more classy now if you do like things flashy the s30 is also available in a green weight as for the finish it is pmma thermoplastic which is also known commonly as acrylic class and the camera model also has the same design as the newer motor phones but the camera bump is kind of big i mean you can't use this phone on a desk apart from the looks moton has also added a couple of fan favorite features in the h30s design so the first feature is an in-display fingerprint scanner honestly we've been wanting motorola to do this at least in the high-end phones and they've finally heard us the fingerprint scanner as you can see is fast and nice on the front another thing that the h20 lag is dual speakers and the h30 fixes that too yes there's a speaker here on the bottom and a speaker on the top now these speakers are fairly loud and the sound quality seems good too now these are good changes but apart from that there's no micro sd slot no headphone jack and there's an ip52 rating for splash resistance moving to the front the display hasn't changed and that's not a bad thing because you get the same beautiful 10 bit p only display with the same super high 144 hertz refresh it here is the display in action and yeah this is a beautiful panel with very punchy colors and the usual inky blacks you associate with oled the high refrigerator is also noticeable because android 12 seems to be optimized for this refresh rate and its animations feel really smooth apart from this the phone has a wide wide l1 license and motorola says that the screen has hdr10 support but netflix does not seem to be compatible with that the next aspect where the h30 has gotten an upgrade is the chipset it's a fairly minor upgrade the h30 brings the snapdragon 778 g plus which is the same as the 778g but with a higher clock cpu the ram is lpddr5 and the storage is umcp storage which offers speeds close to ufs 2.2 now honestly i'm glad that motorola has retained the snapdragon 778 g in the motorola h30 because i've seen a lot of other manufacturers switch from the snapdragon 778g to the dimension 900 which is kind of a downgrade so thumbs up to motorola also if you know which manufacturers i'm talking about give a thumbs up below you know what i'm talking about anywhere 778g plus is not a big upgrade but it does make a difference in benchmarks here's the address score of the h30 and you can see the scores are higher when compared to the snapdragon 778g and it's not just added even in geekbench and also in 3d mark the scores of the 778g plus are high i also ran the cpu throttling tests on the h30 and the performance was good be it in the 50 threads test or 20 threads about these tests the h20 is a fast and snappy phone the 770g has been live on almost every phone i've used and the s30 feels the same be it in day to day usage or gaming i mean it is 778g plus so games like vgmr optimize better i mean bgmi supports hdr ultra smooth extreme settings and the game performance is very good next up the cameras have gotten a good upgrade and also a downgrade so the main camera is now a 50 megapixel which does not seem like an upgrade to the 180 megapixel sensor on the h20 but megapixels don't matter and it has ois it also has the high resolution 50 megapixel ultra white camera which also works as a macro lens now one cut down is obviously no telephoto lens which the h20 had so that's there but apart from that the camera performance has definitely improved first of all i've been complaining about motorola's camera uf for a long long time and they finally made it better you finally get all the camera modes up front and i like that important settings like video resolution aspect ratio are all on the top i don't have to go into settings for anything anyway the camera performance is better too i compared the h30 photos versus the h20 and the 50 megapixel sensor with ois takes better shots than the 108 megapixel sensor being daytime or low light and photos are just sharper and better exposed all around and low light is actually a big difference if you ask me ois also makes videos more stable you can see less shake in the h30 video and the h32 is also better in quality for sure the 50 megapixel tripod camera is also an improvement the h30s ultra wide shots have better colors and more details almost every single time the front camera is the same 32 megapixel sensor but the s30 has 4k video recording on the front which is lacking in the h20 now here's some selfies from the phone and here's a video now shot from the front camera this is a 4k video from the front camera of the motorola h30 and if you're enjoying this video so far make sure to subscribe and hit that bell like when it comes to software the h30 comes with android 12 on board which is awesome and it's same pixel like clean experience with the same material ui the theme features and obviously there are a few useful more features like the moto gestures the peak display and very cool ready for which works both wired and wirelessly plus there's almost no bloatware except for facebook and there are no weird ads or features plus motorola has promised the android 13 and 14 update for this phone along with three years of security patches apart from this the battery remains the same at 4020 mah battery and there's a 33 watt turbo power charger in the box i know it's not the fastest charger but at least there is a charger in the box on the connectivity front the h30 has 13 5g bands there's three ca carrier aggregation support with 4x4 memo nfc support wi-fi 6e and bluetooth 5.2 they're all the important sensors you expect to come to the pricing like i said at the start the motorola h30 brings the pricing down with the six 128gb variant costing 27.99 and the 81280 gb variant costing 29 triple nine plus that is 2000 off with hdfc bank credit cards now if you ask me my opinion on this phone i think this is a very solid well balanced smartphone for the price i will bring some really good changes to the h20 which by the way is already a very good phone i mean the design is more compact it's lighter and slimmer the fingerprint scanner is in the screen now the phone has stereo speakers which was missing and i like that motorola went ahead with the snapdragon 778g plus and i like that the main camera and ultra wide camera performance is better now there are a few quirks like there's no telephoto lens which was present in the h20 there's no aluminium frame and i'm yet to test out the battery performance but
