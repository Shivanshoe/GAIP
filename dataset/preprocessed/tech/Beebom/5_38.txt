snapdragon 8gen1 plus a qhd amoled ltpo2 panel at 50k that is fantastic pricing really but there has to be some catch right well ever since the realm gt2 pro arrived i've been asking myself the same question what's the catch is it the agent wants thermal performance throttling performance are there any major cost cuttings well i'll talk about the catch but first i know you want to know about the agent one's performance so let's talk about that so these are the specs of the phone the same as the h30 pro which also has the same price tag and these are great specs for the price the first up here are the benchmark scores where the real me gt2 pro does really well as i was expecting but the question with a gen1 is always the throttling and i tested things see i ran all the three tests that we usually do with the cpu throttling test app twice just to be sure and in round one the gt2 pro was fairly impressive in the first test the result was 88 the second test result is 90 percent and there is more throttling in the hundred threads test but it's not outright bad it's okay in round two the gt2 pro throttled a bit more in the first test it thrown to 70 in the second test it throttled to 73 percent and in the hundred thread stress the phone did throttle just like in the first run and the end result was 63 percent throttling see personally i think the realme gt2 pro does fairly well in the cpu throttling test app as far as agent one phones go i mean yes the phone does throttle in the hundred threads test but i've done the same test a couple of more times and i've seen a lot of agent one phones do a lot worse than this [Music] as for the temperatures the real me g2 pro does hit 45 degrees after the 100 threads test but generally after long hours of gaming or benchmarks it was close to 40 41 degrees now one thing to note the performance apart from these tests is really good in the gt2 pro day-to-day usage is very smooth and fast probably held by the 2nd gen ltpo display and the gaming performance was really good too bjmi the best graphics were almost lag free and after an or so i did notice the metal frame of the device getting a little hot but the back was cooler so it's not really overheating anyway if you ask me the 8gen1 chipset is not the biggest usb of this phone because you get the same specs in the moto h30 pro the usb i think is real me bringing a 2k second gen ltpo display at this price there's no other phone that can match these display specs at 50k now if you don't know about ltpu 2 this means the display can go from 1 hertz to 120hz depending on what's on the screen really quickly so here i am scrolling in the settings and it shows 120 hertz but the moment i stop it quickly goes to 1 hertz when a youtube video is playing the screen switches to 30 hertz now what's interesting is it's all pretty quick and this dynamic refresh rate should translate into better battery performance now it's not just the ltp or tech that's great the panel is also high quality so this is a high resolution display and the colors look very very good and then everything else speed the brightness the wing angles it's all on point if you're wondering there is the wide one and one license of course but i did not notice hdr capabilities in netflix however i did see the hdr tag in movies in prime video the phone also has stereo speakers there's one primary speaker at the bottom here and there's a secondary speaker in the earpiece now the speakers here are not the loudest but it's pretty good anyway apart from the two big highlights there are a few things i like about the gt2 pro and there are a few things i don't like about this phone so first i like the fact that this phone comes with real me ui 3 based on android 12 and it's confirmed to get three years of major updates and four years of security patches this is good one thing i don't like here is the bloatware apps that come pre-installed you can uninstall these but on a premium phone like this i would have wanted a more cleaner experience especially because there's also this lock screen feature that just feels like an ad now going back to what i like i like this design i mean even with the fairly big battery metal frame the gt2 pro is 189 grams in weight and pretty sleek 8.2 millimeters the back is plastic but i'll be honest i think this bio polymer design that feels like paper is kind of refreshing in the whole world full of glass metal phones this is way better than what real me has done in the past if you know what i mean i'm still not a fan of this laser engraved signature by the designer and i think this white will get dirty quite easily but overall i think this looks nice and clean i also like the box of the device has the same paper finish anyway the fingerprint scanner is on the front and it's fast i also like the haptics here there's good and accurate feedback while typing and even when the gt mode turns on you get this really nice feedback and this really cool sound now there's no headphone jack if you're wondering and there's no micro sd slot and these are fine but i think there are three cost cuttings on the design front first there's no ip rating there is said to be splash resistance but no official ip rating there's also no wireless charging which is something that the h30 pro has so i think we may skip that to bring the ltpo panel in this phone third the usb c port at the bottom is a usb 2.0 port which is a bit strange in this price range on the camera front you get these three cameras no telephoto lens but again that's something really has kept to get this price point now the microscope camera is actually interesting it's a novelty feature but it lets you get close to anything and get some really cool shots check out a few photos i have taken from this so this is from my bag and this one is from akshay's diary which i really like because i love how well it has captured the texture of the paper the ink yeah it's pretty cool the imx 766 main camera is a proven camera and it works really well here i haven't compared the cameras to any phone but the photos i've taken so far look like they're taken from a high-end phone i say this because even the low-light shots are really good it automatically turns on the night mode and the photos are bright and sharp there is a bit of over saturation at times but i don't think i mind that a lot there's also ois and unlike the 9 pro plus ois definitely works in both videos and photos and on the video front there's 8k video recording support along with 4k 60 fps and here's a sample 4k video i took from the phone which i think looks sharp with good colors the ultra wide angle camera is also pretty interesting it's the same one as the oneplus 10 pro by default it takes photos at 110 degrees wide but there is a 150 degree mode which either lets you take these really wide shots or you can take shots with this fisheye effect the underwide angle camera quality seems pretty good so far the selfie camera is a 32 megapixel sensor and selfies are mostly good i felt most selfies have good sharpness and good enough detail especially when the lighting is good i also notice good dynamic range probably because hdr is set to auto always when it comes to videos the front camera only has support for 1080p or 720p videos which is a little disappointing for a high-end phone i also like that the battery size is good and although there's no crazy 120 watt charging you get this 65 watt charger in the box and i'm okay with this because first you'll be starting to remove charges from the box and second 65 watt is still pretty fast apart from this the phone has carrier aggregation support and it has all the important sensors too so let's go back to that question again what's the catch well the answer is really has skipped a few things to get this great pricing beat wireless charging ip dating the telephoto cameras the usb 2.0 usb c port but i don't think there's any catch in this phone see the agent one performance in the gt2 pro is pretty good it's a big deal because you've seen what happens to agent one phones and this phone throttles too but it's definitely not as bad as the icon 9 pro or the xiaomi 12 pro chinese variant we have plus a great qhd ltpo2 amoled display at this price is just absolutely fantastic and i like the fact that there are no other weird compromises sure realme ui could be a lot cleaner and i want oppo real me oneplus to bring 4k recording on the front camera but if you're okay with these points this seems like a great deal at 50k but this is not my final word because i'm yet to use this phone as my daily driver compare its cameras there's a battery drain but i want to know what you think of the real me gt2 pro at this price which one will you go for the h30 pro or the gt2 pro comment down below also give this video like make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos
