[Music] so this is the meat and i ak the redmi note 9 pro 5g aka the meat 10 t lite and i've been using this phone for more than a week now and in this review i'm going to answer the most important question should you buy the me 10 i at rupees 21 triple nine i mean it's obvious that xiaomi is aiming towards the likes of the oneplus nord the moto g5g with the meat and ice so is the meat and i kind of like the new mid-range king in 2021 another doubt i have is how does the 750g perform because i ran into some issues with the 750g optimization on the moto g5g so yeah that's another question so i'm gonna answer all of those questions but first let me tell you all about my experience so the first thing that came into my mind when i unboxed the me 10i is oneplus 70. i mean the back look at it it's clear that the meat and eye gives off 70 wipes right the second thing that came to my mind is that this color looks yup you guessed it beautiful yes this matte gorilla glass 5 bag with this blue and pink gradient mix looks absolutely stunning i mean i've had a number of people ask me which phone is this and yeah i think this definitely looks good no doubt the third thought was that this phone is kind of big and hefty nine millimeter thickness from the sides 215 grams in weight so this is by no means a light or compact foam i mean there's even a camera bump which isn't very big but it is noticeable in the hands see i still like the meat and i weigh more than the moto g 5g because it's definitely more premium and has a similar weight thickness now compared to the nord the oneplus knot is more handy and comfortable in the hands but the looks are subjective i personally like this matte back on the meat and i because it i think looks good and there's also more grip see apart from the fact that this is a big phone it's kind of hefty i like the meat and nice design i think it looks very premium and it's also got all the functionality that you need so there's the headphone jack dual sim micro sd hybrid slot an infrared sensor notification led ip53 rating for splash resistance side mounted fingerprint scanner which is very fast and accurate and they're stereo speakers which by the way are good enough they're fairly loud and i like that the speaker on the top isn't very muted so you get to hear things properly even when you have the bottom speaker muffled up as for the front the mi 10i has a 6.67 inch ips lcd display and honestly i would have liked an amoled panel since it's 20 21 now and mid ranges should come with amoled but this display for what's worth is a very good lcd display it is hdr and hdr10 plus compliant and there's also l1 certification so netflix and prime video playback is no problem as for the display quality the colors look nice and while the contrast isn't out of the world it's pretty good for an lcd display as for the brightness the display is set to go till 450 nits and i'd not really notice any major issues outdoors but on a very sunny day i did feel the panel wasn't the brightest so obviously compared to the oneplus note and yes the nods amoled is definitely brighter as you can see anyway the display here also has a high 120hz refresh rate which changes dynamically depending on the app it changes to 30 24 48 60 90 120 and xiaomi calls it adaptive sync now generally the display is very smooth when set to 120 hertz but there were times when i did feel that 120 hertz wasn't really as smooth and that's because sometimes i noticed that this adaptive sync feature tends to result in frame drops when switching between apps and that's probably because it's dynamically changing the refresh rate it's not a big problem but i didn't notice it so that was the design and the display now one thing i was excited to check out in the meat and i was the camera especially the main 108 megapixel camera so as you guys know the meter i has a new more compact samsung hm 208 megapixel sensor with f 1.8 aperture and 0.7 micron pixels now i know smaller pixels means less light but thanks to 911 pixel binning the hm2 sensor actually creates one large pixel of 2.1 microns and like i said the bigger the pixel the more light the sensor can capture so yes i was excited to check out the low light performance especially from the new hm2 sensor and after using after taking a ton of photos with this camera i can tell you that the meat and eyes 108 megapixel camera is actually very good and the daytime photos are really good they're sharp color accurate mostly and very detailed and the dynamic range is brilliant too in some shots like in this photo just look at the sky now i did notice some over sharpening at times but it's nothing too major as for the low light and that's what i was really interested in i have been really impressed with the meat and i see like i expected the sensor captures a lot of light and the photos are very sharp and very nice now there is a bit of noise in a few photos but it's overall managed really well and i like the low light photos now honestly i found the meat and eyes 108 megapixel very good because of two reasons first is obviously the price of the phone the performance the camera performance to price ratio is very good and second it's because i compared the meat and eyes camera to the oneplus knot so here are some comparison shots and to be honest in daytime it's not a big difference both phones do well i find the meet and eye's photos a little more contrasty and there's more appealing but i think the knot is fine so it's very on par low light is where the difference lies the meat and eyes low light shots are just more sharper when compared to the knot see the notch shots are kind of fuzzy and some shots have this warmer tone which isn't really accurate and yeah the meat and eyes low light shots are just overall better so the 108 megapixel sensor is actually great now coming to the ultra wide angle lens i think it's kind of fine nothing exceptional see when there's a lot of light it does well but the moment the light drops even in daytime the photos lose detail and sharpness at the edges i also took a lot of portrait mode shots and portrait mode shots definitely are very good the edge detection is very accurate and there is a bit of saturation going on and the contrast goes higher too but they look nice as far as portrait mode shots go moving onto the videos there's 4k 30fps video support i would have liked 4k 60 fps since 750g supports that but yeah 4k 30fps it is anyway so i've taken a lot of videos from this phone and i found the video quality to be overall good with natural colors and nice dynamic range the exposure adjustment could have been a little better at times with moving videos but i wouldn't say it's bad as for the stability there's only eis which works when you're walking or just moving around but yeah in a moving vehicle with a lot of bumps not very good which is kind of expected the front camera is a 16 megapixel camera and the selfies from the phone were mostly consistent with good overall exposure and details so no problems here so the camera especially the main camera is a win on the meat ni now let's talk about the performance i think you already know the specs but here they are so there's snapdragon 750g adreno 619 lpddr4x ram ufs 2.2 storage so the specs are good i mean the snapdragon 750g is actually close to the 765g i mean there are obviously differences like the fact that the 750g has the most powerful cpu because it has the faster cortex a77 based cryo 570 cpu compared to the cortex a76 based cryo 475 cpu on the 765g however it has the weaker gpu in the form of the adreno 619 compared to the adreno 620 on the 765g there are other differences too like the clock speed and the fact that the 750g is an 8 nanometer chipset and the 765g is a seven nanometer chipset but overall these chipsets have the advantages but they are closed when it comes to benchmarks or even real world performance now talking about that the meat ni has been working fine for me for the past week or so there's no major lag or anything and i played a lot of cod mobile on this phone with graphics 0 very high and frame rate set to max and the gameplay was smooth and consistent almost all face i mean the overall performance isn't always perfect i did notice some apps crashing for example i can't get geekbench 5 to complete a benchmark test it always crashes i also noticed a few minus turtles when i was scrolling in the app drawer it's honestly the same issue i also faced while using the moto g5g it's probably not visible on camera but the knot does not have any stutters while scrolling so maybe it's a 750g optimization issue having said that last night the meat and i received an update miui 12.0.4 that's said to bring performance improvements and the scrolling definitely seems better but i've only used it for a day so we'll see see i'll put it this way the day-to-day performance on the meat ni is good there are a few stumbles on the way but did not really bother me much because they are very occasional oh and by the way the phone has ufs 2.2 storage which is said to be faster than ufs 2.1 well i did the cpdt benchmark on the meteoni and the oneplus not to you know check the storage speeds and as you can see these screenshots the ufs 2.2 storage is a little faster when it comes to sequential read and random read write tests on the software front there's miui 12 with android 10 and it's the usual miui but it has google apps for phone messages etc and as for azure noteworth there are no ads but bloatware yes there are these games which i uninstalled straight away and there's facebook amazon wps office and linkedin and all of these can be uninstalled so that's good lastly let me talk about the battery and the charging performance of the meat ni so the meat ni has a decently big battery at 4820 mah and i was kind of expecting decent dish performance but it was generally better than what i expected so with the display set 220 hertz i got a screen on time of around six hours six and a half hours almost always and that included gaming almost one and a half hours two hours of cod mobile so that screen on time is very good now with the display set to 60 hertz i got a screen on time of around seven hours which is also very good now you'll obviously be using this phone with the screen set to 120 hertz and that's where the battery life matters a lot and i think the meat and i does a very good job at that the phone charges very quickly too thanks to this 33 watt charger that you get in the box i noted things down so after 30 minutes of charging the phone went from 10 to 72 which is definitely very fast the phone took a total of 55 minutes to go from 10 to 100 so yeah it's very fast now coming to the pricing xiaomi has done a very similar job to oneplus by launching a six plus 64 gb variant that's coming soon so i'm going to consider the six plus 128 gb at rupees 21 triple nine the base rated the phone that people are actually gonna buy so coming to the verdict should you buy the me 10i at rupees 21 nine well the answer is i think this is a phone that i can't recommend see this is not a perfect phone it has its problems first up like i said this is a big and hefty phone there's no doubt about that second it does not have amulet and yeah there are a few minor performance issues that i talked about so the meat and i is not perfect but if you're okay with all of those things overall i think the price is justified and it's a very balanced smartphone the design is very premium and does not miss out on any important functionality the display is good enough for an ips lcd the 750g is a fairly powerful chipset with 5g and the 108 megapixel camera is actually very good and even better than the nord's main camera see if you don't like me why i don't think you should settle for the moto g5g just for stock android instead i think you should spend a little more and get the oneplus not which is more compact has amoled and 765g but yes it's kind of pricey at 28k having said that if you're okay with me ui the big size of the phone and you're looking for a good all-around smartphone at 22 23k the meat and i is actually a good option well that was my review of the meat and i but i'd love to know what you guys think tell us in the
