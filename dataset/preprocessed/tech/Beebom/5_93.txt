[Applause] hey guys this is patientview.com and this right here is the brand new jio4 year's new entry-level android smartphone made in partnership with google now there are actually two aspects to this new phone there's obviously the phone and then there's the price now let me make it clear straight away that the jio phone next is a phone that has failed to impress me in both of these aspects first up let me just clear up the price because i think there's a lot of confusion around it so jio phone next has launched in india to be six four nine nine that's the actual price upfront price and that's the price i'm going to consider now i know a lot of people are hyping up the rupees 2000 price tag but that is not the deal price let me explain so here's how it goes first up you need to pay 2 000 rupees up front that's the price supposedly along with that you have to pay 500 rupees processing fee that brings it to 2500 now say you take up the 450 rupees per month emi plan for 24 months now this also includes 1.5 gb of data daily and unlimited calls which on prepaid costs 200 rupees so this emi is basically taking up 250 rupees extra now that means 250 rupees over 24 months and that's 6 000 rupees so overall with the emi plan the phone actually costs 2000 rupees plus 501 rupees processing fee plus 6000 rupees which is equal to 8500 rupees so yeah 6500 is the real price of this phone and at that price this is not so impressive so the jio phone next would have made sense at 4000 rupees but at this price no so this is the phone and the first thing i noticed when i unboxed the phone is this a removable 3500 mah battery i mean it's been some time since we saw this in a mainstream smartphone anyway here's how the phone looks and yeah it's got the typical cheap phone look and feel with the hard plastic back with the jio logo single camera and a speaker grill now like a usual entry level smartphone the jio phone next has the usual buttons the headphone jack on the top and a micro usb port on the bottom there's also a dual sim slot but the sim one slot is locked for geo sim cards only and i also noticed that mobile data only works with jio no other sim cards i mean as you can see there's the mobile data option in jio and even if i turn it off there's no mobile data option in the vodafone set it's also mentioned in the specs page as you can see and if you're coming to the front this is how the front of the jio phone next looks and you get these big bezels the display is a 720p panel with cortisol class 3 and it is an okay display i mean it's very reflective you can't see anything from angles and it's not very bright but the colors kind of seem fine to give you guys a better idea this is the display at max brightness and yeah this is not a great display but i think it's okay for a entry-level smartphone now overall i would have been okay with this design especially for its price but the problem is you get phones like the redmi 9a or even the dmc 11 at this price range and those phones are way better looking and more modern looking than the jio for next now talking about the experience the jio phone next has the new pragati os which is actually the android go platform sort of rebranded and it's a good experience here you get the popular google apps like play store chrome youtube maps google go google camera go gallery go etc there's also facebook lite instagram and whatsapp on board which was expected since jio and facebook had kind of become partners then there are various jio apps like jio games usa1 geomart jio tv live geo meet etc now apart from these apps there are features like google assistant which works well there's translate now which lets you translate anything on the screen to 10 indian regional languages there's also features like nearby share read aloud and more so yeah you get all of these features and the software experience is actually clean and nice i like that but there's one thing that you'll always see in pragati os in jiofi next i'm talking about this device provided by financer this is something you will see when you set up the phone it's there on the lock screen as well you get notifications reminding you about this it's there even on the quick settings page in fact when i tap here and hit view policies it tells me that the admin aka the financer can see the apps on the phone also admin can lock the device which means that if you don't pay the emi the device will be locked i mean this may be okay but putting this device provided by financer everywhere is not cool and kind of makes me feel green now data part the software experience is actually good on this one that's one thing that's definitely good i even like the camera the phone has a 13 megapixel rear camera on the back and the google camera go app has features like snapchat lenses built-in portrait mode hdr and hey it even shows you the number of photos you can take with the storage left just like the old days now all that is fairly good for an entry-level smartphone but what the problem here is the deal breaker is actually the performance of this phone so the geophone next is powered by the snapdragon qm215 with 2gb ram and 32gb storage which is expandable now i was not worried about the average specs here because hey this is an entry interview phone like i said and the phone was made in partnership with google so i was expecting an optimized experience but hey i was wrong i mean there's so much frame drop everywhere there's lag when i go from home screen to the google discover page there's live when i'm going home from an app there's lag with the auto rotate is on there's lag while scrolling typing and i've noticed this in a day of usage i did not even try a game because that would be harsh on the phone at this price but it's not cool that this phone is so slow in day to day usage see if you ask me i would have maybe accepted this performance if the phone was priced at least 3 500 or 4 000 rupees but this is a 6500 piece phone and you know what they're just better options in this price range i mean for example there's the redmi nine and six triple nine which is 500 rupees expensive but it's a better looking phone like i said it's not locked to geo sim cards for mobile data it has a bigger better display it has better performance with its faster octa-core chipset and it has a bigger battery the software experience is one thing that's been on the jio phone next but is that enough i don't think look to conclude things i just want to say this come on jio you're supposed to be a disruptive company i mean you disrupted the telecom market with geo4g you disrupted the feature phone market with the jio phone and you disrupted broadband with jio fiber but the jio phone next you know it we know it this is not going to disrupt android smartphones anyway i want to know your opinion on this jio phone next smartphone do you think it makes sense at 6 500 rupees when you buy this
