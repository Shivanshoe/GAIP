[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is patient B wongkom and OPA has launched its very first smartphone of 2020 the Oppo f-15 yeah we have the Oppo a 15 here with us so we are going to take a look at the brand new Opel smartphone but before we do that I suggested to hit the bell I can do get notified every time you post an awesome new video now that you've done that let's talk about the Oppo f50 so this is the new Opel f15 and when one of the big highlights of the f-15 is the design now to be on is the moment I took this phone out of the box I was reminded of a certain flagship from last year yeah the Oppo f-15s unicorn white variant looks a lot like the flagship but is that a bad thing now well I like this gradient finish and I love how sleek and lightweight this phone is the oh boy of 15 is 7.9 millimeters thin and weighs around hundred and seventy two grams and that's pretty good compared to a lot of other phones in this price range I mean this is a phone that feels very comfortable in the hand and it looks pretty good as well so yeah I like the design anyway on the front you get a teardrop nagy display and the good thing is this is an AMOLED display which is pretty nice you get this beautiful six point four inch full HD plus AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass five and since this is AMOLED you get all the AMOLED features like deep blacks and nice colors and I think it looks great the display is nice and crisp and I loved watching videos on it the food does have the white wine elven license so HD on Netflix and prime videos shouldn't be a problem anyway thanks for amulet you also get an in display fingerprint scanner on the O point 15 which opal quality third gen in description of it scanner and when it is pretty fast as you can see it in action here there's also face unlock here obviously and like other opal force the face unlock here is super fast so yeah that's good apart on the display the open 15 has the usual buttons dub use PC port the headphone jack and the single speaker on the bottom there's also the dual simplest micro SD slot which is nice because it's a dedicated slot the next big highlight of the Oppo a 15 are its quad cameras there's the 48 megapixel primary sensor an 8 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens are 2 megapixel mono lens and a 2 megapixel depth sensor so these four cameras mean you can capture different types of photos you can capture usually daytime new light shots and in my brief time the food does fairly well in good light now low light isn't as impressive but it's fine nonetheless you can also take ultra wide-angle shots which is nice since most phones come with ultra wide-angle lens these days anyway these ultra wide-angle shots from the up by 15 look cool don't they the Oppo f-15s ultra wide angle lens keeps the colors and the exposure fairly intact when compared to the primary lens so that's pretty good the ultra wide-angle lens also works as a macro lens which lets you go as close to 3 centimeters on an object so you can also capture macro shots like this one or you know this one piece and I'd say there's also the depth sensor so portrait mode photos have nice edge detection and fairly good looking bouquet yes there's a bit of a smoothing going on and sometimes the edge detection can be a little finicky but overall I'd say it's fine apart from that you get the different camera features like the night mode which also works with ultra wide-angle lens now and there's also a new tripod option for long exposure shots there's also a eye video beautification which makes different beautification adjustments to different faces in the same video using AI and more talked about video is the Oppo a 15 only supports 1080p at 30fps videos now I would have liked 4k video recording or at least 1080p at 60fps but I guess we have to make do with this anyway here's a 1080p video and I think it's fairly stable with GIS and the quality is also decent on the front you get the same 16 megapixel F 2.0 camera with the usual set of features here are a couple of selfies I took from the forum moving on from cameras to things under the hood the oh boy f15 comes the mediatek helio p 70 chipset a GB dam and what do we need GB storage now these aren't exactly specs that'll blow us away in 2020 but these are decent specs what about the smart phone anyway the real level performance of the Oppo air 15 seems fine so that's good I also played some games on the phone Babji mobile rather than medium graphic settings but default and the performance of the phone is good so no problems there plus I like the different gaming specific software features the oh boy 15 breaks there's game booze 2.0 which is set to increase frame with stability in games like pop G there's watch danger in case you want to change your voice lastly there's in-game noise canceling effects which as the name gives away it reduces noise in games about rad if you're wondering this is colored over 6.1 on board based on Android 95 yeah there is no color over 7 or Android 10 here which is a little sad but color OS 6.1 brings smooth transitions navigation gestures a smart bar for notifications and more so yeah that's something nasty there's the battery the oh boy 15 might be slim and nice but it's got the fairly big 4000 mAh battery with 20 waterwalk charging now I'm here to test out the battery but since it's a 4000 mAh battery I think it should be decent enough as for the charging the 0.5 teen goes from 0 to 50 percent in just 30 minutes and that is pretty sweet fast charging well that was a look at the brand new Opel f15 and at the time of shooting this video we don't know the price of the phone yet but from the looks of it this seems like a decent smartphone the design is sleek and nice-looking there's a beautiful AMOLED display you get the quad camera set up a fairly big battery and fast charging so all in all this seems like a fine smartphone having said that I haven't obviously tested out the f15 extensively and if you ask me it all depends on the price so let's reserve our verdict on the Oppo f15 when the price rise we will be adding the price in the description so make sure to check that out anyway what do you think of the brand new Opel f15 tell us your thoughts in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
