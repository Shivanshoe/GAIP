[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from bboom.com and as you guys probably know oneplus recently launched two new budget not smartphones in the global market the n10 and the n100 now you're probably wondering these phones haven't launched in india so how did we get this phone well another clickbait by bibo but but you won't be disappointed because this is actually the one plus nord n100 sort of kind of see i'll be honest this is actually the oppo a53 as you can see from the back but this is the phone that's identical to the oneplus not n100 almost identical let me show you so here's both the phones side by side now coming to the specs both of these phones have a 6.5 inch hd plus display with gorilla glass 3 the oppo phone does have a 90 hertz display but the nord n100 does not and that is the only difference between these phones apart from that both the phones pack in the same snapdragon 460 chipset with adreno 610 gpu 4gb ram and 64gb storage both of these have the same modest camera setup with a 13 megapixel main camera a 2 megapixel depth sensor and a 2 megapixel macro lens and they have the same 5000 mah battery with an 18 watt fast charge on the design front two they are the same yes the oneplus not n100 has a matte finish while the a53 is glossy but that's it so after checking out all the specs yes it's true the oneplus not n100 is a rebranded oppo a53 and this isn't something i was expecting with oneplus at all i mean i know everyone knows that oneplus flagships are tweaked versions of some or the other opel phones but generally oneplus flagships are better versions of their oppo counterparts and there are generally big changes too so there are actually two problems in the oneplus naught 800 that kind of stand up first is the fact that it does not have a high refresh rate display which is weird because last year oneplus promised that all of its future phones will come with fluid high refresh rate displays second is the fact that there's no uniqueness to this phone there's not even the iconic alert slider in the oneplus not n100 or the n10 for that matter so yeah that is kind of disappointing so i'm not really sure how oneplus plans to sell these budget not smartphones i guess they are too confident about their oxygen os experience but i don't see that working see offlate i've noticed that oneplus is not the same oneplus that we used to know in the past one plus is changing i mean just take a look at some of the things oneplus has done recently and you'll delete so it recently launched the new oxygen os 11 update which moved away from stock android and i have mixed feelings towards it and i think a lot of you guys feel the same then they launched the oneplus 8t now generally when a new oneplus phone arrives there's a lot of excitement a lot of hype but honestly i did not feel that with the oneplus 8t that's probably because it's a minor upgrade it's just 120 hertz and 65 watt charging that's it but yeah there was no excitement at all then there's the fact that we got news that oneplus started rolling out an update to the 80 that installs the amazon app on the phone which is weird because pre-installing bloatware through updates without user content is just wrong so all of that and now this the new not smartphones i really don't know what's happening with oneplus or maybe i do see i feel that this whole change in one pluses approach is due to the changing leadership at the top i think you guys know that carl pay the co-founder of oneplus and the more public phase of the company has left one plus now there's speculation that pay left because of an alleged internal power struggle between him and pete la anyway the point is i get it i get it that these budget not smartphones have probably been in the pipeline for a long time but this whole leadership change in one plus is bringing out a big dynamic revamp in the company i think it's playing a big role here and i can relate this to poco see when pogo started off as a sub brand giamani was the head and it was a very different company then germany left and the poco that we have today well it's way different from the original poker that we saw so i feel the same is kind of happening with oneplus 2. anyway coming back to the oneplus not budget smartphones c1 plus has always been about the uniqueness the experience and the value for money factor and i think these new oneplus not budget smartphones kind of fail on all those fronts so these nod smartphones are not unique they're basically rebranded oppo smartphones the experience that we used to love earlier is not the same in oxygen os as i showed you earlier and well these nod phones are definitely not value for money now i don't think these not smartphones are coming to india but if you ask me i have two words on oneplus rebranding open phones bad move anyway what do you guys think of these new not budget smartphones do you think that oneplus should be launching these in india do you think that these phones make sense tell us in the comments down below give this video a like make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for
