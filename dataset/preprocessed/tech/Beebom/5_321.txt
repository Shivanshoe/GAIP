[Music] [Applause] [Music] so add retain is still not on a lot of phones but we all know one thing Android 11 is coming Google is obviously working on it and while we have no idea what the features will bring there are certain features that Android 11 must drink and not just add 11 some of the features I'm gonna talk about are not present in custom skins like me you ideally you are oxygen OS one UI you get the idea so if you are using any of these skins I'd suggest to watch this video till the very end now let's talk about the features Android eleven must definitely break so starting off for the most underrated features of iOS is the system level undo feature so the shake to undo gesture was always present in iOS but it wasn't very how do I put go I said when I was 13 brought better gestures for this so in is 13 you can just swipe left with three fingers on the screen to undo text and so I pried with three fingers to redo text and like I said it works everywhere bit whatsapp Twitter or Instagram or any other app in fact it even works for things other than text in supported apps like say mail in the mail app if you have moved an email to the wrong folder you can just do this gesture and undo it so you trust me when I say that it's a super useful feature and write 11 must bring there's no such undo feature in Android and it will be great if Android 11 brings this feature natively I mean this is a feature that's not present in any other Android skins so yeah Android 11 shocked Android should take the lead on this one so the next big feature under 11 must bring is an airdrop like cross device file transfer I mean we have been wanting this since so long and you know what so the manufacturers have implemented this feature there's me share read me share oppa share and we will share which work with each other just like airdrop and as you can see this works really well so it's high time Android 11 had this feature too now it will work with all Android devices out there and well it looks like it will finally be here see Google was testing a feature called far share with a hundred ten but that did not make it now a report from XD has the wheel in the air drop like features in Android will be caught nearby sharing we'll use do to to initiate a handshake doing devices and then transfer files over a direct Wi-Fi connection similar to a draw but from this screenshot it looks like our 11 will definitely have this feature so good news guys that mode finally arrived with Android 10 and it's obviously one of the big highlights of the latest Android update but you know what the dock mode on a dirt then feels like an unfinished product and that's mainly due to one feature missing the ability to shed your dark mode I mean it's pretty obvious and almost every other skin brings the option to automatically turn on the dark one at sunset and turn off at sunrise there's even an option to set your own timings pick not just different skins there's even an app that lets you send you the dark mode and stock Android devices I mean how tough could it be certainly as dark mode should yuning should be present in android 11 and Google while you're at it make sure that every single app of yours and her party app has the dark mode and yeah also some nice wall people's dynamic items that go dark but the dark mode would be pretty nice every single platform out there has a native screen recorder built in oxygen OS me UI real me UI a color OS when you are you name it and most of these platforms support internal audio recording with it so honestly it's high time stock Android had this reach too in fact Android in its beta stages had a pretty early version of a native screen recorder but again it did not make it so in Android 11 Google must include a screen recorder that supports high resolution high FPS recording internal audio support the ability use the front camera while recording for streams see native screen recording is such a small yet very important feature and Android 11 must definitely have stock Android the screenshots alright even letting you edit the screenshots quickly but to tell you honestly it's nowhere close to the functionality you get on other Android skins first of all almost all Android skins out there support scrolling screenshots or super underrated feature that I use often and I'm sure you guys do it with Google has confirmed that they're working on this in Android art basically added lemons so say I'm positive second some Android skins even let you take partial screen shots take the new deal me you I have for example you can just press hold with three fingers and swipe down or app to take a partial screenshot way easier than taking a screenshot and cropping it right now third is not something that many phones have but I remember on some easiest force there was an option to change the screenshot file type from PNG to JPEG and that could be handed to some people so yeah overall Android 11 must include scrolling screenshots partial screenshots and hopefully more options when it comes to screenshots well Google you know what to do Andrelton seeks the stupid piece gestures from Android 9 and yeah I'm gonna call that stupid but is the under 10 gestures perfect well I don't think so and a lot of people agree with me let's check out this reddit thread I have listed in the description a lot of people have problems with the way the back gesture comes in the way of these slide out menu I mean you can still access this menu by peeking and swiping but it just doesn't feel like so how about me wise implementation in me why the back gesture does not work on the top third of each side of the screen so that you can open up those hamburger menu and that's not it some customizability would be nice a lot of people like the whole the bad gesture just switched to the last app and a lot of people want more options like you know how the fluid gestures app lets you use gestures like swipe up from the right bottom to open the notification shade and hold it to open quick settings directly and it's totally customizable you can set any app or actually really do it yeah it's pretty good to be honest I don't think Android 11 will bring all of these changes to gestures but I just hope they make it better [Music] features are good yeah the great but there are some things in a door 10 that need fixing most importantly the annoying opened by default option she added has had this for years for example you could say Twitter links to open by default in the Twitter app Instagram links in the Instagram app you get the idea now previously it was simple if that always am that's it done under tenth messed it up now when you tap always you take it to this open but default settings now here you have to tab the open supported links button and then press open in this app yeah just some unnecessarily annoying work I'm just hoping that Android 11 fixes this it's super annoying now that was a big one but there are a couple of other minor things that need fixing with Android 11 how a Bluetooth not turning off an airplane mode East or not that would be handy right now reports say that Android 11 will bring this so that's good news next up how about or native one-handed usage mode I mean more skins have this but a nice native implementation would be great well Android 11 is still some time away but these are the features it must have but is there anything that I missed out on tell us in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you
