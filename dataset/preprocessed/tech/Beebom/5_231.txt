[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is from b1.com and asus has just launched its new expert book series of laptops and pcs in india and we've got the flagship of the lord the new asus expert book b9 now if you saw the launch of it you'd know that this is a proper business laptop but i think it also makes sense as a personal work laptop so is this like the work laptop for everyone well time to find out but before we start what exactly makes a good work laptop for say someone like me okay so a good work laptop for me should have a portable design with a good selection of i o and all the important functionality it should have reliable performance good battery life and very importantly security and privacy features so is the expert book b9 actually an expert on these fronts well on the design front it does seem pretty sorted i think this is a great piece of hardware and i say that because the first thing that hit me when i took out the laptop from this box is that this is super compact and just crazy lightweight i mean i can just hold it in a single hand for a long long time and carrying it shouldn't be a problem it's just 995 grams and you have to hold it to believe it it's crazy thin anyway i also like the cool matte black magnesium lithium alloy chassis it's very premium but what's also interesting is that it's a very durable design this whole hardware has gone through different tests and it's mil std810 gus military grade standard so that sounds serious now the selection of ports is pretty good too on the right you get the audio jack a usb a port and the kensington lock slot on the left you have two thunderbolt 3 usbc ports a usb a port an hdmi port and a lan wire micro hdmi port which can be handy because you do get a micro hdmi to lan port dongle in the box so that's great and talk about things you get in the box you also get this very premium looking sleeve that i like also you must have probably noticed that this is a very compact laptop and that's because asus has managed to put in a 14-inch screen here in a 13-inch chassis and that's because of the 94 percent screen to body ratio so as you can see the bezels all around the display are very narrow in spite of that though asus has managed to cram in an ir camera here along with the webcam shield function so i can just slide this switch here to stop webcam access i think it makes sense in a proper work laptop as for the webcam quality it's decent-ish but i like the four microphones here which make up for better audio quality in video calls also since this is an ir camera it also works for windows hello functionality and i think it works really well even in the dark there's also the fingerprint scanner in case you want to use that so like i said there's almost every feature here you can think of coming to the display now it's a 14 inch 16 inch to 9 led ips anti-glare display with 1080p resolution and 100 srgb color gamut and so far it seems like a really good display i mean i was using it in my living room where you get a lot of natural light but the screen was bright enough and the viewing angles were great as for the color reproduction i think it was very natural and good looking now moving on to the performance on the specs from the expert book b9 is an intel project athena certified laptop and it comes in an i5 and an i7 variant the variant we have features the quad core intel core i7 engine chipset up to 16 gb lddr3 ram up to 2 2tv pcie 3.0 ssd wi-fi 6 and bluetooth 5.0 now these aren't mind-blowing specs but for a professional work laptop these are decent specs and in my usage which includes a lot of browsing some video playback and some minor photo editing the performance was good i also noticed that there wasn't any difference in performance with power plugged in or not now i generally use this laptop without the charger plugged in because the battery life here is awesome i mean this super lightweight laptop packs in a 66 watt battery and it's rated to last up to 24 hours on continuous usage yep 24 hours crazy right i mean you obviously won't get 24 hours of battery life in day to day intensive use but yeah that definitely sounds good see i've been only using this laptop for a few days now and i got around 15 hours of battery life and that included me using the laptop intensively and i think that's very very good and just what you want on a work laptop plus i like the fact that there are different battery saving features like the panel self refresh technology which means the display has a frame buffer so it'll only refresh the screen's pixels directly rather than continuously requesting data from the gpu when it comes to charging this is the watt usbc charger you get in the box and by the way it can also charge phones that support usb pd charging which isn't most high-end phone so that can be handy anyway when it comes to charging the laptop it takes the laptop to 60 in just 39 minutes and i think that's pretty fast so the design the display the performance the battery charging all that seems pretty sorted on the expert book b9 but i like the fact that asus has packed this laptop with some really good features that will appeal to professional users first up there's enterprise great security features now i've already showed you the few security features like the webcam shield the different biometric methods but there's more there's the asus business manager app which lets you do a number of things there's secure guard where you can restrict usb storage devices lock the date and time settings disable system registry editing and more there's secure drive which lets you create an encrypted virtual partition on a storage device or one of the local drives in your pc so that you can save sensitive data there's system backtrack which basically lets you revert your system to order restore points there's file share which allows you to permanently delete files and i think that can be pretty handy and lastly there's my logo which lets you change the system bios along with the logo oh and by the way just check out the bios on this laptop it looks so modern and you can actually use it with the mouse so these are pretty important features on a work laptop but apart from that there's also the my asus app so the my asus app lets you contact customer support do a system diagnosis update drivers change different hardware settings made the charging mode fan mode the screen temperature and more there's also the link to asus feature which lets you connect your phone to your laptop and receive calls messages share files mirror screen and even extend the screen and by the way the myasus app is available for both android and ios so that's sorted so it's clear that the expert book bean and packs in a lot of interesting features and i like the rest of the laptop too for example this hinge is great this is a 180 degree hinge and i like the fact that it raises the keyboard at a small angle which makes the typing experience better and this better airflow too since the fan is located beneath the laptop as for the keyboard i like the layout and the decent 1.5 millimeter travel these keys offer and by the way this is a spill resistant backlit keyboard so it seems good all wrong having said that there's one thing that might bother some people it's that the power button is located right here which might result in accidental presses other than that it seems like a pretty good keyboard the touchpad is pretty good too it's a fairly big glass touch pad with support for different windows precision gestures and it works fine now as with most high-end asus laptops there's the number pad built into the touchpad and it works well you can use it in the calculated app or anywhere else and you can use the touchpad to move the pointer even when the numpad is active so both the functions work simultaneously as for the speakers there's a one watt speaker on both the sides and these are harman kardon certified speakers so the quality is good and while they're not crazy loud it's decent so that pretty much sums up everything about this new laptop and like i said at the start there are certain factors in a work laptop that make it actually good and i think the expert book b9 qualifies for that see the asus expert book b9 has a premium design that's portable and it has all the important ports it has some security features that are actually pretty useful there's long lasting battery and the performance seems promising for a work laptop but so far it seems like it's got all the other basics right be the display the keyboard or the touchpad see i don't know the price of laptop right now and yep i'm yet to truly test things out but if you ask me the expert book b9 is a work laptop that appeals to me anyway asus has also launched a number of other laptops in this new expert book series so make sure to check them out as well also tell us what you think of this new
