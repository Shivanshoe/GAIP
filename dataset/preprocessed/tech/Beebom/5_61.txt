this is a phone running windows 11. it's not a joke it's not clickbait this is actually full-fledged windows 11 pro running on a smartphone let me show you so here's the phone and i can hit the power button and as you can see it's the windows 11 lock screen i can just swipe up to unlock into the password and here it is the windows 11 desktop with the windows 11 wallpaper the start menu the taskbar the apps this is full-fledged windows 11. i mean as you can see in the about page in the settings this is actually windows 11 pro insider preview i know what you're thinking how did we get windows 11 running on a smartphone when all the credit goes to project renegade i'll leave a link to it in the description down below now this project brings windows 11 to a bunch of smartphones powered by the snapdragon 845 and the snapdragon 835 the best compatibility is with the oneplus 6t the oneplus 6 the mix 2s and the poco f1 i mean obviously now we are running windows 11 on the oneplus 6t so how is it running on a smartphone that's practically failure well surprisingly windows 11 works really well on a phone first of all windows 11 here supports the basic features the hardware the buttons of the phone see i showed you how the device wakes up with the power button and i can also press hold on the power button to get the slide to shut down option that's all even the volumes button work wi-fi is also working and so it's bluetooth in fact we connected some bluetooth headsets from the windows settings like you would on a pc now you can use windows in portrait or you can use it in landscape but i prefer using it in landscape because it's just better that way for windows other options like brightness features like night light they all work a couple of things don't work the speakers and camera but hey it's still amazing how most things work in this phone now hit like if you think this is awesome now what's cool though is that all the windows 11 features actually work in this phone as you can see i'm using the start menu and it's working fine i can search for files and folders there's the widgets page here the task switch also shows you the apps and desktops you've opened there's also the calendar and notifications here and there are these different toggles for brightness volume etc apps also work fine with the native windows apps like calendar or clock and even the traditional apps like file explorer as you can see it shows me the two partitions and all the files the third party apps also run fine i have chrome installed and i can even open the microsoft store and download an app say netflix and it works just right compatibility is great too accessories worked flawlessly with the usbc hub i connected a mouse and a keyboard and it all worked out like a normal pc setup there's no lag using the mouse or typing with the keyboard it's actually all great anyway windows 11 actually works well with touch as you must have noticed i mean suppose the windows 11 gestures to switch apps open up the tasks which is clean we're also able to drag and drop files between apps snap multiple windows side by side just like you would on a desktop basically almost everything works with touch i say almost because the right click does not work with the gesture and the on-screen keyboard does not show up automatically at all the times see the keyboard shows up in the windows lock screen automatically so you can enter the password or pin but in other places it does not so you have to open up the on-screen keyboard app manually or you know use a keyboard see i was kind of expecting windows to lag on this phone i mean it's windows and this is a phone full fetch windows is known to be heavy but surprise surprise windows is actually usable on this phone in fact it's more than usable and you've already seen windows 11 in action on this phone and there is no lag whatsoever with any windows animations be it while navigating the ui or apps or you know just going about the normal usage like i said we have chrome installed and works well even with a number of tabs open videos play fire to 1080p videos in youtube is no problem as you can see now when playing 4k videos the cpu usage hits hundred percent and things get laggy but yeah it's overall pretty good now for testing purposes we ran a couple of benchmarks like geekbench crystal disk mark and you know what they worked fine on the phone now i know the scores don't matter but the geekbench single score was equivalent to a 5th gen core i3 the multi-core score is equivalent into a 7-gen core i3 look if you ask me the windows performance on this phone is actually a lot better when compared to old budget windows laptops i've used in the past and this is all the more impressive because this is a phone that's dual booting windows and android i showed you the two partitions here and one partition has windows and one partition has android and you can switch between these voices by going to the bootloader and selecting the other partition of the os now it's windows so we obviously had to try some games so we intentionally downloaded a few low end and mid in game so the phone could handle it we tried portal 1 and half life 2 and the fps in both these games around 40 to 60 in high settings at 1080p resolution i know these are all the games but imagine playing pc games on your phone i mean literally new games like cs go started between 20 to 30 fps and then stopped working all together but it would have been interesting to try new pc games on a new more powerful smartphone i see this whole windows 11 experience has its issues some ui elements become too small on the smaller screen some new elements get cut off in the corners but you know what i was amazed at how well windows 11 runs on the phone which is practically four years old you know what this makes me think what could have been if we had a full-fledged windows os for phones i mean windows phone had its advantages the ui was definitely ahead of its time i really liked it but it did not manage to win people because it wasn't full-fledged windows it was a different windows version with a different app store and lack of app support is what killed it now imagine if microsoft had not created a separate phone os rather ported full-fledged windows to phones and just optimized it for the smaller screen just imagine windows 11 with its better ui and better store on a smartphone windows 11 on phones and pcs would have had the same app same store and some really cool connected features it would have been a proper ecosystem that could rival apple i mean if this would have happened we would have an option today other than apple i mean right now apple is the monopoly if you want a true ecosystem experience the android plus windows experience isn't the same because it's two different os is made by two different companies i know it's all wishful thinking but maybe microsoft can do something like this in the future i know they have had bad experiences with windows mobile and then windows phone but maybe you know never say never anyway what do you guys think of the windows 11 experience on a phone do you want microsoft to bring full-fledged windows 11 on a phone let us know your thoughts in the comments down below also give this video a like make sure to share it around and subscribe to our channel for more amazing
