[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is the patiomyo.com and first we made a video on gadgets under 100 rupees and then recently we made a video on gadgets under 250 rupees so we thought why not take it to the next level yes five hundred rupees i know it's just totally extra but next level so i'm going to show you 10 awesome super useful gadgets that you can buy under 500 rupees and i know i say this in every guys video but it's insane how many useful gadgets you can get for 400 rupees 500 rupees so yeah it's insane now enough talking let's get started [Music] first up is this really cool smart bug that only costs 499 rupees so this is wipro's 9 watt bulb that works with both alexa and google assistant which means you can control it via your phone or via a smart speaker i mean you can turn it on or off change its brightness its color now this is not an rgb bulb but it supports white and warm yellow which is enough for most people also this is nine watts which means it's bright enough for most rooms and yeah at 490 rupees it's just a great deal for your smart home setup next up if you have way too much money but you are still too cheap to buy a real cctv camera first up send me your address and second this is for you now this is just a dummy cctv camera which means it won't record anything but you can put batteries in it and have this red light which will make people think that this is the real thing i mean it looks like the real deal with screws and everything to install it so yeah this would make people think that it's a real security camera now this awesome cctv camera costs 250 rupees and to kind of sign off on this amazing product i just want to show you something on the box [Music] this charger with a lamp thingy and instead of me trying to describe it let me just read what's on the box when your family passing by the dark isle and step into the bathroom at the mid height the night light would light up the aisle and guide your family with the soft light it embodied the concern what you did for your family now jokes about this is useful i mean a little bit i mean it looks kind of cheap and to be fair it is cheap at 500 rupees but it works as a very dim night light and it helps you locate the charging socket in the dark plus it has an auto mode where the lamp lights up automatically when it gets dark so that's pretty nice now apart from this you can also get a proper motion sensing light like this one for 4.99 rupees now you can stick this motion sensor light anywhere you want and this turns on when it detects a motion and the good thing is it only works in the dark so it's pretty handy now i know xiaomi you're really offered this too but they are slightly expensive so at 499 rupees this makes sense [Music] next up is the zebronics county portable bluetooth speaker and this has all the features you can think of so this is the speaker and there's bluetooth mode obviously there's an fm mode aux mode micro sd support usb port call functionality 10 hours of playback so yeah everything well everything except sound quality see the sound gets distorted at the max volumes and the quality is just uh you know missing but for 4.99 rupees i'm just surprised it turns on [Music] honestly for this price this is not bad especially with all the features it comes with also one thing to always remember zabronix for life bluetooth mode so do you have an electric car have you wanted to charge two electric cars at the same time well this right here is the dual karcher no this is not it but this is actually a regular car charger and this has two charging ports and that's why it's called the dual car charger now this dual car charger is actually useful because along with the usb 8 port that supports quick charge 3 this also has a usb c port with 18 watt power delivery support i mean with most iphones and added flagships only giving you a usb c cable this makes sense especially because of its insane 299 rupees price tag well are you like me and you suck at bgmi or maybe you're worried at sucking at pubg new state well with these gaming triggers you'll still suck at the game but hey you'll feel like a pro this is the spin bot x1 battle mods gaming trigger and i can just attach them to my phone set up the controls in bgmi and then use them like a pro as you can see i'm shooting from the trigger and it's actually very responsive i mean these are conductive triggers which means it uses capacitive touch on the screen for instantaneous response i also like how clicky this is yeah noise the price 449 rupees and i think it's an awesome gadget at this price and comes with these bigger clamps for phones with cases also let you guys know i also tried out this trigger from the same company spin bot this is the f1 battle mods at 649 rupees and they're better so if you have a higher budget you can check this out so over the year headphones under 500 rupees you probably expect them to be  right well expect the unexpected these are the bold audio bass birds headphones that are actually pretty nice even if you take the price out of the equation i mean these are priced at 4.99 rupees and they look good they sound good with nice jumpy bass and they have a decently wide sound stage i also like the fact that it has a mic it's water resistant and it supports google assistant and cd now technicalities aside these wide headphones are actually just really good for 500 rupees [Music] now i know what you're thinking who the  uses a water tedious tester i mean you call the ro guy he comes home he tells you that your auto is up steals away all your money well not anymore this is a water tedious tester from conveyor that costs 299 rupees and it's a pretty simple device you just open up the cap turn it on and you can put it in the water to easily measure the tedious value of the water in your home [Music] so are you a budding instagram reeler or a budding instagram influencer and you want a previous video and you bought that dumb ass ring light well i'm sorry about that but just because your video quality sucks does not mean that your audio should suck too now to help you out this here is the jbl mic which is slightly expensive right now but we got it for 99 rupees and it's pretty good it's an omnidirectional mic with a windshield installed and also has an earphone so that you can monitor your audio in real time [Music] now if you watch the previous gadgets videos you would remember that i showed off 250 rupees gaming mouse and i think you'll also remember that it was not a real gaming mouse well this on the other hand is a proper gaming mouse well it's the redgear a17 gaming mouse which has everything a gaming mouse needs rgb lighting extra customizable buttons braided cable and a dpi of up to 6400 the price 500 rupees so yeah pretty awesome anyway that was our list of 10 awesome gadgets under 500 rupees some very useful some not so useful but still funny gadgets and my
