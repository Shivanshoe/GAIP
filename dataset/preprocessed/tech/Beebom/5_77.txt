[Music] [Applause] [Music] miui 13 is here yeah xiaomi unveiled it's brand new miui update added xiaomi 12 event yesterday and this is an update that brings ui changes lots of cool widgets and some really interesting cool features so you know what i'm going to tell you all the new features in miui 30. but before we begin i want to give a huge shout out to wondershare's dr phone which is a great all-in-one tool for smartphones i mean dr phone brings a lot of different tools be data recovery data transfer data backup system repair if your phone's not working screen unlocked password manager and more because all of these tools are fast and nice and wondershare promises data security apart from that i like the nice user-friendly ui of the tool now dr phone is free to try so check it out from the link in the description down below [Music] now i'm going to start with the visual changes in miui 13 because i think that's what interests most of you guys so yeah okay so this is what a me ui 13 home screen looks like yes this is brand new and it's pretty clear that this is all about the widgets see there are ton of new widgets in miui 13 and a lot of them are like you guessed it ios let's look at the clock widget on miui 13 next to the ios clock widget now take a look at the weather widget here i mean unlike google's widgets in android 12 which are very unique these are obviously inspired from ios now that's all just look at the widget picker and the ui for different widget sizes yeah the ios resemblance is quite noticeable anyway the widgets are pretty cool because this is not a half-hearted attempt there are so many images just look at the widgets panel in the screen record their widgets for music player notes app suggestions gallery and more i mean xiaomi even showed off some fun widgets like these or even this rock paper scissors widget i mean that's pretty cool right now one interesting thing i noticed with widgets is that in this video they're changing the theme or color depending on the wallpaper so a material you theming may be supported in miui 30. anyway another visual change is the new miui 13 control center which is once again kind of revamped and once again takes more elements from ios i mean just look at the brightness and volume sliders apart from this miui 13 brings some cool new super wallpapers in partnership with the company called beauty science so here are the wallpapers and these wallpapers are recorded using a polarization microscope to show the changes of crystal formation through 8k time-lapse photography and i think they look pretty cool now lastly on the visual front is the new me sans font which looks quite minimal and a more refined sensory font so yeah cool [Music] so coming to privacy features in miui 13 first of all me ui 13 changes face unlock to body unlock i mean that's not how they put it officially but you know anyway miui 13 will scan the face along with the upper body to make sure that other people who have a similar face can't unlock your phone because mostly their bodies are different myotarian also has a new feature where you can scan your ids and put a watermark on it so that when you share your id with someone it's not misused there's also a new system level anti-fraud feature which wants users when they get a fraud call or when they're installing a malware app i'm not sure if these features will come to me at 13 globally but yeah these are interesting [Music] so you all know about miui and its bugs it's big issue and we've talked about that in a previous video and xiaomi had acknowledged it previously and they did it again while launching miui 13. i mean i don't understand chinese but thanks to google lens i know that they're talking about bugs and how they've fixed more than 400 bugs in bui over the last few months and now there's only like 17 bucks in the latest stable version so hopefully miui 13 actually makes the whole miui bug situation better apart from that miui 13 is set to reduce frame drops in budget phones by 52 in mid-range phones by 32 and in flagship phones by 15 the new miui update is also said to bring better performance to system apps and better memory optimization based on factors like location time etcetera [Music] meditating also has a tablet version called miui 13 pad and honestly this new os kind of makes me want to try out a me pad and hopefully they'll bring it in india very soon in new york 13 pad you can just press and hold the corner of an app and drag it to quickly put it in a window like this plus the window is scalable so yeah this should be good for multitasking there's also the option to drag and drop apps from the taskbar to open them in small windows now this does seem like a tweaked version of the android 12v gesture but that's not a bad thing you can also press hold on an app and use this button to open it in a window now these gestures are actually cool and apart from that xiaomi has optimized a number of apps to adapt better on the bigger screen and there's also better support for traditional keyboard shortcuts in miui 13 pack [Music] i talked about miui 13 for phones and newer 13 pad but the big deal about miui 13 is the fact that it's spread across multiple categories of devices cme ui 13 works across phones tablets smart home devices tvs and more and that means some really cool connected features and that's what miui next is all about and it's pretty cool first of all there's a similar feature to apple handoff i mean you can just open an app on your phone and you can continue using it on your tablet you can do it on a notes app a document editing app or even while playing videos mia next also means that you can even copy otps on your phone and paste it in your tablet tamiya 10 is also coming to xiaomi watches and that means when you're navigating on your phone you can continue getting directions on your watch you can also take a call on your phone and continue on your watch now this is nice and only if you could get these features on me laptops [Music] so much next is an interesting feature i mean it's a cool feature that works across multiple miui 13 devices but me magic center is the ultimate all device feature samir 13 has this new center aka the magic center where you can see the different xiaomi devices be it your tablet tv speaker laptop etc now say you're playing some music on your phone you can drag the audio to the speaker and the speaker will start playing it instantly you can also drag it to your tv and it starts playing on your tv how cool is this now that's not it even works with videos as you can see here yeah this is nice and you can also just drag a window here and drop it on a device you want and just start playing [Music] xiaomi is also announced a new miui 13 for home aka smart home devices and a new miui 13 tv update and i like that all of these different ui 13 platforms play well with each other i mean it's great really but both of these are china specific oss i mean indian xiaomi tvs and redmi tvs use android tv so i'm not going to go into detail here anyway so those are all the miui 13 features and changes we know so far and i think the new mio update does look interesting i mean i know a lot of continuity features won't arrive in india but they are cool right plus i like the new visual changes even though they are inspired by ios now obviously i will bring you a more detailed look at miui 13 once i get hands on on the beta which hopefully will be very soon so stay tuned for that also i know there's a question
