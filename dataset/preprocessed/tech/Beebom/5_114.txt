alexa it's show time rolling the intro [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from vm.com and a few months back we did a video on my alexa smart home setup where i showed you sort of my basic smart home setup with alexa well today let's take things up a notch today i'm going to show you the ultimate alexa smart home setup that we have been working on now first up let me make it clear that i'm still using alexa on the echo.4gen to control a number of devices a 9 ampere smart plug to control the geezer or ac depending on the season the amazon smart plug for one of the tvs the smart lamp i have in my bedroom my air purifier this lamp with the smart bulb and more now that's already a lot of devices but over the last few months i've been adding a number of different cool smart home gadgets that a lot of people don't know about and i think you're gonna love them i mean a lot of people in india just know about smart bulbs and smart plugs and that's all but there's actually a lot more but first up let me start with something simple an echo device so you've actually added another echo to my home and i'm not talking about the echo dot i mean the echo dot is pretty good with its loud good speakers and far few microphones but i'm not talking about this i'm talking about really cool echo flex so here's what it looks like yes this is the echo flex and this lets you add echo to multiple rooms easy i mean this is like an alexa adapter you can just plug it anywhere and that's it you have a sort of mini alexa speaker in that room now this has point six inch speakers and it has mic so it's actually a full-fledged alexa device now you can set up the echoflex in different rooms so that you can use alexa everywhere in your house but i've set it up in the kitchen so that whoever is cooking the food can just announce when the food is ready very important so basically anyone in the kitchen can just say alexa announce the food is ready to the eco-flex and this will be announced on the echo dot and other alexa devices like this announcing [Music] the food is ready now this is super cool right now another feature i find really useful is the ability to drop in so i can just say alexa drop in on the kitchen echo okay dropping i can use this to you know make food demands and yeah food demands work better when you are not face to face so i like this feature so ecoflex is a great addition especially because it also has a usb port so you can use it to charge your phone or any other usb device but what really took my lex experience to the next level is the other cool devices that i'm using one really useful device i'm using is this this is an all-in-one smart ir remote from oakdal and what this does is it lets you control every single ir device in your house via alexa video tv ac setup box anything i mean you just have to set up different remotes be that of your ac or tv or any other device and it's very simple because i noticed almost every single ac every remote from different tv brands and even center boxes we use in india available in the octa app so yeah you're pretty much covered now i've set up the octa smart remote here in my living room so i can control the tv and the ac so i can just say alexa turn on the ac okay did you hear the sound yes the ac turned on so that works pretty well i can also say alexa turn on the living room tv and it works seamlessly yes it's very useful and to give you another example you can also use it to control other aspects of the features of your tv and ac alexa set the ac temperature to 24. ac is set to 24. now do note that you can use smart plugs to control these appliances but this lets you control everything with one device so that is great i can control the ac the setup box tv any other device with ir remote but one thing i've been wanting to control via alexa is fans see a lot of smart fans have arrived in the market but most of us have these old non-smart fans but you know what i've been using this to make fans in every single light in my room smarter yeah this is a smart switchboard from smartyfee and it actually has a modular design which means i've added a fan regulator to it separately as you can see now this is smart which means all of these switches can be controlled with the app or more importantly alexa i can just say alexa turn on the bedroom fan and see how the light changes in the switchboard i can also change the fan speed alexa set bedroom fan speed to 75 percent and yeah it does how awesome is that lastly there's this really cool smart video doorbell that i've been using and i want to show it to you guys well this is the cube of video doorbell that looks really cool especially compared to the traditional switch doorbells and it has some really great features it has a security camera so you can see who's on the door it lets you talk to people on your door it has a motion sensor and i like how it works with alexa i mean whenever someone hits the doorbell alexa notifies me like this [Music] someone is at the home front door with your doorbell and if you have an echo with the display like say the echo show you can also use it to see the camera feel alexa show me the doorbell camera and you get the camera feed right here this is awesome i mean the smart video doorbell is great for these go with time especially because you don't want to meet a lot of people in fact i get a lot of deliveries and i can just accept them without even going to the door and if there's a code to give to the delivery person i can just say it while they speak on the doorbell it's really simple so those were some really cool smart home gadgets that i've been using with alexa and to tell you honestly a few months back i had no idea these exciting smartphone gadgets existed in india i mean with these devices you can actually make your doorbell smarter control every single ir device control the fan with alexa and do a lot more there's clearly a lot of potential here especially because i know a lot of people have started setting up their smart home with the eco.4 gen or even the third gen i mean the echo rods are affordable they usually start at the ps 3499 and they're much lower during sales so if you think about it they're only slightly expensive when compared to a usual bluetooth speaker so yeah it makes sense especially with all the combos on offer in fact things like smart plugs or smart bulbs are also very affordable these days so yeah the point is you can actually do a lot more when it comes to a smart home in india anyway i
