[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys i'm akshay from vwom.com and nokia recently launched the nokia 5.4 and while that phone isn't really something to talk about the company also launched these these are the nokia power earbuds light and they sure got my attention i mean these are nokia's first budget twc earbuds and no one is talking about them even though they look like a perfectly nice pair of tws earbuds well i've been using the nokia power earbuds light for almost a week now so let's check them out starting off the first thing i noticed and this is something i actually like here is the design i mean this case is quite small and compact which is something i really appreciate on earphones it's also pretty well built with a nice tactile click when you close the lid and yeah it's matte black which i absolutely love the earwords 2 are decently good looking this design sort of reminds me of the galaxy buds for some reason but yeah it's a good design overall so no complaints there the earphones also fit really well in my ear and they stayed well in place during the extreme head banging test as well which is like my personal way of figuring out if a pair of tws earbuds fit well or not so full marks there also the nokia power earbuds light are ipx7 rated which means you can use them by working out or in the rains and they'll be just fine okay so the design is all well and good but pairing these earphones is a little annoying the nokia power earbuds light don't support google fast pair which means i have to take them out of the case go into the bluetooth settings on my phone and tap on their name to connect that's something nokia should have definitely thought of better anyway let's move on to something more important the sound quality so the nokia power average light comes with six millimeter graphene drivers which isn't the biggest driver in this price range by any means but the sound quality here is pretty good actually the earbuds get quite loud the base is definitely nice and thumping plus there's a decent balance between the highs mids and lows here which is nice i also quite like the fact that these earphones manage to keep the sound balanced even at higher volumes and the bass isn't too overpowering at any time however at the max volume the treble gets a little too sharp sometimes not a big deal but it's definitely there speaking of minor issues there is some sound leakage at 100 volume but it's very very minor and not really a problem that said the nokia power earbuds light can't compare against the recently launched real me buds air 2 which have a better sound quality and just an overall more pleasing sound signature as compared to these ones from nokia one thing where i have to give props to nokia is the mic i tested a bunch of tws earbuds in this price range and the nokia power earbuds lights seem to have the most natural voice quality from the mic that said this mic doesn't seem to be doing any noise cancellation and that could be an issue in more noisy situations so far the nokia power earbuds light seem to be a pretty good pair of tws earbuds i mean everything we've seen so far seems powerful course here but when we talk about the features that's where things just fall apart let me tell you what i mean feature wise the nokia earbuds basically have nothing to offer there's no app here so you can't customize any controls or do anything else that most earphone apps offer not even a simple eq there are touch controls sure but those aren't anything to write home about you get the basic ones here to play pause music answer calls and launch the assistant but that's all these earphones also don't offer active noise cancellation which is something that the real me buds air do offer at pretty much the same price anc is one of those features that are really nice to have and the nokia power earbuds light are missing out there also no sensors here for ear detection so the music doesn't automatically pause when you take the earphones out of your ears which is another thing i'm basically used to at this point and it's weird that nokia didn't include a feature like that here i also tested these out for gaming because i like using tws earbuds while gaming on my phone most of the time but even here the latency is quite noticeable in fact most of the time you'd fire a gun and the sound will come way later which is obviously not what you'd want i wish nokia included a gaming mode here to reduce the latency but there's no such feature here so as far as the features are concerned the nokia power earbuds light are quite underwhelming but let's also take a look at the battery life the nokia power earbuds light come with a 50mah battery inside the earbuds and the case here packs in an additional 600 mah battery pack nokia claims that these earphones last up to 5 hours on a single charge and up to 35 hours with the case that sounds about right i used these earphones at around 80 volume and they lasted 4 hours on a chart so that's quite all right i do appreciate the usbc charging port on the case here but if you were also hoping for wireless charging that's not available here point is i have really complex and mixed feelings about the nokia power earbuds light look i honestly quite like these earphones but they're just missing a lot of stuff sure the sound quality is good but it's not as good as the competition in this price range plus there's no active noise cancellation here there's no support for fast pair or any of the smart features that almost every other tws earbuds offer these days and the latency in games is quite noticeable what i'm trying to say here is that if the nokia power earbuds light were priced at something like rupees 2500 i might have recommended them however at rs 3499 they just don't offer enough value for money in my opinion nokia is just trying to live on with its brand name without really doing anything to compete in the market and india is a very competitive market for smartphones and accessories look these earphones are quite good but they're not the best in their price bracket i think if nokia really wants to succeed in the indian smartphone and tws markets it will have to recognize the competition and either lower its prices or offer features that other companies offer so yeah i do like the nokia power earbuds light but it's just difficult to recommend them because they just can't compete in this price bracket with options from companies like real me and oneplus so what do you think about the nokia power earbuds lite will you buy these over the real me buzz there too let us know in the comments also give this video like and share with your friends lastly subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos that's me
