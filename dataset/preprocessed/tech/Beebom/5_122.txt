[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from beyond.com and yeah it's actually me trust me i'm rupesh i'm not kidding but yeah let's ignore this and focus on these now these are motorola's new phones that have just launched in india the motorola edge 20 and the motorola h20 fusion now these are phones that have got me interested because they bring in clean stock android experience with good specs at a price that seems pretty good so yeah what are you waiting for let's not waste any more time and talk about my first impressions of the new h20 phones okay so this is the motorola s20 which starts at rupees 29 triple nine and s20 fusion which starts at ps21499 now i'm going to start with the motorola h20 because that's the more exciting phone of the two i mean starting off the first thing that came into my mind when i held this phone first up is that this looks and feels like a very premium smartphone so it has this squarish sort of boxy design that i personally find really cool and the best thing about the h20 design is that it's probably the slimmest and lightest phone i have used in this segment it's just 6.9 millimeters thin and weighs in at around 163 grams which is really good in comparison phones like the not 2 and the poco f3 gt they feel like hefty phones at 189 grams and 205 grams as for the build the h20 has an aluminium frame with dedicated google assistant button on the left side there's also the fingerprint scanner embedded in the power button on the right which is pretty fast and there's a single speaker on the bottom along with the dual sim slot and let you know there's no headphone jack there's no micro sd slot and do note that this whole design is ip52 rated for splash resistance now the frame here is metal but the back is actually plastic but it honestly had the food because it looks very much like glass in fact it has this matte finish which just feels like glass anyway on the back there's also the big camera bump now i say big because there's no way you can press this phone on the table and use it moving on to the front that displays one of the big usps of the h20 because it's a 6.7 inch amoled with the 1080p resolution dc ip3 color space hdr 10 plus support and an amazing 144hz refresh rate with up to 576 hertz touch response rate that is crazy a 144 hertz oled in this price range is a big deal and even though i've only used the h20 for a day i think the display looks bright and beautiful with all the oled trays and it's very responsive i mean the ui just looks so smooth as you can see plus the amoled panel here is a 10 bit panel unlike most phones in this segment which have eight bit packs now for people who don't know 10 bit displays can show you over a billion colors on the other hand 8-bit displays can show you around 16 million colors so yeah the display on the edge 20 is top-notch now what's also interesting is the chipset here the motorola s20 is the first phone in india to be powered by the new snapdragon 770 chipset with the adreno 640 l gpu now the 778g is a capable chipset it is based on the six nanometer node and features cryo 670 aka cortex a78 cores that can go up to 2.4 gigahertz now this is a 7 series chipset but it's fairly powerful to give you an idea the snapdragon 778 should be more powerful than say the snapdragon 860 and it should be comparable to the demand city 1200 thanks to its cortex a78 cores so yeah it all seems promising also the snapdragon 778g is a 5g chipset and i like the fact that the h20 is a proper 5g phone with 11 5g bands and yeah there's 8gb of ram 128gb of storage and support for wi-fi 6e now let me make it clear that the h280 i have is a production unit not a final retail unit as you can see from this text so i can't judge this performance or run any benchmarks yet but you know what i'm positive about the 778g in this price range especially with the clean stock android experience that motorola offers in its phones the h20 and also the h20 fusion come with android 11 on board with two major android updates plus two years of security updates guaranteed now the great thing about the stock android experience here is that there's no bloatware absolutely nothing and there's no adware no weird permissions anywhere or recommendations in the setup just nothing it's a very clean experience plus there are a few handy features from motorola for example there's ready for which now works wirelessly so you can use this feature to connect the h20 or h20 fusion to a media car supported tv or even your pc to get a desktop experience where you can open apps from your phone multitask i mean you can even play games on the bigger screen if you like that it's pretty cool especially since all of this works wirelessly now as for people wondering about the bgmi performance i will be testing it out but to let you know the default graphics settings it's hd and high but there is support for hdr and ultra or you can go with smooth and extreme next up i want to talk about the cameras so the h20 comes with a 108 megapixel primary camera a 16 megapixel ultra wide angle lens but what really has got my attention here is the 8 megapixel telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom support and optical image stabilization see the telephoto lens is interesting because none of the popular phones in this whole 25 to 35k price segment have a telephoto lens not the oneplus note 2 not the poco f3 gt not the mi 11x all of these phones have either a useless macro lens or a depth sensor so yeah telephoto lens on the h20 is a good move it's a great move if you ask me anyway as for the camera performance of the s20 it's too early to judge and like i said this is a production unit but i took some shots and yeah here are some shots from the 108 megapixel camera to give you an idea now here are a couple of ultra wide angle shots and now here are a couple of 3x zoom shots to you know give you an idea about the telephoto lens now the photos seem good in my brief use but i just want to say that it's high time motorola updated the camera app on response it just looks outdated and sort of clunky not a big deal but yeah it deserves an update lastly there's the battery the h20 comes with a 4000 mah battery with the 30 watt turbo power charger in the box now that was a look at the new h20 now i know a lot of you guys are also interested in the edge 20 fusion so let me give you an idea about that as well so this is the h20 fusion in all its glory and we have the black variant of the phone and even the back and frame of plastic here i like that it's a matte finish which is not a fingerprint magnet anyway i like that the phone has a dedicated google assistant button just like the h20 and the design here is also ip52 rated plus it has a headphone jack as well as a micro sd slot both of which the h20 lacks also even though it has a bigger battery than the h20 it's still fairly light at 185 grams and 8.2 millimeters thickness apart from the design here the specs of the h20 fusion it has got a 90 hertz amoled panel with hdr 10 dc ip3 coverage and this too is a 10 bit panel which is actually great it is powered by the mediatek demon city 800u chipset which is a pretty good chipset in this price range when compared to the competition it also supports 5g and the edge 20 fusion has 13 5g bands which is probably the most 5g bands on a phone in india which makes it more likely to support 5g whenever it arrives in india when it comes to cameras there's the 108 megapixel primary camera 8 megapixel ultra wide angle lens and a 2 megapixel depth sensor on the front like the h20 it has a 32 megapixel camera as for the battery it has a 5000 mah battery with the 30 watt turbo power charger on board so the specs seem good for the price and yeah it brings the same clean stock android experience look overall in my brief usage of the motorola h20 and the motorola 20 fusion i feel these are phones that have a good combo of specs speed in terms of display processor cameras 5g etc and there's also the clean and nice experience which is important especially with oneplus moving oxygen os to color os so these phones could be good options for anyone looking for good all-around smartphones with a clean android experience i mean honestly i'm yet to use these phones as my daily driver but so far i'd say my experience has been positive anyway i want to know what you guys think of these new motorola phones so make sure to comment below also give this video a like if you enjoyed it make sure to share it and subscribe
