Be ready for our next mega-project,
watch how a group of hard workers turn a hill... ...into a self-sufficient eco-farm
with space for several families First of all, they use heavy-duty machinery
 to level that part of the hill They excavate the rocky slope and
then use a steamroller to compact it They start to build on ground-level,
creating caves to turn them into a farm They have to be careful to secure
 the hole, or the cave could collapse This project is being done in the Chinese Loess Plateau,
 a plateau in north-central China Once the caves are done, they cover the interior
with a mix of water, earth, and straw This blend dives the walls and extra layer of
insulation and helps fix the structure in place The area is located southeast of the Gobi Desert
 and is surrounded by the Yellow River... ...so it has easy access to water sources When the mud mix is dry, they start
digging the plumbing system Animal slurry is one of the main concerns
 when planning and building a farm It needs a clear strategy of evacuations and storage,
 as it's a highly flammable material It's also toxic, so it needs to be sealed to prevent
 any contamination of the local water sources There is a bright side, as it can also be
 used to enhance farm efficiency... ...by using it as fertilizer, compost,
 or to generate energy This area has been suffering soil erosion and deforestation
 due to intensive farming and environmental changes Combined with the migration of the population
 to big cities, the site was being abandoned To stop it, a man from the area had
the idea to use the hill to build homes... ...and an eco-farm with a
self-sustained vegetable garden His idea was to revitalize the area with
job opportunities and dwelling spaces The Chinese government is issuing aid
to stop depopulation, so he saw the opportunity... ...to help the village where he grew up He found a crew of hardworking workers
and started the project in April 2021 As you can see, they are building
 the brick structure to cover the caves As the entrance has been elongated,
the hollow form is filled with soil... ...to make it a more
 solid and sturdy building The caves will be used as breeding chambers,
 and they are now building... ...all the exterior chambers
where the animal will dwell Many innovative farmers and scientists
are moving toward a farming system... ... that is more sustainable, environmentally,
economically, and socially The trenches for waste disposal
 are covered with concrete mesh This way, farmers only need to drag
 excrements to the center of the chamber... ...to keep the whole
environment clean To level the floor to the mesh,
 they apply a coat of soil... ...that it's also be covered
 with a pouring of concrete The key to this step is to work as a team
 to quickly get the slab poured and leveled... ...before the concrete has time to start taking
shape and dry before being properly leveled Because once the concrete has dried, it will
 be impossible to work with or reshape Metal beams are installed
to place the roof on top Metal roofs are fire-resistant, look nice,
 and melt snow quickly slides off The second floor of the hill will
become housing space for the farmers Three of the caves will become apartments,
 while the other two will become storage space Caves can become great spaces
to transform into homes Their natural thick walls
ensure incredible insulation... ...that keeps temperatures stable all year long,
 with fresh temperatures in the summer... ...and warm temperatures in the winter They follow the same initial steps as
 with the farming spaces, building brick walls... ...and extending the entrance
 to create a straight wall When all bricks are laid, they produce
 a wooden framing for the entrance They use the massive space to add decorative
 motives and make it more beautiful All windows will be covered with glass panels,
 so they add two opening doors on top... ...to help with
ventilation and airflow The plateau has a humid climate with
great temperature variation throughout the year In these areas, insulation is super important
 to keep the housing in a comfortable temperature Storage space is very important in remote areas,
 especially to keep vehicles and supplies To make the spaces habitable, they
 have to make the electrical installation They have been placing wiring during the building
process so that not all cables are on the outside The spot right next to the windows is
 where they build a risen space... ...for a resting space that
 can be a bed or a sofa The end of the cave will be turned into a bathroom,
 so they start tilling the space Porcelain tile is waterproof,
 cost-effective, and easy to clean And with ever-growing options in color, texture,
 and patterns, there is an endless variety The resting area is strategically
placed over the heating tube... ...warming it and making it
very pleasant in the cold winter The only straight wall is covered with a
cabinet to add more storage space All walls are covered with a flexible but
 sturdy material to leave a smooth finish This material is also
easier to clean and maintain Little by little, they add and finish all details and
 appliances needed to make the apartment comfortable In small living apartments, finding ways of
using all the space is super important White also makes the room look bigger, and
the reflective material makes it even more luminous The exterior space will be turned into
a vegetable garden with a cooking area They create a concrete slab to help keep
 dust and soil outside the living spaces The exterior cooking area
is made using bricks and mortar Brick is a good choice because
it's handsome, it retains heat well... ...and, as a fire-hardened material, it doesn't
readily break down when exposed to the elements To make it more comfortable,
they add benches and tables to eat on They have to break the soil to prepare it
 for the vegetable garden Plowing is done to turn over the upper layer of
 the ground bringing fresh nutrients to the surface As the soil is erosional, they
add new earth filled with nutrients Plants have to be seeded with space around them
 to ensure they have room to grow As of June 2022, they have placed
 pavers and finished the first terrace... ...and are in the middle of building
the second terrace of living spaces They want to finish building both the second
and the third terrace to complete it
