In today's video, we show you
the impressive work of these creators They are building a bunker in their backyard They'll use concrete for it, but first,
they have to dig a hole big enough They used shovels to give it
 the square shape that it needs When building a bunker, you want to dig deep
enough to protect yourself from nature... ...but not too deep so that
 you risk trapping yourself Insulation of the whole structure is
 a crucial aspect you need to solve Since this area is located below ground level, water
tends to accumulate rather than evaporate Mold and mildew may grow, which could be
dangerous to anyone who is sheltering there Reinforcing your shelter is a crucial
 step in building an underground bunker Begin by setting up a proper foundation before
setting up your shelter to support your Bunker Concrete is one of the best materials for a basic
foundation but can be prone to cracking Use reinforced concrete or self-healing
concrete for greater results While the concrete cures, they get to
build the stairs down the Bunker The foundation on which the concrete
 stairs rest is to be properly constructed... ...so that the loads are transferred in to ground
 successfully and to resist the movement The most important step when building concrete
stairs is to use a proper formwork The angle of flight, dimensions of thread,
 and riser are to be properly checked Pouring of concrete into the formworks
 is started from the lowest part up Using a concrete vibrator while pouring
 the concrete is recommended... ...to fill the gaps in the stairs and
 avoid the honeycomb formation The stairs require at least 21 days to dry out completely... ...so the removal of formwork is
to be done only after 21 days Proper curing prevents cracks in
 stairs due to thermal expansion Once the stairs are done, he starts building
 the formwork for the concrete walls Reinforced concrete to create an
extra outer layer for added protection The walls of the Bunker need
 to be at least 1-3 feet thick Plastic will prevent any concrete from
leaking and weakening the structure Walls need to be thick and
reinforced to add extra protection... ...against explosive shockwaves and radiation Formwork is a temporary structure used
as a mold for the original structure Formwork material is selected depending upon
factors like cost, requirement, type of structure Timber is the most commonly used material,
 that's why timber formwork... ...is also called traditional formwork It is the most economical material of all the options Timber has good thermal resistance, which prevents
the damage of concrete in colder regions Plywood, which is a manufactured product of
 timber, is also used for formworks Nowadays, the use of plywood formwork
 increases, especially for facing panels Plywood formwork provides a smooth finish
when compared to normal timber formwork The thickness of the concrete ceilings
varies according to the weight... ...it has to support, but it is
 usually between 5-6 inches Taking into consideration the weight of the
 rebar structure and the weight of the concrete... ...building a sturdy form
 is essential for any project A key element for the Bunker
 is the ventilation openings Open a circular hole and then place a long pipe,
 long enough to reach ground level The edge needs to be isolated as
well, with foam for example Other piping needs to be added before pouring
concrete, especially to make sure... ...you can install light and electricity later You cannot just place a concrete box
underground and call it a bunker If you're going to live in it, it has ought to
have basic systems for your survival You cannot survive in a
 closed space without water Regardless of your stay duration, a reliable water
filtration system is something you should look into Formwork should only be removed when
the concrete has hardened to the point... ...that it can support its own load
and loads placed upon it Otherwise, it could shift or
collapse without support Water damage can create mold if
untreated and destroy your structures Coat your Bunker and protective systems
 with waterproof materials... ...such as rubberized asphalt or
cementitious waterproof coating Foam boards are used as extra
 protection against moisture Foam board insulation offers nearly double
the R-value of any other insulation material They help reduce heat conduction
 through wood and steel studs Moreover, they're stronger, water-resistant, easier
 to work with, and permeable to water vapor It also gives the structure an
extra layer of sturdiness Here again, the plastic cover prevents any
direct contact with water or any material Make sure to extend it entirely
 on the whole surface Now that the concrete structure
 is finished, it can be buried You'll need to hide the roof of your
 underground Bunker from view To prevent people from discovering
your Bunker, cover it with dirt and local fauna Try your best to ensure that it blends into the
 surrounding environment as much as possible Once the Bunker is operative, you
 have to think of how to furnish it Avoid dumping all of your equipment into a corner For a long stay, you'll need a thorough inventory
 and a method for keeping track Air and ventilation systems are also important,
 as they provide clean air inside the Bunker An NBC, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical,
 air filtration system takes the outside air... ...filters out impurities, germs, and other toxins This system runs on power but can also
 be automated to switch to backup energy After building, you need to clean all the debris
from the area, making sure you have... ...an optimal surface for further building In the First World War, the belligerents built
underground shelters, called dugouts in English... ...while the Germans used the term Bunker The sense of a military dugout or a reinforced
concrete shelter was first recorded in 1939 Albania is the country with more bunkers, with
an average of 14.7 bunkers per square mile
