Watch the incredible journey pineapple 
makes from the fields to your local store Once the file is prepared with risen beds,
 suckers and slips are cut from mother plants Plastic Mulch Layers are used to lay plastic
 mulch on the bed and secure it with soil Plastic mulch suppresses weeds and conserves 
water in crop production and landscaping Bactericides and pesticides are used
 to control plagues and keep plants healthy Seeds are planted into
 two rounds on the risen beds Plants from the last crop are used as
 fertilizer to prepare the ground for the new All plants must grow at the same rate
 for them to get the same nutrients Depending on the extension, a farm 
can produce 75 million pineapples per year In 2020, the Philippines, Costa Rica, and Brazil 
were the top three pineapple producers worldwide The Philippines generated 2.7 million 
metric tons of pineapples in that year Bomb sprayers are used to fertilize the plants 
and make sure all of them grow correctly The leaves crown is designed to conduct all water
 to the center, so it's the best place to spay them Plants are very sensitive to temperature,
 if the temperature is too low... ...the fruit will sour, but if 
it's too hot, it will be too sweet After some months, the ripe 
pineapples are harvested There are many methods to harvest pineapples,
 this one requires more hard labor Each basket can weigh up to 100 kg when full, 
all carried with your neck and back Mechanical methods require more hands,
 but it's faster and more efficient Each fruit should weigh around 5,5 lb
 to be considered large enough The machine moves slowly to allow the workers 
time to assess if a pineapple is large enough... ....or if it should stay on 
the plant more time Machines are custom-made for pineapple
 producers to cover their needs On fields for canned production,
 the crown is cut to pick more fruit at once Workers store them crown-first to
 make sure the fruit isn't damaged Depending on the location and the weather, 
crops take longer to get ripe In Costa Rica, a whole crop can be ready in 8 months, 
while an Australian a crop can take up to 18 months Once at the processing plant, fruits are
 cleaned to remove all dust on the surface Fruit floats, so it can be pushed
 towards a conveyor belt Next, they are sorted by size and quality, 
leaving the bigger ones to be sold whole ... ...and the smaller ones to be 
cut or to produce juice Washing water needs to be changed and treated 
frequently to meet production standards The peeling process removes leaves, 
wooden pieces, pips or seeds, and peel The fruits are sorted again to remove any 
blackened pieces, bits of peeling, or seeds The peeled fruit can be cut into a
 variety of shapes according to type The cut pieces are filled into jars or cans 
and weighted to match a standard After the jars or cans have been vacuum-sealed,
 they are either pasteurized... ... at temperatures above 80°C or sterilized
 at temperatures above 100°C After this, the cans are ready to be packed
 and sent to their final destination Pineapple is believed to have 
originated in the Brazilian rainforests The Spaniards named the fruit "piña"
 due to its resemblance to a pinecone During fruit processing, thousands of tonnes 
of solid and liquid waste are produced Solid waste is generated by skins, pips, and stalks,
 and liquid waste from water used to wash fruit Consumers look at the appearance and 
the weight of the fruit when buying it So the pineapples that are the perfect size 
and shape are cleaned again to be sold whole They are packed into 
boxes and sorted by size Boxes are packed into bigger crates that are sent to 
local shops or overseas to international markets
