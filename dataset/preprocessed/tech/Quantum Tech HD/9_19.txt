Brick masonry arches are constructed with
the aid of temporary shoring... ...termed centering, or permanent supports,
such as a structural steel angle Centering is used to carry the weight of a brick masonry
arch and the loads being supported... ...by the arch until the arch itself
 has gained sufficient strength That's the technique these
workers use for an arched doorframe The final product will look like a horseshoe arch,
 one of the oldest arch techniques It needs to have the right support
both on the sides and underneath Once covered and painted, it
will look like a hobbit entrance After more than fifty years, this concrete pad is
 dirty and broken, so it needs a renovation After giving it a deep clean, all loose parts are
sanded away to prevent further damage Once the slab is smooth, the worker
applies quick-drying concrete to reshape it A long bar or piece of material
 can help keep it completely straight He works it with his finger to get
 a smooth finish before it dries As a decorative choice, he adds
a line of thin bricks all around As they aren't supporting anything, you
don't have to worry about where you place them Here you have a great idea
 to decorate drywall on the outside Decorative plaster for the facade is not
 tricky to use and can be used for any pattern Like this brick imitation you
 can do yourself, or a rock imitation  The stencil was made in laser cutting,
 but you can find any other you prefer The wall is coated with adhesive before
applying the plaster to ensure it sticks The trowel makes sure the layer of
 plaster is thick enough for the template... ...but not so much that it
could fall over its weight Once dry, you can paint it and
 decorate it with a color combination Normally, different colors are
 used for the bricks and the joints An expansion joint cover is what you see on
a roof, and it allows the roof membrane... ...to expand and contract in sync with the roof
deck without compromising the roof system Concrete is a very durable material,
but time and intensive use can crack it That's why maintenance and repair are
super important to keep it in a good condition These workers corrected a large height
difference from the driveway to the garage... ...repaired large broken pieces on
 the garage slab, bridged the cracks... ...using a flexible mesh, and overlaid the upper
 pads, to leave a new, broom finished look All was done using only one material, Structural
concrete repair,  and it was completed in one day Concrete can be given different
finishes after all the pouring is done Pavers, which are thin concrete shapes usually
12 inches square, can give a whimsical look to an area When the area is completely clean from weeds,
 leveled, and tamped, a layer of sand is placed The sand is the material
that holds your pavers in place The material is creeded it smooth
 to a uniform depth of at least 1 inch Begin laying pavers
 at a 90-degree corner... ...preferably one that abuts
 the house or another structure Never walk on your prepared sand, stand
on the pavers and work your way out Sand is swept into the joints to
 fill the joints between pavers For added durability and lower maintenance,
pavers are sealed with a liquid sealing product Ceramic tile is a versatile
and durable finishing material Tiles can be installed as a floor or wall covering nearly anywhere...  ...but they are especially useful in bathrooms and kitchens Tiled walls can resist moisture and handle scrubbing much better than drywall or other materials... ...and so they are the ideal choice for humid bathrooms and kitchens... ...where they will be exposed to cooking splatters The whole tile needs to be covered in adhesive to ensure it's secured... ...and then the joints are filled with grouting to seal them Cobblestone pavers sheets make the installation a lot easier and don't require as much maintenance
