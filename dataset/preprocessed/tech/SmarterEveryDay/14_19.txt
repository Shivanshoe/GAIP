- Hey it's me, Destin. Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day." We're at that magical moment where you build something in the garage, a culmination of week and a half of effort and then you kind of all have
your hands in your pockets. This is Jeremy filming. This is Trent. This is George. We are about to have what we're calling (heavy metal music) - [Announcer] Weed eater Wars. - [Destin] In our first
episode on weed eaters, we used a high-speed camera
to explore the mechanics of weed eater lines, so
we could understand things like aerodynamic drag or the
dynamic mechanical interactions with semi stationary objects,
like posts or fences. We learned that it's the weed
eater line wrapping around the objects and then breaking off which makes you lose the
line when you're trimming. On the next weed eater episode, we did a head-to-head
grass cutting challenge by comparing the cross
sections of different types of weed eater lines to learn which shapes
seemed to cut the best. But today, we have to figure out which one of these lines is the strongest. And we're gonna do a single
elimination tournament, much like gladiators in Rome. We're gonna pick out these shapes. We're gonna put 'em on
the tournament grid here. We're gonna fight 'em to the death. And this is the device that
we're gonna use to test them. So we have this Tektronix old school oscilloscope protomatic. We can set the angle of
this thing if we want. It's amazing. - We've got cable connected to the end of the lever down there. - [Destin] All right. - And we've got it connected down here. - [Destin] Aha. - And when you pull on this,
pull on the lever, Jeremy. - [Destin] (chuckles) It's beautiful. Got throttles right here that corresponds to throttles on the weed eater. So you should be able to throttle up and move everything at the same time. - And it has a ergonomically
designed handle. - [Destin] We've got
the high-speed camera directly over top. And I think at this point,
we have to build the bracket. What do you think Jeremy? - Well, no question. This guy is gonna be in. - [Destin] Because that was the sharpest? - It was the best performing
last time, as I understand. - [Destin] Somebody
sent me this, they said it's this Echo Crossfire, like super. I want that. I wanna see what that does. - I'm gonna do the-
- [Destin] Razor core? - Razor core with no
cuts, biggest diameter. - I really like blue. (group laughing) - [Destin] Alright, so
everybody gets another one. Oh. - [Trent] What are you doing Jeremy? - [George] Oh, I'll take the triangle. - [Destin] This is the sharp
square that we had last time. It was really, it feels like it's bigger than
the 0.095 inch diameter. It feels like it cheats almost. - I'm gonna do this one. - Okay, that's the sharp, sharp square that the professional weed
eater guy gave us last time. All right. - What's the grey blob? - [Destin] It's titanium force. I don't know, what do you think? - Yeah. - [Announcer] Choose your fighter now. Comment below. (heavy metal music) - There's been a lot of discussion about what winning looks like. And I think what we've decided
is whichever one breaks first is the loser. And that's down to the microsecond. - [Destin] So as they go in like that, pull the lever there
- [Jeremy] Yeah, sorry. - [Destin] That's gonna be
our plane of interaction, like right there. - [Trent] Right there.
- [Jeremy] Yeah, right here. - [Destin] And I think
what's gonna happen is we're gonna get some kind
of, it's gonna be like that. We're gonna get some
kind of wrapping effect. And I think it's the unwrapping that's actually gonna
make everything go bad. So we'll see how this works. - [Announcer] Battle
one: Star vs Crossfire. Fight! (weed eaters buzzing) (cables collide) - Okay, so- - I mean, the one on the right is definitely losing more
energy with each hit. - [Destini] This is more
like judging a boxing match, like you say. - [Jeremy] Yeah at some
point you got to say yeah, he can't take anymore. (cable snaps)
- [Destini] Ooh. - [Jeremy] Wait, wait, what? - [Announcer] Crossfire wins. - [Destini] The star
is down for the count. We're gonna advance the Crossfire. Okay, so who do we have next? Jeremy, which one you wanna go for? - [Jeremy] Ah, let's go to
the other side of the bracket. - [Destini] All right, here we go. Sharp square versus triangle. Got sharp square on the
left, triangle on the right. - [Announcer] Battle 2:
Triangle vs Sharp Square. Fight! (weed eaters grind together) (cable collisions echo) - [Destini] Dude, we
got some delamination. That, that right there. This is the, this is
the blow right here, so. Boom, right there. - [Jeremy] Oh! Yeah. - Not even a question, man. - [Jeremy] I mean, that's,
that's the blood flying right out of the lip right there, man. That's the, he just, he got clobbered. - Yeah, look at that. - [Destini] Shmack.
- [George] Oh. - [Destini] Okay. Yeah. - [Announcer] Sharp Square wins. - Cool, go ahead and advance your, advance your fighter there, Jeremy. - For sure. - [Destini] All right. - Let's not forget the x here. - Okay, so next one we're
going Razor Core versus Blue. That's you, George. How you feel about that? - Oh my goodness. - [Destini] You just have
to get in the ring, buddy. - [Announcer] Battle 3:
Razor Core vs Blue Line. Fight! (weed eaters buzz) (cable collisions echo) - Ooh! It's clear. It is clear homies. - [Jeremy] Blue is all frayed and torn. - All right, look. Hey, just come look, man. Look at the high speed. - [Trent] Oh no!
- [Jeremy] Oh no! - [Destini] What?
- [George] Man. - [Destini] You out? - [Jeremy] It's an inch shorter. - I'm an inch shorter. (laughs) - [George] Oh man,
- [Destini] Look right here - [George] I went in
five, I came out four. - Here's the, right there. - [George] Oh! Yeah. - [Announcer] Finish him! (cables whipping) Razor Core wins! - X goes on the poor blue. - [Destini] Yeah. - You did good, you went
out with, with style. This moves forward, and we need one more with the East division. - [Announcer] Battle 4: Sharp Sharp Square vs Grey Blobby thing. Fight! - [Destini] All right, crank 'em up. (weed eaters buzz) - [Destini] Whoa! - [Trent] Somebody lost.
(laughs) - [Destini] All right, it came at my head. (cables slap each other) - [Trent] Whoa! - [Jeremy] Look how much that green is wrapping around the grey. - [Destini] You got some
intimate contact this time. - [Jeremy] Yeah, the grey is out. - [All] Oh! - [Destini] This is maximum noodlage. - [Announcer] Maximum noodlage. - Right there. - [Jeremy] Oh. There it is. - [George] It pulled it out? - [Jeremy] It yanked the whole thing out. - Yeah, so. - Yeah.
- Golly. - I mean, it broke out the root, man. (laughs) - [Jeremy] It just yanked
it right out of there. - Okay, cool. Alright. (cables colliding) - [Announcer] Grey Blobby Thing wins! - We're going to the Grey
rounds versus the Sharp Square on the East side here and on the West side we've got the Razor Core
versus the Crossfire. - [Jeremy] Ooh, that's. - That's that's going to be a big a big one right there. - [Trent] These are the semis right? - Yeah, this is semifinals. - [Announcer] Semifinal, East Division: Sharp Square vs Grey Blobby Thing. Fight! (weed eaters roaring) - Man, that was a hard fight there. (cables slapping) - I don't think we had a clear winner. I think they need a second round. We need Jeremy to have
a sign and walk around. - Yeah. I need a round two
for my boxer, here man. Say, give my man a drink of water and let's get back in there. Do we start with fresh
line or leave it as it is? - No man.
- This is boxing, man. - [George] Keep going dude.
- [Jeremy] No, keep going. - [George] What you talkin'
about, fresh line, dude? (weed eaters buzz) - [Destini] Dude. - [Jeremy] Man, that's a lot of smacking. That is, this is the heavyweight, man. - [Jeremy] Wow. - That grey stuff just
doesn't want to die, man. - [All] Oh, no. - Who lost it? - All right, that was pretty definitive. (cable severs) - [Announcer] Sharp Square for the win. - [Jeremy] Sharp moves
on to the final round. - [Destini] Gotta kill that one. - [Jeremy] Going down, my friend. - [Destini] There you go. - [Announcer] Semifinal, West Division: Crossfire vs. Razor Core. Fight! - [George] Revin' them up! - Yeah. (blades whirring) - Cut! Ow. - [Trent] We have some serious noodlage. - [Jeremy] Spaghetti junction there. (group laughs) - [Man] Spaghetti junction. - [Destini] Jeremy just
starts saying stuff. - [George] It's like he's been
announcing this for years. - [Trent] Oh, spaghetti junction! - [George] It's like his catch phrase. - [Announcer] Spaghetti junction. - [All] Oh. - [Jeremy] Look at this.
- [Destini] That was trapped. - [All] Oh!
- Oh, there it is. (cable severs) - [Announcer] Winner, Razor Core. - [Destini] Oh wait, this is me. Oh, I'm out. All right, here we go. - [Trent] So the fi, so we got - [Jeremy] We're down to, ooh. Oh, look at this. We didn't even plan this. - [Trent] Look at that. - [Jeremy] The Solid Core.
- [Destini] Look at that. - Dude, hey, look at this. You're missing it. Look at, look at what just happened. - Oh wow. - That's what's left. Yeah, what did we just learn? - [George] That Solid Core
seems to be making a difference. - [Destini] This gives us rigidity, so that we can have more toughness. I love it when we're goofing
around and we learn something. So I guess there's only
one thing to do here. - [Jeremy] We've got to set up the final. - [Destini] We've got
to set up the finals. - All right, here we go, this is the championship. We've got the Sharp
Square and the Razor Core, both with the hard line in the middle. Here we go. - [Announcer] Final match:
Razor Core vs Sharp Square. For the win! Fight! (weed eaters roaring) (cables slapping) - [Jeremy] They look pretty even there. That was a good wrap. They both seem to bend
about the same amount. - I think that's the key, is it's not a small radius. So if nothing else, we
have learned that it's the bend radius that
affects its ability to rip itself apart. And it's only, it seems
like it's on the unwind. - And what exactly do
you mean by bend radius? - [Trent] When this thing
wraps around my finger? - [George] Yup. - [Trent] See that bend right there? - [George] Yup. - [Trent] Look at this bend here. Look how much sharper the bend is around. - [Destini] So that's, that's like a a half inch bend radius, right there. - So the tighter, the bend radius, or the- - Yeah. - The more.
- Smaller. - [Destini] See, look at that right there. See that one right there. See how tight that is? - Yep. - [Destini] And when it has
to bounce back from that, you know you're getting
on this other side, you're getting some
kind of tensile stress. - Gotcha, so it's better that it doesn't, the thing that's stronger is the one that doesn't bend
as tightly, I gotcha. - Well, that seems to be
important for toughness which is kind of what we're
measuring here, is toughness. - [Jeremy] Oh, wow. - [Trent] That was a good strike. - [Destini] Yeah, I like that we act like we're
connoisseurs of this art now. (laughs) - [George] Oh.
- [Jeremy] Oh. They kind of whipped around each other. And it's still, man, it's a tough fight. That makes sense, it's
the, it's the finals. - [Trent] Oh, that was something. - [George] Ooh. - Okay. That is amazing. It, it literally, there's
a total momentum transfer and goes to zero right there, but look at this. So it's in tension, right? But that wave's gonna be
at the end of the orange, but there's still momentum
moving down on the grey, so it should pull it away. Yes, it does, see that? Oh, we're starting to
lose the end of orange. - [Jeremy] Yeah. There's
some tiny little pieces coming out of orange.
- [Jeremy] There's that whipping action we saw against the chain link fence. - [Destini] There is. - They are duking it out, man. It's a close match. - Toe to toe. Something flew off. - [Jeremy] Oh look.
- [George] It's tearing. - [Destini] All right. Orange is tearin'. - [Jeremy] That was a good hit. - Oh but look so does the grey. - [Destini] Hang on. Grey is tearing and you can see the tear in orange. - [Trent] It's liquified. - [Destini] Oh, look at the end of grey. - [Jeremy] A piece of the grey came off. - [Destini] Oh, look at this. - [Jeremy] Oh, no. - [George] Nothing's had
a clean, big break yet, - Oh!
- [Destini] Oh, that was a lot on grey there. - [Jeremy] Hmm. Yeah. - But it's just the- - It's the tip. It's like the end of
it is starting to fray. - [Trent] That is really fast. - [George] But it's just the momentum. - [Jeremy] Yeah. - [Destini] Okay, yeah that's a big chunk. - [George] That's a big chunk. You might be done, Jeremy. - Yeah, unless you come in with like just a huge decapitating blow and mash the whole thing. - I don't know man. It's not.
- He hasn't fallen yet. Let's see what happens here. (cable severs) - Oh! - That was orange, look at that chunk. (cable severs) - That is undeniably a large piece. - That's undeniable. - That is the decapitation. - Okay, wait. So this is 10,000. This is 11,000 is the frame. Here we go. So the wave stops, grey still has a lot of mass moving down,
and it starts to pull. - [Jeremy] Orange has bent
all the way back on itself. - [Destini] Right there,
there's stretching. - [Jeremy] Now they're
wrestling, they're rolling over. - Boom! - [Announcer] And the
champion, Sharp Square wins! - Go ahead Jeremy. Do the honors. - [George] Boom.
- [Destini] Went down. - [Jeremy] That is it. - [Destini] Although this tournament seemed to be very cut and dry, it absolutely was not
scientific in any way. We were just having fun. Every two seconds of battle
we recorded was around 30 minutes of slow motion
footage we had to review, and later we found mistakes in how we judged the outcome
of some of these battles, which ultimately means our
results are potentially flawed. There's a longer cut
on the second channel, "Smarter Every Day 2" of other
stuff we did in the garage, and I'll link to the full high-speed files for each individual battle
below in the video description so you can judge the matches for yourself and determine which line
you think is the toughest. This episode of "Smarter
Everyday" is sponsored by Audible. (laughs) - I'm so sorry, but also kinda not. So here's the deal. Audible has been sponsoring
"Smarter Every Day" for ages. And I am so happy that they do, because I use the fire out of Audible. I'm gonna suggest a book today that you totally should listen to, to reup on your nerd cred. I was assigned the book, "The
Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien in the sixth grade. Didn't remember anything about it. You probably know some of the characters. You got Bilbo Baggins, you got Gandalf. Maybe you remember Gollum,
but do you remember Thorin? Do you remember Elrond? And do you remember
these other characters? I didn't. So listening to this on a road trip with my family was a delight. I've been chewing through
audio books this summer. You get an Audible book per month with an Audible subscription, but you also get unlimited
access to the plus catalog. This is how I put awesome
stuff in my brain. You totally should do it. I'm gonna tell you the promo code, but you're not ready for this. Sign up for an Audible
subscription at Audible.com/smarter or text the word SMARTER to 500-500. Yeah! Put smart stuff in your brain. You should totally get Audible
though, audible.com/smarter. Text the word SMARTER to 500-500. Here's the thing with "Smarter Every Day." You never know what you're gonna get. I think we can honestly say that one day you're on a nuclear submarine, the next day it might
be Prince Rupert strops or a supersonic baseball cannon. Other days, we're fighting
weed eaters in slow motion. Thank you so much. Thank you to all the patrons that support "Smarter Every Day." Also, please consider subscribing if this is the kind of stuff you like. If it's not, thank you
for watching this video. It was really fun to have you here. Anyway, I'm Destini. I hope you're getting smarter every day. Have a good one. Bye. - Spaghetti junction! - [Destini] Wow! That was
so good on video dude! (banjo music)
