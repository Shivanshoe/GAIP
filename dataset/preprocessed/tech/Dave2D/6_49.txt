all right so this is a laptop that's around 650 and it's fantastic so a few months ago really announces that they're getting into the laptop game and my first impression is like okay how good can this stuff really be because it's their first attempt at getting into this stuff right it's the first laptop they've ever made so i was expecting good but nothing great right but it comes available i'm like i gotta see this thing and this is remarkably good for the money so let's just okay the first thing i did when i got in just the the initial reaction is like it's got to be running ads right that's how they're getting the price so low they've got to be running bloatware or some crap in there that people don't want people don't need because so many other companies are doing it so many other laptop companies are putting i don't know norton mcafee crap that nobody wants i'm expecting this to be filled with it nothing there's it's just a plain blank slate windows 10 and i'm like how are they doing it at this point i still have no idea how they're running this thing for 650 bucks so let's talk about the build this is a thin machined aluminum device and it's built really well there's no rough edges that's polished properly and that's the thing when you have metal devices that are inexpensive that's one of the quickest ways and most common ways you can cut costs right just leave the edges rough leave the bottom panels unpolished you see so many other companies do it this is a properly machined and properly finished product it's so weird to see at this price point there is a fairly prominent realme logo on the back which not everyone's gonna like but the screen flex is also slight it's just a solid tanky machine uh one thing i want to mention about the hinge so it is not one hand openable now i mentioned this in some of my videos where you know i talk about the ability or inability of devices people to flip open with one hand and it's not so much the it's not super important right like how many people are just lifting hinges with one hand it's not the point it's the fact that it takes a good amount of time and engineering to tune a hinge just right to have it openable with one hand right so it's not too tight so you can do it but also not too loose what flops back down and this is probably the first point about the real me device that i've been like okay they kind of cut a corner there they didn't spend the time to do that because that it only happens with top tier devices a properly tuned one hand openable hinge okay so the screen is really nice it's a three by two aspect ratio it's high res it's got good brightness good colors it's a really nice screen it is a 60 hertz panel so it's not like a high refresh gaming display and it's also got a glossy finish so you might look at the reflectivity of this me like that's a touch screen it's not it's just like a regular screen with a very reflective surface they do have some kind of coating on it to reduce the reflection but if you're used to matte screens this is a very reflective screen kind of like macbooks the whole thing is very macbook like we'll get into that at the end of this but yeah it's meant to go after that macbook aesthetic um oh webcam up top 720p it's not a great webcam but it kind of does the job if you need it there's also a rubber trim that runs around the edge of the screen and it's something that some companies skimp out on again it's like one of those corners that you can cut but they chose not to cut it and when you close a rubber trim to laptop it gives you that nice thump sound okay the keyboard open this thing right back up uh all right so oh another thing the hinge of this thing goes all it doesn't go like perfectly 180 it's like close maybe 177 degrees but uh yeah it's pretty close to a full flat open if you're looking for that okay keyword so this is a keyboard that is modeled in terms of the layout to a macbook keyboard even the texture on the keys is reminiscent of a macbook it does not type as well as a macbook keyboard i feel like these are just softer it's still a responsive keyboard but it's not as fast to type on that i personally like but i think most people will enjoy this keyboard and just get used to it quickly the trackpad is not like a macbook whatsoever i think this is a plastic surface i looked onto like their press material i couldn't find it i took a knife to it and i tried to scratch it and i was able to scratch it and to me that means it's plastic that's not the best test out there but i think it's a plastic trackpad the surface texture is okay but the click mechanics aren't amazing to me this is a very average trackpad and then on the top right is a power button with the fingerprint sensor that's built into it now let's talk about performance so this comes in an i3 or an i5 mine is the i5 and it performs exactly like what i would expect on a device like this it's cooled properly the fans don't get super loud or anything it is interesting to note that when you pop it open there's two fans in there normally on a device like this with this kind of form factor and this kind of chip it's a single fan like all the competitors i can think of are single fan solutions this is a dual fan i'm not sure if it's like a cost thing or whatever but it was just something i noticed but inside there you're also getting a single nvme that you can replace you get a wi-fi card you can also replace but the ram is baked onto the motherboard unfortunately so you can't upgrade that now the battery is 56 watt hours which isn't super small like on a device like this that's kind of above average i would say but battery life was a little bit short i got six and a half seven hours on this device with my regular testing i do have a feeling that it's that the reason why it's lower is not because of like the hardware but because of software i feel like when you have a a company like a manufacturer that makes laptops that spends more time on the software and tuning that you know synergy between the battery and the energy consumption i think you can get better battery life with that same kind of battery size on other companies and i feel like that's something they could improve on but right now ran a couple times seven just a little bit shy of seven hours on a 56 watt hour battery okay ports so on the left side there's two usbc and then on the right side there's a usb-a a note about these usb-c ports on the i5 variant these are thunderbolt 4 compatible on the i3 version they're not they're just regular usb-c ports so depending on what you need or what kind of connectivity you're looking for you might have to make adjustments based on that but yeah i think for most people usb-c is probably good enough so i'm gonna wrap this video up with i guess two things i'm gonna talk about things i really like about this device and things that i think they kind of should have done differently so the first thing i like about is the price 650 bucks at the base is just remarkably good you cannot get this kind of value with this kind of build quality anywhere else i've looked i've tried it's strange to me that they were able to pull this off on their first iteration it's built well it's got a kick-ass screen it's got good performance a good keyboard the only thing that's lacking to me is the trackpad i feel like that could be improved on but the thing that i don't like about what i'm seeing here is that this is clearly a macbook clone right they had the opportunity and clearly the funding to make something amazing they did but why did they have to make it look and feel and smell like a macbook they could have made something unique and something awesome like i get the idea of like you know you see the success of the macbook air and you're like let's replicate that that'll sell but now it's just a macbook clone and there's so many other companies that do something just like that already i felt like they didn't need to do it and i feel like it was if this was a more unique design like something that was just i don't know just not a macbook i wouldn't be even making this complaint here and this would be a slightly different kind of review but i like what they're doing i just don't like the fact that it's a macbook clone uh the other thing i don't love is availability so right now this is only available if i'm not mistaken in the other side of the world like asia in north america we may not see this for a little while and if this was here if this came in north america at this kind of pricing it'd be so disruptive it'd be amazing now it's you can still get it i got it you can import it you can do stuff to get it in but if only it was easily available here it'd be something else okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
