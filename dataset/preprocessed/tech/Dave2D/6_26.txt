oh man so this year in 2022 we're getting a bunch of new laptops and i think we're going to be in for a sweet show so intel amd and nvidia just announced the newest stuff and it's just like big jumps in performance some really big so let's start off with intel uh this is a company that's been kind of eating sand for the past little bit and this year they just they're coming out of the gates super hard so we're looking at the 12th gen alder lake mobile chips and these look awesome it's a brand new architecture it's kind of like a split hybrid type cpu where it's got two types of cords it's got performance cores and efficiency cores in the same package and it's similar to like what arm chips do right like mobile chips and tablets we've been seeing it for years but apple m1 like apple silicon that's what they do as well that split kind of specialization inside the cpu and it's unlike anything that intel's ever done so you have these performance cores for the heavier tasks but then you also have these efficiency cores that are there for the lighter stuff but when you need the juice when the system needs that extra kick it'll activate all the cores and just push out the maximum performance so at the top end we have these 14 core chips with six performance and eight efficiency cores and they can hit up to five gigahertz and also claiming a base power of 45 watts but i imagine once you push the system it'll break 100 watts pretty readily but the thing that i'm most curious about is how this compares to m1 max like apple's top of line silicon right now so that stuff apple's m1 max and m1 pro products they are very very energy efficient like that's what they emphasize with all their product material this stuff it's super powerful but i'm curious how it stacks up in terms of energy efficiency because the performance claims are incredible like you're looking at 10 to 20 better in single threaded but the multi-threaded like up to 20 faster in games and in terms of content creation my god like look at those numbers you do not see this very often 44 faster in premiere pro like look at the thing they're comparing it to that's an 11th gen top of the line chip from last year from intel like that was fast it was already great to get it 44 faster in one year come on dude that's really impressive and because these chips have efficiency cores when you're not pushing the system hard i feel like the system should be able to dial it down and just use very little energy when it's idling if you're just doing light tasks so intel 12th gen i think this is going to be huge i think this is like the biggest step they've made in their mobile tech in a really long time and honestly it's all because of the presence of amd's really good stuff last year and apple silicon like that's the truth if it wasn't for those two companies we'd probably be looking at like another iteration of 14 nanometer stuff from intel there you have it intel stuff looks really cool and then there's also nvidia's new chips for laptops they have the mobile ti chips so the 3080 ti at the top end all the way down to the 3050 at the bottom they are claiming that the 3080 ti has the performance that is equivalent to if not better than the titan rtx from a couple years ago like the desktop version of that so it's a decent bump up and this is really just for like uh it's like a refresh in the middle of the year i wouldn't expect any kind of revolutionary gains in terms of gpu performance but it's just like a nice little bump up from their regular stuff and then we have amd so they have their new 6000 series chips these are still eight core but with an improvement in performance so it's zen three plus the six nanometer processor and with the heavily anticipated rdna ii gpu so these are the same graphics as like xbox series s and the ps5 it's very capable stuff now in terms of performance laptops some of my favorite devices last year were running ambi chips right so like the g15 the blade 14 the legion five all of those devices that are running amd 5000 series chips are now gonna be updated or upgraded to amd 6000 stuff which is fantastic but the real winner here is the mid-tier stuff so like the u processors like regular laptops these aren't gaming laptops these are just regular you know work laptops or hybrid laptops regular laptops that now have access to our dna 2 gpus which is incredibly powerful this is supposedly two times the performance of the 5000 series apus from last year so we're looking at gaming performance that just was not possible with integrated graphics before it's truly incredible and the thing that's like taking my head is like this is so disruptive because now you have these integrated graphics like apus from amd that they're so good that they remove the need for like the mx 450 or anything from nvidia at that kind of tier right it's like you have these very gaming capable laptops that are that aren't being sold and priced as gaming laptops like you can be you can be a student right now i'd be like yo mom can you buy me this laptop they would not ever think that it was a gaming laptop it's a regular laptop but because it's got the 6000 series apus from amd they're going to deliver really good gaming performance double the gaming performance we had last year is going to be good now amd also has a bunch of mobile gpus like dedicated discrete gpus they have some 6000 s series stuff as well as like some updated xt versions of their regular 6000 chips i think it's cool but i got to test those gpus out properly because they're not showing a whole lot in terms of performance especially compared to what nvidia's offering at that tier but overall the laptops this year look just so good like all the players intel amd apple no one else makes laptops but the three players the three big players they're all in it and they're all competitive and like we're here for it right we get to see the fruits of competition and this year's very fruitful okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
