all right so in front of me are two gaming laptops that I think are gonna be very popular in 2020 these are the Zephyrus g14 from Asus 14 standing for 14 inches and the reason why I think they're going to be super popular is because they did so much right on these devices so these are both the same laptops gaming laptops except they just come in two color variants it's like a Space Gray if looking thing and there's a white looking one like white and silver now if you look at the top panel I'm not sure if the overhead camera is picking it up but there are these black dots that you can see that cover half of this device and these are little tiny micro LEDs that light up and you can control them in software to display a picture or an animated gif we'll get into in a little bit but it's one of the more interesting design elements to this device but on the inside it is running AM DS new Rison 4000 renoir AP use these are very anticipated chips that provide a lot of power efficiency and just good performance into these laptops and I haven't been able to benchmark them these are engineering samples I was told specifically not even to connect them to the internet but looking at what AMD's Renoir has to offer I'm very hopeful and it's also running NVIDIA GPUs so the base model has a GTX 1060 T I believe and you can upgrade it up to an RT X 2016 max Q so very powerful and capable gaming components in an extremely lightweight portable gaming device this is magnesium alloy chassis it's only one point six kilograms but even this engineering sample feels incredibly well built for a device that is this light now when you open it the hinge does this you know we've seen on other laptops before where it lifts the bottom of the device a little bit to get some improved airflow and I've been told that there's two fans in the forex news device that are the same size and same kind of thermal configuration as the bigger 15-inch device so I feel reasonably confident that this device will have at least acceptable thermals considering how small this package is the keyboard has a very user-friendly layout I feel like most people can just pick up this keeper used to it it actually feels very similar to a lot of the other Asus devices if you've never used an Asus at least a modern Asus laptop keyboard they often feel like the chiclet style keywords from like the older Mac Pros is a very enjoyable keyboard to use trackpads a little small but I think this device is I mean it's all about this compact portable gaming device like they nailed the inputs in my opinion for something this small now if you look up at the top of the screen there is no webcam I know that some people like that for privacy concerns but it is just a sacrifice they had to make to make this all fit I do think that they include an external webcam in the retail package when you purchase this device I know that some other Asus laptops have done that like they don't include a webcam on the laptop and they give you this external unit but my kind of engineering sample did not come with them but the screen here's another really cool thing most 14 inch or 13 inch gaming laptops gaming laptops don't have high refresh screens they're usually stuck at 60 Hertz this has a 120 Hertz 1080p option and a 60 Hertz 1440p option that's exactly what so many people are looking for obviously this isn't finalized hardware on this unit but I do think that that screen is something a lot of people will be interested in so other things I noticed it has a USB C port and it does support charging through that USB C port I plugged up a MacBook Pro charge to this and I was able to fill it up so for people that are traveling and they just want to bring one charger for their phone and their tablet and their laptop it's just one charger which is sick again I can't get inside here or I could but they told me not to I want to see the insides like I want to see how they've done the thermal layout but we'll have to wait until the actual reviewing it for a proper look at that other things I noticed I mean the design is so nice like it's such a simple and kind of understated laptop it doesn't scream gamer but it's got some kick to it so I'm really drawn to this personally and I could actually see myself switching over to this as my regular laptop just because of how it looks like I actually like the look of this more than the razor blade now this let's get back to this matrix of dots that you have on the top panel you can customize this to your heart's content it's only white LEDs I don't believe there's like an RGB option but it just looks so cool and it's fun to play around with and I don't feel like this is super gimmicky like you know how on some gaming laptops I have like all the crazy lights and stuff you can play around with them and to give a particular design aesthetic but it's not personal you don't mean like you can have a favorite color but it's just color here you can actually put like a logo a name a brand whatever you want onto the laptop and it just has this pop to it that is so unique to this device now I do have like a mild concern with these dots it's that if you work or use your laptop in a kind of dirtier environment I feel like dust and dirt and just grime can get into these holes and I have no idea how easy would be to remove it now it could just be like the engineering sample I have doesn't have anything covering these holes like maybe the retail units will have some kind of plastic over each dots but that is a concern like if I took mud and just smeared it on this thing I don't think I'm getting that mud out of those holes but seriously such a cool-looking device such a good package of overall components and there's also a 90 watt hour battery in a 1.6 kilogram device like that is that's the icing on the cake it's rare to see small devices like this with a big battery like I feel like as long as that AMD APU performs well and is as energy efficient as they claim I think this could be easily like in seven eight hour battery life of like real-world use I think they claimed 10 but real-world like proper usage I could see this thing hitting seven or eight hours so like come on how cool is that now I believe these starts at thirteen or fourteen hundred dollars so not super cheap but certainly not crazy expensive and I think for what you're getting and how unique this device is I think that's a that's a very fair price and that's why I think it's gonna be super popular okay
