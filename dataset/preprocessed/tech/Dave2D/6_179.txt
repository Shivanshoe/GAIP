okay so this video is about the one plus eight but it's going to move into a conversation about the company as a whole and then their transition to that upcoming product the one plus Z so if you've seen my previous video on the 1 plus 8 Pro I gave this a very positive review I really like this phone it's expensive but it's a very good phone it's just packed with all the things you would expect any high quality flagship including the camera this year expensive phone but good phone this video is about the 1 plus 8 the regular one the cheaper one and the way we're going to do this video is we'll talk about the 1 plus 8 and you just kind of mini review on it and then I want to move on to bigger juicier things so I like the phone I do not like its price the things I like about it so the color I mean very partial to this teal color if you're on the fence of like whether or not this is actually a good color in real life I think it is there's a lot of really pretty phones out there that just don't look good in real life like the little code in videos this looks good in videos and in real life so the size of the 1 plus 8 is a little bit smaller than the 8 Pro just fits in my hand a little bit easier and the curvature of the glass just like the wraparound of it is not as steep or it's not as pronounced as the 1 plus 8 pro it's still curved edge I don't love it I would have preferred a flat edge but it is it's just a nicer feel than the 1 plus 8 pro for people that don't like curved edges which is me and I feel like a lot of you guys are in that same boat another thing I like about this phone is the great battery life and that 30 watt wark charge and I also like the screen it's 90 Hertz screen instead of the 120 from the 1 plus 8 pro but it is a very fast screen still if that matters to you I mean the whole phone is super fast the ramp is slightly slower on the eight versus the 8 pro but it's something that I think most people will not be able to pick up on unless you're running a benchmark or something the camera on the back is also slightly less protuberant than the one on the 8 pro it still juts out but it's a more normal camera hump like if you hold on to this thing on the back it doesn't feel it doesn't feel crazy where's the one in the 8 pro like you pick it up you know it's the a pro just from that camera hump it is quite pronounced okay things that I don't like about regular 1+8 the first thing and the main thing is the camera system it is surprisingly mediocre the one plus a pro's camera is so much better this year that I thought that it would kind of carry over I know the a pros running better sensor that are lenses but I just I was expecting more the regular lens and the wide-angle are decent but the telephoto is non-existent it's a digital zoom and the macro lens is just it's no good I was surprised at how bad it was the 70 last year was awesome if the a pro awesome the 8 like the macro on that thing is like weirdly bad but that's what we have a mediocre camera system on a $700 smartphone and I gotta be honest I do not think that it is worth the $700 price tag that it has in North America we're gonna talk about other markets in a second but at this price point it just it doesn't feel right with me something feels off so if you look at what you lose like what do you lose going from this phone to this phone like it's a $200 price difference right you lose wireless charging you lose certified water resistance you get a lower res screen you get a slower screen the whole product is slightly worse but the biggest difference is really the camera system the oneplus 8 Pro has a significantly better camera now if you look at any kind of online publication or YouTube review of this phone it was like everyone shared the similar sentiment of it's an expensive phone but it's good this year like the product is really good this year including the camera and that camera was the thing that justified the price tag right that $900 price point was like that's so expensive for oneplus phone but because of the camera system they kind of earned it they earned the stripes of charge flagship money on the oneplus 8 pro this phone does not have that camera system one plus 8 is a noticeably inferior camera and it makes the phone feel like a oneplus phone from the past where the emphasis is on how the whole product is good except for a mediocre camera and because of that it just makes this product very difficult to recommend to people at a $700 price point like any other oneplus phone ever has been if you cared about tech and you were enthusiastic about having a good fast phone it was an easy recommendation right this at seven hundred bucks is hard to recommend even for someone like myself who is fan of the oneplus brand so this is where I want to transition this video into the more interesting conversation the question of why why is this priced at $700 it really doesn't make sense like I feel like oneplus could have priced this at $600 I wouldn't be surprised that the you know the oneplus HQ they actually considered selling the oneplus 8 in North America for $5.99 and at that price this would have been a very popular phone like all the publications and reviewers be like hey this is the best $600 phone on the market right now and they would have sold a lot of 1+8 phones and probably less 1+8 Pro phones if they had priced it at six hundred bucks but I think they priced this thing at seven hundred to make this guy the oneplus a pro look better because when you bring out a phone that's nine hundred bucks and this is the most expensive one plus phone ever when they brought that out that's a very expensive phone but when you anchor it next to a $700 phone that has had enough feature stripped away that $900 phone starts to look pretty good see I'm convinced that they could have put wireless charging onto the eight I know the eight pro has it but they could have put like five or ten watt wireless charging on the back of this I had a coil been like a couple bucks and cost but they didn't do it it was like it was a purposeful mission so that you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying the eight pro has to look the best the best way to do that is to make this thing expensive and feature poor relatively so that I believe is the story in North America with the North American pricing I believe that this phone the eight is I mean it's got its purpose there's people that are looking for something like this but the there's a ancillary purpose of it to make the a pro look that much better now this conversation gets even better when you look at global markets because there is a third player the 1 + Z now in my iPhone se video I talked about how the pricing of oneplus phones in India is completely different than the way it is in North America like the 1+8 is a cheaper phone than the iPhone se there it's the strangest thing but that's just the way it is partially due to taxes and tariffs but I think there's also an element of like brand positioning like I feel like oneplus they built their popularity and there and through really cheap pricing and you know their fan base really they want that so I think for one plus in India they're willing to eat some of that profit margin to maintain that popularity lead that's perfectly fine but it's also this element of that one plus is e and this is a phone that I think will be very disruptive in the market it's been leaked quite heavily it supposedly has a six point four inch OLED panel with a centered hole punch running at 90 Hertz supposedly it's supposed to have a flat screen instead of the curved edges that we're seeing on the 1+8 and a camera cluster on the back that's very similar to what we see on the samsung galaxy s 20 phones and it's supposed to be running a mediatek chip instead of the more common snapdragons and it's going to be priced supposedly at the equivalent of 400 US dollars which is incredibly inexpensive for a oneplus phone so this product the 1 plus Z fits like in order for that thing to exist you need to have very particular pricing in the rest of your of your repertoire phones right so in Asia it makes sense and in Europe if you look at the pricing of these phones it makes sense that cheap one plus Z can slot in nicely but that phone cannot exist in North America I don't think that they're gonna bring that one plus Z into the US or Canada it just doesn't fit you take a four hundred let's say we bump it up in North America like five hundred bucks you take that and you place it beside and $900 and a $700 like flagship and semi flagship phone it just looks so out of place it doesn't fit it's too it's too good it's too cheap it's too powerful it's too disruptive to its own brand so that is why I think they press the 1+8 the way they did I think it's a great phone but I just don't think it's worth $700 if you're interested in buying this thing right now you know there's the 70 the 7 pro 70 pro those all offer similar experiences so that's very comparable for a lot less like 500 or $550 and I think this and will go on sale like by the end of the summer I feel like the eight will drop down to like 600 bucks on the oneplus store but that's basically it I hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if he loves it I'll see you guys next time this is a little bit different of a video hope you guys enjoyed it if you if you actually liked this conversation I feel like I could talk about this like powers but if you liked it let me know with a thumbs right [Music]
