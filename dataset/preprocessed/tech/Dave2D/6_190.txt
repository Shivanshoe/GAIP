all right I'm shooting this video at 60 frames per second instead of my regular frame rate because I'm trying to showcase some high frame rate in gaming but 4k 60 is the best that YouTube can do I'd love to show you some super high frame rate stuff but we're stuck at 60 now this video a little bit different because we're in this quarantine time period I've been just spending a lot of time indoors and we have in front of me a bunch of 2020 gaming laptops so some of these are running some Intel chips the 10th gen Intel CPUs some of these are running the AMD Rison they're upcoming stuff but because there's been spending so much time playing games on these things just testing them out I wanted to do a video showcasing the screens like these new 300 Hertz screens that are popping up in all the kind of top-tier gaming laptops do they actually make a difference when it comes to gaming because I'm someone that plays games a lot and I want to know does my gameplay actually improve am I a better player with these faster screens and it's important for people that are buying a device this year or even if you're buying something that's older or if you have something that's older to see what you're missing if anything at all so just some background information a screen refresh rate when it comes to laptops or any kind of digital screen their standard screen is a 60 Hertz screen so it's redrawing a refreshing that's green 60 times a second so you're kind of productivity based laptop or like a MacBook or your standard phone has a 60 Hertz screen a few years ago gaming laptop start to get 120 Hertz screens and that difference between 60 and 120 was massive like even non gamers could tell there was a big difference between those devices like look at phones phones have starting to pick up high refresh screens because their stuff even the UI looks so much better so over the years they've just gotten faster and faster so I went from 120 to 144 and then last year went to 240 and now we're at 300 Hertz but there is a very fierce degree of diminishing returns when it comes to refresh rate on displays like once you go past 120 you need to start making some bigger and bigger jumps for there to be any kind of perceivable improvement in visual experience and compounded by the fact that there's a you know there's a degree of marketing here they're trying to sell you something new every year so I approached these new screens with this with this healthy dose of skepticism right like does this actually make a difference when I'm playing games so I booted up the msi jia 66 i installed overwatch and i could immediately tell that something was making this game look extra smooth on this display so here's the thing I have played a lot of overwatch like we're talking a thousand hours probably more and I test that on every single gaming laptop that I get in it's like I know overwatch I know the way it looks on laptop screens and looked particularly good on the GS 66 so then I stepped back and I was like I'm not even getting 300 frames per second like I was floating around to 50 to 60 so it's not like it's the frame rate that's doing it and I realized that this has a three millisecond response time which is relatively fast I say relatively because gaming desktops like their monitors can hit one millisecond sometimes even less but for a laptop three milliseconds is really fast also this isn't like the first three millisecond response time screen ever viewed on a laptop but the combination of a 300 Hertz screen along with the three millisecond response time makes it something special so response time is the time it takes for a pixel to change from one color to another but the way that it's measured and the way that it's marketed varies drastically between companies so it's actually difficult to compare like the face value of you know the the listed response time of screens from laptop manufacturers and also for validating it like if I wanted to test the response time of these displays it's quite complicated you need an oscilloscope and I'm assuming some kind of sensor to convert light data into a voltage readout point being it's more complex than what I normally get into I may have to invest it in the future but right now without any of that gear I can tell immediately that a 300 Hertz 3 millisecond screen is a better and faster and smoother gaming experience than what I had in the past which was a 240 Hertz screen and I think the blade is 7 maybe 6 millisecond response time it is very noticeable so easily the game I play overwatch has a character called Reaper and he's the guy that I'm playing a lot of recently his weapons are these shotguns so you have to go really close to the opponent to make them effective if you shoot from far away they're not particularly good and because he doesn't have a lot of health you've got to make those shots counted like when you close in on someone you have to do good damage or else you're probably gonna die and when you're up close like this the screen is moving very fast like again it's hard to showcase in this video because we're only seeing in 60 frames per second but your eye has to track what your opponents doing and you have to react to that it's very different from shooting something that's far away like in a game when you're kind of looking further away and tracking something that's in the distance I don't think response rate is as important when you're up close and in someone's grill and there's a crazy amount of movement happening on-screen I think a high refresh low response rate screen can make a difference there's just less ghosting and motion blur happening so after some fairly extensive but very unscientific testing like we're talking 35 40 hours of overwatch gameplay between several laptops I just did better on these new screens I hit more shots and I felt like gos moving and performing a little bit better with this faster screen I don't think it was the increase in refresh rate right I think was more the reduction in response time on this three millisecond screen and I hope going forward that manufacturers focus on response time and like lowering that number from three to two hopefully one instead of just trying to bump up refresh rate because we're limited right the hardware on these devices can only go so far like if you notice the game in this video that I talked about the most was overwatch a four year old game that's not particularly demanding for hardware and even then I had a really tough time hitting 303 is per second even with good hardware so the focus at this point I don't think it should be refresh rate but more response time the lower the response time these days the better the experience that you're gonna get and the good thing is that this whole feature of fast response time is not a premium feature like there are some valley laptops out there like the Helios 300 that can hit three milliseconds as well so you don't need to have a crazy expensive laptop to have this kind of feature there is a disadvantage though if you've noticed I never went for three millisecond screens in the past even the one I use right now the blade is a slower response time and the reason being when you have this type of response rate you sacrifice color krisi and brightness sometimes but the big thing for me was color accuracy the blade is a slower screen but it is one of the most color accurate gaming screens on the market so that's why I went with that but if you want the fastest and smoothest gaming experience possible you got to go for that fast response time oh one other thing this year we're starting to see smaller laptops with also fast refresh screen so this is the g14 from Asus the review of this was gonna be dropping very soon almost done with it but this is one of the first devices out there with a 14-inch 120 Hertz screen like there's something we never saw before so I think this year we're gonna see other manufacturers making smaller devices but also with high refresh gaming laptop screens okay hope you guys enjoyed this video I will end this thing with some gameplay footage so give me some thumbs we liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time need to recharge machines just stomping off my shield
