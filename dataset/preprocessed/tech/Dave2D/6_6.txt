asus announced a bunch of really cool laptops today but the two that were most interesting to me were these two here and i really wanted to get them in to show you guys so the first is the strix scar 17 special edition this is the most powerful laptop you can get in the world right now this is running the new intel hx chip it is crazy powerful like literally desktop performance in a laptop and it's in this new chassis with the cool like ultraviolet link at the top of it it's pretty wild and there's also the new flow x16 this is the first true hybrid gaming laptop the screen goes all the way back put in like different modes and stuff but it's running a 3070 ti and it's still really thin because the cooling system here is really special but the cherry on the top it's running a mini led screen like a high refresh rate fast response time gaming panel but it's mini led okay let's start off with this thing the super powerful strix scar se and the chip in here is the 12 950 hx from intel and this chip was very unexpected so normally when intel comes out with a new generation of mobile or like laptop chip they come up with the best stuff right off the rip this year they already came out with the 12 900 hk which i reviewed i don't know four months ago or whatever fantastic chipped i thought that thing was final boss because it was so good this thing comes out and it's seriously 20 or 25 faster just dominates in benchmarks it's super fast for video edits it's amazing with blender it's amazing with any application that can take advantage of lots of cores it's not a huge difference in most games compared to like the regular 12th gen stuff because most games lean more heavily on the gpu than the cpu but if you're looking for the fastest possible performance with a gaming laptop it's right here baby this is literally the fastest thing out there now these components are packaged into the 17-inch strix scar chassis with a few tweaks so the big one being the ultraviolet ink that's on the top of this device if you look at this area under normal lighting conditions you can't really see much but when light from the uv spectrum hits it it reveals a series of these rog glyphs and messages in this blue and neon green metallic ink it's pretty cool and they do include the ultraviolet flashlight in the box just be careful where you aim this thing in your bedroom um okay so the panel itself is a 17 inch panel it's high res it's got good color reproduction but it could be a little bit brighter so this is kind of like the standard screen that asus includes with their high-end gaming devices like the 17-inch ones it's super fast for games great response time but it's only like 300 nits and change so for me i could use a brighter screen because their certain games are really dark we want things to pop when they should even in the darkness this screen struggles with that it is a 16x9 aspect ratio so there's a bit of a chin at the bottom of the panel i personally don't mind it and i prefer this type of aspect ratio for shooters but there's also a rgb light strip at the bottom of that chin and there's also rgb for the keyboard rgb at the bottom of the laptop this is a very well-lit device you also have the rg keystone for the different user profiles if you want to use it the keyboard and the trackpad remain unchanged from the regular strix scar edition they're both pretty solid but the internals is where you'll see the biggest difference so it's a vapor chamber that covers both the cpu and the gpu and asus is running liquid metal on both components so both the cpu and gpu have conductonaut on it the vrms are also very well cooled and thermally they've done an excellent job on this device this laptop can handle the huge amount of wattage that the cpu can use so if you're just using the cpu and nothing else like if you're just doing like a benchmark or some kind of cpu heavy application this chip will pull 140 watts and this laptop can sustain it comfortably it gets warm but it doesn't get crazy hot and the fan noise isn't super loud or anything if you're gaming and you're pushing the cpu and gpu both hard at the same time this system pulls a lot of juice at peak i saw this thing push almost 240 watts it's incredibly power hungry but this system can handle it it really is just that chip it's a 16 core chip it's a big chip and big chips need big juice okay so inside you're also seeing two nvmes two ram slots and a 90 watt hour battery and the battery life i got on my test wasn't amazing i got a little bit less than four hours on this system with like 250 nits on the screen so uh not a great performer in terms of battery life but holy smokes this thing delivers on performance everywhere else okay so that's the asus strix scar 17 special edition really long name super powerful system next up we have the flow x16 it's similar an idea to the x13 from a couple years ago but now it's with a bigger screen and it's just a way more capable system because this is running very powerful stuff it's running a 6900 hs from amd and a reasonably high wattage 3070 ti and it's packaged in something that's quite thin right so in terms of its footprint it's similar to the g15 and m16 in terms of just like the surface air of the device it's two kilograms so a little bit heavier than g15 but it's still quite portable now the design aesthetic is very similar to me to the flow x13 so it's got that linear design aesthetic and i've always liked this look it's got that kind of industrial vibe without it being like super game or anything and it's quite unique to this product line right not a lot of tech products have this it's a nice look and it's got that magnesium alloy finish it's durable it's a nice like a really nice design aesthetic i kind of wish more of asus product used this exact finish but what makes it special is how complete this package is so it's got the ability to like flip around and be kind of two and one-y right but the screen is what ties everything together so this is an awesome screen 16 by 10 aspect ratio super bright it can peak up to 1100 nits it's high res high refresh fast response time they're claiming three milliseconds my testing is a little bit higher but this is an engineering sample we'll see what the retail units bring in but this display is running mini leds and mini led technology is so nice when it comes to gaming and for viewing content so unlike a traditional panel with just a single large lighting zone mini leds have a lot of lighting zones and that allows for local dimming so here we're looking at 512 zones that will automatically get brighter and dimmer based on the image that's being displayed so for a brighter scene or like a brighter portion of a scene those lighting zones will get turned up and then for scenes or sections of scenes that are darker the lighting will dim down and what you get is a contrast ratio that is unlike anything you can possibly get on a regular ips panel black sections are really close to being a proper black instead of being like a gray and then whites are very bright white like a pure white looks very bright on the screen especially when you're looking at hdr content great for gaming great for making content great for viewing content and it also has pen support for people that want to use it for any kind of digital illustration now internally we're looking at some really cool stuff as well so this device has two things that jumped out at me when i first popped it open first thing is two ram slots asus normally doesn't do that with this kind of chassis design like the g15 the m16 doesn't matter which year it's always one stick of replaceable ram and the rest is soldered on now the user gets both ram slots upgradeable which is huge there's two nvmes there's two fans but there's also a third fan right in the middle of the case and this is unlike anything we've seen from asus before but the idea of it is to suck in cold air blow it across the heat pipes and then out the back of the system now traditionally when it comes to gaming laptops or performance laptops the fans don't blow air across this area like there could be multiple fans in a system but because of the foam cutouts or depending on how they've done it they're trying to direct the airflow so it just hits the heat sinks and just exhausts it out this area in the middle is usually just left hot and they just deal with it right this is actually an interesting way of cooling things down so on the x16 the heatsink runs along the whole length of the back of the laptop now because this is an engineering sample i can't benchmark it at least not legally i was told not to but i will say this i tested a bunch of stuff on it just out of curiosity uh and it works like straight up this can easily handle the heat that this system can put out now it's an amd chip so they're not like 150 watts like we saw with the intel design but it's very capable and to see this kind of performance and this kind of like graphical capability in a two in one it just hasn't existed before uh especially not on a package that looks like this i really like this system now it does have a bunch of the features that exist on the flow products so uh the big thing is their xg mobile connection so this is their external gpu that asus makes for the flow products and they continue to support it and it's really cool that they added it to the new flow product like there was this concern a couple years ago they're like are they really going to keep going with it because external gpus are so niche but we're seeing again it's not like a huge feature to me but it's nice to see the battery in here is 90 watt hours and for my initial testing it's like a five hour battery this is an engineering sample so it's probably going to change a little bit with the retail unit uh the the clear thing though to me is that this has good battery life it's a bigger screen it's got a powerful unit but because it's amd lower wattage it's a pretty solid system now both of these devices i don't know the pricing on them like i was shooting this before they revealed the pressing to me but i have a feeling this super powerful intel one is gonna be quite expensive i i wish i hope this thing is not like crazy expensive but i think both of them are just really cool now thank you for watching this video i think this is the stuff i love to do right do we have access to this to be able to see and review and share with you guys like that's the best stuff so thank you for watching hope you guys enjoyed it see you guys next time [Music]
