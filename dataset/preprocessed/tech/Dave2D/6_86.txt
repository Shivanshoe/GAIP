[Music] okay it's the one plus nine i've been using this phone for a little bit over a month and it was actually the phone that i put my sim card into right from the beginning when the review units came the nine and the nine pro i put it into the nine because i thought that this would be the device that i'd be switching over to instead of the nine pro i like the flat screen the upgraded camera system i thought that this would be my phone for this year and there's a lot to like about it it truly is a great phone in a lot of ways but it does have a fairly large deficiency in the camera system which we'll get into in a second so let's get into the stuff i like about it first so i really like this display flat screen it gets more than bright enough in fact i actually find it quite difficult to tell the difference between the 9 and the 9 pro in terms of how bright they get same with the touch sampling rate 9 pro goes to 360 hertz this is at 240 both super responsive i feel like the difference is almost imperceptible in terms of the resolution it's a 1080p panel so you can tell the difference between this and a 1440p screen if you look for it but i think at this price point 730 us dollars most people are gonna love this display the speakers are good they're stereo and they sound just like the nine pro speakers to me they're not like gamer phone good but they're good now in terms of battery life 4 500 milliamp hour battery that was comfortably getting seven seven and a half hours of screen on time every time i charge this thing the one thing i noticed though is that i'm getting more consistent battery life on this than the nine pro and i think it's because it's 1080p screen doesn't have ltpo so you're just your battery life is more reliable on your everyday use whereas if you you know if you're just staring at websites on this thing you can extend it a lot longer because it can drop down the refresh rate but on this it's more consistent the super fast 65 vr chargers included in the box but the wireless charging capabilities is reduced a little bit on the 9. so the 9 pro has a 50 watt wireless charging capability this only has 15 it's like a more standard somewhat semi-fast wireless charging i'm perfectly happy with it i feel like you'd have to have some very demanding needs to really need that 50 watt wireless charging but i think the overall hardware on the 9 is pretty solid right but because it's oneplus being the new oneplus they gotta just they gotta get one in so let's talk about the cameras so i was convinced that the camera system on the nine would be at least as good as the one in the 8 pro because it's the same sensor right and it's got the new hasselblad partnership with new software and well let's just get right into it for whatever reason the oneplus 9 does not have optical image stabilization on the main sensor it's the weirdest thing it's a very unfortunate thing so what is oas and why is it important right it's a hardware feature that moves the sensor and the lens around physically inside to compensate for your hand when it's moving around taking pictures where you want your hand or you want the sensor to be as still as possible when you're taking pictures now in perfect lighting conditions it doesn't make a difference it's a quick shutter there's no difference right but if you have any kind of tougher shooting condition or you're trying to catch something quickly or you're taking a picture something that's moving it's very noticeable and i am shocked that they've removed it on the oneplus 9 basically every oneplus flagship has had ois for years and they removed it on this device this is a 730 phone this isn't like their super cheap nord lineup this is for all intents and purposes a flagship device from oneplus and it's gone and it really makes a difference especially in low light photos the images are just softer than they should be and then combine it with the fact that there's a bit of shutter delay right now it's a software issue that we've talked about in several videos but even if they fix that there's something about the lack of ois that makes me feel like this isn't as good of a camera system as it should be it really should be better because look at the price point of this thing in fact i wouldn't be surprised if this was the world's most expensive phone that doesn't have ois like what other phone that's 730 dollars does not have optical image stabilization like legitimately it's strange for it not to have it now the software otherwise is great the hasselblad partnership has great colors for more realistic looking images and better skin tones and the ultrawide sensor is also really good it's just like the oneplus 9 pro nice clean distortion-free images i like the ultrawide i like the colors but the lack of ois straight up sucks and same with the zoom lens right but not having a zoom in here but leaving behind the black and white camera it's just for them for one plus the cost of switching out that black and white camera for zoom lens would have been so inexpensive and the user experience had been so much better but they do it because like this right you know why they do it it's like why upgrade the nine pro when you just downgrade the nine to make the nine pro look better it's the classic upsell okay uh now i don't want to take away from the best feature of oneplus phones really it's their software it's what drew me to the brand in the first place and even to this day it's just so much better than any other android offerings to me it's clean with a lot of extra functionality which i value i do hope though that they continue to support their older devices in a more timely manner i feel like they've kind of dropped the ball over the past year and their older devices aren't as well supported as they have been in the past but overall i still think that they have the best software in the game now the real question is do i write do i still recommend this phone 730 no ois plastic frame no zoom is it still a good phone yes it is it just it sucks to see oneplus doing this like strategic and like tactical removal of features to upsell the oneplus 9 pro i hate seeing it like clearly they're doing it for profit right by removing that stuff this guy looks that much better it looks that much more appropriately priced but i just i just don't like it it's weird uh and i don't think other companies do it as aggressively as oneplus because the removal of oas that's serious man that's no one else has done that yet okay that's the video hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
