okay let's talk about the new samsung galaxy tablets if you'd asked me before today hey dave what is the best tablet out there i would have said without a doubt in my mind like for sure ipad pro this is the best hardware the best experience the best supported thing out there easy pick this product the samsung tab s7 plus is in my opinion the first tablet out there that can legitimately compete with the ipad pro's like it's that good now this is for sure the best android tablet right not a very difficult achievement to a hit uh but i think for many people this is actually the better choice and the more practical choice over the ipad pro that's a big claim now to understand why we have to look at this product as a comprehensive package not just as a tablet by itself but the whole thing like the keyboard the s pen because when you're looking at tablets at this kind of price point these premium devices you're not just using them for media consumption right there's obviously a reason as to why you're picking this up instead of like a cheaper two or three hundred dollar tablet just for media consumption the plan is when you pick up something premium and high-end you want to do more than just consume media right at least that's the the thinking so let's look at the hardware first obviously this thing is packed with some powerful stuff the snapdragon 865 plus six gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage and also has a new 120hz display panel which is a smoother and more fluid visual experience and also has a new s pen and a new keyboard which we'll get into a little bit but the hardware on this thing is excellent as a media consumption device this thing is awesome the speakers are very loud very clear there's two on each side it's a very nice audio experience if you're watching movies you're listening to music anything that has to do with sound this thing does it really well the exterior of the device hasn't changed much from last year's model but the front facing camera is now positioned in a way so that's on top in landscape mode the new screen is 120 hertz ammo led high ppi it's a fantastic visual experience and because it's got a high refresh screen stuff just looks super fluid on it now i've talked about in phone videos how a high refresh screen isn't super important right because on a phone i mean scrolling is nice scrolling very smoothly is really nice but when it comes to a tablet a high refresh screen makes a huge difference especially when there's a pen or an s pen involved and this is one of the reasons why i like the ipad pro so much when you're drawing or just doing any kind of creative work with a pencil or a pen and there's no lag it just makes the whole pen and tablet experience so much better and this year they've reduced the latency on the s pen to nine milliseconds it's super fast when you draw with this thing it really feels like there's no perceptible latency between the s pen and the screen it's just so much better than last year's model now when you're done with it or when you want to store it it just goes into the back of the device it stores magnetically it doesn't have a divot on the back of the screen like last year's model it just attaches onto a flush surface the case that i have on this device is the bookcase keyboard and it is so much better than last year's model that thing used weird adhesives to stick the back thing on it was no good it was unreliable and more importantly the keyboard this is a way better keyboard than last year's model this types similarly to a surface device it's not as good i definitely prefer the surface keyboards but the layout is on point and it just feels appropriate like the responsiveness of the keys is nice it doesn't have backlighting which is unfortunate and the keyboard also does not tilt up like surface keyboards also unfortunate but the overall typing experience is good now the reason why i'm even talking about this stuff but the pen and the keyboard is because the functionality that this whole thing provides comes to life with samsung dex and if you're unfamiliar with what dex is it's this platform that samsung has that allows you to use their android devices in an environment that's more windows like right it's got a taskbar it's got windows that you can resize and stuff like that it's a very productivity focused platform now here's the thing samsung dex is available on pretty much every single samsung device their phones that's a lie not every samsung devices clearly their fridges don't have samsung decks but they're they're android devices the current ones have decks and i've always found decks to be gimmicky when it comes to their phones because it's like in order to use this to use it effectively you need to have a keyboard a mouse and potentially a bigger screen like who's carrying that stuff around right it's it feels like a cool idea but not a lot of people are using decks on their phones but when it comes to a tablet what i think dex does is it gives the user a different user interface depending on whether they're holding the tablet and using it for media consumption or handheld touch sensitive things and it differs from when you connect it up to your keyboard and that i think is a fundamental difference between this tablet and just gives it so much more practicality versus everything else out there if you're using an ipad if you're holding it your hand if you have it connected to a keyboard and you're doing work on it it's the same ui and multitasking on ipad os doesn't feel particularly efficient and same thing with windows tablets when it comes to the surface devices it's why they're great as laptops but they're not the best media consumption devices when it comes to handheld use with dex it allows the device to be a really good tablet and a really good laptop because the ui can switch to an environment where there's multiple windows that you can move around and resize however which way you want and that is so useful like there's a reason why microsoft windows has that stuff there's a reason why mac os has that stuff because resizable windows movable windows is so useful when you're trying to get stuff done and that's always been one of the biggest shortcomings of ipads because ipad os doesn't allow true or proper multitasking it's got some panes you can shift them around but it's not like this if you want the good stuff samsung decks uh battery life on this thing is pretty solid it's a easy 10 hours if you wanted to you could probably hit like 13 14 if you lower the screen brightness but at like the three quarter mark so there i just ran the test 10 and 10 hours in a little bit it's pretty solid now there are some disadvantages with samsung's tablets there's two things that come to mind both software related number one apps ipads just have a more robust app selection developers probably feel more comfortable more confident in developing apps for this user base because there's so many tablet like ios tablet users out there versus a tablet that's android based but secondly i'm going to bring this up because their track record in the past hasn't been excellent samsung's support for their hardware it's like a comfortable two years sometimes three years and i don't know if that's you know i don't know how that's going to be like in three years time you always get two years of great support and then afterwards it's hit or miss now with ipads you just get awesome updates for four to four or five years sometimes two to three isn't is comfortable you'd be lucky if you got more but that's the galaxy tab s7 plus i think it's a really good devices here so much better it's so much more competitive now that they have the 120 hertz screen and the overall pack is just so much more refined okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
