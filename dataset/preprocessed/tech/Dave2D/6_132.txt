okay so there are these laptops out there that are really good like really really good but they're not particularly well known like these are devices that will be recommended by laptop enthusiasts and if you visit my discord the sweaty laptop nerds there will often recommend these devices and if you hop into reddit and you hop into like a laptop focused subreddit again these devices will pop up and just be aggressively recommended and the reason being the reason why they're so popular amongst the enthusiasts of this laptop world is because they have very good performance for the money like incredibly good performance for the money especially when you compare it to the major kind of name brands out there but the reason why they're not well known and the reason why so people so few people use them is because they don't market they just really don't spend their dollars their revenue on marketing at least not to the degree that a lot of the major brands out there do like if you look at acer asus razer msi alienware like you recognize all those brands because you see them everywhere they're plastered all over your twitch streams they're plastered over esports events like they're just you recognize those names these are made by a company called tongfeng they are it's made by one company and it's distributed or sold through multiple vendors around the world and you might recognize some of them if you're in the states you might recognize electronics or main gear or origin in europe they got xmg and in asia they got a whole bunch of kind of boutique resellers that resell these tongfeng devices so in this video i will talk about what makes them good what makes them so special what makes them so attractive to the laptop enthusiasts but i also want to talk about why i don't use one i mean if they're so good right why don't i use one and it's not some like weird twisted reason it's it's particular to me but we'll get into it now uh let's talk about performance first because that is what makes these things so special the reason why they have such good performance is because these companies or the one company tongfen they cool their chips very aggressively like we're talking vents everywhere back side bottom lots of vents and they have fast fans to push a lot of air through these laptops and all this cooling potential allows these devices to have higher clock speeds and sometimes even faster gpus so these laptops tend to benchmark really well especially if you configure them with amd's ryzen chips and if you're an owner of one of these laptops if you're a member of this secret laptop club you will have one of the best performing devices on the market and there's other benefits they tend to have big batteries like for the size of the laptop these guys will pack in like 90 95 watt hour batteries in there they're big like near the upper limit of what you're even allowed to put into a laptop that goes on a plane and it provides pretty decent battery life right it's going to be a gaming laptop you're not going to get 10 hours on a charge but these tend to have bigger batteries than a lot of the name brand competitors out there and then if you do need to charge it up you plug it up in the back which is something i always like the ac adapter goes in the back and just keeps your workspace on the left and right of the laptop clear um there's other stuff like they don't have bloatware on these devices and they're easy to open up so you can repair or replace as you need and they're also very often quite customizable like not just like the cpu and ram choice but you can get like different types of thermal paste again these are all things that enthusiasts care about and enthusiasts would appreciate and they still charge a reasonable price for their laptops but i want to move this conversation over to the topic of why i personally don't use one of these devices and it boils down to that performance difference i was talking about so yes these have better performance than some of the name brand stuff out there but that extra performance comes at a cost number one fan noise tends to be loud you can control it in software but when i'm playing games or if i'm editing videos i can't use my regular earbuds or the built-in speakers it needs to have an enclosed headset to block out fan noise and secondly it forces the design aesthetic to be this kind of perforated block of laptop it's not the worst thing in the world right there's definitely uglier devices out there but you compare something like a razer blade to this like one looks like they had aesthetics in mind and one doesn't now louder fan noise and a less attractive design would be a pretty good trade-off if the extra performance was significant but if i look at my real world usage the difference between a razer blade like a relatively slower clocked system compared to the faster electronics device the difference is noticeable but it's not substantial right we're talking a few seconds of render time and a few frames and games it really isn't worth it to me just to switch over to these devices for that extra benchmark performance the other thing is the keyboard there are two main keyboard variants with the tongfeng chassis the first one is this one here it's got this single rectangular cutout for the keyboard right and i think it helps to keep the manufacturing cost down because they have to just mill out one big rectangle instead of lots of little squares it's just less machine time but this keyboard is incredibly hard for me to get used to even after months of using it i still find that i make a lot of typos and frequently have accidental key presses when i'm in games now this keyboard is shared amongst several of these devices they do have an alternate type and individually cut out chiclet style some of these xmg devices here have it these are better to me than the first type but they're still not great they feel stiff and weirdly unresponsive when i'm typing on it and i get it i am very particular and picky about my laptop keyboards but it's important to me because i don't use external keyboards and a keyboard that i personally dislike is kind of a deal breaker for me when it comes to choosing these laptops and the design aesthetic as well as the louder fans don't really help but my overall take on the tongfeng family of laptops is that they're really good in terms of performance for the money they are almost impossible to beat but they're not for everyone right oftentimes when you hop into a subreddit or a discord channel of some sort you're going to get shoved right down your throat by tongfeng it's the best it's the best why would you buy anything else it comes from a good place right those guys are enthusiasts and they they want you to get what they like but what they like doesn't necessarily align with what you need right so just don't don't be swayed by the sweat um okay in terms of brands i like electronics i think they do it the best in north america i also like xmg a lot they're in europe uh asian brands i have no idea i've been sent a few but i can't i i don't know the pricing after the exchange rate but in north america uh the two other brands i would say don't do it as good as electronics so origin and main gear their stuff tends to be a little bit cheaper but yeah software is better particularly the bios is better if the electronics and xmg i think these two companies i'm not sure but i think they communicate and share bio stuff and that does make a difference when it comes to performance tweaks and stuff okay that's the video on the secret laptop club hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs you loved it see you guys next time
