so in typical RAZR fashion they have once again expanded their repertoire of mice we have not one not two but two new mice from Razer we have the basilisk version too as well as the Death Adder version 2 and I'm gonna focus this video on the Death Adder because this is like this was my very first gaming mouse not this one but the one from like 2006 or whatever this is an extremely popular Mouse this shape has been like this has been in so many people's hands I think they sold 10 million mice over the years I actually don't know why they call this one version 2 they've sold so many in so many iterations and variations of this thing it's like probably version 17 at this point but it is called version 2 and they've changed a whole bunch of stuff like they've changed the cables the sensors the switches we'll get into it but the one thing that is like the most unique changed to this iteration and maybe this is why they're calling it version 2 is the shape has been slightly tweaked all the earlier versions of death adders have had this area on the right hand side of the mouse kind of like the top right where your fingers rest that just it flared out in a particular way that was uncomfortable for people that had smaller hands this new version too they've they've just shaped it slightly different it doesn't flare out as wide as it used to and it's just like a it's a nicer feel in most hands now I think people that have giant hands won't notice it or they may even prefer the older style but I think the average hand size you'll appreciate this slight adjustment to the shape of the mouse but the overall design and ergonomic fit of the Death Adder remains unchanged and it's a good thing there's a reason why there's 10 million these things sold it is a very popular design so they've changed a couple other things the sensor has been upgraded to the new optical sensor the focus plus from razer i think it's actually the best sensor in the market right now better than anything that Logitech has we've seen it on the viper ultimate as well as some new switches these are optical switches now they have new feet PTFE material very slick very smooth and the cable it's also this new speed flex much here we've seen this on basically all the 2019 mice that razer put out and this has all been put into their Death Adder and they did all of this while reducing the weight of this Mouse it's now an 82 gram Mouse the last iteration of the Death Adder was I think over 100 grams that was probably my personal reason as to why I switched off of the death adders they were just getting heavier and in like 2018 when lighter mice were being introduced I didn't like that whole heavy Mouse feel especially for first-person shooters so I switched off of it primarily because of the weight and I don't know if I'll switch back to this because I do like I like the Viper the other mouse that razer makes but if you were someone that was drawn to its shape and its size and you just like the ergonomic feel of a Death Adder this is a really nice update they've also added onboard memory so one of the things I always disliked about basically every Razer product is their software they run this thing called synapse and it is it's big it feels clunky and honestly it can be really buggy sometimes I do not like installing any of their software on any of my things not their laptops certainly not for their mice and because this thing now has onboard memory you can just install it once set up your colors set up your button configurations your dpi settings and just delete that thing from your system forever because you just store all your settings onto the mouse and you're good to go if you ever want to adjust that stuff in the future you'd have to do it all over again but just keeping synapse on your system is I hate that thing so who is this mouse for well for people that enjoy the DeathAdder economics this is an easy upgrade like if you have an older one that's broken or about to die nice pickup but for people that want a lighter mouse that is shaped but you didn't want the honeycomb pattern and you also like the features that Razer provides on their mice this is definitely a good thing to check out the basilisk so this is it has the same kind of internal hardware in terms like the sensor the switches the cables the PTFE feet on the bottom it's also been updated but I've never been drawn to the shape of the vast list this is most similar to the logitech g502 it's for people that like that design aesthetic and that organ ah mcfist never been for me I've always been more of an ambidextrous Mouse person or the old-school Death Adder feel but they've both been updated and there you have it enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
