all right so a while ago i got the pixel 6 devices in and i was super excited like 8.99 for the pro model 5.99 for the base model new hardware new camera system and i'm like like this this is going to be the phone of the year right this has to be the best phone especially that base model at that 5.99 price point so i started testing it and then things just didn't play out the way that i thought they would and there's so much to talk about so let's start off with the camera system because to me the camera system is what defines this product but it also kind of defines the pixel brand so let's start off with the main sensor in good lighting conditions the photos look really good as you'd expect the contrast is pumped up a little bit kind of the way that pixels often do it and it's no different this year and the images are nice now when you get to more difficult shots like when you need to have a little bit more dynamic range it does well like the images have a lot of detail in the dark areas and same with the highlights stuff doesn't look overexposed or anything it has a very good ability to capture regular shots like well-lit proper conditions this is good at it but the truth is everybody is as well in 2021 all the major players in the smartphone game with their flagship phones they all shoot really well in good lighting conditions even last year's pixel 5. and to me the pixel 6 is strangely similar to the pixel 5 on the main sensor like it's got the same kind of coloring very similar in dynamic range but it's also the sharpness pixel 5 and pixel 6 have very similar sharpness to their photos and that to me was surprising like the pixel 6 is running new hardware new image sensor new lens but it's so close now that's not to say that that's poor right the pixel 5 had great images to begin with but i just thought based on the marketing material and based on how they talked about this camera system that there would be a noticeable improvement in sharpness but to me it isn't it's got great images but i wouldn't crown it a clear winner now in terms of the ultra wide the images feel a little soft i was hoping for sharper images but again it's quite similar to the pixel 5 from last year with older hardware now in terms of low light photography this is where i feel like brands differ the most right in terms of like the method and the route that brands take to brighten up a dark scene everyone's doing it a little bit differently i would say that the pixel 6 is one of the best here it's able to capture what looks to be the brightest image both in the main sensor and the ultrawide but the colors aren't as accurate like i think the iphone 13 has colored these low light photos a bit more true to life but in terms of brightening up an image and keeping it clean i would say that the pixel 6 is the best particularly with the main sensor now in terms of the zoom so on the pixel 6 pro you have that 4x optical zoom it shoots well in properly lit conditions and in low light scenarios it has an incredible amount of detail when you hit that 20x zoom though the pixels get pretty grainy so this is done through software it's not 20x optical obviously and the iphone only goes up to 15x in terms of software but the s21 ultra that also hits 20x if you throw in the software and if you compare the pixel 6 pro and the s21 ultra the s21 ultra has less grain like it feels like the software is quite aggressive at smoothing everything out and i think it takes away from the image but on the pixel 6 pro you do have more grain but i feel like a lot of the detail is retained and i personally prefer that look but i do think it's subjective like i think there's gonna be a good number of people that prefer that smoother kind of look from the s21 ultra there's no macro capabilities it's something that basically every other flagship phone delivers nowadays including the iphones but there's no kind of ultrawide macro capability on either of the pixel devices okay let's talk about video so this to me is the biggest letdown of the pixel devices this year so in the past pixels have always struggled with video in terms of just image quality and stabilization it's always just been a step behind almost everyone else but particularly with the iphones and it feels so similar once again to the pixel 5 and i'm surprised at how mediocre that video quality is like it's new camera system new hardware how does it still look like that like the colors feel off to me it's just surprising to me that this is what the new pixels can do now i'm someone that came from the pixel 5. this was the phone that i used for the majority of the time last year and i'm used to the images i'm used to the videos i think i was just expecting these to fix a lot of the issues that the pixel 5 had but a lot of it still remains now in terms of the front-facing cameras on the 6 pro it's a nice image it's kind of standard for a flagship device like this but on the 6 like the regular 6 it doesn't look good i feel like the colors are really washed out and the skin tone is off on it it's not the best so overall i would say that the camera systems on these devices to me they're a little underwhelming and maybe my expectations were too high like maybe i bought into the hype bought into the marketing and i conned myself into believing that these ones would be amazing they're good but so was the pixel 5 last year and so are the competition right they just i feel like the pixels this year they don't stick out as being something special in terms of just raw technical capabilities of the camera systems however i find these things very enjoyable to shoot and a lot of it is the software like that new magic eraser tool it does a pretty good job at removing unwanted objects or people from photos now there's limitations like it's best at removing items that are easily filled with simple texture like removing an object and replacing it with grass or sky it's good at that but more complex scenarios you're gonna see some kind of visual artifacts and the thing is all of this stuff can be easily done with either a third-party app like snapseed or if you're good with a photo editing tool you're gonna do a way better job than magic eraser but this is built right into the photo app it's right there it's frictionless it's easy to use and it's super fast so for certain applications for certain people i just want to play with it it's really neat and then you also have your action blur and the long exposure effects that are also done through software and also visually imperfect like there's artifacts if you look for it but they're fun to use and because it's built right into the photo app it's very easy to try it so i feel like these software effects or these software tools really like they make the camera system so much richer to me and just a different experience than all the other devices but the thing that really makes the pixels this year the special phone it's not the camera system it's the price tag six hundred dollars for a phone of this caliber is such a good deal and the existence of the pixel six it illuminates just how screwed up the pricing in the smartphone industry is right now like we have phones out there like let's say oneplus 9 as an example that is a 730 i believe phone it's 100 and change more than this but that thing doesn't have ois has a plastic frame it doesn't have wireless charging it has a pretty mediocre camera system it like that exists in the same playing field as a 600 pixel six and i love what this will do to the industry right no longer can a company make an 800 phone that is worse than this you just can't because this exists and it's made by google with years of software support and that new tensor chip so this chip is a good performer it doesn't benchmark the best but it's solid and it feels very responsive like even in the camera app and you're pushing it it never really chokes it does however throttle in games like on these devices if you push it for long enough in games you'll notice the drop in performance but outside of that these are some very fast chips now if you're curious about some of the differences between them just some stuff i noticed using it the haptic motor it's apparently the same hardware that's between the two phones but they feel drastically different just because of where they're located like on the pixel 6 pro the haptic motor is closer to the bottoms when you're holding your hand the vibrations are awesome it's just like they're powerful they're just they're very tactile but on the regular six the motor's located up to the top and it's just it's like a more muted vibration i don't love the way that it feels but in your pocket you can't really tell the difference but for the people that enjoy a good haptic motor in hand the six pro wins by a long shot now in terms of the screens okay so there's the obvious difference of like the flat screen on the 6 which i've always been a fan of but this screen on the 6 does not get particularly bright i don't have the instruments to measure nits on a phone but based on my eye i'd say that the 6 is like 10 maybe 15 dimmer than the pixel 6 pro screen but they're both good screens it's just a matter of brightness now the refresh rate the 120 versus the 90 no there's no difference to me um at least not for what we usually use phones for okay battery life so i thought that the 6 pro would have significantly better battery life but they're both very similar to each other and they're also very similar to the pixel 5 from last year and in terms of the speakers the 6 pro sounds better but the six is actually pretty good there's no like obvious stereo left and right discrepancy like some other pixels like it's a pretty even volume from both sides the six like the regular six sounds more hollow to me the six pro sounds a little bit better they both don't have face unlock i'm kind of surprised about that for the 6 pro the 6 i get because the camera there's kind of balls but on the 6 pro it seems good enough they feel like they could have done it but it's missing you are reliant on the fingerprint which is reasonably fast it's not like super fast though now my overall take on the pixel devices this year i like them a lot it's just that if you have heightened expectations of what the camera is going to be like you got to temper it i feel like you're going to be disappointed if you wanted this thing or expected this thing to be like the clear camera king it's a really good camera system but so is everybody else's stuff and i think if you go into it with like weird expectations like i did you're going to be a little bit disappointed but overall easy recommendation i like them a lot it's just that i like them for different reasons than i thought it would originally before i opened the boxes okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music] you
