all right so microsoft announced a few new products today but there were two that were particularly interesting to me so the first is the surface laptop studio which is supposed to replace this thing the surface book of the past and then the new surface pro 8 which looks very similar to this thing here the surface pro x and let's start off with that laptop studio so this is a product that is a convertible device it's got a versatile hinge so the screen can rotate freely and it can create several modes for the laptop to be in so it's got the regular laptop mode it's got the tablet mode with the screen on the top and then you have the in-between they call it the stage mode now the purpose of a product like surface laptop studio or the surface book of the past is that they're trying to create a product that is versatile in the sense that it can be used as a tablet as well as a laptop but it has to be powerful right because there are plenty of products out there already on the market that can be a laptop or a tablet but to be able to pack a powerful system in there with sometimes a dedicated gpu is difficult and very few companies have been able to do it this was one of them now this product the surface book it had a few issues like the form factor was really neat and they had this really ingenious well-engineered hinge to compensate for it but this was a a mechanically complex system which jacks up the price of the product but also it was top heavy like because the screen component had a full computer in it plus a battery it just became a very top-heavy system when it was used in a laptop mode now this new version the surface laptop studio it solves that issue of the top heavy component but it is no longer detachable so surface book could be removed right you could detach the screen and you now had a fully functional computer in a tablet form surface laptop studio can't do that it can only rotate in this convertible manner now my initial reaction to the surface laptop studio is that that is a smarter and more practical design than this thing the surface book was a really neat product on paper and the engineering behind the hinge was really well done but the surface laptop studio is just better it's lighter at under four pounds it's got a 14 inch 120hz display it's got surface pen support and it also has a haptic trackpad so if you're a deeply entrenched windows user and you've never tried a macbook track but they use haptics so that the trackpad doesn't actually physically click down like you press it and there's a like a haptic motor that simulates the sensation of force right so when you click it it's not actually depressing it's just sending a signal up to make it feel like you've pressed it now the advantage to that or at least one of them is that on a regular trackpad this uses a cantilever mechanism right so you click it it comes back up but you can only do that most effectively at the bottom of the trackpad as you move further and further up it becomes harder and harder to press it at the very top of the trackpad you can't click it at all because that's where the lever starts but on a haptic trackpad you can click wherever you want because there is no lever it's just a pad that goes up and down and the haptic force comes up to tell you that you've clicked it so this touchpad sounds really cool and same with the screen the keyboard it all sounds great and there's even a slot at the front of the device where you can slot the surface pen magnetically to house it conveniently but i have not talked about the internals of the surface laptop studio and this is the heartbreaker so these are running the 11th gen h processors from intel so these cpus only have four cores and they're going to be limited as to how powerful they can possibly be they're watt chips so they're not super lightweight but an amd equivalent to this like the 5000 series chips they could just blow these things out of the water with the same kind of thermal output and it kills me because that's what i would want that product right there 120 hertz screen imagine they had an amd chip in there that's like that's amazing like truly amazing eight core cpu capable gpu you could edit videos on it you could edit photos on it you could do everything you could game on it but with this variation the four core intel it can do some stuff well but it could have done so much more like as an example there's a product i reviewed a month or two ago the 14 inch razer blade amd chip with up to an rtx 3080 in it four pound device very small 14 inch screen same kind of idea right thin light elegant but very powerful the only way they could have pulled that thing off that 14 inch razor blade is because they have an amd chip in it because the thermal capabilities of that chip are just better than what these intel chips are offering and it just it pains me to see such a cool form factor being equipped with only intel now again there's some advantages with intel like you get thunderbolt for some people that require it but so many more people would have benefited if it had an amd chip maybe in the future but is that i'm just i got to get this out here that was my first reaction when i saw this device okay i want to move on to the surface pro 8. not this thing it looks very much like this but this it's the same kind of form factor this was the surface pro x and this was kind of like the new design and shape very thin elegant modern looking surface pro 8 has the same kind of look now uh the surface keyboard like the new one it's just like this it's a little bit different from the existing surface pro keyboards but it has this little slot at the top that holds the pen like the magnetic new again this is the old style of slim pen but they have a new one which is very cool and i love this form factor in this shape way more than the existing surface uh like the surface pro 7. i like it now there's two main changes this year the big one is obviously the form factor but the 120 hertz screen is faster and a little bit larger than the previous generation and you obviously have your regular update of cpu and the internal gpu and there's also thunderbolt support which is cool this year but that's the new surface pro 8. i like the form factor a lot better i felt like the previous generation of form factor was just getting a little long in the tooth this more modern look is uh i've always liked this one but those are the two new laptop type devices not these things but the ones i just talked about there you go hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
