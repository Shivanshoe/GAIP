[Music] all right so asus has a series of gaming laptops they call the strix lineup and this is a series of devices that tend to be focused more on performance and value instead of being like super thin and super portable the strix devices tend to be a little bit thicker and have slightly better performance than their thin and light stuff and at the very top of the strix lineup is their premium flagship model it's the scar edition and that's what we have here so this device has features and some upgrades in it that don't appear on any of the other asus devices in fact some of the stuff in here doesn't exist on any other gaming laptop on the market and i think it's a pretty interesting device now the exterior of this laptop has a couple design elements that are unique to the scar version so we have this reflective rog logo that lights up and you can change the colors or you can have it completely off in the software and there's also this back cap which comes off it's attached magnetically but you can swap it out to different shades of gray like there's no colored options but they just attach magnetically and they actually look pretty nice and i think it's a simple way to be able to customize the actual physical appearance of the device i do wish it came in colors like they just have the gray one a silver one and this translucent smoked gray version i think having color options would be nice but you can always spray paint it if you really want the top panel is an aluminum material it seems well built like there's no crazy flex to the screen but the rest of the device is this polycarbonate material it feels tanky like asus plastic devices tend to be built really well uh and it's just plastic everywhere else even the keyboard deck which we'll get to in a second is also plastic okay the inside so when you pop this thing open the lighting kicks in and this has one of the more unique lighting configurations on a gaming laptop so you have this front kind of under glow trim that goes around the device and you also have a light strip at the bottom of the screen and this light strip casts onto like the back grille area it's not super obvious in this shot but it's there and it's very noticeable in the dark i will say though that last year's model to me had a more interesting lighting like that light strip went around the whole device then just do the front area and it was really colorful and i feel like if you're going to do rgbs to this degree and you just want you just want it everywhere right so you can you can flex that lighting all the way but i feel like it still looks cool but to me it's not as nice as last year's model but for the people i don't care about rgbs none of this matters there's also this translucent gray area where you can kind of see through some of the keyboard deck this is the same finish as the non-translucent black area but it's just able to be seen through i think it actually looks kind of cool the disadvantage i would say though is that the material that they use or seemingly had to use to be able to achieve this translucency is very prone to fingerprints like this thing shows fingerprints immediately so it's kind of a trade-off if you have super greasy hands you're probably gonna hate all the smudges that appear in your device but i think it looks quite nice now the keyboard itself uses an optomechanical switch so it's a mechanical keyboard it uses a very tactile switch right you can hear it you can feel it and it uses an optical sensor so it's got a light beam that when you press it and detects that the light's cut off it registers as an input so it's very fast in that sense very quick response time but there's a couple issues number one it's loud right so if you're typing and if you're in a noise sensitive environment like you're in the library or you're in a lecture hall or a place where noise matters like at work and you're just right you're just going ham you're gonna get some dirty looks for sure the second thing is the feel of it this is not a keyboard that everybody's going to like it definitely feels different from like a domed switch keyboard just a regular membrane-based keyboard these are if i'm being honest i would say that most people would prefer a dome switch over this if you've never tried a gaming laptop with a mechanical keyboard these feel different from a regular mechanical keyboard right most people who try a regular desktop keyboard they're going to like a mechanical but these are it's a it's a different kind of feel so if you can't try one in the store there's a risk of you not liking this keyboard right out of the box the layout is great i really like the design and the shape of this keyboard i also like the fact that as a print screen a lot of asus keyboards don't have them this year but not everyone's gonna like this kind of tactility on a laptop keyboard the power button up top doesn't have a fingerprint sensor i was hoping it would actually i thought it would because so many other devices from asus have it this year but this one still doesn't and the touchpad or the trackpad this is slightly different this year so they've removed the physical left and right buttons it's now just built right into the trackpad it's still a gloss surface it tracks nicely but it's a little bit louder because the button mechanics are right the standard click and there's also a numb lock so you can hold it and now you have access to a number pad if that's something that you use frequently now on the side here you'll see this red plastic they call it a keystone or keystone 2. this feels a little bit gimmicky to me basically you load up your personal settings and then when you place it in you get an audio cue and then now your personal settings will load on the device it's like i said gimmicky but if that's your kind of thing it's available but you can always just remove it and just not use it which is probably what most people would do okay let's talk about performance because this is stacked with all the good stuff amd's 5900 hx and an rtx 3080 very powerful stuff however it doesn't run the fastest it's really good but i do think there's a couple problems number one the cooling on this system is just enough and in a 15-inch device that isn't super thick it is a challenge to cool the stuff properly especially if you have the high end configuration the second thing is that there's no mux switch so the gpu isn't connected directly to the display on the screen so you get a slight dip in performance i feel like currently in 2021 most of the premium devices out there even the ones from asus have that direct connection this one doesn't it's very very slight but it is a dip in performance compared to the best stuff out there that being said it still has excellent performance and even the fan noise is quieter than i thought it would be if anything i feel like they could ramp up that fan a little bit louder because even on turbo mode it's quieter than you might expect but you can crank it up pretty aggressively in manual mode there are still no ports on the right side of the device so if you're right-handed and you're using a mouse or any kind of peripheral you have to route the cable from the left or the back of the device where you'll also find the ac adapter as well as your ethernet port it doesn't support thunderbolt 3 on the usbc but you can charge it with 100 watt power delivery if you need to in a pinch uh i think that's basically all the exterior inside you have access to all of it you have your two ram slots you have your two ssds and you also have your big 90 watt hour battery and this is a comfortable seven and a half eight hour battery now the reason why it's not a longer battery life is because the screen is a high resolution screen it's an awesome screen it's 1440p and it's high refresh good colors i think this is one of the best screens you can get in the gaming laptop market right now it's not unique to this device the g15 i believe also shares the screen i think other devices out there also have a comparable screen to this but i do like playing games and editing videos on high refresh high resolution panels it's a treat okay so that's the overview my personal take on whether or not this is worth the extra money right because this is like two three hundred dollars more than the the standard non-scar edition or just like a competing product this has a whole bunch of like gimmicky stuff i'll be honest like the keystone and you know the design elements on this thing are cool but they're not they're not fundamental to the actual feel and performs the device what is different though is this keyboard this defines the product for me not the rgb lighting nothing else it really is this keyboard and i think because it's so personal like it's such a subjective thing right you got to try it you really have to go into a store and try it out for a little while because if you don't like the keyboard then there's no reason to get this but some of my friends love this thing straight up they think this keyboard is fantastic they like the feel they don't mind the sound but everyone's different and i think you've just gotta know for this keyboard before you spend the money okay i think this thing starts at 19.99 they have an rtx 3080 version at that price point which is fairly reasonable like it's like high-end stuff but for high-end stuff it's priced reasonably well okay hope you guys enjoyed this video
