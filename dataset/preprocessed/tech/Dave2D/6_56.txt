all right so today we have something very special i have wanted a product like this since i was like seven years old i have wanted this thing since i was a child uh and you can probably tell by the front of the box what it relates to this is it's optimus prime and it's not a regular optimus prime it is a it's made by a company that makes programmable robots and it does it apparently does a lot of cool stuff right so i haven't opened anything i haven't even read up on this thing i wanted this to be a very kind of organic experience for all of us come out childhood dreams okay i'm sweating i'm so excited so we have it's a collector's edition on this particular unit it comes in a black box you can see them right on the box dude this looks so cool i'm actually surprised it's a black box i thought it'd be like the red and blue the classic optimus prime colors but this is so much cooler it looks so much more collector's edition and okay i got to read this i can't read it like that all right voice controlled interactive play manual control via mobile app there's missions apparently and an action library all right i'm going into this thing it comes in a case like a foam this feels like a dji drone i'm surprised they put so much attention to the packaging man okay latch one two and then i'm assuming it pops up here we go i feel like i'm giving birth to a robot come out yes okay okay how do we do this oh he's heavy okay where do i put him okay let's put him like this oh you can he did you hear that there's like there's like servos in there oh he's gonna do good stuff he's a lot bigger than i thought he'd be because i've seen robinson's or robison's regular robots they're actually a little bit smaller than this quite a bit smaller than this but he looks just like optimus look at this thing this is straight up like original cartoon this is it this is what optimus looks like and the the colors and like the kind of details on them okay let's start okay i guess we start peeling no we don't need to peel i gotta figure out how he works i don't want to break him power on hold down for five seconds to start him up i hope he comes charged so hold on for five seconds to start him up greetings i am optimus [Applause] okay i got you optimus i'll reboot you okay do i just turn them off okay turn them off turn them off chill chill i got you dude i'll reboot you okay okay
