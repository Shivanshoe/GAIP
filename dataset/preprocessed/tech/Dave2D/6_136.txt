okay let's talk about the new apple watch the series six so this is the first apple watch that i've wanted to own or to wear for like over five years i bought the very first generation apple watch but i didn't really love it like it just you know it was cool but it just wasn't for me i just didn't love the look of it i also didn't find it particularly useful for my life back then but there's two things that have popped up that made me interested in the series six number one the blood oxygen sensor so the ability to measure the o2 saturation in your blood it's something that i'm familiar with in my regular work and it's just we'll get into it but that was something i was interested in but number two and there's a more personal reason i am 39 i feel old i am old and i'm about to roll into 40 in a few months and i've just realized that my actual health like my sleeping habits my cardiovascular health all that stuff is starting to it's starting to slide like i have two kids now and i mean this is a very personal video but i have two kids and i feel like my health not that it's poor i don't think it's poor but i'm starting to realize that i should i should take care of it and i and i wanted to pick up a tool to assist in that stuff so we'll get into at the end but the first thing first uh let's talk about the pulse oximeter actually before that let's talk real quickly about the solo loop so the solo loop is the watch band or one of the new watch bands that apple is offering this year it's this giant rubber band and i like it like it's super comfortable more comfortable than a regular strap with a clasp and it's easier to take on and off than i thought it would be so if you're interested in the solo loop it gets my whole hearted recommendation i just wish it came in better colors but i'm sure there's gonna be some third party guys doing it okay the blood oxygen sensor so this is measuring the amount of oxygen that's bound to hemoglobin that's floating around in your blood expressed as a percentage and at 100 that would mean that your blood is in theory maximally enriched with oxygen now this measurement o2 saturation is not like a casual measurement it's normally used to monitor things it's not just like you know what's the temperature today check it's not normally for that it's normally used to measure certain conditions or to monitor certain conditions and especially with the current pandemic because covid is a pulmonary disease like it affects your lungs this can be a very useful tool but in my opinion this is not reliable or accurate enough in the current like the in the way that it's used so the hardware is excellent but i've noticed that when you have on your wrist and it's measuring off of your wrist this is a really bad really bad sight to measuring o2 saturation normally with pulse oximetry you want to measure like through a meaty part of like like your fingertip or something right where the light has a lot of you know it can travel through something and you can measure it but because this is a wrist mounted watch you're reliant on a reflection they're shining light on your wrist and it's reflecting back and the sensor is reading that reflected light and it is very difficult for hardware to do that reliably and or accurately now i've noticed if you take this thing off of your wrist and you use it on your fingertip it's awesome this thing measures up like i measured it on this thing and i compared it to a regular pulse oximeter it seems very accurate and i never get error messages saying that it can't get a reading but the thing is this device is often mounted on your wrist that's how the vast majority of users are will be measuring their o2 saturation and it's just number one not a great site and number two this is the big thing it's almost useless information if it's not accurate then the number is meaningless it's like a temperature right imagine have thermometer that's like plus or minus seven right it's like how useful is that information do you have a fever maybe maybe not how do you know you measure it 10 times it's like how right it's it's there's a there's a weird thing i'm glad that this tech exists but there's no instructions on apple's site as to like you know take it off and use your finger it's weird that this tech is in there given the inaccuracies that the wrist mounted measurement seems to have but i'll be completely honest i think it's really cool that it's in there i think it's awesome i just feel like the messaging around it could be different okay let's move off this nerdy sweaty o2 sad stuff because that is well the thing the reason why i went so deep on it is because that is the primary feature that is different this year between the series six and the series five like that's it's how they're marketing and it's just it is the primary feature so that's why i went a little ham on that thing okay uh let's talk about just real briefly my interest in this device as a fitness tracker so apple has an upcoming service it's called apple fitness plus it's a paid service that's supposed to be coming out at the end of the year and it's used in conjunction with the apple watch where it can monitor your heart rate and give you feedback to your actual workouts it's an interesting idea and i want to give that thing a solid run but it's not out yet so i'm just using the apple watch as a basic fitness tracker thing is i have forgotten how good the apple watch is at the whole gamification of fitness and just keeping track of things not that it's super fun but it's more enjoyable to have metrics and to have goals that you can chase instead of not having any of that stuff the other thing i've noticed is well sleep so this has a decent sleep tracker i've never actually used one before so i'm someone who sleeps around four maybe five hours a night and it's not great like i've always been told like everyone always tells me you gotta sleep more but not only do i now have like empirical evidence that i'm sleeping poorly but there's a good number of tools and apps to help me make changes in my personal life for health so i feel like if you're someone who's interested in stuff like this uh i mean just stay tuned in a few months i will do i'll be doing a follow-up for sure like just the process of what this was like for fitness interests but for people that are interested in this device for pulse oximetry or measuring of blood o2 saturation there's probably better ways to do it there is one last thing i want to talk about it's the battery life so the series six has a slightly bigger battery than the series five and if you turn off the ozone display i can actually comfortably hit two days of battery life on this new series six which is a big plus in my books just charging this thing less okay that finally wraps up this video hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
