all right i wanted to have a conversation about the upcoming samsung galaxy s 21 or the full family of the s21 phones so the s21 regular the s21 plus and the s21 ultra now these are phones have been leaked and rumored for a really long time at this point like we've seen high-res imagery and really detailed specs come down the pipe for months at this point from very reliable leakers now recently there's an article published by wind future they kind of detailed the whole thing so if you're interested in seeing the whole thing it's it's available i want to draw your attention to well let's talk about the good stuff first there's three things that i'm personally interested in i like the new look it's a kind of sleek looking design that's not super reminiscent of their older stuff so i like it i also am interested in this new snapdragon chips or the xnos equivalent supposedly the exynos 2100 is really good this year but the feature that caught my eye the most was the presence of flat screens on all of these phones it's a feature that we saw on the well the s20 fe header but the flat screen i love it right this is just it's just better it doesn't look as sexy in videos and stuff like that but it's a more practical and in my opinion more usable design choice than a curved screen so that's all good stuff but there are some features on these new phones that concern me and it's not just me i think it concerns a lot of people so number one there's no charger thanks apple there's no charger there's seemingly no sd card slot and there's supposedly less ram so the s21 family is supposed to start with eight gigs of ram at the base which is really strange like the s20 from 2020 started with 12 gigs of ram and then the kicker the s21 and the s21 plus are supposedly running 1080p screens 2400 by 1080p it's really weird like when i first started youtube 2015 they made the switch over to 1440p screens i remember like it was a big deal right a handheld device with a 1440p screen it was crazy it was cool but it's been so many years of running 1440p screens and now they're reverting back to a 1080p panel it is like what is going on like okay i don't care how bright this screen is i don't care how amazingly color accurate it is i don't care what tech is in there the fact that they're dropping resolution is going to be very noticeable not just to the tech enthusiasts like you and i but the average person that picks up these things you're holding them inches away from your face to go to a 1080p panel i just it's strange it's really strange now i'm sure there's good reason for it and we'll get into it but that's it's it's strange now the other thing is that supposedly the base model s21 is running a plastic back panel or like a glastonic back panel now we've seen this stuff on uh the base model note 20 as well as the s20 fe i like this material i think it looks cool it's cheaper it's lighter it's more durable it's good stuff but a lot of the world doesn't see it that way a lot of people like that premium glass back now when these phones get announced on january 14th i think for a lot of people especially for tech enthusiasts they're going to look at this stuff with puzzlement it'll be strange like how did samsung's galaxy s line which has traditionally been like the premium the best of the best like the bleeding edge of what samsung has to offer how did it go from that stuff to 1080p panels with plastic backs and no chargers now i'll be honest i actually like the idea of plastic backed phones it's just i i don't mind the feel and look for them i really like the durability if you've watched my channel i've broken two or three of my personal phones over the past few years just cracks on the back through regular use i like plastic back phones if they're done right like you can do them cheap there's a bunch of phones out there particularly chinese branded phones that just slap on a really ugly ass plastic bag it's just got the super shiny material where they try to mimic glass but then if you own it like the note 20 they just owned it like we got plastic we don't care it just it feels like plastic it looks like plastic but it looks good and this type of plastic back i like so if this is the type of stuff they're bringing onto the s21 i'm all for it i think we'll have to see but in general i like plastic back phones all the other feature oddities not so much particularly the 1080p panel like even though it's 120hz it just doesn't feel right not for a galaxy s smartphone so the big question at least for me was why why would they do this because it's not like samsung's sitting at the top there thinking hmm let's pack a phone with garbage specs garbage features and charge a lot of money and not sell any units that's not reality right there's a there's an actual reason why they go with this route and i think and this is just a theory i think because i've been thinking about this for the past few days right like why this doesn't make sense it doesn't add up i think it's because they're actually sidelining these phones i think that the galaxy s phones and the note phones are being pushed slowly over time to the side in favor of their foldables where they're spending a lot more of their r d money over they're spending more effort to make their foldables a thing that's just a theory but it just makes sense because if you look at the innovations that we've been seeing in the flat slab screen phones over the past few years and it's considering that samsung makes a lot of the stuff right they make the ram modules that go in these things they make the socs with their excellence chips they make the screens like they have the tech to make this stuff way better if they wanted to they don't have to put 1080p panels into these things there's no way they need to but they're doing it with intent because i really think the foldables is where they want to be because that's just that's what they see as the future now this is just a theory but i want to know someone who watches me must have a sound theory as to what on earth is going on because i want to know in three years time the s24 when it drops what is that gonna look like is it plastic mid-range stuff like the s20 fe which was an awesome value or do you think it'll be more like the traditional galaxy s with a more premium lineup let me know hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
