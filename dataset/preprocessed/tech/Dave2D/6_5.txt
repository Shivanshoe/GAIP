i was sent the newly announced snapdragon chip to test out today this is the snapdragon 8 gen 1 plus and it's in this prototype asus phone now the chip in here is the most powerful android chip that's available on the market it's their flagship chip like the snapdragon 8 gen 1 just amped up the design on this prototype phone is really cool to me so it's got this nice blue iridescence to it the camera's been blacked out with a piece of glass and it says confidential equipment so we can't do any kind of camera testing and there's a clear or translucent back panel to it so you can see the internals and there's also an rgb light on the side that comes on you can change the colors but this device even though it's like technically not a retail model i would love to see something like this come out because it just looks so good so i want to download some benchmarks here to test out this chip so i'm going to get geekbench the classic but there's a whole bunch of other stuff i want to test the gpu and stuff uh 3dmark i really want to see how this chip does compared to all the other flagships out there including the previous snapdragon 801 regular okay here we go damn 41.75 i didn't think it'd go over 4 000 but i should actually plug this up to perf dog on the computer because i want to see how much energy is being consumed on this test i also think that that was one of the big issues with regular snapchat in hn1 right it sucked up a lot of juice does this new one perform better okay we're good to go i have perf dug running on the laptop i have geekbench 5 about to be run on the phone i just want to see how much juice does this thing draw when it does the test so in terms of energy consumption it looks like this new chip pulls very similar wattage to the regular snapdragon 81 but you're just getting way better performance for that wattage i do want to test the gpu though 2803 that's actually a pretty good score but what's more interesting to me is that the power consumption was noticeably less than the regular snapdragon 801 running that same test so that's an improvement uh i do want to test out some games because really that's the that's the thing that i think you're going to notice the biggest difference in when it comes to phone performance we're going to start with gentian impact because it's a very demanding game every phone out there including iphones and the previous version of this phone they'll have like dips in performance as you play like i don't know 20 minutes in let's see how this one does [Music] okay there is a very clear difference between this new chip and the regular snapdragon 8 gen 1. this does not throttle as aggressively as the regular chip so with the regular snapdragon 801 iphones were significantly better when in terms of like sustaining a high frame rate this can keep up with the new iphone 13. uh okay i want to check other games because genshin as good of a game as it is is not the only game out there so i'm going to test some other stuff you know i'll get apex this came out recently i've never tried it but i'll give that a shot and i'll throw call of duty mobile on it because that is a pretty popular game i don't think it's particularly demanding though but we should test it anyways i'm pretty sure i'm going up against bots because this is way too easy so yeah no surprise both of those games run perfectly fine on this device it's just i don't think those games are demanding enough to really push this chip i do think that because both of them are capped at 60 frames per second like that's the limiting reagent right if you could go beyond 60 frames like 90 or even 120 frames per second then maybe be able to see what this chip could do but that's just the nature of a lot of mobile games right now maybe in the near future there's no spider-man games no official spider-man games just filled with rope hero rope man let me just see this rope hero there were like six of those games [Applause] oh my goodness these none of these are actually spider-man they're just like rope hero vice town [Music] look look at this guy look at him he's like spider-man but he's like the derpy spider-man oh my goodness he flies we got to get this it's a knockoff of spider-man and gta in one game there's so many of these oh my god spider hero rope hero game look at this oh my god how are they getting away with this as long as they don't have the spider-man logo they're good to go okay let's check this out this is so bad but so good meet the tipsy [Applause] i just got punched in the face with a tick-tock ad of course what what else would i expect from rope hero okay hey dude come closer i need your help more ads are you kidding okay i can't play any more of this this is the best game ever okay so there you have it um this is the snapdragon 8 gen 1 plus i'd love to show you more of the inside but apparently i can't show any of that to you like the ui and stuff but uh yeah fast chip more energy efficient excellent gaming performance especially rope hero vice city i don't even think it's vice city it's like vice tower that's that's you should keep that whole thing i don't think it's right
