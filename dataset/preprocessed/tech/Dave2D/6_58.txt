all right so this is the triton 500 se from acer now a couple years ago when they launched their original triton 500 it was a pretty special device it was one of the first good thin gaming laptops that you could get in the market they've revamped the product it's had this whole new refresh a whole new look and well i was very drawn to this so they showed a pre-production version of this thing earlier this year and i looked at the color i looked at the specs i'm like that looks cool but this does not look like the pre-production unit it had a badge in the top left corner and it just looked like a completely different top panel this is still a nice looking device but if you were drawn to that original kind of aesthetic of that pre-production unit i don't know where that is because it's it's not this thing but this has this two-tone finish there's this kind of matte finish on the top with the predator logo up top and then on the bottom half of it or the bottom section it's got this cross hatch material it is a metal finish but it's not i don't like this as much as that kind of as the photos in the marketing material the weird thing is though on their website they're still showing that picture so maybe in certain regions or something but this is what the retail units look like this kind of aesthetic there's some exhausts in the back that look somewhat gamery but overall very nice design all right so let's start off on the inside here so you pop this thing open you're greeted with a massive reflection uh but you're looking at a 16 by 10 aspect ratio screen with thin bezels and i think one of the bigger complaints people had about the previous tritons was that big chin at the bottom it's no longer there and it's a nice screen it's fast it's bright it's color accurate it's an awesome screen but one other thing that i thought was strange in the earlier marketing material again there was mention of g-sync and there's also mention of advanced optimus neither of which seem to be present in this model granted this is the rtx 3060 version so it's possible that the higher spec configurations have it but if you see this one the rtx 360 the one that's available at best buy for i think 1500 bucks whatever it does not seem to have it just put it out there okay so the performance on this device is good but i kind of want to put an asterisk beside that word this is running the rtx 3060 at 105 watts so a pretty powerful gpu nothing super crazy and it's also only the 11 800h a powerful 8 core cpu from intel now all of it is packaged in a very thin 20 millimeter chassis and when you have a device that is this thin you have to take things into consideration right you can't just crank it at full tilt and the way that they've achieved good performance and you saw the numbers they're good right but in order to hit those numbers you have to use a pretty powerful fan system a pretty loud fan system now normally when i record videos i don't have the fans running because i want to keep it as quiet as possible right i don't want to have the fan noise while i'm talking and this system can have a quiet fan system if you so choose but if you want to get good performance out of it the best performance out of it let it rip it rips it's loud and i would say that this is one of the loudest thin devices i've seen now you don't have to run it at the max fan speed to be able to get good performance like on this particular configuration with the 3060 you can you can dial the fans back in the software and you get great performance with a quieter system but keep in mind this is just the 3060. if you get one of the higher spec configurations like a 3070 3080 or you get the top spec cpu you will be dependent on faster fans and potentially the turbo button pretty frequently so it's just something to keep in mind now bring this up because this system is very dependent on fast fans to be able to cool it effectively some companies are using different thermal compounds like liquid metals or polymer phase shifting stuff and other companies have like vapor chambers there are a lot of other solutions that companies have deployed that don't require a high fan speed or as as high of a fan speed that allow it to cool it in a similar manner plus the fact that it's running intel chips that do need they need more aggressive cooling built to keep the temperatures at a more acceptable range and that's what you have now personally i don't mind it but this is just a very personal perspective right everyone's very different on this stuff i like quiet systems but because i can control it so granularly in software i'm very happy with the system they've deployed but you should be aware of what you're getting yourself into if you're actually looking at this particular device okay let's talk about the keyboard so this is a keyboard layout that i think is very similar to the original triton 500 keyboard i think it's a layout that most people would like however i will say that the typing experience is a little bit softer or mushier like the keys they're they're responsive but they're not as springy as some of their gaming laptops out there but i'm gonna bring out this device because i think i think if you're looking at the triton 500 se you might be looking at like the legion devices as well so this is the legion seven i don't know if i did a full review on this thing i want to say i didn't it's a good device i just ran out of time but very similar in price point very similar in idea right this has a number pad and you can't get it without a number pad like if you're gonna get a legion it's got a number pad trackpad it's right below your wasd even with all the palm detection it you're just clicking it frequently plus you're right to the edge of the device right this is a more natural it's just a better feel to me i like the way this thing feels when you're playing games when you're typing it just feels more natural to me plus i don't use the number pad very often i love so much about the legion devices this year but the number pads are they're just not for me but this guy 500 sc no number pad but it doesn't have the best kind of like tactility on the keys neither of them are perfect keyboards but i just bring that up because it's just like if you're interested in one you're probably interested in the other okay uh the trackpad this is a very small trackpad i don't love the size of it there's a fingerprint sensor on the top left of it it's functional and it does its job but the trackpad itself is good glass surface nice click very accurate i like it and you also get your rgb backlighting on the keyboard but keep in mind that it's a three zoned backlighting not individually lit but those are the inputs they are as i have described now on the sides we have an sd card reader it's got two thunderbolt 4s which are used to connect the drives it's got an ethernet port which i use regularly it's got the single earphone jack which i much prefer over the double of the old one and it's got this blue strip up here which i personally like it changes colors like depending on the angle that you have it in like sometimes it's purple sometimes it's green sometimes it's blue it's like this iridescent finish but it's this nice little aesthetic trim that i'm into but this is a really like for me personally and it's a very personal thing i like this device but it was hard for me to remove my brain from what i liked about this device from what i think the average person would see in this device which is difficult right i think that if you're a creative and you use like the ports and the thunderbolt 4 stuff then yeah it's it's a really cool device but i think if you're just a regular gamer there's other devices that are better than this for just straight up gaming uh but yeah uh oh insides haven't gone in there yet let's talk about that should i turn this off before i do it now let's just go in dudes let's just go in while it's running probably gonna break something uh okay so we have a big battery i like this 99.9 watt hours and it's a comfortable six and a half hours of battery life on this thing with the screen at 250 nits if you want a thin gaming laptop that has a big battery like the biggest size possible there's not that many options this is one of them the wi-fi card is removable the motherboard however is flipped if you want to replace the ram there's two slots in here but you'd have to do a pretty extensive disassembly to get into the ram slots and same with re-pacing if you want to re-paste you'd have to pop the whole motherboard out to be able to do that but it is serviceable it's just not the easiest thing to do and the speakers down here you know how i complain about gaming laptop speakers pretty frequently they're like oh they're not great these are like the epitome of not great they're really not great but what do you expect it's a gaming laptop all right um i think that basically wraps up this device i like it but it's this base model configuration that i'm drawn to the most with the rtx 3060 and that 15 1600 price point it's a good overall package and it looks good right nice gray with the blue can't go wrong with this color okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time you
