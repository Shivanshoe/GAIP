[Music] all right so in front of me are a bunch of iphone things on this side we have some of the iphone 12 family but then on this side we have four of these iphone models that are supposed to represent the upcoming iphone so either the iphone 13 or 12 s whatever they end up calling it now when i got these devices in my first reaction was they're cool right there's some aesthetic differences between the upcoming stuff compared to last year's model but i didn't want to do a dedicated video in it because the visual differences as interesting as they are they're relatively mild right but then i saw this report on bloomberg mark german very reputable apple leaker he's stating that apple's requesting 90 million units of the iphone 13 to be made that's a very significant bump up from their regular request so normally they go for about 75 million which is a lot of iphones already but they are confident they have the the intrinsic belief that they're going to sell a lot more of these new iphones than they have in the past now there's a couple theories as to why this is happening right so there's i've seen theories of like you know the post pandemic time period maybe people want to buy stuff right so the retail therapy of buying a new iphone or maybe the whole idea of like the the second generation of a 5g device from apple people might want that but when i look at the rumored spec list of these new phones the one feature that jumps out to me is the 120 hertz display on the iphone 13 pro and the iphone 13 pro max so these are rumored to have these 120 hertz oled panels with ltpotech it's pretty interesting stuff but what makes it special what makes it really special is that people that are in this ecosystem like the people that are deeply entrenched in the apple ecosystem which is a lot of people they've never seen a high refresh screen on a phone before a lot of them right obviously if you're watching this video even if you're an iphone user you're a tech enthusiast you've at least heard of a high refresh screen maybe you've had the privilege of seeing one maybe even own one if you're an android user there's a reasonable chance that you have a high refresh screen on your phone because they've been around for years or if you're a gamer pc gamer you've seen high refresh screens but there's a huge huge chunk of the apple ecosystem users that have never seen that before ever they may not even heard of it before and when they see this in a store when they see a high refresh screen in a store it's a it's a whole new experience like think of phones and the way that apple tries to market things and try to sell you things new a new product every year it's hard they have a crack marketing team they're amazing at it but even then it is a really difficult job to sell you a new iphone because the differences between the the old one and the new one every year they're subtle you have to you have to sell it right it's got this feature it's faster it's got this new color this new design there's a whole bunch of things that make new iphones better to the perceived market but it's not super super obvious what is obvious is a screen you see a high refresh screen for the first time it's like whoa that's that's that's that's new that is a fast phone that is something that my old phone didn't do couldn't do that's a better phone now i still remember the first time i saw a high refresh panel on a smartphone it was the razer phone in 2017 i think wait yeah 2017 and it was so weird to see something so fast so fluid so responsive in a smartphone and this is coming from someone that had access to gaming desktops right i'd played on high refresh screens or higher refresh screens but to go from a 60 hertz phone to a 90 hertz phone back in 2017 was was quite the experience and now apple users of goods i think a large chunk have never seen this type of tech before they're going to go from 60 hertz to 120 hertz overnight and they're gonna see it on in a store or maybe like they pick up the device and it's going to be a it's going to be a very compelling reason for them to be interested in this phone and the other thing even if they've seen the ipads like the you know the pro motion ipads 120hz displays those are ips panels there's ghosting on that stuff right oled panel zero millisecond response time it's a whole new experience and i think that is the reason why apple is pushing those bigger numbers because people are going to be interested in this thing in a way that they haven't ever been for years when it came to a new iphone now some other new features include a smaller notch on the front so the front screen has a slightly smaller notch and an earpiece that supposedly moved up just above its original position and the whole kind of camera system for face id is shrunken down to fit into that smaller space and the battery's supposed to be a little bit bigger i'm assuming to support that high refresh screen even with ltpotech it's going to draw more juice and the device is supposed to be slightly thicker than the previous models of the iphone 12 but the biggest difference is the camera system at least from the visuals so just starting off with the regular let's look at these so this is the iphone 12 the iphone 12 mini and they're still making apparently an iphone 13 mini if you look at the camera array of the upcoming iphone you can see the diagonal layout of the cameras as opposed to the vertical layout from the previous generation and it's supposedly to make room for some bigger components so apparently they're bringing in that sensor shift technology over from the iphone 12 pro max like that ability to move the sensor around not just the lenses but the actual sensor to deal with uh just like their version of optical image stabilization it's like a more improved more efficient manner of it and they're bringing that across the line and i think that's supposedly the reason why they're having this kind of diagonal camera orientation but the big one to me is like this chunky camera system on the iphone 13 pro and the iphone 13 pro max and these are big like if you compare them to the previous iphone 12 pro max like this already had a large camera system right i'm just going to clear these out of the way this was a big camera system i looked at this and i was like that's that's big you compare it to well it's compared to this the supposed iphone 13 pro max that is a huge difference in camera cluster and even more interestingly is that the iphone 13 pro like the regular size iphone 13 pro it has the exact same cluster size as the pro max which is unlike what we saw last year so if you looked at the 12 pro max to the 12 pro like the 12 pro had a smaller camera cluster but this year supposedly they're rocking the same size and this is what has been kind of confirmed by case manufacturers they're saying that they're the same kind of camera cutout now last year when i did my iphone 12 family of reviews one of the things that i was standing i think this was a sentiment felt by a lot of reviewers is that the difference between the 12 and the 12 pro wasn't massive like there was a lot of stuff that was so good about the 12 that it made it quite difficult for people to recommend at 12 pro unless you really cared about having a zoom lens on your phone because that third lens that zoom lens was really the biggest difference between the iphone 12 and the iphone 12 pro but this year in the iphone 13 series it looks like there's going to be a big difference between the pro and the non-pro phones like we're talking the like the fast refresh screen we're talking a completely different camera system between the 13 and the 13 pro it seems like if they if they're charging pro money on this you can be darn sure that they will but i think there will be more differences between them to desegregate the the the the pleb line and the pro line uh but yeah so this is i mean this is what this is what we have to look forward to a new phone from apple of course it's gonna be a new phone from apple but um yeah this i just want to share this with you right i just had some thoughts on this and my question is what do you think like you see that number 75 million units normally and they're bumping it up to 90 million what's your guess as to why because there's there's got to be a reason it can't just be like we we hope but we're going to sell them so we'll just make them now they they really believe they're going to sell them is that the thing is the screen the reason you think that's gonna that's gonna take it off all right that's it hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time you
