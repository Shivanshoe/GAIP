okay so i wanted to make a tier list of all the gaming mice that i used this year so all of these are mice that i either purchased this year or was sent to me this year and if you've never used or seen a tier list before it's basically a way to sort out or categorize things right so you just have a pile of stuff and you just put them into the different categories from the best to the worst category but the thing to keep in mind is that just because i place a mouse into the worst tier which would be a tier d it doesn't mean that it's a terrible mouse for everyone it just means that i personally didn't like it so i try to explain why i place each mouse into their respective categories but it's a very opinion-based video this is not like some master technical review of these mice it's just a very light-hearted fun thing and i really think that you guys will have different tier lists than me this is just the way that these things work right okay let's begin so the first mouse is the razer deathadder v2 pro and i would place this right in the middle a b this is a mouse that isn't it i don't have strong feelings about this either way it's not a great mouse to me it's not a terrible match to me it's a very generic high quality wireless mouse this is if i'm not mistaken at least razer markets it to be the world's most popular gaming mouse because it's you know they've sold millions of these things because it's such an old shape but i don't like it because well it's shaped i don't like uh like right hand only or left hand only mice like i like my ambidextrous shape mice and this is a really large mouse it's just like it flares out a lot at the tips and it's just a very high mouse i don't love this thing but it's a it's a solid b so in the b category it goes the next mouse is the logitech g pro x super light so this is a mouse that super popular i think most people making tier lists on these types of mice would probably place it as an s or an eight tier most likely an s here personally me i'm going to place that as an a tier because this is a micro usb based mouse this thing should have been charged with usbc and they could have done it right so many other logitech devices use usb-c and this is their high-end like premium gaming mouse it should have been used pc it isn't and i think they did it with intent that's why it deserves being a if they couldn't you know they were like struggling to make this thing fit a particular budget and they had to right then it would still be nested here but no they could have done it but they i feel like they intentionally put it as micro usb to make people buy the future usbc version of this mouse that's just my take on it but it's a really good mouse and i wish i could place it as an s tier especially because it's white matte white it's a sick mouse but it's an a tier i'm sorry at least yeah it deserves being eights here maybe we'll bump it up to the s but it's an a uh next is the air rox three this is a this should have been a better mouse i feel like this was a excellent idea of a mouse like they they got a lot of stuff right and keep in mind that this was a mouse that they kind of you know they kind of hopping onto the train of the perforated mice with ultra light weights this should have been an a tier or possibly even an s to your mouse like i just feel like they screwed up on one really big thing with this mouse it was the feet so these feet are terrible like the skates on the mouse if you are into gaming mice you'll understand the the kind of importance of good skates and they just have terrible skates to the point where i've been using this for about a month at this point and they're flat like they're worn down to the same level as the plastic so now when i'm using my mouse pad or any kind of mousing surface it's starting to make noises which is crazy this is a one month old mouse so i don't even think it deserves being the beats here like let's be real here this let's place it in c for now i mean otherwise the hardware is fantastic it's just they really screwed up the the skates on this thing you know what it's a b tier because i feel like you could fix it if you wanted to you get third-party skates or like replacement stuff and you could fix it but that's a b tier for me okay next we have uh the razer basilisk so this is okay so this is a wired version of this mouse let me show real quick on camera they had a new one this year this one is actually a much older version but they have a wireless basilisk pro or something they have now i have a very strong opinion about this mouse i've never purchased them i don't like this mouse and it because it's because well they copied so there was a mouse called the logitech g502 it was a very popular mouse at the time and it's something that i enjoyed using and because it was doing so well because so many people enjoyed using that mouse they straight up copied the shape of the g502 and they called it the basilisk and i that kills me like i feel like this was not their mouse shape to to do that to it you know this is a very personal opinion right obviously tons of people like the basilisk and if i'm being completely neutral and not being you know brand loyal or anything like that i would actually say that razer did a better job with this shape than logitech did right they have a better mouse overall but they straight up stole the design of the mouse they straight up stole the shape and in it in the attempt of trying to take the the user base right we have a mouse shaped just like the g502 come buy our mouse instead some people don't care about that stuff i do i hate copycats i hate them so for me basilisk ranksy ranksy it's a good mouse it's technically a very good mouse but it's it's spawned from from thievery so rank c okay next up we have the glorious model d this is their new mouse for this year the new wired mouse for this year i'd place it as a probably a b tier i don't like the shape like i feel like for people that do like that type of mouse shape they probably love this mouse it's well priced really good performance but because i don't love the shape i'm placing it as a b uh again it's one of those mice that i don't have a lot of opinion like a strong opinion on right i've used it a bunch but it's just like a generic kind of perforated mouse i do want to say something about the perforation though i feel like this whole like the the holes on mice this is just like it's a trend right clearly it's something that's hot right now over the past couple of years and well they hopped onto that wagon but i don't really like perforated mice so it's a b tier for me next up we have their wireless model this is the glorious model o wireless i'd place this as an a tier number one it's well it's uh what do they call it ambidextrous so i love that whole i like this mouse shape but this deserves special mention because of its pricing so this you know what i think this deserves being an s tier this will be the first s tier for now even though i don't love the perforation i think that because of the pricing and because of how good the performance is and they this is a company that listens to their fan base they listen to gamers and they kind of pick out what is important what is unimportant and they make their products based on seemingly user feedback but yeah this is a solid s tier it's got all the lights and stuff but notice how i don't mention anything about rgb's because i don't care about that stuff it doesn't affect me but this is an s to your mouse the first one yeah all right next up another s to your mask this is well i have the wrong one here but it's the same idea this is the white viper ultimate the one in the photo is the black one this is my favorite mouse this year um especially the white one but this was done so well and unlike their copycat child the basilisk mouse this was their original ip this was their own idea awesome mouse and it fits perfectly awesome performance great color good skates it's a it's a banger so for me this is clearly a s-tier mouse i just wish that i'd gotten the proper photo and gotten the the white one in there they also make the yellow one if you've seen it in my cyberpunk video they have a fully yellow tricked out cyberpunk version of this mouse as well but s tier okay next up this straight up d tier so this okay so this mouse was sent to me uh sometime in the summer i think and they're they're like you're gonna be the first person with this mouse please do a review for it it's awesome we're gonna change the face of gaming and it was a mouse that had a fan built into it and the idea of it sounds cool right a a mouse that has a fan to blow cool air onto your palm while you're gaming gets rid of the sweat it's a great idea except it was so poorly implemented so this is a very loud fan it's annoying when you play in games it's got vibration when you're playing games and if you just crank up the fan and you don't even move the mouse it'll move like the mouse just sitting there the reticle moves because of the vibration of the fan this is a terrible idea i feel like this is not the first company that's tried it several people have tried or several companies have tried to make mice with some kind of fan implemented into it you guys have to stop trying because it's not going to work that's a strong hard d for me all right okay next we have um the logitech i put this as an a tier mouse so this is a wired mouse they call it the light something light sync g203 light sync it lights up and it's a white colored mouse this is an excellent excellent mess it's on sale for like 20 bucks right now like during the holiday season this is a very inexpensive mess excellent sensor great performance if i'm not mistaken a lot of professional gamers used to use this mouse before they like got sponsored by the different brands and stuff i think shroud used to use this thing as well so excellent mouse highly recommend it 20 came out in 2020. okay uh two left this one oh this this one has a little bit of a story so this is the master mouse 711 from cooler master i'd place this in it's a b tier it should be an a tier if they tweaked a couple things but i would consider this a b-tier mess so this mouse is uh well there's two things i want to draw attention to number one it's the one and only mouse i have here that's a glossy white plastic like this should not be a thing mice should always be a matte material because it just has the least kind of grease effects right when you have shiny plastic and your hand gets a little bit greasy and you it becomes very slippery mouse their black version is matte black but for whatever reason they're white material is shiny plastic oh well um now the story behind it though is that this is a mouse made by cooler master and a couple years ago i did a video on one of the keyboards i forget the name of the keyboard but i didn't like the keyboard and i gave it a bad review i was had like you know early access to this thing and i said it was not a great keyboard because i'm honest in my videos and they were like they didn't like that obviously so when i asked them for the mouse they're like no you can't get a mouse so i had to buy this one but it's a good mouse rank b okay last mouse this one yeah it's an a it's not an s it's an a so this is the pwnage ultra custom and it's a really good mouse i don't place it as an s tier because i don't love the shape of it it's pretty big mouse and it's a right-handed mouse but if you're into those types of mice you're gonna like this one i feel like this mouse would be more popular if they spent more money on marketing dollars right they clearly don't sponsor you know like the twitch streamers and esports players but if they did i think this would be a really popular mouse it has a crazy amount of customizability you can pop off the back plate and switch it out to like the honeycomb material if you want to reduce the weight and have different colors and stuff it's a solid mouse it deserves to be an s tier if i like this mouse shape because it also has usbc charging and everything right they nail a lot of stuff on this thing but because of the shape it's an a tier and also i wish the software was less ugly it looks really cheap and sucky to me but the rest of the mouse is solid but that's basically my tier list i don't think i would want to shift anything on the last minute here maybe the air rox 3 like i'm disappointed in this thing yeah i'm going to put this as a c because everything else in the b tier is like is noticeably better it doesn't have good skates and if you're someone who spent that kind of money buying that mouse and it wore out after a month you'd be super disappointed so yeah i'm comfortable with putting with the c yeah beside the basilisk the thieving mouse okay that's my tier list i'm curious obviously you guys are gonna have different opinions on all this stuff obviously you guys are gonna have your favorite mouse how far away is this from your from your list what's your favorite mask let me know i wanna see in the comments okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
