[Music] okay so i've never really loved the camera systems on oneplus phones like they're good they're often really good for the money but they're never great camera systems except for the oneplus 8 pro this was the first and only camera system to date that i feel was a truly great camera system that came from oneplus now recently the company's come forward saying that their oneplus 9 and oneplus 9 pro camera systems were developed in partnership with hasselblad the famous swedish camera company that sent their camera to the moon to take pictures of the lunar landing it is a iconic photograph that i think most of you have seen but in terms of how it's relevant to smartphones we're about to find out so recently the company as well as the ceo of the company pete lau have been putting stuff on twitter and on their social media pages these like pictures and comparative photos of what their new camera system is capable of and i want to talk about that so in this tweet here they're drawing attention to the ultra wide capabilities of the oneplus 9 series and you have one photo from a regular ultrawide lens from a competing smartphone and then you have a second photo from one of the oneplus 9 phones so the difference is pretty obvious right the new ultrawide lens heavily reduces that whole fish-eyed bowing of the image now as someone who uses the ultrawide lens a lot on his phone that's pretty cool like i don't mind the fisheye i actually think that in certain shots it gives this kind of dynamic action vibe to it but there are other times when you're shooting landscapes or buildings or scenes with a lot of straight lines in it and having that distortion kind of ruins the image now oneplus had a whole bunch of shots taken on their new ultrawide and i can't tell whether these are taken with the oneplus 9 or the oneplus 9 pro and also can't tell how much post editing has been done in these but they do look nice and more importantly they are seemingly distortion free which is pretty neat coming from a smartphone camera now the way that they're doing it is through a freeform lens on the imx 766 sensor so this lens can correct the distortion before it even hits the sensor which is kind of neat and if you look at those images it seems pretty convincing now the second thing we've talked about is their new custom sensor that they've made for the main like the flagship sensor the imx 789 it's the successor to the sensor that was in this thing and it's supposedly custom made specifically for the oneplus 9 series and this sensor is supposed to be stacked it can shoot 4k video at 120 frames per second it can shoot 12-bit raw images and it has sony's new digital overlap hdr which is supposed to be really fast where they're taking two exposures at the same time or almost the same time and they're able to merge it into one really clean image but because it's super fast they're able to use that same tech in video now supposedly we'll have to see but if you've noticed none of this has anything to do with hasselblad yet like this stuff is hardware and i don't think it's dependent on their partnership with hasselblad as an even if they didn't have that partnership they'd still have access to these new sensors and new lenses so where does hasselblad really come into play here like what are they actually doing in this partnership and i think the answer lies in software particularly in color so in their original media statement they mentioned that they had worked with hasselblad to develop some new color science for their camera systems and that's important but i don't know how valuable that really is when it comes to the oneplus camera systems like it's not like their colors were terrible to begin with right i will say that there have been issues like especially when it comes to switching lenses even the oneplus 8 pro had this issue like if you're switching between like the zoom lens and the wide and the ultra wide there is like a slight color shift between them like some are more pink some are more green and i'm assuming that this partnership can resolve issues like that but color it's important but this was a very expensive investment and there's a part of me that worries or at least wonders how much of that 150 million is just for licensing right just for the ability or the privilege to be able to put hasselblad onto the back of your phone and the real question like the most important question you should be asking yourself as a consumer like once all the reviews are coming out and you're looking at this stuff like how much of this color science or how much of these improvements really matters to you as an individual because everyone's different on this stuff like i personally love the nightscape mode on the oneplus 8 pro i think this phone does it better than everybody else better than apple's iphones better than the pixels better than samsung's galaxy phones this phone has this uncanny ability to shoot that nighttime scene outside of my condo really nicely and i like it i like that stylized look that it gives but it's not for everybody and when it comes to colors because colors are a big part of this hasselblad partnership right now colors are very subjective some people like realistic looking images that are flatter some people like stuff to be more vibrant and more exaggerated or stylized and there's nothing wrong with that but there is a difference in people's tastes now me personally i think that this partnership is going to be i think it's going to be legit and it stems from this it stems from the attention right oneplus has intentionally drawn a lot of eyeballs to this partnership and if for whatever reason it's not legitimate and it's not it doesn't yield great results oneplus is gonna look like clowns straight up they're they know that right so i don't think they would have drawn as much attention as they did to this whole partnership unless they actually had something to show for it i hope it's going to be good i really think i should rephrase i hope that this is the year that oneplus goes from like right right where they've always been that kind of mid-tier good product to something that legitimately competes with the best of the smartphone cameras out there that would be pretty cool okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music] you
