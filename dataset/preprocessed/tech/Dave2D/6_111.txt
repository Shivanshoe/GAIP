all right so in 2020 we saw a lot of laptops to the point where this year i actually think we saw the most number of laptop choices available ever like there's just so many devices that companies were pumping out and i checked just before this video i was like how many devices did i get i was just curious 67 i was sent 67 laptops from various companies from 2020. it's just crazy now the truth is i didn't review most of them they go back in case you're wondering but i didn't review most of them for a couple reasons number one time it's just i had less time than normal this year but the big thing is that i think a lot of companies were just refreshing devices right there was like you know we we're gonna change it a little bit here's the new laptop for 2020 and i was i didn't want to review it the truth is i don't want to waste your time like that's the thing that's very precious right you guys are watching these videos i don't want to burn seven minutes of your time 10 minutes of your time making another video of something you saw last year with like a new color that's just not how i roll so i skipped a big portion of them however i wanted to do a video at the end of this year kind of ranking the devices just for my opinion what did i think of the devices as a as an overall product right so tier list time i wanted to do a tier list of these devices again from best to worst and this time is a little bit different i wanted to do a video just on the devices i was interested in right the stuff that i was interested in terms of like replacing my existing laptop or stuff that i was just drawn to because it was a cool product okay top of the list legion five so this is from lenovo i'm comfortable placing this as an a tier i think i may regret this but i feel like we're opening strong here legion five amd based laptop really well built for its price point i felt like this was one of very few devices out there amd based devices out there that was done properly so many companies tried to make a ryzen based gaming laptop and so many of them did a really poor job of it these guys did it well so it's an a tier for me uh next up nitro 5 from acer this is yeah i'm going to place it in a beer tier so there's two things that come to mind number one it's a red gaming laptop it's 20 20 that's like a dying fat they're still doing it maybe it's you know it's a marketing position so it's not the best looking device they have there but it's a red gaming laptop this was also ryzen based pretty well done i do think that it would be tough for acer to sell this thing alongside the rest of their devices if they made this device too good looking like they got to make it a little bit ugly so that the other devices they sell look better but yeah it's a it's a solid b tier for me so the g5 sc so this is from dell this is another one of the right we have a lot of ryzens to start here this was one of the few that had an amd graphics card to go alongside and they had this tech that kind of made the gpu and the cpu talk together to give like a little bit of boosted performance i would place this as yeah it's a beach here uh it doesn't do better because i remember this thing running hot like it's a dell device a lot of them do but this i feel like they could have cooled this little better uh yeah beats here okay legion 7i this is also from lenovo this was not as well done as the legion five i'm gonna put this as yeah i'm gonna put this as a seat here so okay it's an expensive device right these are these are intel base when you see the i it's an intel chip this was also expensive because it's like the more premium version the seven is higher than the five and also their pricing like lenovo's pricing is all over the place they have sales some days they have like overly inflated prices other days to make their sales look better it's just a weird pricing thing legion 7i c tier i also remember the thermals being kind of iffy on this device okay the rp so this is the rp15 from electronics a whole bunch of other kind of boutique brands sell similar device this is a member of the secret laptop club this was a really good device ryzen based and very inexpensive for the kind of hard i'd place this as an s tier if my memory serves me correct i would consider the rp15 to be single-handedly the best value high performance gaming laptop on the market right now like if you're trying to spend the best like the least amount of money for the highest possible frame rate this is probably the machine it's a really good one yeah it's a nest here i don't love the keyboard but i can kind of forgive it because the price is well done blade 15. this is the laptop that i probably use the most this year i wouldn't give it a nest here uh two things come to mind i feel like razer could have and should have done more with this year's iteration of it i think they changed the keyboard but aside from that the performance was kind of very similar not really through fault of their own like they you know they're working with intel and nvidia to kind of depend on them for their performance but they could have done stuff to make this thing a better iteration of a product also they got rid of the mercury white color for like the advanced model which i personally like that's why i still use the old one as well uh max 15. this is another device from electronics another uh what are they called secret laptop club device this goes in [Music] yeah it's an a tier for me not as good as the rp15 to me two things it gets hot to the point where it doesn't throttle it probably should throttle it gets that hot like these run weirdly hot and the fans are crazy loud on these devices because you can configure them so powerfully area 51m okay it's either a c or d i'm gonna place it in c so if you're unfamiliar with this device it's that big one that gigantic one from alienware uses two ac adapters the whole premise of the area 51m was that you could upgrade it right you have this gigantic laptop and you could swap out the parts with new ones a very rare thing to do with laptops right change the gpu change the cpu you couldn't actually do it though if you had last year's area 51m and you wanted to swap out the cpu and or gpu to this year's model they didn't work and it was just so disappointing so many customers bought that first generation one with the kind of hopes or intent of upgrading it and then they didn't allow it now i don't know how much of that was alienware's fault it could have been intel it could have been nvidia but for whatever reason this was one of the big kind of components big characteristics of this device and it just it didn't work out you could only upgrade it within the generation itself which was really weird but i respect what they were trying to do with the super powerful system so it's not a d tier it's a it's a c tier for me triton 500 this i'd say it's a c tier so this was one of those devices that was really lightly refreshed i loved last year's models like this blue color that looked really cool and i don't know they just tweaked it in this really unimpressive manner it was really good last year i would have given it like a b maybe even a tier last year but c tier this year the ge66 so this is from msi this i would place yeah it's an a tier this was one of the devices few devices that was heavily tweaked for this year like full-blown rgb system if you're into that but they just made a much better thinner lighter product than they had in the past so that's a really that's a good one xps 17. this was really cool s or a s yeah let's give it an s here well okay so yeah a tier i take that back so here's the thing xps 17 new design one of the best looking devices in the world right now right super big screen on a relatively small footprint like really thin bezels the thermal performance should be better now i know if people that watch my channel you're always about the thermals listen when you buy this kind of device you spend this kind of money you want it to be awesome like super awesome expensive but it just it just wasn't quite there to be an s tier for me but overall really good device the book 13 so this is from razer this is their new device c tier for me it just boils down to price this is way way too expensive for it to be any higher like i know razer devices are usually expensive and they have a very unique look it's a really well-made device but this is like you got to compete with so many devices when you're in like the 15 1600 point and for the performance you're getting on this thing you're paying for a very unique looking device and at this kind of money yeah seat here for me the omen okay s tier this was a huge surprise for me so omens in the past ever since i started this youtube channel i think in 2015 i tried my first hp omen it was hot it's like overheat central and every year it's just like oh you're the new woman surprise it throttles hard this year it didn't like at all big improvements i think they finally realized that people care about thermal performance on devices uh and it's just like a really well-made device i liked it a bit of a screen gap i remember this was like uh as a bit of an issue for some people but yeah it's a good one m17 this is a beat here so this is the big alienware m device like the kind of regular laptops but like the 17 inch one this should have better thermal performance than it does back to thermals it seems um okay so 17 inch device right big device you got a lot of room in there to do some crazy cool stuff to blow the heat off of it but they didn't really tweak the thermal stuff and alienware software sucks alienware if you watch this video you need to just completely revamp your software it's clunky it's buggy you guys need to fix that and you can i know you can okay blade pro this clean software relatively clean software so this i'd place as yeah i put it as an a tier yeah let's give it an eightier so this is a really nice device it's big it's powerful but the one thing i think that they do really well is that they make a device that takes acoustics into account and what i mean by that is that even though it's a big and powerful system when it's idling or even when you're doing light tasks the fans are super quiet which is like no one's doing that you know what though this is so expensive if i'm not mistaken this is like three four thousand dollars i'm gonna put it as a b tier because it doesn't quite jive in the a tier to be honest yeah it's a b tier but if like this is something that so few companies do right like let's say you have like right now i'm recording this video while running a laptop that's screen recording if this was a windows gaming laptop you'd hear the fan i'm using a macbook because they they know some people care about fan noise i'm screen recording you can't hear the system fan that's why i'm using a macbook but a lot of companies just they do that wrong and these guys do it right for a big powerful device okay the mech 15 also from electronics this is ah this is a b tier for me so this is also a member of the secret laptop club and it's a good performer but i really don't like the keyboard and it's like a mechanical one and i feel like they did it for like marketing things like oh we have a mechanical keyboard but it's just a really bad keyboard but again personal opinion this whole thing is opinion based so it's a b tier for me stealth 13. it's a b this is again really expensive but you know i feel like the value is a little bit better on the stealth than the book uh but it's a kind of mediocre device in terms of dollar to performance ratio but it's super unique if you want like a really small high performance well moderately high performance gaming laptop that's a 13-inch screen with high refresh screen that's it for you but you got to pay up ooh asus tough 15. d tier this was a ryzen device had high hopes for it this was like a really inexpensive amd gaming laptop i was like oh this is going to sell really well and it just had thermal issues up the butt it was really poor performing i don't know if i did a review on this thing i actually don't think i did but it was just weirdly hot considering how much space this thing had to cool it off properly yeah d tier for me and i don't think they fixed it i revisited it like several months after i got my initial review unit but yeah it was a it should have been better could have been better okay helios 300 a tier this last year was an s tier like asti it was an s tier and it was i mean it was so good last year it was again a device that they just tweaked so lightly they added some rgbs that's it right i feel like this should have been better uh and i think my biggest issue with the helios 300 is that they didn't drop the price as often as they did last year so they had sales in 2019 like black friday sales like sales when it was sale time helios 300 was consistently one of the best things you could buy this year they didn't do it they were just like we'll jack up the price and we'll keep it there so really good device just could have and should have been better zephyrus m this is a this is a bead tier for me this is a really cool color again i don't know if i made a video on it but it was one of the nice looking devices really clean really minimal look uh but performance was kind of middle of the road it was more it's mostly pricing that's what i was concerned about it should have been a cheaper device but yeah it was expensive creator 17 this is the one with the mini led uh display is really nice looking display i put it as an a tier i really wish that it was again a device that considered acoustics like i remember the fan at idle was like it would hum if you're buying something like this spending this kind of money and you're probably using a professional environment because you you know you're dealing with really good image quality and stuff it should have just been should have been a better acoustically designed device we got the legion 5i so just like the legion 5 but with an intel chip this is not an a tier this is a b tier because well it's intel's chip they run hotter they're more expensive everything bad well not bad everything worse than ryzen especially right now and that's the thing next year next year i think we're going to see a ton of really good high-end ryzen devices it's going to be the year of amd laptops prestige 14. [Music] this was reviewed earlier on in the year i don't remember that review all that well but i don't use it and if i and say i remember wanting to use this device as my personal device right because it's like a little bit smaller a little bit thinner than your average laptop 14 inch screen i remember it had a single fan it was like this device that had so much promise good gpu good cpu but because of the single fan it just choked a little bit yeah maybe a b but i would say c because they i know they could have put a double fan in there i remember yeah it's all coming back they could have they had the space they just didn't for whatever reason arrow 15. this was a good device it's kind of showing its age though like in terms of the design it's a b tier for me am i going to run a room like what happens when i err okay uh let's try this this would be another beat here to be completely honest this had a mechanical keyboard oh so it stacks okay uh this was had a mechanical keyboard really good mechanical keyboard everybody who tries a mechanical keyboard fails in terms of uh gaming laptops they all think hey we got a mechanical keyboard go buy it it's awesome no one does it right these guys are closest i wouldn't say it's a perfect mechanical gaming keyboard but it feels distinctly mechanical and it's a nice keyboard so it's a b tier good thermal performance too i remember the m15r3 this this was improved this year improved enough though to be an age here it's definitely not an s tier i put it as a b tier only because i know dell can do better i know they can do better plus their janky software yeah solid b they can do better next year i just k you know what would win straight up an m15 with an amd chip in it that would crush that would just absolutely crush better thermals lower price everybody wins except maybe intel they don't win g14 this is an s tier 100 this single-handedly best laptop this year this was you know if i had awards this would win it best laptop of the year okay so if you're unfamiliar with the g14 it's a gaming laptop had a ryzen chip in it great performance and it was small and it was just awesome and it had that like cool micro led or not micro led these little leds on the back of the display panel so you could like light them up and do cool things and show memes is the best okay 13 inch macbook pro um this has i'm assuming this yeah this is gonna be the m1 equipped ones yeah it's an eight here and i would consider using this thing like if it had more storage and if it was i guess a little bit better for for what i do i would use it it's really good and it's like m1 they're like the apples chips are just they're on another level right now they're gonna fire up real soon the gs66 so this is from msi this would be a a tier or b tier i really like this device i played a lot of apex on this machine because it had the 300 hertz display panel this is really good uh i'd give it an eight tier just trying to think is there anything i disliked about it you guys are going to go back to my review and call me out on something but i'm going to place it as an a tier because my memory doesn't pop up any red flags when i look at this device it was a nice looking device and they tweaked it enough that i would consider it like a proper refresh so it's an a-tier the 16-inch macbook pro uh beats here so they fixed a whole bunch of stuff this year they got rid of the butterfly keyboards they got a nice screen uh decent thermals considering how thin that thing is they're just so freaking expensive and and we're all waiting on m1 we want some kind of apple silicon-based 16-inch macbook pro because that's going to be on another level the zephyrus s i'm not even sure if that's a zephyrus s in the picture but uh this is a b tier for me this is a very expensive machine so asus they have the zephyrus that's like their premium zephyrus and it opens up in the back to vent out the air and actually works it's actually really cool but it's got this weirdly expensive price tag that's associated with this product every year and in the beginning when they first came out with it like the very first zephyrus s was like the thinnest gaming laptop ever no one else did anything like it but at this point in 2020 a lot of companies are making thin powerful gaming laptops and this just doesn't stick out as much as it used to but the price tag is still nasty high so it's a b tier for me xps 15 i put it as a b tier it could be an a tier if the thermals on this thing were better so this one does not have a vapor chamber the xps 17 does thank god i ranked it a little bit higher uh but yeah it is it just performs a little bit worse in thermals and look at that spread man it's like a three s tiers one d i'm just going to go these real quick just to make sure i didn't screw something up i think these are all right though yeah i'm just looking at like the a's and c like yeah this looks good i'm satisfied with this list the s tiers rp15 definitely like just best value for your money for a gaming laptop right now if you want something really high end if you want like the bleeding edge performance for games rp-15 delivers it at a very reasonable price omen 15 much improved just it's a nest here for me and of course g14 so that's my list now i know this is going to differ vastly from what you guys would do right i feel like everyone's got a very different opinion on how this stuff plays out but yeah this is mine i'm curious what are your as to your laptops i'm actually going to check out the comments pretty heavily this video i just want to see what would you guys consider an s-tier laptop doesn't have to be a gaming laptop just stuff that you would want to use okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
