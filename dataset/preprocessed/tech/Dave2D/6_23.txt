oh boy we got a good one today so this is a laptop that is such a big generational leap from the previous stuff that this is most likely faster than the gaming desktop that you have at home it's incredibly powerful so this is the new msi ge76 and what makes it so special and so powerful is three things number one it's running intel's new 12th gen alder lake laptop cpus two it's running nvidia's new rtx 3080 ti these are both the fastest components you can get out there right now for laptops and three msi has a new phase change liquid metal to cool this thing it's a compound little transition between a solid form and a liquid form and it helps to keep the temperatures down in the system so let's start off with the cpu first these new cpus are incredibly fast so over the past couple of years we've seen some chips from amd and apple that were designed to compete with intel stuff and it's just been so much better than what intel's had to offer and i've been recommending amd's chips instead of intel from gaming laptops for a while but this year intel just came out swinging super hard this new laptop chip is so fast it's nutty it honestly destroys the previous generation of mobile chips it beats amd's 5000 series stuff it beats apple stuff it's just super fast it's faster than most intel and amd desktops now it does run ddr5 memory and it's hard to tell how much of that performance bump comes from the memory versus the actual chip itself but based on what i've seen with desktop versions of this stuff it's alder lake's chips that are doing most of the heavy lifting the ddr5 memory is nice but because they have different pin layouts on the memory modules i can't just swap out the ddr5 with ddr4 to test now this is a cpu that has 14 cores it's got six performance cores and eight efficiency cores and the system will designate the different core activity based on what you're trying to do so if you're playing games or using apps that can take advantage of lots of cores and fast cores this is going to be a big generational leap from the previous stuff now we need to talk about heat and energy consumption in a bit we'll get there but i want to talk about the gpu first because it all kind of ties in so this is also running a new graphics component it's the rtx 3080 ti which msi is feeding 175 watts in this system now this machine comes with a ridiculously fast 360 hertz 1080p panel it's a gaming screen like a competitive gaming screen it's a very fluid display now games are obviously going to run faster with this new cpu and gpu combination right sometimes we're getting performance bumps that are fairly significant other times less so it really depends on the game but there's a couple things you should keep in mind number one lower resolution gaming is always going to lean more heavily on the cpus you're going to see the biggest gains there but secondly i don't have access to other devices with these components in it right so i can't really tell how much of those gains are coming from the cpu or from the gpu itself it's kind of hard to gauge at this point we'll have to see more reviews down the line now when i take a look at creative workflows this laptop is an incredible performer it's fast with 3d work it's super fast with video work like the render times that i got out of this machine were the fastest i've ever seen in a laptop like this can almost keep up with that machine back there that desktop that's a 12 900k with a 3080 ti i built it a couple months ago super fast machine this is not that far off from that performance it's kind of wild now i will say one thing if you compare this to the m1 max equipped macbook pro the macbook has better playback performance in adobe premiere apple's m1 max has an awesome media playback engine and outperforms everything out there including desktops but in terms of render time this thing just crushes what apple has to offer right now but the elephant in the room is energy consumption so on a device like this you have to wonder how are they pulling it off how are they able to get such amazing scores and well the big thing is energy it's feeding a lot of watts to that chip and like all cpus the more wattage you give it the more heat it'll give off so with max wattage and max fan speed you get the best possible performance it's loud but you get big numbers but if you set the system to the balance mode which is a much quieter system and much more energy efficient setting this still gives you amazing performance that is where the impressive numbers are in that balance mode where you get great performance without any heat and noise and high energy consumption that previous generations of intel chips required so i want to move this conversation over to battery life because i did a slightly more extensive battery testing with this device than i do normally because it's a whole new architecture right what does intel's 12th gen chip do for battery so okay when you do my regular loops like just uh website loops it's decent battery life but only a little bit better than last year's model and the same would apply for streaming if you compare it to previous generation stuff it's similar and kind of to be expected but where it did notice a difference was when you push the system hard like if you're playing games or you're doing any kind of application and you're not plugged in you get a significant bump up in battery life than the previous 11th gen stuff now i don't know how much of that is because of intel's new chip or if it's because msi made some tweaks between last year's model and this year and they're somehow able to optimize the energy use i'm not entirely sure but there is a noticeable difference between this model and last year's model but if i had to guess it is that chip it's just a little more energy efficient when you push the system hard now it's not as energy efficient as apple's m1 max and m1 pro products these are like the kings of efficiency but this delivers top-end performance as well like if you want the best possible performance throw in the wattage cool it properly and you get crazy numbers you get desktop numbers it's that good apple can't do that amd can't do that i don't even think their new stuff will be able to do it but this is an amazing amazing performer now i want to wrap this up with a conversation about this device itself so intel could have asked any oem out there any manufacturer to be like hey you know we want to showcase this 12th gen chip make us a device they could have chosen anyone but they went with this and i did i think they did it for a reason so it's not about a system where it just shows the top end performance like obviously they could have just gotten a laptop company be like hey you know we want to stick in this new chip in it cool it aggressively show the greatest numbers they could have done that but what i think msi does really well really really well is they have a system that can do that at the top end but their balance mode is so nicely tuned like it's quiet it's got great performance and you saw the numbers like you this is a really good showcase of what this chip can and should do in a properly tuned system and i think not just what intel's done but i think what msi has done in this system is fantastic um i've always been partial to this thing like i love the rgb light bar it's kind of silly but this is such a unique looking rgb system you look up close it looks like there's a fluid inside here like the color shifting it's awesome i like the keyboard i really like the super fast screens i like the layouts of like the ports and stuff great system from msi but i think the like the big winner here is intel they did an awesome job this year and i'm excited to see what intel does with the rest of their lineup like what is their mid tier or even lower end uh mobile chip look like because this this is promising okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
