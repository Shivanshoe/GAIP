[Music] all right the new lg gram for 2021. this is a family of laptops that has evolved quite a bit over the years like the original algae gram was really focused almost laser focused on being as light as possible at the expense of performance and a whole bunch of other things but over the years they've had to adapt and kind of reconfigure what the lg grain was all about and at this point i feel like it's gotten to the stage where it's just a really good a really good overall product and i feel like for a lot of people who are looking for a new device this is going to be on that short list so there's a whole bunch of new features and stuff they've added this year but i want to draw your attention to a new device so they have a new 16-inch model this year they've had 14 15 even 17 in the past but the new one is the 16 inch and of the bunch this is probably my favorite it's that perfect size and weight combination while still retaining really good battery life it actually has the best battery life of the bunch but we will talk about a few features they've added so they now all have 16 by 10 aspect ratio screen so there's just more vertical real estate it's the same kind of overall screen size but you just get more room on the top and bottom and it's something that a lot of people appreciate the only thing it's not great for is if you're watching shows there's now black bars on the top and bottom but for everything else that extra space is nice and they've also added finally usb-c charging and i don't mean like optional usbc charging or the capability of it it's the only way to charge this device usbc right into the port comes with a 65 watt adapter it's something i've been hoping for on the lg grams forever and it's strange to me like on a device like this a premium device that's so focused on weight and portability to not have usb-c was weird but now you don't even need to bring a regular charger you could use in theory your phone charger to juice this thing up it's probably my favorite feature on this year's gram okay they've also added new cpus so all three now run intel's latest tiger lake cpus and we'll get into performance a little bit but that's the lineup the very portable 14 inch model that's still under a kilogram the big screened 17 inch model that's weirdly light like every time i pick this thing up it almost doesn't make sense as to how this thing has such a low weight for such a big screen and then lastly the 16 inch model and all three of these are obviously very light and i wouldn't be surprised if some maybe all of them hold records for like the lightest laptop in the world now in terms of the aesthetics they are slightly different than the previous years so they're cleaner looking this year the design lines have this industrial vibe to it but there's also this feature on the hinge that when you open the device it kind of tucks a portion of the bezel behind the keyboard deck like the bottom bezel like the chin when you open the device it just kind of goes below the hinge so visually it's an illusion right the chin is still there but you just can't see it as readily it's a nice little visual tweak they've made i think it looks nice but it keeps the thin bezel design uniform around the whole screen the 14 inch model has a full hd screen but the 17 and 16 inch models have quad hd panels these are really nice looking displays like they're colorful they're bright they don't however have a matte finish they are a glossy panel which i personally love but everyone's different on that and they also don't have touch screens which is something you often see on glossy panels like this but i assume in a move to keep the weight down and the pricing reasonable is just a regular screen it's just glossy so there's also a webcam up top it's not amazing but it's usable and i think that's all that really matters in this day and age okay let's talk about the keyboards so they all look very similar they've changed from previous models one thing is they've removed that orange color accent that they used to have it's a more minimal looking keyboard but this is a nice keyboard i think most people really enjoy typing on it they do however type slightly different from each other it's the strangest thing i i mean it's hard to tell right when you're typing on if i did like a blindfold test i think they're actually different the 17-inch model feels slightly more clicky to me but it's probably in my head like it wouldn't make sense for them to switch different membranes between the three different keyboards that'd be really strange so i'm probably going crazy but it does for whatever reason feels slightly different the touch pads are bigger this year one of the issues that people have had with the grams in the past is having smaller track pads but this year it's noticeably bigger as well as still having that nice smooth glass surface and a nice click mechanic this is a good trackpad i think most people like it and you can see the the chin thing i was talking about right that whole reduced bezel on the bottom it's a bit of an illusion but it's pretty cool okay let's talk about performance so all three of these are running tiger lake chips and in terms of the overall performance i'm i guess the word i want to use is content i was gonna use word happy with it i'm content so if you compared to last year's model it's an improvement but these use chips that have incredible potential like if you put the same chip in a laptop that's cooled more aggressively you can get some really good performance particularly graphics performance but because these are 15 watt variants they're not as powerful as they could be and they can't sustain a high clock speed for extended periods of time the way that i look at it is this on the 14 inch model i feel like it gets a pass when you pop this thing open there's no more room in there for anything really right it's a pretty packed device but on the 16 and particularly the 17 inch model there's room you could totally have revamped it or redesigned the fans so that you could cool this thing better and if they did if they had cooled this thing really aggressively i think that you could have gotten like good gaming performance out of this chip like if you look at the motherboards clearly they're sharing the exact same main motherboard and thermal system across all three devices i'm sure it helps to keep the cost down and on a 14 and 16 inch model maybe gets a pass but on the 17 inch model because there's so much room in there i can't help but wish that they had put something to accommodate for the potential of this chip but i get it it's the lg gram and they're focused on weight so you know adding another fan would have bumped it up by who knows 150 grams 100 grams and that would have been unacceptable to the gram family okay uh the ports so these have a pretty good selection of ports so there's the two usbc on one side with the display out like hdmi and then there's two usb-a which on a device like this like ultra thin 2021 to have four usb ports two of them being usb-a it's not common i like seeing that uh there's also a micro sd if that's your jam all right battery life the 17 and 16 inch models share the same battery size they're both 80 watt hours i got nine and a half hours on the 17 a little bit more than nine and a half so i compared it to last year's data it was slightly longer than last year also around nine and a half on the 17-inch model but a little bit better and i think i was running the test identically so my guess is that the chip is slightly more efficient this year and on the 16 inch it's actually the longest running it's just under 10 hours this is on my test they make claims of like 10 hours or like 5 000 hours it doesn't matter those are unrealistic to me uh but nine and a half on the 17 slightly under 10 on the 16. the 14 inch is the lowest of the bunch it has a 72 watt hour bar so it's slightly smaller but i was consistently getting nine hours on this thing but that's just my testing okay so the rest of the stuff inside you got two nvme slots on all three of these so you can have some really fast drives in there the ram is sorted on there's 16 gigs and you can see it up top and the wi-fi card is also baked on so you want to replace those or swap them you cannot the speakers down here sound okay like they're slightly different looking the previous year's model but they sound very similar i feel like with the amount of space that's available in that area you could put a ton of speakers so lg if you ever watch this you should probably do something by putting just better or bigger or more speakers in there to make it like a really good sound system you have the space you clearly have the space so it would be cool if you did that instead of having these predictably mediocre sound systems okay i cannot understate that's the wrong word overstate i cannot overstate the lightness of these things it's just like they're so weirdly light it's awesome if you want portability you want that ultra light experience these are a really good choice this year now in terms of pricing i don't have pricing on any of this stuff yet it's relatively early in the launch cycle but i do remember that last year i mean these things go on sale pretty regularly but i remember the 17-ish model hitting i think like 1200 bucks it was crazy to have that kind of configuration and this screen size and this kind of package for that kind of pricing so keep an eye out for the sales on these things okay that's the lg gram lineup thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
