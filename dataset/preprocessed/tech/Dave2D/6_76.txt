listen i've been reading the comments and i feel it too it is very difficult for me to do the tech videos that i'm comfortable with with the tech videos that i'm used to without a table i've been doing this for six years at this point right but i just want to get away from the table if i can we'll see how that plays out but today we're wheeling on this workbench and this is what we'll use as a temporary table so today we're talking about the zenfone 8 and the zenfone 8 flip now a few months ago there were rumors that there was a mini zen phone of some sort coming out it turns out that's just the regular zenfone 8 and then the zenfone 8 flip is the one with the flipping mechanism so we'll talk about this in a second but when i first pulled this thing out of the box the regular zenfone 8 i was surprised i was almost disappointed because the iconic flippy camera system that has been around for the past two years was gone at least on this one and i was like why why is asus making a generic phone like why are they making something that seemingly everyone else has something very similar to but it turns out this is actually pretty special so this phone has a lot of the top tier components in it it's got a snapdragon triple eight it's got ufs 3.1 storage it's a very fast phone but what it does really well is the fundamentals it gets all of the necessities down just right so it's a very small phone it's a 5.9 inch screen but it's a comfortable one-handed phone and there's actually not a lot of devices out there right now that we can do that whole one-handed reachability we can stretch across the width of the screen with one finger something i appreciate it's obviously not everyone's jam but i like it and it's kind of like the pixel 5 but this is actually a narrower screen than the pixel 5. there's also the return of the headphone jack which is something i personally love seeing they removed it last year and i think on a device like this that is as well-rounded and as complete of a package as this is if they didn't put this in it would have been such a mistake so i'm glad that it's there it also has the weirdest thing amazing speakers so i'm used to small phones having not just bad speakers but just like discrepant speakers where like the left side or the right side is louder or quieter just because it's a small phone you kind of expect it to have less room in there to put big speakers no dude this thing is awesome i don't know how they did it this is a smaller phone with possibly one of the best speakers i've heard outside of a gaming phone these are incredible they're not super loud but they're clear they have good stereo separation they're clearly taking notes from their rg phone line the battery in here is 4 000 milliamp hours it's not huge it's relatively big considering the size of the phone but their marketing material made it seem like at 4 000 milliamp hours they're like breaking records or something it's a big ish battery but battery life isn't super special either i'm getting like six hours of screen on time and there's also 30 watt fast charging capabilities with this device and it's included in the box now what is kind of special though is that they were able to combine a 4 000 milliamp hour battery so large ish in a smaller package with a high-end soc so normally i'm just going to use the pixel 5 as an example if you have a small package like this or a smaller package like this and you want to stuff a big battery in there it's a lot easier to do that when you have a low-end soc because you don't have to run as much copper piping and materials in there to wick that heat away right something like this device that triple a gets hot so the ability to pull that heat away properly effectively while leaving enough space in there for four thousand milliamp hour battery that's commendable so i think if you want that full round package like powerful big battery and small that's what this guy does it also has a fantastic screen so it's a 1080p panel but it's 120 hertz and very responsive very fast but it's a little bit taller than you might expect like the aspect ratio is 20 by nine and it's just you know a bit of a vertical stretch if that's something that's important to you there's also more prominent black sidebars and videos if you don't zoom in but the screen overall is fantastic now the bezels are a little bit thicker than some other devices out there but i feel like it's so worth it right by having bigger bezels like this they're able to put a much more powerful speaker system behind it and i feel like it's completely worth the trade off for me like if you want super thin bezels you just can't have good speakers in there you just right it's just gonna have anemic sounds this is this is the move now the camera system is using the same sensors as last year's model the zenfone 7 pro but it doesn't do the flip obviously this is just a rear mounted camera system but it's a very generic looking phone now there's not a lot of features in the back that really identify it it shoots nice though the dynamic range is up there on the main sensor the imax 686 the ultrawide sensor isn't as good on dynamic range or as sharp but for both lenses the colors are good and the low light is actually quite good i feel like asus's software can sometimes be a little aggressive with brightening the image and sometimes it overexposes shots but in general i think this camera system is very good i actually don't think people need to install third-party stuff like gcam because the stock camera app is on point it doesn't have a zoom if that's something you're looking for but the camera system is solid now a quick note about the color on the back of this device it's a matte black glass it's gorilla victus so it's strong glass but this is a really nice finish it's a nice color and to me it looks almost identical to the one on the s21 ultra the one that they called phantom block and they did like a 10 minute presentation of what made that black so special this is the same thing to me it's like very very similar but if you like that color you like that finish you're gonna like this one it's just not called phantom black i'm sure okay so there's also this blue button on the side that looks really cool against this black finish and there's no wireless charging and there's also no micro sd that's something you're dependent on but overall i think this phone fits so many people's wish lists like it's just it does so much stuff right at a very reasonable price i think it's like six seven hundred dollars but if you're in the market for someone that's small but feature packed definitely check out this phone now there's two concerns that i think people have when it comes to zenfone devices number one is the bands so i'm going to put it in the description like all the available bands on this device but there's also the issue of availability i asked them like is this going to be a device that's available in higher quantities than previous devices because on the zenfone 6 and even parts of 7.7 you couldn't get this device no matter how hard you tried it was weird it was like sold out everywhere but they said they've improved their kind of method of getting this thing out globally but we'll have to see so that's the zenfone 8 i think this is a really cool and really well-designed small phone way better than i thought it would be when i pulled out of the box because i just didn't realize what this thing was packing okay i'm gonna move on to the zenfone 8 flip now this phone is more in line with what i thought a zen phone would be a big large flippy camera system not a lot has changed in this device from last year's zenfone 7 pro it's kind of strange to me and i'll talk about it a little bit but the the concern that i have is more about the why like why did they move away from this design and this kind of form factor with the flippy camera to something that is so not zenfone and i don't have an answer for that obviously but it just feels strange to me and it worries me thinking that this product line or this kind of product innovation with the camera system is gonna disappear in a year or two or more like it's just strange that they would separate it like this and i don't want it to now personally i don't use this camera system but i feel like it was a great idea that i think a lot of people appreciate like you get this full front screen with no notches or bezels or any kind of obstructions and it's kind of sad to see that the main hero devices here being sold globally is the regular zenfone 8 and not the flip because i really liked the flip it was unique and as consumers it was cool to see companies try stuff like that this feels more like a safety pick right it feels like i mean it's a good phone but it just feels like this was like you know they could look on a chart and be like what's the mathematical best option for building a phone that can sell and this would be it but it just feels less innovative in that sense so i just i'm disappointed that they did this i hope it's not some kind of foreshadowing that they're going to dump this camera over time but zenfone 8 flip so just like the zenfone 7 pro from last year it does the flip in the camera system but the images are actually quite similar between this year's model and the 7 pro from last year it's just some minor tweaks in software the overall phone is actually quite similar in fact like it's aside from the soc being upgraded to the snapdragon 8 there's actually very very few differences there is the removal of that side mounted fingerprint sensor and it's now in display just like the zenfone 8 but it doesn't have an improved speaker system which i was assuming they would right if they could put those great speakers into that small phone i thought they'd put them in here as well but these sound just like the old one this just seems like a slightly updated version of the 7 pro from last year for the people that really enjoy this form factor but that's it that's the zenfone 8 and the zenfone 8 flip on this rolling table that i pulled in for you guys okay hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
