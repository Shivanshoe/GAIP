all right so this is the 20/20 razor blade stealth and in many ways I would consider the student my favorite laptop on the market right now not just like gaming laptop but just favorite laptop period because they do so much right but because it is such a good product that's also this wonderful example of what is wrong with Intel based devices right now this is like the epitome or like the poster boy of you know it's so good but Intel so the way I'm going to do this video is I'm going to do like a quick review of it and then I want to talk about some bigger picture stuff like the the landscape of laptops right now so the first thing I want to draw attention to on this device is the I guess design and material choices and aesthetics of it it is this unibody built device that just it's just got this wicked look to it I love it I've always enjoyed the way that the stealth look I've always enjoyed razors build quality but this one in particular like the 13-inch stealth it's this the moment you pick it up it's got this great balance to it it's perfectly balanced like like haul things should be it's perfectly balanced in this in this weird way maybe it's like the the dimensions of it or the I don't know I'm always drawn to it and it's hard to portray this in a video right because you guys are just looking at it you're not holding it but when you pick up something like the g4 team from ACS this is a very popular device also a great machine but this just doesn't feel the same you pick up if you had these in front of you you pick them up like you just know that this is a it's just it's got that vibe to it that most people will appreciate it's got this nice black like matte black finish to it with that logo like that snake logo that's not super obnoxious it's got this you know two-tone finish to it I like it okay this machine is super expensive because of that design aesthetic though right they can charge this kind of money because not a lot of laptops are made like this and they know they have something that's relatively unique now the performance this year has been improved a good amount the cpu wattage has been bumped up to 25 watts so it can just hold the turbo boost a little bit better and the GPU has been upgraded to the 1650 TI max-q so it's like a noticeable difference between this year's model and the previous year's model in turn of just the internal components the fan noise can get somewhat loud if you push it but it's to be expected it's a laptop that pushes out respectable performance the screen this year has also been upgraded to a 120 Hertz display I don't even know why I'm showing you this like you can't see the Hertz here but it's a faster screen one of the complaints I had about the previous model was that it was a 60 Hertz screen right and if you're playing games faster refresh is always something that you look for but I've also noticed that the response time on the screen isn't great it's not as slow as the g14 like that say it feels like a 35 millisecond screen this feels I want to see like 2025 millisecond I don't have an oscilloscope to test but this is not like a 5 or 3 millisecond screen it's fast in terms of refresh rate but you may notice some ghosting in certain games like if you play competitive shooters you may notice some ghosting on your targeting reticle so it depends on the type of game you play and basically how sensitive you are to this type of stuff but one thing's for sure 120 Hertz is a heck of a lot better than 60 Hertz when it comes to games in general ok the keyboard has also been updated they've fixed the right shift key this is a keyboard that I am partial to I've spent a lot of the past few years typing on razors keyboards like their laptop keyboards so I really like this layout and I think most people will the arrow key cluster is a little bit different like the up and down arrows are really small so you have to get used to it if you're someone that uses arrow keys for whatever reason the trackpad I've always liked their track pads they just do it right the keyboard lighting is decent it's not like the most vibrant or brightest keyboard lighting out there and it also has to be one color like you can't choose you know individually lit keys it's got to be one color across the whole keyboard but it gets the job done and I actually like how they've done it in their software these speakers on the left and right there above average like they sound actually pretty good ok Oh ports before we wrap this up there's two USB a to use b/c the one on the right supports Thunderbolt 3 and there's a headphone jack on the left you see how easy I can spin this thing around balance ok so inside you have the same stuff as the previous years you get one SSD that you can replace one Wi-Fi card that you can of course there's only one Wi-Fi well why would there be two wi-fi's one Wi-Fi card that you can replace and you get 16 gigs of ram that is baked on so you can't ever change that or upgrade that in the future the battery is the same size of the previous years and I got six and a half hours on this machine I was expecting a little bit more because last year got seven and a half or something a little bit less than seven half six and a half I ran that test twice so I don't know maybe it's the video card I can't tell you maybe maybe it's Windows to be completely honest use BC charging hundred watts same thing as last year good stuff now let's talk about the not-so-good stuff okay how should I do this alright I think as I said in the earlier part of the video I think this is like the perfect example of what is wrong with Intel based devices right now because this is such a good machine and if AMD didn't exist if r aizen's chips didn't exist on the market this would be a fantastic laptop expensive but fantastic so this thing goes for 1,800 bucks I believe yeah $1,800 for the model with the the gtx 1650 TI which is a lot of money now because it's razor and because this is such a unique product there's nothing else like this what else was out there that is a unibody ultrabook with this type of gaming performance it just doesn't exist so they can charge whatever they want as expensive as they want it to be however there is a very similar product the G 14 now this machine came out I don't know two three months ago and it is similar in size clearly it's bigger right it's not exactly the same size but it's it's a it's a comparable machine in terms of what they're going for these are both small portable gaming devices this machine I believe costs 1500 for an 8 core CPU with an RT X 2060 versus the $1,800 stealth with its four core CPU and it's weaker GPU and I get it they're completely different classes of machine right the stealth is thinner smaller lighter and it's better built than the G 14 but you can't help but compare the two because they're both going for that same like portable gaming setup okay the reason why I called this the stealth like the poster boy what's wrong with Intel stuff right now is because on a small ultrabook like this that is as well built and as perfectly like engineered as it is aside from its CPU the the problem with the CPU just it sticks out it sticks out really hard as being its weakest point because if this thing had an AMD chip in it I would be recommending this thing like crazy this would be like hey guys go get this right now it's a little bit more expensive than the other stuff out there but it is so good but I'm not I can't write because it's it's not AMD and that has always been the problem with AMD's chips this year as good as they are it's like everybody loves am DS rise and stuff it's awesome but no one seems to be using it other than the g14 everyone else is just sticking with Intel and it's a shame it's like you see this stuff and you want it to be awesome cuz it is awesome but it doesn't have AMD in it okay so there you have it do I recommend this device kind of if you don't care about multi-core performance and you just want a very portable gaming device it's pretty good it's expensive but it's pretty good it's just this would be a very very different conversation if it was packing some AMD in it all right razor you got to open the doors to AMD right right okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs be liked it subs have you loved it I'll see you guys next time [Music]
