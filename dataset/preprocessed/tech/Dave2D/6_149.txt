hmm you see i just shot a imac review a very technical review for the past 16 minutes and just as i got to the end of that video i said something that made my brain pop and i thought that's that's not the review i want to do that's not the message i want to convey so i'm contemplating reshooting this entire thing you know what let's just do it let's just do it i brought all this stuff out and i was trying to explain some stuff but these will all these will all work right yeah yeah i can talk about this okay let's talk about this from the beginning uh okay because of the current climate of coronavirus and the world being you know all about isolation and stuff right now the way that press briefings are done with tech is a little bit different usually you know there's events and stuff like that but right now there are no events companies are sending out products and they do these online press briefings usually companies are awful at them they're super boring and everyone falls asleep but apple because they're apple they do things a little bit differently and when they sent this device over last week uh the press briefing that came along with it was a little bit different it was an hour long i'm not sure if i'm even permitted to talk about this stuff but let's just roll with this for that hour long briefing the first 10 15 minutes they talked about the product what's new what's changed and it was interesting for what it's worth but then the rest of that hour was really interesting they brought on these creators these people that had used a 27-inch imac or imax of sorts to create stuff some were musicians some were coders like developers some were video makers and it was it was really moving for me like i i remember last week right after the event i felt like it felt it awoke something in me because it had reminded me of why i started creating it had reminded me of how i felt when i first started making anything creative in my life and you know what let's just let's get into it story time seven or eight years ago i had this really weird idea to make a game a 2d game and i wanted to make a game put it on the apple store and sell it and make money that was this stupid idea of mine i had this game in my brain that i thought would look really cool when it came out the idea was that you would have these creatures that you would inject with a touch-based syringe and you would inject them and they would burst or sometimes they would do different things and i thought the idea was so cool i knew nothing about coding at the time right i needed a mac i didn't own any apple hardware back then i used windows stuff in it but i needed a macbook or some kind of mac device to be able to code in xcode so i could make the game and then upload it to apple servers i picked up this machine it was a used 2011 macbook air and i still have and i keep it around because it's like this memento of you know it's it's a reminder of of creation of dave don't take your job so seriously you can make things that's what i did with this thing i made a game was called inject it took me two years every day i'd go to work come back from work and i'd work on it until really late at night and two years and a bit later i published the game on the app store it did horribly it was a two dollar game and sold like 2 000 copies for two years of work it was not a financially great endeavor however it felt awesome i had made something and shared it with the world and it felt so cool like the game itself was trash i'm not gonna lie but it felt really nice to make something and then i felt like i was bit by this bug by this creative bug because like a year later i had this weird idea to start a youtube channel this was at the end of 2014 and i remember asking one of my friends at the time he was 14 at the time his name was dylan i said hey dylan i'm thinking of starting a youtube channel but i'm i'm scared i'm scared of what people might think i'm scared of what people might think of me what if a friend of mine or a relative of mine sees my video and thinks it's stupid i'm talking about these nerdy technical tech things and his answer to me was like why do you care why do you care what other people think if you want to make something just make it just do it because you're going to that's why you want to do it and i thought to myself wow this 14 year old kid just schooled me he just taught me something really valuable and i feel like his response is seared in my brain if you want to make something just do it because you want to make it so i bought a used 15-inch macbook pro and i bought a camera from a friend and i learned how to use that camera and learn how to edit videos and i started my channel now why am i talking about this stuff why am i telling these dumb stories that have nothing to do with imax nothing to do with anything that's on the table here let me tell you why one of the main questions people have right now when it comes to purchasing this new 2020 imac is do you buy one now or do you wait for the upcoming refresh of it because this is aesthetically dated hardware it's not new right we've seen these thick bezels for years we've seen this exact same design for many years and as hardware enthusiasts this stuff is not super interesting right this stuff is supposed to be coming up very soon apple's new apple silicon this is the developer's kit it's going to have apple silicon inside an imac type device soon maybe the end of this year maybe next year and the question is do you get it now do you buy this thing now with this intel old hardware or do you get this or sorry do you wait for this to go into here and the video i shot just previously 20 minutes ago i was trying to look at this objectively because there's a lot of moving parts right it's like how do you how do you disseminate the information so that you guys can make a good purchase decision of whether or not you should buy this thing now and here's the thing it seemed like a difficult question 20 minutes ago but then i realized it's actually a really simple answer a really simple answer if you want to make something if you want to do something this is just a tool it's just a tool if i'd waited for the next imac when i picked up the first piece of hardware to make my game or to start my youtube channel who knows maybe you never would have done any of this stuff but if you want to make something you just do it obviously you want to buy you know a 13 or 1400 imac but if you need a tool because you want to create something or you need to create something don't wait for the next best thing just pick up the tool that's available today and use it to make stuff starting today that's the message i'm trying to say because if i'd waited for like the next piece of hardware who knows i'm who i may never never even started my youtube channel um i'll give you the two minute review of this device though it gets up to 10 cores there's a few things i want to talk about uh the performance is good it's as you would expect it's not going to be as cost effective as a windows pc but it's got 10 cores and a decent gpu it pushes out good performance there's four or five things that i think you should be aware of in case you were interested in actually picking something like this up number one i guess sound profile so imacs have always had a very quiet audio signature it's not new to this imac it's something they've always had but it's something that's very difficult and expensive to duplicate with a windows machine right this is very quiet so if you value that stuff imax deliver that number two there's a nano coding option this year that reduces glare it's cool tech and if you're in an environment where you're constantly looking at reflections on your screen they bother you i would get it but i think for most people not just to save the 500 but the image isn't as nice when you have that coding on at least to me so i would say if you can skip it skip it uh number three still has upgradeable ram which is awesome and number four oh new mics i was gonna record this whole thing on the mics on here they've improved significantly like they're so much better than basically any all-in-one system out there but they're not amazing they don't sound like this kind of mic so they're good they've improved they're not the best um and the webcam the webcam is really good like it's sharp 1080p with nice facial toning so if that stuff's important to you this webcam will probably do the trick but the rest of the device hasn't really changed much right it's still that thicker bezeled 27 inch device that is quite frankly starting to show its age but here's the other thing after that press briefing it was a really nice one if apple you're watching this it was really good but the question that popped in my mind was like why why would apple go through so much energy and effort on an imac refresh and i think the reason why they did that kind of briefing where they brought on these creators and they showcased what you could do with this stuff is because they knew that this would be a difficult product to sell they knew that this last intel imac would be a harder sell because it's just such dated hardware like aesthetically right this doesn't look new and i think that's always been one of the big appeals of apple's products they look cool this doesn't look cool anymore because it's so old so i think that's why the press briefing went the way that it did but the reality is this imac will let you make really good stuff right now so don't waste your mind space worrying about the next one you just get the tool and get the job done because you never know you might land on something that you love like i did with youtube [Music]
