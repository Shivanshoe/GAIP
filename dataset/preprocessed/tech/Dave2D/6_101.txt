[Music] all right so this is my review of the flow x13 from asus it's this mini laptop that can connect to an external gpu that's equipped with an rtx 3080. it's a very powerful combination and it's something a little bit different and a lot of times when companies come out with something that's a little bit different the product falls short of expectations right it sounds cool on paper and then i get it in i review and it's like it's not that cool this time it's it's something else this is a very it's just so cool let's get in now this system is running amd's new cpus it's their 5980 hs it's an 8 core cpu 35 watt and it pushes out performance that i have not seen before not just in a mini laptop like this but even regular gaming laptops equipped with intel stuff these new amd chips are amazing and this device is an incredible showcase of what amd can do with their new processors super thin super portable and yet it crushes if you have any kind of workflow that can take advantage of a lot of cpu cores you're gonna like the performance on this machine now this is equipped with well there's two gpus in here there's the gpu that's baked onto the amd apu itself like the radeon stuff but i'm gonna focus on the gtx 1650 that's equipped in here so this isn't the main gpu like this is the big stuff but if you're in a pinch and you're just using this laptop on the road and you have to do some graphically capable stuff it does have a usable gpu so i did some video editing and some light gaming on this and it's not bad it's not going to be as good as the rtx 3080. we'll get into that in a second but it's usable and thermally it does really well for such a thin and light device now the exterior of it is made with a magnesium alloy so the top panel and the bottom panel are both made with this tanky and durable feeling material which i like to see the inside panel however like the keyboard deck this i think is a plastic finish and like the top of it has a smooth finish but the bottom area like the wrist rest area has this ribbed texture to it so it makes this sound when you rub it the wrong way or poke at it the wrong way but yeah i think it's a comfortable keyboard to type on in terms of the keyboard deck the layout itself i'm partial to it i like this kind of asus keyboard layout i've always liked it the arrow keys are in a good spot and there's no weird shift positioning it's a comfortable layout for a 13 inch device and the back lighting is this simple white back lighting you can't change the colors or anything of that sort now the trackpad this has a smooth finish despite the appearance of that ribbed texture again it's a little small i think it's somewhat expected on a device like this because the package is small but most laptops nowadays have much larger trackpads than this it gets the job done but if you're someone who's very gesture dependent like if you do a lot of stuff that's gesture based you might find this thing a little cramped but tracking and the button mechanics are good okay let's get onto the screen this is a 16 by 10 aspect ratio so it's a little bit taller than your regular screen it's thin bezel good colors but it doesn't get bright like it's reasonably bright i just wish it got way brighter and especially for a premium device like this i feel like it should be brighter now this one is a 4k panel at 60 hertz they do make a if i'm not mistaken a 1080p panel that is 120 hertz now if i had to give a recommendation if you're somehow in the fortunate position of choosing between the two screens i would definitely opt for the 1080p panel like you can play games on a little bit better but at this screen size 13 inches you're not really taking advantage of a 4k panel unless you got some very specific needs like your photo editing and that's like that's all you do all day long then maybe go for this one but most people i'd go for the 1080p panel there is a webcam at the top it's only 720p but the image looks pretty clean and if you want to you can tilt the whole screen back all the way and it becomes this two-in-one tablet-y type device now personally i've never enjoyed using this type of computing device i get it there's a lot of people that do like if you're a student it has pen support and all that stuff it's just not something i ever do but if you want to it has all the you know tent mode and presentation mode all the things you would normally do with a flippy screen like this uh let's get into the good stuff actually before we get there we got to talk about ports because it's connected literally okay so there's two usb-a that's a lie there's one usb-a and two usb-c now the usb-c on this side is part of the proprietary plug that connects to the external gpu so if you're not connecting this thing you can just use it as a second use pc you can power it through the ac adapter use pc but if you want to when it's time you can connect it to this external gpu and this is where this product really shines so this is an rtx 3080 equipped box it's very small i think this is just under a kilogram and so that's 2.2 pounds and it's crazy powerful and crazy small and crazy quiet for what this thing is able to deliver so to connect it up you it's as you would expect you connect it into the port and you flick the switch to lock it and then the software prompt will pop up be like do you want to connect it and you hit yes and now you're connected now there is a bit of a wait time it's like 10 or 12 seconds it's not instant but once the connection is complete you're now connected to a laptop rtx 3080 with 16 gigs of ram and this thing runs with 150 watts of gpu juice right into it like the box is 280 watts that's like to power the system and to power the gpu but it's a 150 watt rtx 3080 inside there in case you're wondering performance is fantastic it's super fast like super super fast it can't keep up with desktop grade components though right if you grab a regular rtx 3080 from a pc build and you compare to this this is definitely slower than a regular rtx 3080 it's even slower than a rtx 3070 but considering what's going on here in 150 watt package that is small and quiet and relatively portable this thing is pretty impressive the connection is proprietary so you are dependent on asus to make new ones of these right if you know two years from now you want to have an upgrade to your system if you are so fortunate to own this thing you need asus to make another one of these within our own rtx 4080 or whatever that happens in the future you need them to do it you can't upgrade this thing yourself at least not from what i saw when opening it we'll pop it open a second but the power cable or the connection cable powers the system as well as the bandwidth for the gpu if you want to disconnect it like you want to remove your laptop and leave from this gpu you have to click it in software to let it know before you do the disconnection process now internally you can see the power supply it's 280 watts it's actually pretty small for that wattage but the gpu component cannot be upgraded yourself it's like something that's completely proprietary to asus so you can't just upgrade this on your own unless you got some serious engineering skills when you open up the laptop the ram and the wi-fi card are baked on you can't upgrade or swap that and the ssd it's reasonably fast but it's a shorty so if you want to upgrade if you want like a bigger ssd it's not the easiest thing to find like there's definitely options out there but they're not as common as a full 2280 this is a 2230 i believe the battery down here 62 watt hours and it's okay like i feel like on a device like this because it's got that two-in-one capability and it's theoretically possible that the student want to bring this to school or someone want to bring this to work it doesn't last long enough for what i would consider to be like a full day battery i got six hours just under six hours on my regular test so screen it 250 nits with regular browsing and stuff like that it's okay but i do have the 4k panel so if you had the 1080p panel it probably go to seven and a half hours as my guess maybe seven but that is battery life and okay i think that basically wraps up this review i want to talk about pricing and just kind of the value proposition of this thing this is not a cheap product i believe it comes in at 32.99 it is one of the most expensive laptop-based products i've ever had on this channel but two things to keep in mind number one there's no one else that makes this a super powerful mini laptop combined with a super powerful external gpu like this package as expensive as it is is unique and i guess number two when you have the world's only this you can charge whatever you want it's unfortunate that it's expensive but it really is like when you have the unicorn you can charge a billion dollars to that unicorn it's a very unique product and it's clearly not for everyone but i also want to present this other kind of scenario because i think a lot of people are looking at this and like okay for that kind of money you could buy a really good laptop and build a really good pc for seven dollars you could just have both right so why would you have why would you do this why would you spend all of your money on just one super versatile but very expensive products and i don't have an answer for that i feel like this is going to make sense to the person like there's going to be people out there that see this and like this is specifically what i want or specifically what i need not the laptop and desktop combination they want this because it does provide a level of versatility that you just can't do with the the setup that i mentioned previously it is super cool like unbelievably powerful for what this thing delivers and the weight that this whole package comes in but it's so expensive and yeah i mean if i had the money i know it'd be tempted because this is such a cool product okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
