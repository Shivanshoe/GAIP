this is the new studio uh i've been doing youtube for six years now i never had a place that was my own to just shoot youtube videos i shot at my home i shouted my condo i shot out of work the vast majority of my videos have been shot in like my office at work which is ridiculous right how did i do 600 videos with that this is a studio this is my own space i can do whatever i want with it be as loud as one with it be as animated be as crazy as i want with it i love it and so this is a concrete bunker looking thing for some people but this is this is so my style i've always wanted like some kind of space that was like this i've always wanted it right i always wanted a house like this but my wife would never let something like this fly and so i was like you know what for youtube let's do it so a couple things number one there's no light sticks i deliberated on it for a while but they're just so played out i feel like at this point they're just i'm done with them the light sticks they're gone they're never coming back for all the other people that want to see them i'm sorry they're gone uh the other thing i'm contemplating truly contemplating going no table like i've shot every single one of my youtube videos with a table right it's me in a desk i'm interacting with the camera i hate it there's something about it that just feels off that feels just not it's just not me so i i don't know what i'm gonna do maybe i'll come back to a table i really hope i don't but the idea of being able to just do things just my own way is just it's exciting okay um in this space i'm looking over here because there's like the monitor here i'm probably gonna put like a a desk of some sort over there not for shooting videos but just like you need a desk in a space like this right and there's an aquarium back there it's it's super cloudy i just filled it like yesterday um but it'll fill out over time it'll grow it's a planted tank if you know anything about aquariums it's going to be filled with green life um what else is there to say this is a new space i owe all of this the presence of this the ability to make something that is like my dream like bunker to you guys all of this this is like this is it so all the people have supported me over the years thank you finally have this space and i'm just excited to make videos in just in a very very different environment okay see you guys soon
