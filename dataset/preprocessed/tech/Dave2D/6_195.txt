okay so this is one of the coolest laptops I've seen this year it's this 17 inch device relatively large but it's a very powerful comprehensive creative battle station that allows you to do pretty much everything you could possibly want for a creative workflow it's got all the good stuff like an RT X 2080 very powerful CPU but what makes it special what makes it a very unique product is this hinge it allows you to rotate the screen in pretty much any way you'd want you can have it backwards facing the back of a laptop or a client you can have it facing yourself like normal or you can have it in this top-down kind of artist mode and in conjunction with this screen it also has this really awesome pen now the traditional pen that comes with a lot of laptops out there feel like this afterthought they don't feel like the product was based around the use of a pen it's just something that can just add into a product as a value add but this laptop makes really good use of this pen the screen itself has this kind of matte texture to it so when you're drawing on it it has this paper like field not that it feels exactly like paper but it feels a lot better to draw on this screen than your kind of standard glossy finished screen and it's also a Wacom EMR based pen so the stylus itself doesn't have a power source that digitizer under the screen powers the whole connection and it's just it's a really good drawing surface I'm not an artist but I can immediately tell they put time and effort into making this pen and digitizer interface feel proper so if you do do digital arts and you're working with any kind of pen based workflow you'll probably appreciate this now I was recently introduced to this game called osoo and it's this rhythm game where a lot of the veteran players use tablets to play and I thought that because this screen and digitizer were so good that it would be awesome for it and I just want to say it was like I mean clearly this not meant as a you know the world's best osoo machine but it plays your arm just gets super tired moving around but it's fun and I also tried Starcraft 2 an RTS game the biggest problems get to right-click so much in that game and to right-click with this thing you got to hold the button down and tap and it's just it's very ineffective I felt like I had an APM of like 5 it wasn't good but the pen itself and the interface with this device is on point it really is meant for creative work and for that it's quite good I did notice that when I was drawing this Pokemon here it would occasionally miss click from a palm detection but the accuracy and the pressure sensitivity felt right now the performance of this machine is really good it's running on our TX 2080 it's running an eight-core i9 from Intel it's super powerful I played some apex on this thing great frame rates it's obviously not a gaming oriented device it's got a 60 Hertz screen but if you want to play games you can video edits on this machine are great it has very nice performance especially for being so quiet it can't turbo boost a lot I feel like if they let the users control the fans a little more you could boost this thing significantly but it has good performance for the sound level this thing pushes out now the keyboard is it's something you have to get used to it's got two kind of issues for one the keyboards in this lowered position so there's no wrist rest and the track pads on the right so everything feels a little more cramped everything feels kind of unfamiliar when you first use it but I think most people if they spend some time with this will get used to the device now the keys themselves they're a mechanical switch I don't think they market or advertise this thing as having mechanical switches but you can distinctly hear like there's an actuation point when you press down on the key and the layout of the keyboard itself I think it's pretty much standard except for the right shift key I think it's something that is you know not everyone uses that right shift key but for the people that do it's really small and in this weird position the trackpad it's got this thing you can DoubleTap and you can activate a number pad for the people that want to use number pads but the inputs on this thing feel a little strange and the other thing I don't love about this thing is that this machine is expensive it's clearly geared towards premium kind of professional users but they do not include a wrist rest with this device and I feel like for the kind of money that this thing demands it should include one in the box instead of having the user go out and look for a custom wrist rest that fits this particular device it should be in the box the exterior of the device is relatively plain there's no like super obvious branding on the back of it it just says like there's no there's nothing it has a very slightly visible concept D that's kind of debauched into the metal there it's not like super obnoxious branding alright let's talk about this flippy screen because this is the cool part of the device now if you'll notice through this whole video when I opened and closed this hinge it had this Creek to it and it's not the rotational hinge it's the actual hinge at the base of the laptop and I think it might be unique to my device but it's something that I feel like I should mention in this video it doesn't come from the right hinge only the left hinge I feel like they over tightened this unit that I got and it tightness is good like stiffness on a device like this is great like if you're drawing and you want that kind of sturdy surface to work with it's perfect but I hope this Creek isn't a side effect of that sturdiness now the screen itself has a relatively big bezel I'll be honest when I first saw this thing I was like you know why does it have to be so big maybe they couldn't source a panel that had this type of color accuracy that they wanted because the screen is excellent like the panel is bright it's very color accurate probably one of the most color accurate screens that have ever seen it is geared towards creatives but it's a really nice screen with a thick bezel granted for people that actually use this thing for work you probably won't notice it but as a laptop reviewer I feel like I'm just going to nitpick on that and there's also a webcam up top 1080p image and it's a relatively clean looking picture there's a spot at the top right of this device where you can place your pen like it just kind of holds it magnetically and it's kind of good to have when you have any kind of stylus based product or stylus compatible product to have something like this you just don't lose it as readily so the arms of this device this kind of arm here that holds the flippy hinge for the screen it's very well made it feels like you could spin this thing around like hundreds of thousands of times I feel like Acer did a good job on this thing there is also this magnetic like when you push it to the back it snaps in place and also you saw there when you flip it like when you flip it all the way around the image rotates automatically for the eye depending on the mode that you have the screen on okay it's gonna close this off here the internals are easy to access you can replace your Wi-Fi card your drives your RAM and the battery down here isn't particularly big 71 watt hours and you get an hour and a half of battery life it's actually shorter than I thought but considering the size of the screen and the resolution and all the kind of powerful internals that are in here I guess it's kind of expected but you won't get great battery life with this machine ports there's a good selection of ports there's no SD card slots though there's three USB a's to use pcs and an Ethernet jack and there's four speakers that actually sound quite good they're loud and they're clear now the overall takeaway on this product it's a super expensive device it's 5000 bucks it is obviously not something that everyone's gonna go out and buy but if you are interested in this device like let's say you are a creative professional that's considering this thing make sure that you're using the pen like that is really it's big a strength I tried to show it in this video but because I'm not an artist I can't really flex what this sounds really capable of but if you're someone that can make use of a pen and the kind of processing and graphical power that this is capable of I think it can be really useful for certain people but there you have it the Acer concept d9 I hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs we loved it see you guys next time [Music]
