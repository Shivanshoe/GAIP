all right so in my recent video about google's pixel 5 announcement a lot of you guys in the comments section were saying that this was the better phone a lot of you guys have a preference for the samsung galaxy s20 fe over the equivalently priced google pixel 5 and if you look on paper there's a lot of stuff to like about the s20 fe it's got a faster processor faster screen faster storage expandable storage it also has a third camera lens you can zoom in optically instead of digitally there's a lot of stuff to like about the s20 fe that the pixel 5 does not have now the conversation could end there if all you cared about was hardware specs but i think that the decision between the two between pixel 5 or an s20 fe lies deeper all this stuff is about aesthetics and design and stuff that not everyone cares about i do right that's if you follow my channel i care about this stuff a lot but i think that's one of the things you have to consider if you're interested in these phones like they're both the same price but one is meant to delight and the other is not to understand just kind of like the groundwork of what i'm going for we got to talk about positioning and marketing if you look at what this phone the s20 fe what it represents for samsung it's a very different type of phone than what the pixel 5 represents for google so this is samsung's like it's not a budget phone because 700 is still very expensive but it's more budget friendly option in their premium lineup it's like yeah we got 13 1400 phones but we also have this 700 phone but this phone can't be too good or too cheap right if they make this thing too good then no one else is buying the other phones right it has to sit alongside the rest of its brothers so this is a value oriented option amongst a sea of premium phones for pixels the google pixel 5 represents their best it's their poster boy it's their premium flagship most expensive phone this year but these differences in positioning for these phones manifest itself into hardware decisions like if you look at the front-facing camera on the s20 fv do you see how prominent that is that hole punch camera it has a silver ring around the element and it's weird when you first see it it's very obvious it stands out even with the thing off right it made me think did they do this on purpose like did they intentionally make this ring silver and make this front facing camera more visibly obvious so that it looks not as clean compared to its brothers and this goes to other features as well if you look at the plastic back like i have nothing against plastic-backed phones but this particular back is a very plain like if you compare the two so this is the note 20 like the plastic backed kind of basic note 20. this is not a cheap phone by any means but you can tell the very obvious difference in aesthetic focus between these two phones despite them both having plastic backs and there's again nothing wrong with it right it's meant to be that way the s20 fe has to look a certain step down from its brothers it has to not look too good with a pixel 5 however it's meant to look the best it's meant to delight now when it comes to cameras it's gotten to the point where basically every flagship phone has gotten much closer to pixel's quality than a year ago even the pixel 5 uses the same main camera sensor as the previous generations it's a really good sensor but it's their software that's doing most of the work and the pictures that come off pixel phones are excellent right particularly the difficult shots low light stuff high dynamic range stuff it just looks so good on pixel phones the s20 fe is really close there is one advantage that i think the pixel 5 will have though it's with ultra wide photography so when it comes to ultra wide shots the processing with samsung's phones and basically every phone out there isn't as good particularly with low light photography on the ultra wide lens pixels but this is the first time we're going to see an ultra wide lens on a pixel phone i think they're going to do it better than everyone else with the low light shots or like the tough shots and on this phone the s20 fe the ultra wide with low light is okay it's not great now i want to touch on a few other things before i wrap this up the fingerprint sensor on the fe it's an optical sensor it's in display and i was concerned because i've had poor experiences with optical sensors but this one seems quite good it's fast it's reliable and even a week later i've had no drift with accuracy on this particular sensor at least with my finger or fingerprint another thing battery life so this has a great battery life i'm hitting like eight and a half almost nine hours of screen on time consistently the pixel 5 it's a smaller battery but it's a smaller phone so i imagine battery life would be quite similar between the two in terms of software i think that samsung's one ui will never be as clean or as simple as google's version of android right it can't be samsung has some more features in their phones but not everyone appreciates that stuff not everyone wants that stuff so if you want just the cleanest and leanest software possible i'd probably push you more towards pixels but the point i'm trying to make is that this phone or just any phone it's not just about specs right if it was we'd all just be using 300 phones from china with snapdragon ten thousands on them but clearly it's not there's the decision for this kind of purchase decision is it's more nuanced there's things like how it feels in your hand how it looks how it appeals to different people so to the people that were in the comments that this is the better phone for sure it could be for certain people but it's not for everyone right but personally i think the s20 fe is an amazing phone it exceeded my expectations because of its price point but it's got to sit along the shelf with the rest of the galaxy lineup right so it can't look too good especially in the aesthetics department okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
