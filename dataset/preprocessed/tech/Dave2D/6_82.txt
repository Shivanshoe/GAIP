[Music] okay so this video is a follow-up or a response to the theft commentary or like the anti-theft commentary that i saw a lot of in my previous air tags video so air tags are very easy to set up they are a great tool for finding lost or like misplaced items and they're just a very appally experience for people that are looking for a product like this right but they have a couple features that are relatively unique and one particular is the anti-stalker feature that's not the official name but there is a feature that's built into air tags in the find my app such that if there is a unwanted or unknown air tag that's following you it will notify you and there was concern about this because people are saying if if that is real right if this tag is not yours and it's following you and you're being notified of its presence doesn't that allow a thief to be able to steal items that are air tagged very easily right so in theory if you're stealing a bike right and this is hidden underneath the saddle and you're writing off with it and you have a phone an iphone wouldn't it notify you that there's an error tag somewhere on the device that you just stole and it'll give you instructions to locate it you can make it play a sound you can physically disable it by removing the battery there's a lot of things that would make it seem very easy for thieves to disable the whole system but it turns out apple's given some thought to this and there are more details to this process there's an element of logic or programmed logic to the behavior so the way that it works is that this app to find my app and the tracker it'll recognize if there's an unknown tracker or unknown air tag that's keeping up with your movements it'll recognize that but it won't notify you right away what it'll do is it'll wait it'll wait until you get home or to a a location of significance and only then will it inform you that this unknown tracker has been following you or has been within your proximity while you moved so if stalker man x decides to slip an air tag into your bag and you start traveling around it won't notify you about this foreign air tag until you get home and that home location is based on the address that you have in your address book and the reason why they do this i think is well there's a couple of reasons number one so that people don't panic right imagine you're out on the subway and you see this notification suddenly it'd be it'd be a very unsettling experience be out in public and you see this thing you're like what is going on like what what's on me what's tracking me but the other thing is that by having this this checkpoint so you have to get home before it does this notification it removes a whole bunch of false negatives right if you're on a public transportation anything like a plane or a train or places where there's a lot of air techs potentially a lot of air tags you would just get notifications like crazy even if you go to school like what if there's all these kids that whose parents stuff air tags into them your notifications be going off like crazy right but they wait for the phone to get to its home location and at that point it's it does a check like is that thing still following you and if it is that's a great time to be notified now the downside to this is that if you're being tracked maliciously you are not made aware of it immediately you have to wait till you get home and only then you get the notification but the benefit to it the big benefit to it is that it allows the air tags to maintain some degree of theft deterrence so in the scenario of theft let's say you're a bad guy you're stealing a car or a bike or you grab someone's backpack and those items or the item has an air tag in it the thief isn't made aware of this air tag unless he or she brings it to their home if they're so bold enough to bring a stolen item to their home but the whole time that it's traveling there the owner of the stolen item would be able to track it on their app which is a good thing now clearly this isn't perfect right in both cases the malicious tracking case and the scenario of theft it's not perfect right they've had to they've had to balance it like this because the two features like anti-theft and anti-stocking rely on the same technology to allow or prevent one another so i think they've reached a pretty decent balance now keep in mind air tags are meant for finding things and not really geared as like an anti-theft tool all the marketing material all the ads they're showing people finding lost or misplaced items right even the accessories for attaching these clips to your stuff are designed in a way to facilitate finding stuff more so than deterring theft but there you have it the air tags now these ones in particular are covered with these pastel dbrand skins they kind of identify the batch as well as protect the silver finish if you want to keep the metal unscratched but that's basically it i think these are excellent tools for finding stuff but if you're looking at purchasing a bunch and like thinking they'd be 25 low jacks for every item that you own to be able to like deter theft across the board i don't think they're really for that and they're not great at that okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music] you
