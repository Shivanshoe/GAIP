okay the iphone 12 mini of the four iphones that came out this fall this is the one that's been most interesting to me personally because well because of its size i like the way they feel in your hand i like how they fit in your pocket i like small phones now because of the timing of this video i think most people who are watching this know a lot about the iphone 12 already so i'm going to focus this video on two things in regards to the mini number one the kind of size like what it means like the benefits and negatives that come with a small size phone like this a small size iphone but secondly i want to focus on battery life because that was one of the major concerns i had about this phone right when you go small like this you can only shrink components to a certain amount right and the battery in here is a lot smaller physically than the other three phones from the lineup um okay i want to draw your attention to this phone right now this is the iphone se like the second generation one this is this is the iphone i've used the most of right now it's actually a modified one if you recognize if you know your iphone's iphone se came with the black bezel on the front but i swapped it out because i'm a sucker for stuff like this but this phone had a battery i want to use the word issue but that's not really the word a battery concern because i knew that if you use this phone kind of beyond light regular use it would suck batteries really quickly if i play games on this thing it just chews through battery life like crazy if i take this thing for like a bunch of photos it chews it up quickly but it's okay when you're just using it for emails and just like browsing stuff now back to this one the iphone 12 mini this is an even smaller phone than the iphone se it's incredibly nice to hold in your hand it's not as small as like the original sc but it's still very compact and very one-handable now despite being such a compact phone the screen size is very respectable like it's a lot bigger than let's say the current sc right it's just like so much more real estate on the 12 mini and it's an awesome screen it's an oled panel high pixel density great brightness you're going to like this screen the notch and the bezels on the 12 mini are actually a little bit smaller than the other three iphone 12s it's barely noticeable like you got to look for it you got to kind of compare them side by side but if you do you will notice that the notch is a little bit smaller and the bezels are just a little bit thinner than the rest of the iphone 12 family but the functionality of face id and that front-facing camera remain unchanged across all four phones so the physical characteristics of the iphone 12 mini are how you'd expect right easy to hold easy to use and very compact now let's move this conversation over to battery life the way that i test battery life when it comes to iphones is that i run a website loop it refreshes every few minutes and it's just a very consistent but primitive test right i compared the 12 mini to several other iphones and a few things stood out to me number one the battery life on the 12 mini is respectable better than i thought it would be definitely better than the sc and it's just a solid battery life not as good as the pro max though right there is a clear winner in that regard but when you do something like this a big shrink in phone size you're gonna have shorter battery life but the other thing i noticed is that on the 12 mini it seems to be more affected by your type of content that you're viewing more so than the other three phones like you saw that test on the dark website this lasts quite a bit longer than the white website and that's a result of the oled tech right when you have a dark pixel it's not using nearly as much energy as a brightly lit white pixel so battery life on the iphone 12 mini is solid but if you're someone who uses dark mode on your phone and you view dark websites it'll just go a little bit further than you would expect um so yeah that's basically the iphone 12 mini i do want to leave this conversation with one last thought small phones are not common in 2020 and i think they're actually quite difficult to do properly right if you look at the iphone 12 like the regular iphone 12 and compared to the iphone 12 mini all the components that are in here are in here as well and they don't shrink it coming across right it's not like the camera module gets smaller it's not like the ram and the soc and like all the components inside here they don't get smaller when you put it into the 12 mini they stay the same size and it's a challenge to fit all that into a much smaller chassis so you have to shrink the battery and you have to make some compromises right so like for example the wireless charging magsafe charging is a little bit slower on this one and the speakers on the mini don't sound as rich as the 12 even though they're really close so it's not a compromise free shrink right when you go to the smaller phone you're going to take a hit but the way that apple's done it is that the hit is almost imperceptible it feels like they did a really good job in the shrink and seemingly no one else is doing it right even apple couldn't do this last year this is the first time they've had a small phone that was this good i do wish the pricing was a little bit better i'll be honest like if i i feel like this should be the 699 phone and this should be a 5.99 phone that would be ideal to me but yeah apple's pricing is always going to be that way it seems okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
