hey how's it going dave2d here so if you're one of my viewers that watch my videos because you want to purchase a high performance or a gaming laptop that isn't crazy expensive and you want someone that's more reasonably priced you want to pay attention to this one so this is the hp omen 15 and here's the thing as a reviewer you start to build these expectations for brands and products of what you think the product will be like of what you think it should be like before the product even comes out like you know you know an apple macbook is gonna be expensive and it's gonna run a little hot and the same thing goes with hp omen stuff like you know over the years it's just they don't make particularly high performance machines that run cool that's just not what they've been doing at least not for five or six years they've been bringing hp omens to the market this year's a little bit different this is the omen 15 for 2020 and they changed so much stuff like we we just got to go in so this is a machine that comes in two variants an amd version and an intel version now people always ask me why do you get the intel version dave don't you like are you an intel fanboy listen as a reviewer if you're gonna review a product particularly for one that has questionable thermal performance in the past you're gonna get the hottest configuration you want the one that has the highest risk of not performing properly so it's an intel version and it's a high spec intel version to get these things as hot as possible because if these things underperform here now you know because if i got like a a ryzen version and it got like a low end gpu if it performs great you have no idea how good the the hot ones are going to run right you get it okay this is the fully specced out intel version and let's just jump into performance it has excellent performance the components are very powerful so it pushes out great frame rates and games and thermally there's no throttling the temperatures are comfortable fan noise isn't crazy loud this is a machine that is just so unlike hp they've never had a device that was cooled as well as this like their whole hp lineup for years this is the best by far now if there's one complaint i have about the thermal system it's the fans don't go completely silent at idle there's no way to actually turn these fans down enough so that they're inaudible like the fan is on right now the mic is picking it up ever so slightly right you can probably hear it it's not annoying but if you work in an environment or you have some kind of work which requires a completely silent system this ain't going to be it but aside from that thermally it's on point okay i'm just going to the design of this thing because they revamped the exterior of this thing as well this year it now has this diamond on the front of the laptop that's this bluish green gradient fade it's very obvious like if you look at this you can tell if you know your laptop so this is an hp omen but at the same time it's not super obnoxious right it's not a glowing one it doesn't light up and it's subtle enough at least to me i feel like some people are gonna hate this but i personally like it i think this is something that sets it apart from thousands of other laptops out there but at the same time it's not annoying it's a metal build that's metal on the top it's got metal on the keyboard deck it's a unibody chassis and the bottom is also metal there is a couple issues i have in terms of the kind of build quality the hinge i would say is a little looser than i'd like like the screen hinge when you lift it up and down it's got a little more play than i'd like to not like a wobble but i just feel like the hinges should be slightly tighter but there's also this issue where on the side of the laptop on this yeah you can see it here the screen on a laptop rests on the keyboard deck when it's closed right and on the actual palm rest area there is material there so that when you close it it rests on that palm rest area but on the back half of that screen there's nothing holding that screen up like there's nothing supporting it so let's say you do lift your laptop up like you want to pick up to go somewhere if you grab it on the front here it's no problem you're pushing down on it and the palm rest area is supporting it but if you pick it up on the back half of it there's this weird flex that just happens to be there i don't like it i don't know if that's going to affect the longevity or the durability of the screen because it's not like you're cranking it hard but i just feel like it was a bit of a design miss when they built this thing i just wish it wasn't there because otherwise the build on this thing is fantastic the port selection is pretty nice you got your regular usb connections but you also have an sd card slot and an ethernet jack and you have two display outputs and there's also a third like they have a dongle that they include so there's technically three video outputs on this machine if you so choose so it's a healthy dose of ports the screen that i have on this unit is the upgraded 4k 120 hertz panel i normally stray away from 4k panels on laptops particularly gaming laptops because i like my high refresh and often they don't come in high refresh this comes in 120 hertz and it supports g-sync so very fast very smooth bright great colors i really like this screen now this is the upgraded panel so if i had to choose one of the panels as like a universal recommendation it'd be that first upgrade so 1080p 144 hertz very easy recommendation it's not super expensive but it gives like great gaming experiences you want that faster refresh uh the keyboard this is an excellent layout i feel like this is like the model keyboard layout for a laptop nice clean arrow key clusters and dedicated page up page down keys and they're in this really obvious spot the reason why it's so good is because this is the same layout as a regular desktop keyboard right you don't have to reorient yourself just because of the laptop you know where stuff is because you've typed on a regular keyboard i think that's why i like this layout so much the keys themselves are a little small but they're responsive i think most people really enjoy using this keyboard now the lighting comes in a few variants this is the fully upgraded one like it's got per key rgb the base model comes in a fully red like only red lighting and if you pay 10 bucks you can get four zone so pay the 10 bucks i feel like you'll regret it otherwise the trackpad is okay like the gestures and tracking are fine it's glass surface very smooth i like it but the mechanism for the click is it feels sluggish almost like not as responsive as i'd like it to be i think it's just the button underneath now if you take a look at the insides the first thing i noticed was the significantly improved thermal system this year it now vents out the back and one of the sides the previous omens have always vented out the back and often times not enough of it but now it's got bigger fans three big heat pipes this thing is done well there's two ram slots two nvme bays and a 70 watt hour battery now in this unit i have a 4k panel i'm getting three and a half hours of battery life i feel like if you had the 1080p panel it'd be like four maybe four and a half hours to be expected considering how powerful the system is but that is what we have for battery life and then the speakers on the side they are classically mediocre as you'd expect on a gaming laptop you know that's maybe the next frontier we've solved thermals speakers are next okay i want to close off this conversation with this topic of well the industry right now a long time ago when the first gaming laptop came to the market i'm sure it had terrible thermals i don't know which company made it i don't know how bad the numbers actually were but there's no way it was a properly cooled machine but look where we are today july 2020 we're looking at hp omen that is properly cooled it took hp five or six years to land on this but they've they've done it right this is something that i feel like this is symbolic of the entire industry the entire laptop industry you look at any company out there hp acer asus lenovo alienware razer they're all capable of making machines now that do not overheat which is awesome like all the memes that people are making over the years sure they're expensive and sure the fans can be loud sometimes but at the very least they run cool that's a win okay that's the hp omen i think this is a a very good machine uh considering its price especially all right hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music] you
