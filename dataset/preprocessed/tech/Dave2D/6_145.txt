okay so the zenfone 7 and 7 pro were just announced these are the successor to the zenfone 6 from last year now this phone if you're unfamiliar with the zenfone 6 had like the full screen up front like no notch no camera no punctual nothing and in order to get a camera up front it used this flipping mechanism it would pop up and it was it was cool now this phone had one not issue it was like a it was a wish item that people just wished for everyone wanted this thing to have an oled panel it had an ips panel it to be able to hit that 500 price point last year and they did it 500 really good phone but no oled panel they've updated it this year so that the zenfone 7 now has an oled panel a 90 hertz oled panel from samsung and it's a really nice screen it's 1080p it's really fast and smooth for the people that can appreciate it the colors are better everything about this panel is just nicer than the previous ips panel it really was the biggest complaint that people had about the zenfone 6 and they've addressed it this is a much nicer screen uh the speakers they're technically stereo again but it still has the same issue like one of the things i noted about the zenfone 6 is that even though it's stereo the bottom speaker sounds so much louder than the top speaker i was hoping that they'd address it i feel like this is actually a pretty important part of the media experience like when you have such a nice screen it's uninterrupted and then your stereo sound feels kind of unbalanced because like the right or the left depending on which we've oriented it is just so much more heavy that it just takes away from the overall media experience but the screen is so much better this year particularly with the contrast and blacks on the image now in order to achieve this type of uninterrupted display they have to do that camera trick where it flips and this year the camera is improved it's faster it's better it's possibly stronger like the hinge it is a significantly improved camera system now one of the concerns that people had when the zenfone 6 launched last year was durability right like this flippy cam how durable is it how many times gonna go up and down how fragile is it how rough can you be with it and i think it spoke for itself zach over at jerry riggs everything did a pretty good test on it and it is durable like way more durable than you might imagine something like this to be and over the course of the year it seems to have held up like lots of people have purchased the zenfone 6 and camera durability is a non-issue uh so the new one it's slightly faster on launch so i'll launch both at the same time like just the flip up see how the new one just pops up a little bit faster it also drops down a little bit faster and it sounds different so this is the new one this is the old one so it's it's just an ever slightly different sound to me i don't know if you could hear it there it's like a smoother sound and even visually it looks like it actuates in a more fluid manner the camera module is a little bit bigger this year it's now housing three lenses instead of two from last year uh but it doesn't feel like it's any different in durability at least not that i can tell now the three sensors are different this year the main sensors the sony imx 686 a pretty popular sensor for that upper mid-range phone it's also got the 12 megapixel wide angle and a 10x that's a lie 3x optical zoom on the telephoto it goes up to a 10x digital zoom i can't post photos yet but my early impressions of the camera system is that number one it's so much better than last year's camera system i mean it's just got updated hardware but two if you pair this thing with gcam like last year's zenfone 6 if you put g cam on this thing it just shot really nice g cam on this hardware we've seen it right there's a bunch of phones out there like the k30 pro and the pocophone f2 pro when you pair g cam with the sensor it delivers some really nice photos so the back of the phone no longer has the rear capacitive fingerprint sensor like the zenfone 6 it's now moved to the side on the power button it's like an integrated capacitive sensor there's something strange on this particular unit i think this is just an engineering sample it's a little bit rough like the actual power button has some sharp edges to it but the actual fingerprint component like the sensing is quite fast i just hope that the retail units resolve this kind of sharper edge on that button okay some other miscellaneous things it still has that huge 5000 milliamp hour battery it's so big it's been updated to support 30 watt fast charging which is quite a bit faster than the 18 watt fast charging on the zenfone 6 but it still does not support wireless charging and i feel like it's a bit of a miss on this device it does have two kind of battery features or tweaks that you can do that have been taken from the rog phone three number one you can limit the maximum charge so instead of filling up to 100 every time you can drop that down to like 80 90 whatever you want and the second thing is that you can reduce the charging rate so instead of filling it up at a super fast 30 watt fast charge rate you can fill it up a little bit slower and the whole idea behind both of those customizations is that it extends the life of the battery like not like your day-to-day battery life but the long-term durability or longevity of the battery in the phone and it's just something that enthusiasts will appreciate but even if you don't really care about that stuff if you kept up with that routine it just makes these phones last longer now in terms of the soc the zenfone 7 pro gets the kind of boosted overclocked version the snapdragon 865 plus but the regular zenfone 7 just gets the regular 865. and i think the other differences is that the regular zenfone 7 doesn't have any kind of optical image stabilization on the camera systems uh okay so that's the good stuff right there's two things that i think are concerns though number one if you noticed i did not mention headphone jack this year they removed it there's no headphone jack on the seven i think that was one of the best features of the six this was like one of the i personally thought it was one of the coolest features of this phone like it sounds so stupid to be talking about a headphone jack on a phone being its coolest feature but considering what this thing was and what it delivered this was kind of unique for its class uh no headphone jack this year number two this is the big one price and availability this phone is not launching right away in the united states or north america and this was a phone like the zenfone 6 was a very difficult phone to get it just sold out quickly and it was very hard for people all around the world to get and maybe that's why they kind of launched it in a more limited geographic area this time to kind of make sure that supply was good but the other thing is price these have been bumped up in price i don't know at the point of shooting this what the pricing is i just i actually don't know the numbers but i do know that it is more expensive i don't blame them like if they could have made this thing the same 500 price tag as last year's phone they would have made last year's phone 500 bucks and put in an amoled screen right but they've bumped it up with better tech better camera sensors but it's just invariably going to be more expensive but that is the zenfone 7 pro hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
