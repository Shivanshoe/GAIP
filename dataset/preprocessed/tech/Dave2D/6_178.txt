okay so Apple announced their newly updated 13-inch MacBook Pro and this is a device that's been updated across the board everything has just been refreshed except for the screen it's still using a 13 inch screen but there's this weird like misinformation or negativity around the launch of this product particularly about the CPU so I thought I'd make a video just to clarify some things and hopefully this will save you some money if you're interested in picking up one of the new MacBook Pros so the thing that's controversial right now and I woke up this morning people are tweeting at me people are writing my old videos like comments about this people are upset visibly upset that Apple is using old 8th gen CPUs in these new 20/20 MacBook Pros and it's like people are like Dave how could they do this F Apple this is the worst listen okay you're upset but let me explain what's going on here when you look at devices like a 13-inch MacBook Pro the difference between an 8th gen Intel CPU and a 10th gen Intel CPU if they'd use one in the base model that MacBook Pro is very small the only time you'd see a big benefit going to that 10th gentian is if you're doing stuff that's graphically capable like if you're doing video editing or playing games or anything that's got graphical requirements yes those new 10th densha's will be better for it they claim like an 80% improvement based on my tests on windows-based laptops it's like closer to 50 maybe 60 percent real-world improvement they are better but here's the thing not everybody wants that stuff not everybody wants extra GPU power for their workflow so the fact that they're using those older 8th gen chips in the base model MacBook Pro is actually a really good thing because you know what else comes with those new 10th gen chips a fattie price tag every Windows laptop that ever viewed in the past like 6 months that use those new 10th times they've been bumped up in price by like 150 maybe 200 bucks sometimes it is something that Intel is doing it's not Apple obviously or any manufacturer when Intel raises the price of those new chips that the cost of the product goes up so every company that's been doing this like the consumers get screwed right we're just paying more for stuff that we may not necessarily need the fact that Apple is using those old 8th gen chips that have slower GPUs but still very capable quad-core processors it's actually a good thing because we don't have to pay extra money like this stuff is already really expensive from Apple if your developer and all you're doing is just like building on Xcode you just want a good quad-core processor you don't want that GPU you want to pay extra for that GPU but they all have these newly updated keyboards we've talked about this forever the magic keyboard in these new MacBooks are so much more reliable and this marks the end of the whole butterfly keyboard era like this is it there's no more butterfly switches in the entire Apple laptop repertoire which is awesome now they had to like in order to fit that new keyboard in here they had to make it a little bit thicker I think it's 0.7 millimeters thicker it's relatively insignificant it was well worth it now if you do decide to go with 1/10 genocide to upgrade from the base model to the 10th gen stuff in addition to that faster GPU you also have access to faster and more RAM I can get up to 32 gigs and it is low powered ddr4 which the older stuff didn't have access to in certain applications and workflows that faster RAM can be useful but most people it's not a significant upgrade it is nice though it's still a 720p webcam and there's no Wi-Fi 6 on any of the configurations of the 13-inch MacBook Pro now if you're someone who's looking at these new devices with the interest of using it for video editing because of that new GPU you like hey maybe that might be a good fit for me it's really dependent like the performance is extremely dependent on a V application they're using and B the camera that you're using so I've tested these GPUs with premiere and like it really depends sometimes you're getting good performance sometimes you're getting very unimpressive performance so you'll have to wait for my regular review of the device to actually get some better data but if your video editor you want to wait for your specific workflow to be tested before you go in on it now compared to the 13-inch MacBook Air and this is a question I feel like a lot of you guys been asking like should I get that 13-inch MacBook Air or this new 13-inch MacBook Pro they are quite different and because the price tag you might be drawn to the MacBook Air it is a lighter machine ever-so-slightly and it's also got a slightly longer battery life and it's a little bit cheaper but it is not built for processor intensive tasks like the moment you push it hard for an extended period of time it chokes and the heirs have always done that that really is the weakness of the MacBook Air the pro is just more suited for even moderately intensive tasks it also has a brighter screen better speakers but a large number of people would already be really happy on the MacBook Air and wouldn't need the extra features on the pro now if you were interested in that upcoming rumored 14 inch device who knows when it's gonna come out maybe it's gonna be for like an ARM based MacBook maybe it's gonna be for an AMD based MacBook which would be awesome who knows but it's not this one so we just have to keep waiting I'm just gonna throw one last thing out there if you were considering like a high respect 13-inch MacBook Pro one of these new ones I'm just want to push the idea out of a 16 inch MacBook Pro like those are just way more capable but because those things are in the refurbished store now like they're available for a significant discount it may be worth it they just test out the configurations see if you can get a 16 inch device for not too much more than a high SPECT 13 inch MacBook Pro because it's just a way more capable system if you're willing to carry something that's bigger and heavier and has a shorter battery life okay I think that wraps us up hope you guys are informed of what's going on with Intel and Apple but I hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we liked it subs if you loved it I will see you guys next time
