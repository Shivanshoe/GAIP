okay let's talk about the iPhone 12 so there was a time like 10 12 months ago when the rumors of iPhone 12 stuff starts to come out there were all these like wish lists and predictions as to what features would be coming out in the iPhone 12 and you know there was really cool stuff 120 Hertz screens smaller notches new designs new shapes new sizes but there was this one feature that was like it was the thing that I was most hopeful for it was the feature that I thought would change that fundamentally changed how I viewed iPhones there was a rumor that the iPhone 12 would be using USBC Universal charging and people rejoiced everywhere iPhone users were excited Android users were excited the the unreleased I've 112 is excited but I think the rumors were false it does not look like we're getting USBC charging on the iPhone 12 it looks like we're stuck with lightning ports again so I was sent a bunch of these kind of dummy units I was sent three of these metal blanks or aluminum blanks I'm not sure what material they're made of they're definitely metal but these are more for like technical accuracy and I was also sent three of these plastic kind of aesthetically finished ones that are meant to represent the supposed look and feel of the finished iPhone 12 the accuracy of these things are debatable right these are all just based on rumors and leaked CAD files but there's definitely a lot to take away from just these dummy models so I just want to dig in on this one so there's three sizes that I have here these suppose at iPhone 12 the iPhone 12 pro and lastly the iPhone 12 pro max they've been redesigned for this year it has a familiar but distinctly new look the first thing I wanna talk about is the screen we're looking at a five point four inch screen on the small one 6.1 inch on the middle and six point seven inch on the big boy iPhone 12 pro max now personally I'm very drawn to the small iPhone 12 like this is in my opinion the perfect size for phone so just to put this into perspective of what this feels like or looks like in terms of size so this is the old-school se for a lot of people the old-school se was like the perfect size same size as the iPhone 5 and 5s this was I really like this phone and if you see my older videos I have raved about the size and functionality this phone for a very long time the iPhone se - like the new one this I mean this is the smallest iPhone that's available right now in the market in terms of like buying one new but this is actually a bigger phone than the upcoming iPhone 12 look I really feel like the size of this small iPhone 12 is gonna be a hit people are gonna love the size of this phone that gets super one handable like you can see on the screen you can stretch everywhere on this thing you can hit all the corners without moving your hand too much it's going to be an excellent size for a lot of people now the other two phones the iPhone 12 pro and the iPhone 12 pro max these are going to be the more premium phones right they're gonna have a better camera system probably better screens but based on just these dummy models there's actually this feature if you want to call it that that exists on these two that is not on the base or small iPhone 12 it's this weird cutout or shape that's on the left side of the phone so the side that's on the volume rocker and I mean there's a lot of speculation as to what this is for right is it the SIM card tray that's now moved on to the left side is it for an antenna is it for a smart connector no one knows for sure but they put this in the CAD design for a reason like I feel like there's some significance to this if I had to guess what it was like and this is just like a if I have to guess I think it's for the antenna I don't think it's for the smart connector like there's some rumor saying that because the future iPhones are supposedly moving off of ports completely and they're just gonna use some kind of magnetic connection for charging and data that could be what it's for but I feel it gets for some kind of 5g antenna that's my guess and that would explain why it's only in the premium models maybe I don't know but it is it's something different that the iPhone 12 does not have now moving on to the displays if you look at the notches of these things they are the same size notch as the previous iPhone 11 let's say it's the same size much as any notched iPhone but I don't think these notches are to be technically accurate in terms of their size I think that when it comes to again case manufacturing this notch this cutout that they have to make four notches is not super important that's more for like screen protectors and stuff I think that this stuff can change that being said there have been rumors on both sides of the fence but we'll have to wait until the launch to really confirm that I want to talk about promotion are like 120 Hertz displays this is something that basically every flagship phone is putting out nowadays right high refresh screens Samsung pixel one plus they're all doing it it is weird that Apple has held off for as long as they did when I use the word weird I should change that word it's not weird it's unfortunate the reasoning I think and I think most people would agree with this the reason why Apple hasn't switched over to high refresh screens is likely because of battery life it's something that Apple's iPhones have been remarkably consistent about over the years right when they put out a phone their phones have good battery life especially considering how small the batteries are in these phones so I think for Apple in order to implement something like this they need to make sure that the software and hardware can can actually do it well like it has built to not just have regular variable refresh rate like they need to down clock that refresh rate to something really slow so on their Apple watch the Apple watch series 5 I think they can slow that screen into 1 Hertz like one frame per second it's very slow but they use it when it's a still image right and that would save battery life a lot I think that type of aggressive reduction in refresh rate is what Apple needs to keep the battery life on these phones as good as they have been in the past like if they put these phones out and you know everyone's saying like oh my gosh these are like you know half the battery life that they used to because they have these wonderfully fast greens I don't think it'll been worth it for apples so they've been waiting to get that tech dialed in so they can do it and I think I hope that this is the year because if they go for one more year with 60 Hertz refresh rate screens I think like the tech enthusiasts of this world will just lose their ass because it's it's a thing up personally I've talked this with for my videos I don't think it's that big of a deal I used to think that high refresh screens were like the greatest thing in the world because the first time you see it it's the coolest stuff but then once you used it enough it's like it's really nice but it's just a fast screen in regards to the camera systems the camera clusters in the backs of these dummy iPhones feel inconclusive like there's just different some of them have two lenses some have three I think these are just derived from the existing iPhone 11 lineup in terms are just like what the camera layout would be like we don't know I will say though just based on tradition or history of what Apple's camera systems have been like in their phones when they do a body change like this like when they have a new design they usually don't focus too much of their efforts on making the cameras amazing because there's so much other stuff that's going on so much new stuff that I don't feel like they put as much effort as much focus on the cameras on those years so I feel like the 20/20 i from 12 will have an improved camera system but it'll be like a big jump like the way we saw like from the tennis to the 11 okay I want to get back to the port so yeah lightning ports but the bigger topic I never made a video in this was the whole thing about the charger or the charging brick that is supposedly not going to come inside these phones and I don't know man it feels almost impossible for them to do that I mean they done pulled things in the past and truthfully when I look at electronics that have purchased stuff like Wireless mice and you know battery packs there are things things like need charging that often don't include a charging brick but I feel like when it comes to a phone especially the iPhone it would be a really the messaging would be so hard like how do you explain that to your customers I could be like we have the world's first phone that doesn't include a charging brick and can you imagine like the keynote whoever's on stage Tim Cook what are they gonna say you know how do they how do they message that maybe they'll give people the options to like you know if you're buying a phone you can if you'd want you can include a freed five watt charger it's not like we need that stuff you know we're technically is anyone watching this video I can almost guarantee you have a 5 watt charging brick at home right you don't need another one but that's not the point or is it like I'm I'm torn I feel like it's a move that doesn't make any sense but at the same time makes so much sense because those bricks are everywhere and the cost the environmental waste behind it all that it's a weird one but if they don't implement or they don't include a charger in these boxes I can't I like you know there's gonna be someone out there like a person who goes to the phone doesn't know that much about tech buys the phone and gets one was like I can't charge this thing because I don't have a five volt charging brick or any kind of charging brick at all I can't yeah that's a weird one to me all right pricing this is the last thing I want to mention this one the small ones supposed to be coming in at six hundred and fifty bucks again this is rumored right the pro and the pro max was supposed to come at regular pricing thousand and eleven hundred respectively but this guy the small one supposed to come in at six hundred and fifty US dollars that is super cool for them to introduce a new phone that looks like this with the knotch and face ID and I think this will be a very popular phone now I don't think that the iPhone 12 like the base model will have promotion I don't think that they'll be able to put it into this chassis it's not so much the price right it's the battery size I don't think that a small battery like this would be able to support high refresh in the way that Apple would want to implement that tech right in order to do it you just need a bigger battery for like the 12 pro 12 pro mass could possibly do it I don't think this guy could do it which is unfortunate but at the same time a an appropriate choice okay so that's the iPhone 12 lineup or at least the iPhone 12 dummy lineup I think these are gonna be pretty cool phones what do you think if you could choose a size right now which one would it be I would definitely go for the smallest one like 100% that's gonna be my phone unless there's some weird stuff that happens with it but the small one what about you okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we liked it subs if you loved it I'll see you guys next time [Music]
