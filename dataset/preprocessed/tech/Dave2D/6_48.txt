get over here okay so asus announced a bunch of new devices but i requested two of them to be sent here some pre-production units of the devices that i thought were most interesting so first up is the studio book 16. this is the one i'm personally most interested in it's probably going to be the device that i end up buying like this is a very interesting device to me and then there's also the viva book this is a slightly more inexpensive version of the studio book but let's start off with the studio book so what makes this thing special this is i mean it's it's the best of both worlds it's an amazing gaming laptop it's pretty thin it's got powerful components it's got a high refresh 16 inch panel that's all the stuff you'd expect on a high-end gaming laptop right but it's also arguably the best content creation laptop you can get right now it's got a super fast sd card reader it also has the availability of an oled panel this one is in it i'll show you in a second but there is a third generation oled panel from samsung which looks really nice but there's also this jog dial and this is something else so when i first saw pictures of this there's a couple things that ran through my mind like number one how useful is that really but two doesn't this just get in the way like this is right in the middle of where you would place your wrist when you're using the device and well to answer that question no because they've done this in a really smart way so they've sunken it into the device like it doesn't protrude it actually sits flush with the keyboard deck it's actually slightly below the keyboard deck so that when you close it like if i close the lid on this device it doesn't hit the screen that'd be stupid if they built it like that but yeah it was a concern i had like how does it work and it's just because it's sunken in it feels like it protrudes like when you use it it feels like a regular dial that sticks off of a surface but it doesn't and when you want to use it you place your hands there and it's exactly where we'd want a dial to be now the idea of a dial isn't new right we've seen other laptops before where they had like a volume dial and the ability to control volume with like a tactile dial is nice right it has a nice feeling to it but this ain't no volume dial this is on a whole new level so this is built as a microsoft wheel device like the surface dial so it has excellent window support and integration and a ton of functionality because asus has added custom software and customizable controls to do a lot of stuff with this dial so you have your basic controls like volume and brightness controls that are built right into the desktop but within custom apps like creative apps from adobe you have custom controls where you can tweak things like in premiere you can manipulate your timeline in photoshop you can adjust your brushes you can adjust the layers you can do so much stuff without taking your hands off the keyboard and that's the key right obviously there's hot keys and you can click stuff with your mouse but the idea being your hand is on the keyboard already and without moving anything around or even moving your mouse cursor away from whatever it is that you're working on you can adjust stuff and for me because i've been video editing that's what i've been doing with it it's just really nice now i've been using this third party tool it's made by a company called monogram or they used to be called palette and it's basically like a jog dial with a whole bunch of other controls that i use to manipulate things in my video editing program right in premiere but to have it built into the laptop and not just built into the laptop on the side we need to like reach over to get it this is in front of you in the exact position that your hand is already in and even in games the ability to control your volume on the fly without removing your hands from the wasd keys or moving your mouse anywhere like you're in the middle of a match you know there's a guy around the corner you just crank up your volume a little bit you're listening for him you can do that because it's right where your hand is you don't have to move anything it's just you're zoned in you get the kill you lower the volume back okay so the screens there's two variants this one is the ips option it's 16 inches 1440p 16x10 aspect ratio it's a really nice screen it's like a high refresh gaming capable screen but if you want the best of the best if you want like the best viewing experience you want a super color accurate and very vibrant viewing experience they have an oled panel it's the same size 16 inches also 16 by 10 but it's 4k it's hdr it's super color accurate super bright super colorful it's a fantastic panel now this is the third generation of oled tech for laptops from samsung we've seen the first and second in previous devices i've covered and in the past one of the biggest issues i've seen when it comes to oled screens is color accuracy as the brightness fluctuates so the way that i've noticed oled panels in the past is you have to dial in your color accuracy at a specific brightness that you're going to be working at and it's usually like you know let's say 300 nits right you set it at that but then the moment you increase that brightness to let's say 350 or 400 or you drop the brightness the color accuracy drops drastically that's no longer the case now inside we're looking at amd 5000 series cpus with an rtx 3070 gpu it's loaded with very powerful components and a fairly large 90 watt hour battery but because these are pre-production units i don't feel right doing you know proper testing on it i feel like any kind of numbers again with battery life or even performance is probably not accurate of the retail product so i'll wait until the retail units come in for a proper review of it but it's very promising and the thermal system from what i'm seeing is more than adequate for the stuff that's inside here a quick note about the inputs so there's a number pad on the keyboard for the people that need it but there's also a third button on the trackpad and it's something like if you've ever messed with cad programs you use that third button often right and if you have a mouse sure no problem but if you're in a pinch third mouse button is pretty nice okay uh ports real quick before i wrap this one up uh the real port of note is the super fast sd card reader like i think it does almost a gigabyte per second and that is the studio book 16. love this thing okay if you're on a tighter budget because i believe this thing is going to go for i think it's a little bit less than 2000 at launch but we'll see okay this guy vivo book so this one tried to open it the wrong way this one does not have the dial right at least not a visible dial but it does have a digital dial and this is cool now to activate it you pull down from the top right and it'll illuminate you can control it with your finger now in this dial it works in a very similar fashion to that physical dial that we saw previously but it's all done through the software and gestures and it's very responsive i didn't think it would be like when you control it around like you can see there's very little lag on that on the integration part but even like getting the like look how quickly this is coming on and off the screen like you want it on it's there you want it off it's gone it's super super responsive and it's really well done i would say that if this tech could be implemented into all of their track pads it would be amazing because i feel like the dial is that useful the other version it's cool but because you gotta like carve metal out and fit it in physically it's a lot more complex but this maybe they could just do this with all of their track pads in the future i think this is a really nice implementation and something that almost everyone's going to find useful the ability to control stuff without taking your hand off of your keyboard it's cool okay so this device is a little bit less expensive because it does not have the fastest gpu it's running a 3050 ti capable but if you're running some high-end stuff you're probably going to want a more powerful gpu which is why the studio book is available but this is a really solid device with the fantastic 16-inch oled screen available as an option now the port selection isn't as robust as the studio book like the sd card reader is like a micro sd and it's just overall just not as high end but if you're looking for something at a lower price point because i believe these start at 1400 bucks if i'm not mistaken these are really good value in my opinion but these are awesome devices for creators and those dials are super cool i actually hope that they implement the trackpad version in all of their future devices i think everyone would appreciate it okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
