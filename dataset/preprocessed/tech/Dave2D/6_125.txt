okay the rtx 3070 from nvidia this is their least expensive and likely gonna be their most popular of their three recently announced gpus the 3080 the 3090 and now the 500 3070 and the reason why i think it's gonna be so popular is because of that price to performance ratio because nvidia claims that this gpu delivers similar if not better performance to the 2080 ti this was a 1200 gpu at launch obviously it's a much older gpu it's a couple years old at this point but this was the flagship this was the king prior to the 30 series launch and my first reaction on that was oh my god the 37 just straight up murdered the 2080 ti this 500 card seems incredible but then you take a look at the details and you start to notice some things that may be of concern first the video memory there's only eight gigs of vram in here and it has lower memory bandwidth so i approached this review with a bit of skepticism a healthy dose of it but the reality is this is a great card it has some quirks but it's an excellent gpu okay so the benchmarks first real quickly it does match the 2080 ti in some cases it performs better in some cases it performs worse but in general it's really close it's better in most 1440p and 1080p games i think that's kind of like the strength of this gpu it's more of a wash when it comes to 4k games like there seems to be a more even spread of games that benefit from the 3070 versus the 2080 ti when it comes to ray tracing and dlss it's kind of a mixed bag again like sometimes the 3070 is better sometimes the 2080 ti is better in synthetic benchmarks the 3070 tends to lose out versus the 2080 ti it's really close but just in general the 3070 performs worse when it comes to canned performance benchmarks now all of this i can forgive like any kind of deficiency that the 3070 seems to have over the 20ti it's really small if it exists and it's so much cheaper like this is a legitimately 500 card or in theory it should be 500 we'll get to that in a second but this even right now two years later you go look on ebay it's like a 700 gpu it's still really expensive so if you can buy a 30 70 this is an awesome car like nothing else really bangs like this for 500 bucks right now the card itself is also small like really small for a founder's edition card it's great for certain itx builds it's got the same kind of vibe as the 3080 and the 3090 so it's got that industrial design to it i don't think it looks as nice though like it's got the same kind of design lines like the whole fin focused design language but it's not as nice looking to me when it's mounted in a case like it's a more standard look probably from the more generic looking bottom plate the geforce logo on the side doesn't light up it just seems to be painted or anodized on there's no leds behind that thing and the fans are a slightly different configuration than the 3080 and 3090. it's the same kind of idea where there's two fans one of them blowing through the device the other fan exhausting at the back but both of the fans are on the same side so there's a very distinct visual difference between this and the other two the power connector on the 3070 fe still uses that new 12-pin connection on the 3070 it's mounted perpendicular to the gpu so when you have it plugged up it just comes straight at you the 3080 and the 3090 they kind of angle them slightly so that when you have it plugged up it's just a little bit easier to route your cable in a more tidy fashion the fans are pretty quiet they're not as big as the fans on the 3080 or the 3090 but they still need to spin very fast to keep the whole gpu cool even at full wattage now i want to talk about the quirks of the gpu let's talk about the ram first with eight gigs of ram there's no way to spin it the rtx 3070 does not have a lot of video memory and when you compare it to like a 2080 ti this has 11 gigs you compare it to like the 2070 or 2080 those are two-year-old gpus that already had eight gigs of vram so it's weird to see a current generation nvidia gpu come out with yet again eight gigs of gddr6 it's strange but at the same time it's at least to me it's acceptable like the reality is there are a lot of games that can break through that eight gigabyte limit right if you push some games in 4k even 1440p games you can break eight gigs of vram pretty readily if you want to and there's some games i can use up like 12 15 gigs of vram like you saw microsoft flight simulator you saw the benchmarks right the reason why the 3070 handles it worse than 2080 ti is because it's a very video memory demanding game so yes there are many games that can actually use more than 8 gigs of vram but by reducing the amount of memory they put into this thing it just allowed them to sell it at a cheaper price right maybe that's what they needed to have a 500 rtx 3070 fe the vast majority of games will not go beyond that eight gig limit i think even in four to five years time you'll still be able to play plenty of games maxed out with eight gigs of vram and watch me eat my words like cyberpunk's gonna come out it's gonna need like 16 gigs of video memory the reality is though it's more like the unoptimized shooters those are the ones that tend to chew up video memory the fastest okay last thing i want to talk about stock levels the 3080 and 3090 launch were pretty poor to say the least i say poor in terms of like availability it was really hard for consumers to pick up these gpus it was stupidly hard in canada they had like seven cards and linus had five of those so it was really hard for people to pick up these things i hope that the 3070 is launched better now they delayed this launch like they pushed this thing back by a week or something like that so that stock levels could be at a more appropriate level but this is what is holding this thing back i think that this gpu like it doesn't matter how you spin it this is such a good value for 500 obviously it's not i don't think it matches everything that people hoped it to be like if you expected it to be a 2080 ti killer like straight up eviscerate the 20 ti at 500 bucks it doesn't do that there are certain advantages there is one other thing i haven't mentioned yet because of that vram difference like this thing having 11 gigs and this thing only having eight i've noticed that my renders are actually noticeably faster with the 2080 ti than the 3070 but i think most people picking this thing up are probably doing games and not editing videos but that is the reality of the situation i think this is a great card if you can get your hands on it i hope to goodness that they have good stock levels on the 30 70. okay that wraps up this video hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs you've loved it i'll see you guys next time
