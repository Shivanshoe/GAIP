all right so Samsung just announced three new galaxy as 20 phones the s20 regular the s 20 plus and the s 20 ultra and I was able to spend a little bit of time with all three of these and this video will talk about the differences between them and as well as like my overall thoughts on all three of these phones so this year the focus of the new S 20 series is definitely the camera system so this here is the s10 and you'll notice right away the difference between this phone and the s 20s is the back camera modules the new as 20 phones have them positioned over to the left instead of being right in the center like this and they're just a completely brand new camera system so starting at the bottom the s20 has a triple camera setup and the main feature here is that 64 megapixel sensor which is a lot more megapixels than what the s10 offered this was a 16 megapixel sensor so it's a huge jump in terms of megapixel count and that sensor is for the zoom lens the s20 plus has the same triple camera setup but there's a fourth lens a time of flight lens or time flight sensor and that's for augmented reality or any kind of depth sensing software so stuff like portrait mode photography can take advantage of a time-of-flight sensor but the main actual optical lenses for the s20 plus is going to be the same as the s20 but the big boy phone that as tony ultra is going to have the most robust camera system of the three and it has a slightly different camera system altogether this thing has the 108 megapixel sensor but it's for the regular lens not the zoom lens or the ultra wide now all three of these phones have a very improved camera system compared to the previous generation but the thing that they're talking about the most is the zoom the regular S 20 and the S 20 plus have a 30x zoom the s 20 ultra has a 100x zoom which is like that is freakin insane I've only been able to spend a little bit of time with these camera systems and the zooms they're impressive in a sense that you're able to zoom quite extensively but the pictures don't look particularly clean if you expected like perfect optical zoom with the stuff you're not going to get that what you do get is just the capability to zoom way more than you can with most other flagships but it's not like a CSI level zoom now the way that they're able to achieve this type of zoom ability is partially through optics and the s20 ultra even has that telescoping lens on the inside but the vast majority of the zoom is done through digital processing and the zooms seem to work reasonably well if the photos have high enough contrast but if you're shooting something that's very flat it's tough for the software to pull out details properly the camera system the hole though feels a lot better than what I've seen from Samsung before I do need to spend more time with it to give like a more kind of summarized conclusion but I do like what I've seen so far one thing it did notice with the camera system that was neat the shutter button has this very unique tactile response so when you press the shutter button and this is something that's very difficult to convey in a video because I'm talking about a physical feel and this is a video but when you press that shutter button you can feel like a motor or something it almost feels like there's something sliding up and down inside the camera it's obviously just something they're doing with the haptic motor like there's probably not a moving or sliding mechanism inside the phone that feels that pronounced but it feels so cool when you take these voters it actually makes it feel like you're taking a picture with an actual DSLR when there's actual weight to the decision of pressing that shutter button the other main feature with these phones are their screens are all equipped with 120 Hertz capable displays which is a very smooth experience I've talked about it in previous videos but the one thing that was interesting is that these devices are supposedly capped at 1080p if you go up to 120 Hertz which is a little bit strange now I don't know if this is just what the units that we had at the briefing maybe the retail models will be able to go to 1440p 120 Hertz but the units I saw were capped at 1080p at 120 Hertz but they look really really nice I mean it's a Samsung display they do have a slightly thinner top bezel than what the s10 had from the previous generation but the biggest difference for me was actually the curvature of the glass I have talked about this and so many of my videos I've never loved how Samsung curves their top glass so aggressively it is a lot better on the s20 there's still a curve there right if you're someone that wants that premium vibe to the phone with that sexy curved glass it's still there is just not as pronounced I think they've just done it in a smarter way like you still have that curve but you don't have the accidental touches and accidental swipes that you get with overly curved glass the other change on the screens is that the punchbowl camera is now in the middle instead of being on the side like the s10 but they've also removed the pillow shaped camera so on the s10 this is the SN plus and the SM plus it has a pillow shaped camera because they have two lenses in there like a wider front facing camera as well as like a regular front facing they got rid of it so there's only one camera up front now but you still get to kind of focal lengths so you get like a regular and a wide but I think it's more of a cropping thing that they're doing instead of having to actual lenses the rest of the phone has very much the same kind of Samsung vibe as you would expect it's got the glass back it's got the aluminum frame there is however no headphone jack in the s20 series it's gone but I feel like there was a bit of a trade-off here see what the s20 phones they have significantly bigger batteries than what the s10 had so I don't know if it's related like maybe they could have bumped up the battery size anyways and kept the jack but these as xx phones have almost a 15% increase in battery size compared to what the s10 phones offered in terms of the physical size all of the s20 phones are big the s20 plus is around the same size as the 1 plus 7 pro but the ultra is even bigger now these phones have crazy hardware in them they have Snapdragon 860 5s very powerful processors they have 12 gigs of RAM they have 128 gigs of storage expandable storage so the hard work in the s20 lineup is just beast and they have 5g connectivity now that's gonna mean different things to different people depending on what country you're from what city you live in not everyone wants 5g right now but it is available on the s20 if you're looking for that type of connectivity in terms of pricing starts at $9.99 u.s. I'm a little bit disappointed they don't have a cheaper version like the s20 II like they have the s10 last year and said they went for a more premium lineup with the ultra I think these phones are awesome they honestly look really nice on paper but I think we'll have to wait for the review to get a more comprehensive look at these devices hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
