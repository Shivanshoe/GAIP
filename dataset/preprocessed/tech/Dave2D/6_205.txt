okay so AMD just launched some new laptop CPUs the rise in 4000 series and they are very impressive like legitimately very powerful CPUs for laptops there are however a strange number of articles that are like this is the end of Intel Intel's dead like it's so not the case so I reached out to both my contacts at Intel and AMD just to hear both sides of the story and to see what both companies think of each other in terms of the industry and where the the laptop industry sits right now and I thought it would make a video for people that are interested in buying a laptop in 2020 because that's not as clear-cut as it may seem it's not like dumped Intel everyone should be buying AMD laptops that's really not the case okay but first of all these new AMD chips are the real deal for certain users for people that can actually take advantage of multi-core processing these chips are great so for some workflows that really makes so much more sense to purchase one of these new AMD laptops then what Intel has to offer right now now in the past regardless of how much like marketing AMD threw into their laptop stuff they were never good and you can tell from the manufacturers side like they never put AMD chips in the past into their premium laptops like we just never did it any time they used an AMD chip in one of their laptops it was usually some kind of like plastic more value oriented device but this all changed a few days ago because now we're seeing some very premium devices being made with these Rison CPUs now the reason for this the reason why this chip is so special and so good is because it's the world's first seven nanometer processor and the key here is power efficiency they are able to push up a crazy amount of performance per watt and it's given these new chips some very serious legs and it's also provided some competition finally in the laptop CPU space now there are a couple things you need to be aware of first these chips are really good for - you know I'd say one thing really content creation that's seriously the best by far the best feature about these new AMD chips it doesn't really matter which application you're using because eight cores is almost always going to be better than four cores or six cores when it comes to content creation now the other thing they drew attention to was gaming but we're talking about gaming with the integrated graphics on these new Rison chips and we're seeing decent performance like way better than what Intel offers in their current integrated graphics solutions but keep in mind that these are still integrated graphics these are not representative of actual gaming laptops so the real strength of these new AMD chips really just lies in their ability to process in multi-core applications like actual workflows now another thing I was interested in was battery life so I played with the engineering samples I've had just to kind of see what they could do and I've spoken to some of the guys from AMD just to learn more about this so this is my gut feeling on it the seven nanometer chips from AMD are so much better than what they've had in the past because in the past AMD's laptop chips were really poor with idle State battery consumption they are much improved but Intel stuff is still better and the biggest thing comes from just years of optimization Intel has spent so much time working with this architecture and working with laptop manufacturers to be really good at battery consumption and the companies out there that are making laptops are designed to last as long as possible are going to stick with Intel chips but the thing is the trade-off for most people seems to be worth it like you just get so much better performance with eight cores in a laptop than four for Apple users if you're someone who's always been interested in AMD based MacBook Pro it's it's not gonna happen anytime soon apple's software is just way too finely tuned for intel's hardware that it's yeah it's it sounds really cool on paper but no okay i'm gonna wrap this up with two kind of bigger picture thoughts here the first thing is pricing AMD in the past has always been cheaper when it comes to their laptop offerings but because they know they have something good here the pricing from what i've seen of all the devices that have like MSRP pop up it's not cheap not that it's expensive but because they know they have something that's comparable if not better than what Intel has they are pricing it at kind of like what you'd expect for a high-performance premium device and the second thing is Intel's response to all of this has been Tiger Lake and Tiger Lake has one clear advantage to me it's the GPU performance like we've been told that the Tiger Lake CPUs are supposed to have a significantly better GPU than what even the Rison 4000 chips have so I'm looking forward to it here's my take on this whole like laptop industry right now in the year 2020 we finally have like two real competitors companies making compelling devices or compelling components for laptops I think it's cool if you've been holding off on a laptop upgrade I think this is the year to do it there's just a lot of cool stuff on the table if you're a content creator the eight core stuff from AMD just makes a lot of sense if you're a gamer or if you're looking for a more productivity focused device or really like a student that just wants a really long battery life in their laptop I don't know if AMD is the answer yet okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
