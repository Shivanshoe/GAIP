okay so it's thursday july 15th i'm in the studio having a very chill day and all of a sudden i see this thing from valve they announce the steam deck there's just so much stuff to talk about so this is probably one of the coolest devices i've seen this year it is a portable gaming console thing and it's awesome like it's just awesome so if you look at the hardware specs this is like the first thing that jumps out of me right for 399 dollars at the base price you're getting a seven inch 1280 by 800 touchscreen which i think is actually the perfect resolution for this kind of device like i've never done a review on this thing but this is the one x player there's a lot of devices out there that try to do this whole handheld gaming console thing and a lot of companies go for high resolution screens right because it looks better on spec pages it looks it looks cooler on paper but in terms of actual playability high resolution screens suck when they're super small because you're just killing battery life this thing has if you're playing any decent game it's like a 30 minute battery life realistically right so low res screen on a handheld device like the switch is perfect uh 16 gigs of really fast ram like we're talking 5.5 gigahertz dual channel lp ddr5 this stuff is top of the line ram it's fast and it's exactly what this system needs it's running an amd apu and that stuff loves fast memory if you look at the storage we're looking at 64 gigs of emmc storage at the base model it's not like super fast stuff but it's usable my concern though is a lot of steam games especially someone like the aaa titles they are huge like actually i think they'll pop over 64 gigs if you have a have a big enough game and i know it's the base model obviously you can go up to like 512 of faster stuff but it's it's a little tight you do have micro sd but it's one of those things where i'm wondering if you have a game that say i don't know like 70 gigs right let's say you have a big ass game 70 gigs like does it know how to split it can it store half of it on the internal storage and then put a chunk of it onto the external like that's that's interesting but 64 gigs for 3.99 like that's the thing that makes this whole thing work 399 u.s for a portable gaming computer this stuff is powerful this isn't like you know rtx 3090 powerful but rd and a2 1.6 teraflops on a seven inch screen right 1280 by 800p it's plenty this is going to be a very viable system for the vast majority of games out there and the best part is it's a it's a full-fledged pc you can plug it up to like a monitor keyboard mouse all the regular pc gaming peripherals you can plug it right up to it and then now you have a 400 gaming pc it's it's crazy like i look at this and the the first thing that comes to mind is like why like why would they do this this does not make in terms of the hardware sales right this does not make a lot of money for val this is not a high profit item i wouldn't be surprised if that base model for 3.99 if it if it's like a if it's like a lost product like uh you know like how consoles are sold at a loss so that the companies can sell games i would not be surprised if that base model is just like that you're they're losing money on every one of them that they sell in terms of the hardware and they make it up in software now speaking of software it's kind of surprising how open this platform seems to be it's running a linux based steam os 3 but you can install whatever you want in it so you can install windows on it you can install competing gaming services like you install origin or epic games whatever you want it's a gaming pc as long as it runs on a regular gaming pc you can install it on this it's pretty nuts you can install like discord homebrewed stuff like emulation you can do whatever you want it's crazy for this kind of price i think that's that's super impressive the weight at 670 grams that's heavy like a switch is 300 grams i think a little bit less than 300 grams 670 is pretty chunky it's not like super chunkis this is super chungus like this is not a comfortable device to use but looking at that controller you see how they've sculpted the back of it so that the curves of the device kind of go with the curves of a natural grip something like that makes a big difference in the ergonomics and just comfort of a device especially if it's thick right you're holding for like an hour something like this chong is here it's got some curvatures but you hold on to this for like 20 minutes your hands feels tired and maybe it's because it's heavy but i actually think that the curvature makes a big difference like you gotta grip it tight so it doesn't slip out of your hands that thing you can just hold it right it looks like it just naturally fits in your hand 670 grams though it's not super light but i think in terms of comfort i think a lot of concerns are like oh you know that's a heavy device it's a thick device but i think the curvature makes a big big difference in overall usability now the controls themselves i'm looking at this thing and the the first reaction on the controls is like those are weirdly positioned like they're so high up right that's just not the traditional spot we'd put like a d-pad or anything and it's just they're up at the top that's something you got to play with but those touch capacitive sensor things i love them so on the steam controller they had that tech a couple years ago and i loved it man so it's nice to see them put it on the steam deck you can seemingly also use it as a trackpad so if you have the operating system or certain games that can make use of a tracking cursor like just a regular capacitive touchpad that's kind of cool uh i will say if i'm just being honest that the vast majority of games that i play on steam and the games that are in my steam library they'd all be better played with a mouse and keyboard which is cool right because you can plug it up and just use it like a regular thing but this is awesome this is awesome uh battery life so looking at a 40 watt hour battery uh considering the size of that device i don't know if they could have made it any bigger like the bigger the battery the bigger and chunky the device is right 40 watt hours i think this thing's like 60 watt hours but this was this is a completely different kind of system this thing chewed through batteries 40 watt hours on the ap is a 15 watt like at the top end so it's not super battery draining not a super high resolution screen i think it's good so they're quoting two to eight hours which is a pretty big spread but there's a line in the ign video where they're saying if you're playing portal 2 at max settings you'll get about four hours of battery life but if you limit it to 30 frames per second you get six hour battery life so it's a decent battery life i mean imagine playing cyberpunk on this system just going to chew through it but yeah i think uh i think it's not bad now my overall take on this is like it i can't i still at this point have not wrapped around the why because if you think about valve they're a company that like they're good at making money they're really good at making money and for them to bring this out right it's obviously not the hardware that's not the play here right that the hardware is like the the stepping stone to get somewhere and they do they really need this like this is a huge endeavor they're going to sell a lot of these and i'm just imagining who are they pulling what's what's the user base that they're pulling that they would not be able to capture with just through regular pc gaming right why do they need this portable console thing it's just so weird to me i think they'll be able to pull a chunk of the nintendo switch players right like the people that are buying that thing instead like now you got this this is pretty appealing but yeah what do you think is this thing awesome like like yeah man i think this is cool oh accessories so even the base model includes a carrying case a pretty nice looking one and the usbc charger so there you have it steam deck from valve it's a pretty nice looking package for 399 bucks pre-orders start tomorrow i'm totally gonna pick one up and i imagine these things are gonna sell out very quickly all right hope you guys enjoyed this video
