all right so a while ago apple launched their airpods max a pair of 550 wireless earphones and the moment they came out with them one of the first things i thought was like there's going to be clones of this thing there's going to be replicas and knock-offs of this product because it's so expensive and because it's a desirable brand right so i hop into alibaba and i take a look around and there's so many there are so many knock-off versions of the airpods max but there's one thing i noticed there's seemingly two tiers of this product there's like an expensive 150 clone and then there's like these 30 or 40 clones that are also very popular so i ordered one of each and that's what we have today in front of you is a 30 knock off version of the airpods max we also have a 150 version of the airpods max and then of course we have the original a pair 550 air pods max now the first thing i noticed when i got this thing in is that the boxes are so similar like the fake version has the same kind of design print like the shape size everything that's easy to do but they have this this it's embossed it's it's raised and it's like they put so much effort into this packaging it almost feels like the guys that made the original like the company that made the original packaging also made the fake one even the back of it like unless you were looking for differences you could not tell them apart like you would think very convincingly that this was a real version of the airpods max the one thing i would say that is noticeable to the eye is that the fake version has like this warmer color to it it's like a orangey red version whereas this is like a more natural color but that's it and this one in case you're curious the 30 version this didn't have any packaging this was in a plastic bag it didn't even come with a charging cable but we'll come back to this in a minute let's take a look at the inside of these so i haven't even listened to these things i have no idea what they sound like or anything like that okay now inside the similarities just keep coming so with the 150 fake you can't oh my gosh even the like the pamphlet they're not exactly the same i don't think but well the usbc cable or the lightning cable doesn't come wrapped up like the real one but it's convincing i'm curious to see about the pamphlets though because if they nail the paperwork as well i don't even know which one was the real one okay let's just assume that i didn't screw it up but so that's oh my gosh dude look at this okay i'm not gonna go through every page or maybe i should oh my god okay at this point you know what's running through my mind it feels like they didn't make this product just for the sake of offering a cheaper version to people it almost feels like there's like malicious intent here like for people to scam people and pretend like it's the real one it's the same quality of paper the same like quality of print this is nuts okay um i don't even know which one's which at this point it doesn't matter let's get to the actual products all right fake one real one the only reason why i know this at this point is because of the color i know that the real one is more of a gray color it's like a space gray product space gray packaging this is definitely like a black it's it's clearly black uh also magnetic like the carrying case yeah maybe the magnet's not as strong but geez we're looking at very minor differences between these two at this point uh but the i'm just curious about the back convincing believable yeah dude at this point i'm this wasn't meant to to serve a market of you know people that want a cheaper version this honestly feels like they're trying to scam people like imagine someone that's trying to sell a secondhand or a used or whatever right an airpod max but they're selling you these knockoff ones instead of a real one you would have a tough time telling them apart this one the real one metal right it's got the aluminum cups uh i may have reviewed this product before i'm just familiarizing myself again because we're going to go into the realm of fakes in a second okay i remember how this feels this is a little bit lighter on the fake it's not metal it's got weight to it it's got i don't know if they're like stacking lead on the inside of this thing or something but it's heavier than you'd expect for a plastic device but this is i'm pretty sure this is plastic like the aluminum it's got yeah this is plastic but it's heavy but the rubber like the silicone it's convincing the mesh it feels like i mean let me side by side okay the real one is a firmer mesh it looks like the knit is a little bit denser the fake one it's a softer it's a softer push but just to show you real quick the 30 one and this is plastic like straight up super plastic very very cheap feeling and it's squeaky dude and it's like creaky oh my god the the hinged it's not even a hinge man this is like one of my what is this okay this is in comparison to the other two it's by far the cheapest but it's very junky but aesthetically it's got the look right i mean for a fake for a knockoff it's done a very good job of being convincing aesthetically now in terms of comfort so let's see this i'm curious this is the real one i'm familiar with this they're heavy but they're comfortable for the weight they do a really good job and make these fit nicely uh okay these are heavy for plastic the hinge is definitely it's stiff but it gets the job done okay they're not as comfortable there's a degree of like compression against my skull i imagine over the course of an extended wear that would be uncomfortable now the cheap ones the 30 ones okay these are garbage they don't eat like there's absolutely no isolation in terms of sound and they i just feel like they they're bad they're they're not spongy enough like they don't uh they're not comfortable but again for the look if you're just going for the look i'd say they're convincing convincing enough aside from that squeak all right i want to hear how they sound so let's pair them up and let's get the audio test going all right so it's been a while since i've used this thing it's like the last video i did with them was like four years ago but this will be a decent representation of what's going on here so i normally don't use these in my videos because they're not they're not accurate they're not a proper representation of what the user actually hears but it's all we got and this is this is the closest thing we'll be able to do for the purposes of today's video all right so those do not sound great the audio quality is very mediocre i mean for 30 bucks and plastic headphones i feel like that's what i would expect but they certainly don't sound anything like airpods maxes one thing i did notice they do not have any kind of active noise cancellation like the real ones i was messing around the software turning on and off it seemed to have no effect on the actual noise cancellation but that's what you expect for that kind of price now i am more hopeful for this the 150 pair because these are i mean they got the oh wait is this the real one dude it does the pop-up like the real ones have the pop-up when it's a real apple product pairing with the apple phone it'll do this thing but they must have like a fake chip in here like a chip in this knockoff version let me just double check to be 100 sure here yeah this is the real one it's got oh my gosh it even has the animation everything this like the phone thinks that this is a real pair of earpods maxes wow okay and it's called the pro max not an airpod max all right let's hear how this sounds [Music] [Music] so those sound okay i don't feel like they're worth the 150 like if i was buying these and this was the sound quality i got for this kind of price point i'd be very disappointed clearly you're buying it for the aesthetics and the fact that they've ripped off apple but in terms of sound quality passable but certainly not worth 150 bucks i did test the active noise cancellation on this one it does work but it is very weak to the point where it's actually very difficult to even demonstrate its abilities so it exists but pretend like it doesn't because it's extraordinarily weak okay just to close this off i want you guys to hear the real ones because these sound obviously the best of the bunch [Music] so that's the airpods max and a couple of its clones i feel like there's a couple takeaways for me here the first is that if you're gonna buy a pair of airpods max i would be very cautious purchasing it from anything else like other than a reputable store because it is so easy to be duped with these counterfeit products it's strange how good they are in terms of how accurate the replicas are uh the other thing though for me is that i don't like seeing this stuff i feel like i mean the reason why these things even exist is that the manufacturers are trying to trick people into thinking that it's the real one right whether it's for malicious purposes or just like you know for a status thing it's just it feels so i don't like it and clearly these things are nothing like the real ones they don't sound like it they're like the quality is not there's not an apple product but there you have it the clones all right hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
