all right the playstation 5. this is a big and very powerful console this particular unit is no longer in its original color but we'll get into that a little bit i want to focus this video on the controller because as i was using it and prepping for the review i realized that this was a very important part of the conversation if you're someone who is kind of deciding between the new playstation or the new xbox you really want to pay attention because this is what i think defines the entire playstation 5. this is its most important feature to me so let's just jump into it this controller looks slightly different from what i'd expected from sony but it plays and feels awesome but there's two features on here that are just super special the first are the new haptics so we've seen controllers before with vibratory motors in them that give some kind of tactile response when you play with them but this is on another level so older playstation controllers would have motors in them right one on the left one on the right and they have different weights in them so that you could create the sensation of some kind of rumble or vibratory feedback and they were kind of cool but they never felt super special to me these use a different type of motor they're called voice coil actuators and it gives developers incredible control over the type of tactile feedback that the player is receiving like you can change the vibration frequency you can change the strength you can do so much stuff with it and it happens instantly right these motors are super fast so i played astros playroom it's this game that showcases these controllers pretty well and the moment you step into the game you immediately notice the new haptics it's so weird it's super hard to explain but i'm going to try because this is something that i feel if you can't try this in a store you just i'm going to do my best to try to explain this over a video okay so on this level you start off on this circular platform the platform is made of various materials right you got a metal grille in the center area and you have glass looking material on the edges and as you walk on the metal it creates this pinging sensation it's like these short precise vibrations for the footsteps and it's not just the ping you feel the ping and then you feel this like echo of a vibration but when you step onto the glass it's a completely different type of tactile feedback it's a more resonant almost hollow feel to the material it's as if like imagine this table was metal right and you had one hand just touching the metal and you tapped it the vibration that you feel on this hand it's it's different right depending on the material and if this was glass it would feel a certain way and if this was wood it would also feel a different way this is what the control is trying to do it's somehow capturing that sensation of what vibrations feel like based on the different materials and it brings it to the controller it's the craziest thing like every surface or every different environment that you're walking through has a distinctly different feel like you can have your eyes closed even and just you could tell am i walking through the water am i stepping on sand am i walking on wood or glass or metal it all feels different you can literally tell all that stuff just feeling the controller now i do think it works best with environments right as you interact with any of that stuff and to be able to feel it and hear it because there's a speaker and it kind of adds to the immersion it's nice but sometimes it goes overboard right so an example here is like you're jumping on a springboard and the haptics are a little too much it almost takes away from the experience because it's just vibrating like crazy now this is up to the developer right they can add as much of this or take as much of it as they want but it is super cool the other thing and this is potentially even cooler is the trigger the adaptive trigger the l2 r2 button so on a regular controller these are just you know pre-loaded with tension right you pull the trigger stuff happens but these triggers have controllable tension to them so if the developers want you can have resistance on the trigger so it now takes considerably more force to activate the pull and it's again it's super hard to convey in a video like this but it is so cool and i couldn't figure how they're doing it right are they using springs are they using magnets like is there some kind of physical shift that's happening inside the controller when you want to have resistance and i found this thing on twitter and i think this is how they're doing it so the trigger in its normal state you pull it and it just goes in right there's some tension but it's a regular trigger but sony has this other mechanism in here it's this motor or actuator thing that has a corkscrew and when you don't run current through this motor it's the same kind of feeling right feels just like a regular trigger button but when you do run a current through that motor that corkscrew thing now has a little bit of resistance so when you pull that trigger now there's tension on your pull and it feels so cool like i actually think you could do a lot of things with this feature you can create game mechanics that could never been done before because of this controllable tension in astros playroom they have it hooked up to some kind of spring mechanic and it feels so neat like again really hard to convey in a video like this but if you feel it it's super special and it really is okay it's so different from anything else out there now the unfortunate thing to this is that if you think about developers this like implementing a feature in a game that uses this is not easy right it's going to take time and effort and only the playstation 5 does this so if you if you're making a game that's cross-platform like i don't know let's say cyberpunk finally comes out on these systems in like 2077 it would be a lot of work for the developers to implement a tactile feedback system into the game just for the playstation 5. so it's probably gonna be first party exclusives that take the most advantage of this tech it's unfortunate but that's just the way i see it shaking out now the rest of the device i'll cover in my full review of it uh i cannot wait for that video because there's just a lot to talk about this it's a really cool system i do want to mention briefly the color so this is a matte black finish this used to be the white finish before uh this has been skinned now i thought that this would look better like this is kind of like an early pre-production skin but the inside of this panel is still white and i think that's just the nature of this skin some people might like this look but i would prefer like a fully mono colored panel if i was gonna do it but what do you think do you like this look or do you wish i don't know everyone's gonna be a little different on this one okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
