all right so every year i try to do a buyer's guide for the apple macbooks but this year it's quite different because all the new stuff from apple is running apple silicon they don't have any of the older intel products available anymore so the purchase decision is a little bit more complex because a lot of the stuff that we would take into account or take into consideration when you purchased an older macbook with intel hardware just does not apply with their current lineup so in front of me are a bunch of devices we have some older macbooks and we have some of their newer stuff i had actually access to seven of the m1 pro m1 max devices at one point just to kind of test it all properly but i'm going to try to distill all that information down to a short video so you have a better understanding of the just the whole lineup okay let's start off with the cpu so at the base model like the entry-level stuff we have the regular m1 products so the 13-inch macbook air and the 13-inch macbook pro and these are very energy-efficient and quite capable but now there's even better stuff you have your base model m1 pro which is a great performer but then you have the best performers the 10 core m1 pro and the 10 core m1 max now those two benchmark the same when it comes to just cpu benchmarks but the m1 max has access to more memory faster memory bandwidth and access to better gpus but in terms of a cpu choice for the vast majority of people out there that eight core m1 like the entry level products from apple can do so much stuff if you're into music production or if you're an xcode developer you're just getting awesome performance with the base models now that's not to say that if you upgrade you don't see a boost right obviously if you go for the 10 core stuff it's better but if that's your budget if you can only look at like you know 1200 bucks 1300 bucks i wouldn't sweat it you're getting great value out of these products like the 13 inch macbook air and the 13 inch macbook pro now for video photo and 3d work the workflows do get faster as you add more cores to them but they're also quite dependent on gpu configuration so we'll get into that in a little bit now i want to move this conversation over to memory because memory i think is the most important conversation to be had about configuring these devices because all the stuff that we've had in our heads of like what we need for our workflows you just toss that out the window so as an anecdotal story for the stuff that i do for work like any of the cad stuff i do for work or any of the stuff i do for youtube like video editing i've always wanted 32 gigs or more some of the stuff i need 64. but 32 gigs at a minimum so any system i've ever built for my personal use including intel macbooks 32 gigs like for the past couple of years 32 or more m1 products are just they're just built different so at the base models so the uh 13-inch macbook air 13-inch macbook pro these start off at eight gigs of ram which in the pc world is laughable like that's an offensive amount of memory that is shipped with the system right you'd be like eight gigs what the what are we doing here but eight gigs on this architecture is great the upgrade to extra memory is 200 it's pretty significant and for my test most people will not use more than eight gigs of ram if you're a student you're picking this thing up for school and you don't have any kind of specialized tasks you have in mind you're just using it for regular computing you do not need the 16 gigs of ram it's the weirdest thing to say right you only need eight gigs of ram but you truly don't when it comes to the m1 products however if you are doing any kind of professional application even if you're doing like a kind of hobbyist level you do benefit from more memory but unless you're pushing your system hard every day like that's your job or that's your career then i would skip on that extra memory upgrade okay when it comes to the 14 and 16 inch devices this is the new stuff and this has a 16 gig memory base and most people will not notice any gains going past 16 gigs of ram it's more than sufficient for 4 6 even 8k video footage and i compared it with 32 gig systems 64 gig systems and the gpu ends up making a bigger difference than the memory that's not to say that 32 doesn't help at all like there's some gains in certain applications but for the most part it's identical now the thing is more ram is always better right especially if you're trying to buy these systems for long-term use but the memory is very expensive like it's a 400 upgrade to go from 16 to 32 and like in some scenarios that's 20 of the cost of the machine right that's an additional 20 just for an extra 16 gigs of memory it's really steep so i think it's skippable now there are some scenarios where it does benefit like if you're running vms obviously ram is great there but also with xcode surprisingly if you throw more memory into the system and xcode has a big project the compile times just get shorter and shorter which is great but it gets very expensive now a quick note about storage so it's entirely personal preference like what you do and also how comfortable you are with external drives me personally i use externals for everything and like a lot of my friends do uh robo tacky he's like a edm musician he does like all of his live sets his shows on externals and he's good with it but again it's everyone's different okay let's move on to graphics so i did a lot of testing mostly with these devices the m1s pros and max's and like the various gpu options and the truth is it is complex because not only are various gpus to choose from you have to consider the size of the machine because both the 14 and 16 inch macbook pros can house any of these configurations and there are some variations in performance because the 16-inch device has slightly better thermal capabilities but the good news is that apple finally has a competitive and powerful gpu option for their user base to choose from which is great but the bad news is that if you are looking at this stuff and you're trying to choose between them you're going to want to get the best one you're going to want the 32 core gpu because this stuff scales well in most of the applications that i tested there was a noticeable increase in performance as you bumped up the gpu core count the other thing that sucks though is that in order to get that top-line gpu like that 32 core unit you need to get 32 gigs of ram and you also need to get m1 max because it requires that extra bandwidth to pull it off so if you want that top line gpu you need to pay a minimum of an extra 800 which is painful right like that's just so much money so i looked at all of this data and i thought how do i give any kind of guidance as to which gpu to choose and i realized i shouldn't like you know better than anybody else which gpu is right for you depending on your budget and what you're trying to do like you don't want to listen to a youtube channel or some kind of publication that says buy this one or don't buy that one because you know better than they do what you actually want right like how valuable is saving 10 on a render or like 15 on a build time for some people it's completely pointless they don't care at all but for others it's very important to save even five percent on a render time right if you're missing deadlines all the time because you're slow you get a faster machine but if render time and build times and production time is irrelevant then who cares right you can you don't need the faster gpu but only you can answer that particular question okay i'm going to move on to battery life because battery life is a very important part of what makes apple silicon apple silicon so the older m1 devices have excellent battery life particularly the 13-inch macbook pro but when it comes to newer stuff m1 max uses more juice than m1 pro so if you have the same laptop size and same battery size the m1 max equipped laptops will have shorter battery life it's noticeable in light tests already but it's very noticeable if you're pushing the system hard so if battery life is important to you it's something you want to keep in your mind when you're choosing between the different configurations a quick note about these screens so both the 14 and 16 inch displays have these xdr panels they're really nice they're mini led excellent contrast ratios they're arguably the best laptop screens you can get on the market right now however if you are looking at a 13-inch device like the air or the pro and you're tempted to pick up a base model 14 just because of the screen i'd push you away like it's an awesome screen the best but it's still just a screen and it's a thousand dollars of a difference now you're getting a lot more right it's not just the screen you're getting you're getting a ton of other features and performance that comes with it but if that's your primary reason for jumping over to the 14 i'd hold off okay i'll close off this video with the topic of the future because m2 is not too far away i don't know a few months away and there's this conversation of like don't buy this stuff because m2 is soon um there's merit to that and i think like you know the newer stuff looks cool but i'm a firm believer firm believer in just like if you need something these are tools just pick it up to do whatever it is that you need to do getting sweaty over purchase decisions and like trying to optimize the time that you buy it to get the best value and trying to future proof you're like come on man that's just a waste of mind space because even though those leaks look really cool if this is a tool for you and you're trying to get something done with it then just buy the one that you can afford and get your stuff done that's just the best way to look at it okay good luck with whatever you're doing with your new macbook if you end up picking one up hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
