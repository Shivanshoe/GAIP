get over here all right so apple announced the new hardware today the new iphone 13s the new ipad mini and the new apple watch series seven i'm gonna go through some stuff that i found was interesting about these particular devices let's start with the iphone 13 pro and pro max and if you take a look at the screens first they're now capable of running at 120 hertz the size and the screen resolution stay the same and the notch is a little bit smaller this year it's just this capability of being able to go to a higher refresh rate now this is a tech we've seen on so many other android flagships for the past few years and apple finally introduces this into their phones it's really cool if you've never seen this before it's fast and fluid and even in comparison to the ipad pro displays with promotion these are going to look nicer because the ipads have ips panels right they're fast but there's a bit of ghosting going on on the phones these are oled panels they're really fast response time fast refresh rate it's a nice image and the hardware is capable of lowering that refresh rate down to 10 hertz and the idea being you lower it down to preserve battery life right if you're watching a high refresh animation or you're playing a game that can support a fast refresh rate it'll bump it up but if you're just watching a static image if you're browsing reddit or something or looking at a picture it'll lower it down now in the past when it came to other companies that use this tech like oneplus phones samsung phones any device that uses ltpo tech there's usually a bit of a stutter or some kind of visual lag when you flick the screen and the phone's trying to ramp up the refresh rate from low to high it appears in basically every phone i've ever reviewed with ltpotech but on the iphone i'm curious to see how they handle it because apple cares a lot about their animations they put a lot of effort and time into just how the ui interacts and if there's lag there from this ltpotech ramping speeds up and down i think people notice so i'd like to see what it looks like on the iphone 13 pro and pro max but that's the other thing this tech this promotion tech only appears on the iphone 13 pro and the pro max the regular ones like the iphone 13 and the f13 mini they don't have pro motion they're still in like poverty motion at 60 hertz all right so the cameras both the iphone 13 pro and the pro max share the same camera system this year there's three new lenses compared to last year the main camera has a bigger sensor the telephoto has a 3x zoom compared to two and a half from last year so it's just got a better zoom capability but the third lens is the most interesting one to me so this is the ultra wide but this year it has a wider aperture and can also focus on things that are close like really close two centimeters away so you can get some nice macro photos now the iphone 13 pros can also record video in pro res which is cool but i kind of have mixed feelings about it like it's a video format that is it's truly a professional video format it's for editing and for working with and the iphone 13 pros can record the footage in 4k 30 frames per second i believe the lower end model like the base model 128 gigs of storage can only shoot 1080p 30 frames per second now i don't know if that limitation is there because of a ram difference between the models or if apple's putting some kind of soft cap there so the people with the smaller storage don't fill up their phones in five minutes point being prores footage is no joke it's very pro but it's also very big i do think that this year's pro models are a more capable camera system than the non-pro bike a significant margin they're even including an extra gpu core on the pro models like the iphone 13 pro and pro max they have a 5 core gpu as opposed to the 4 core on the regular iphone 13 and iphone 13 mini the colors on the pro models there's this light blue model this year that doesn't look all that great to me from the photos and videos so far it could look completely different in real life but based on the picture so far i'm not a big fan of it in terms of the iphone 13 colors like the regular iphone 13s the blue looks like it's slightly different compared to last year's model i think this new one is nicer the camera systems on the iphone 13 and 13 mini are arranged diagonally this year and it's seemingly to house a bigger sensor so this was taken from the iphone 12 pro max it's a large sensor and it also has sensor shift technology the tech from apple that moves the sensor around instead of the lens cluster so it's a little bit lighter a little bit quicker to respond to any kind of vibrations or movements when you're using the cameras now apple's also introducing this new cinematic mode for video and this tech looks really cool to me so we've seen portrait mode in photography before a lot of companies are doing it apple google samsung basically everyone but apple's the first company to do the equivalent of that but for video and it looks really cool it can intelligently shift focus between various objects in the scene and if someone comes in and is looking at the lens it'll focus on that face but then if they look away it'll focus back on the object it's so neat and all four phones get access to this cinematic mode so that includes the iphone 13 and iphone 13 mini despite having lesser camera systems than the other two okay so the processor these are all running the a15 bionic this year with the iphone 13 pros having that extra gpu core also the battery systems they're supposedly bigger this year across the board and longer lasting the 13 mini and the 13 pro get an extra hour and a half compared to last year's model but the regular 13 as well as the 13 pro max get an extra two and a half hour compared to last year's models so it's a significant bump up in battery life if you ask me i do find it strange though that they still refer to it as all-day battery like i feel like they've been using that term forever but you know the battery life is improving but it's still all day battery they mentioned some new magsafe wallets that are compatible with the find my app and at first i was like are they running air tags on these new things but i think what they're doing is it's just a detection system like you have these new mag safe wallets they stick onto the back of the phone and when it comes off like when it detaches it'll record the time and the location that it happened and the idea being that if you ever misplace it like if you ever have a wallet a magsafe wallet that comes off and you're unaware that it came off like it's slipped off when you're taken out of your pocket it falls off you can at least find the location and time that happened the current iteration of magsafe wallets can't do that so if they ever detach accidentally they can be hard to find okay the ipad mini this was the star of the show so this was unexpected for me because i thought apple was done with this form factor like they hadn't updated the mini ipad for a couple years and i was like they're moving on from it but here we are with an 8.3 inch device with thin bezels the a15 chip second gen apple pencil support and center stage remember that tech from the ipad pro a few months ago where it would crop the image and seemingly follow you around and bring more people into the conversation that is a really cool piece of camera tech that i personally love and i think to have that on a 500 device that is super compact i think it's a really great move there's a usbc port as well as touch id on the top there is no 120 hertz display so it's like a regular poverty motion screen and there's also no mini led which would have been nice but i feel like at this price point i wouldn't have expected anything different okay the last thing the new apple watch so it's got thinner bezels it doesn't have that leaked design that we saw floating around on the internet i don't know if that thing was real or that's coming out in the future if that's just a big troll but it doesn't look like that that's all that i know uh the new thinner bezels with the brighter screen i think that's a reasonable motivator for people that had like an older version to upgrade to this one like a bigger screen is always nice but for me the faster charge time is most interesting like any time i've ever had an apple watch i've always had problems keeping it charged i'm bad with that stuff like i'm just not good at keeping my devices charged faster charge time i like that okay that's the apple lineup what do you think hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music] you
