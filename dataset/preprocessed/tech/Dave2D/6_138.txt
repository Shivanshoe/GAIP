okay let's talk about the pixel 5 and the pixel 4a 5g these are two new devices that are being launched by google shortly but i was sent two metal blanks one for the pixel 5 one for the pixel for a 5g and i was told that these are most assuredly exact to the shape and size of the actual devices these are used to make like cases and accessories for the phones uh so i'm inclined to believe it but this you know what let's just get right into it the physical shape and stuff because i noticed a couple things i wanted to talk about so the pixel 5 is very similar in shape and size to the pixel 4 from last year it's actually slightly shorter than the pixel 4. it's got the same kind of button configuration on the right so sleep wake up top and then your volume rocker underneath that and up top there's no headphone jack or anything it's got the same kind of microphone cut out and then on the left uh well you got your sim tray obviously and then on the bottom same kind of cutouts so two speaker type cutouts and then a usbc but on the back is where you'll notice the biggest differences the pixel 5 has a rear mounted fingerprint sensor again it's something that was removed from the pixel 4 where they depended on facial recognition up front for logins but they've implemented it again and this is something i've always enjoyed i've always liked the position and the speed and the reliability of a rear mounted fingerprint sensor i like it the other thing i noticed and this is a bit strange is that the curvature on the back of this metal blank phone is very similar to the curvature on the pixel 4a and this is a plastic-backed phone but this type of curvature is actually quite difficult to do on a glass and aluminum frame phone right normally to get this type of curvature you need to use plastic so i don't think that the pixel 5 is going to be a glass and metal phone i think it's gonna be a plastic phone just like the pixel 4a uh so we'll get into the internals and pricing in a little bit but just keep that in mind the whole concept of a well a cheaper material cheaper as in cost right cheaper materials to make the pixel 5 compared to the pixel 4 from last year now under the 4a 5g this is very similar in design aesthetic to the i mean all three of these right the 5 the 4a5g and the 4a so this is a big phone this is larger than the pixel 4 and the 4a the sides on the bottom don't have any surprises but the top has a headphone jack not that it's a surprise but i'm glad that it's still there just like the 4a so the two kind of mid-range phones from google this year will have headphone jacks as far as i'm concerned now i want to talk with the internals because i feel like this is where a more important conversation is to be had so let's talk about the pixel 5 first this is reportedly running a snapdragon 765g a 5g capable chip from qualcomm and this was controversial this is a chip that is not super high end right it's not an 800 series snapdragon and because it's kind of mid-range or like upper mid-range it's been it's it's a it's a weird message right pixels have normally been synonymous with high prices and relatively high-end internals they've always run 800 series chips in the pixels so this is different and i think that this is a really really smart move so here's the thing ever since pixels have been ever since they've existed right the whole purpose of pixel's lineup the whole reason why this product line even exists is to make money it's to make google money right there pixels aren't here to bring world peace or anything like that they're they're here to make as much money for google as possible and if you think if you just rewind time a little bit think about the nexus phones those phones were amazing i love them you guys probably love them the whole tech community loved nexus phones they were inexpensive they were really good and they just they were like enthusiast focused phones that a lot of people could get behind the thing is that whole nexus line just didn't make money it didn't make money it didn't make enough money for google to keep it around if it did we'd be looking at nexus phones today but clearly nexus phones weren't profitable enough the whole nexus line wasn't profitable enough so they moved on to pixels and for the past three or four years google's been trying to make money with pixels every year there's like a slight variation in their strategy but it's usually not particularly effective and now i think this is google's whole new shift their whole lineup right now look at the 4a the 4a5g and the 5. all three of these phones are going to be not super premium not super expensive but they're kind of targeting something that's it's different there's so many phones out there with snapdragon 865s a half dozen of the major brands that they're putting these flagship phones with top-end 800 series chips every single year and for google it's like why do you want to compete with that like why do you want to put these phones out there and compete with these chinese brands that are put like they're putting out like 300 phones 200 phones that have crazy powerful chipsets in them right they got ads and crap in them but they're doing it in a way that makes it very difficult for google to make a compelling product so i think this is a much smarter move you make stuff that's just a little bit different and the focus is on their software and their cameras but that is what pixels should be known for going forward not trying to match you know hardware specs with everyone else with their snapdragon 800 series stuff it's super competitive in that space let them fight it out focus on what you're good at which is software and i think that is what they're going to go for in the near future and i really like what they're doing now the screens on these two devices look to have a single hole punch camera so just like the pixel 4a but the pixel 5 because it only has that single hole punch camera looks like it's going to lose projects solely like the radar tech it's slightly disappointing because i feel like it was kind of neat but at the same time it's to be expected if they're gonna go with this type of trajectory this path of you know focusing on the important stuff and pricing your stuff at a reasonable price point i think it's got to shed stuff like project solely okay pricing so we know that the pixel 4a 5g i think google's come out and saying that this thing is a 499 phone and the pixel 5 is supposed to be coming between six and seven hundred dollars so my guess is right in the middle 650 bucks and this is both of them with 120 gigs of storage so here's the thing as i sit here doing this video i feel like mid-range chipsets are are smart they're so much smarter than trying to compete with everyone else at least for google but that's just me i i like this stuff i like to see mid-range stuff and i don't really need super expensive chip sets i don't feel like it's something that i've ever really taken advantage of but what do you guys think like when you look at these phones when you look at what google's offering now is this what you like like do you want this direction for google or do you wish that their pixel line went you know do you want them to have flagship stuff at more expensive pricing but maybe done better than they have in the past okay let me know in the comments below hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music] you
