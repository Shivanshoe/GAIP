[Music] all right let's talk about nvidia's new rtx 3060 this is probably their best-selling gpu this year it's kind of like the best valued graphics card for gaming and there is a lot to talk about now i'm just going through the boring stuff first like the benchmarks and performance there's just cooler stuff to talk about in a bit so this performs as expected it's good but it's not surprising right it performs similar to an rtx 2070 not as good as a 2070 super and not as good as a 360 ti but if you can get your hands on one at the msrp of 329 it's a fairly priced gpu but just the presence of this thing like the mere existence of yet another skew that you can potentially have stock on and be able to purchase that's a good thing interestingly it does have 12 gigs of ram which is more than the 36 eti which is more than a 3080 but the reason why it has 12 gigs of ram is because well i'm assuming that when amd kind of pre-announced their upcoming 6700 gpu that thing was supposed to come with 12 gigs of ram so nvidia being nvidia they put 12 gigs of ram into this card as well to compete so is the artex 3060 a good gpu for sure like it has great 1080p performance and it doesn't cost a crazy amount of money i personally would have liked this thing to be 2.99 like just under 300 bucks but i think it's very fairly priced at 329. now the thing is if you go into a store and you have the option somehow of being able to purchase a 360 ti or a regular 3060 and this would cost you 70 more i'd go for the 360 ti it's a little bit more but i just feel like you get better kind of long-term use on this gpu in terms of just gaming performance as well as a nicer looking design but the truth is stock is a very real issue so having access to this at all is awesome okay i want to move on to the more interesting topic a few days ago nvidia announced that this gpu the rtx 3060 would be software crippled so that it had half the hash rate that it's actually capable of this in reference to its mining speed its mining capabilities and it's only affecting the rtx 36e not any of the previously released rtx 30 series gpus just specifically the rtx 3060 and the reasoning behind it at least the public pr statement is that they're doing it for gamers to alleviate some of the supply issues that they've had by removing the mining capabilities or the appeal of this gpu to miners right because if you reduce the hash rate on this thing then for miners they're just they're not interested in this thing it doesn't do what crypto miners want to do with a rtx gpu so yeah i tested it and it's definitely crippled it mines ethereum like a gtx 1060. it's terrible and nvidia's also stated that they're going to be making these mining specific gps they call them cmps and these are devices without any kind of display outputs they're just built specifically to mine now they've gone on record saying that the production of these cmps won't impact the production of their geforce line right their rtx and gtx cards supposedly won't be reduced because of the presence of the cmp line maybe it's true like maybe they're just selling off components that they wouldn't be able to sell in their gaming products but it's been controversial like to [ __ ] your brand new rtx 3060 like this has been a little bit weird to say the least there are some people who are understandably suspicious or even upset by this right linus has an interesting video on it i'll link it down below but me personally i think this is a good thing i think that the interest of nvidia as a company like trying to make money aligns nicely with the interest of the consumer to get access to these cards right the people who get screwed are the crypto miners they're i mean look at the hash rates if you know anything about crypto mining these numbers are not impressive these are not particularly efficient and unless these cards are really cheap i don't think they're going to sell well especially because the resale on this stuff is going to be terrible so by doing this out of the gate by halfing the hash rate of rtx 3060 and by introducing this terrible lineup of mining cards i think the consumers just win the consumers being gamers right now miners know right on day one that this is not a great card for mining so if you're interested in picking this up as a miner you're not gonna maybe there's gonna be software tweaks you can you know adjust the bios and use custom drivers but most of these cards are going to go to gamers instead of crypto miners and even for nvidia a company that's intent on making as much money as possible they like that they would rather sell a gaming gpu to a gamer than a miner because a gamer will hold onto the gpu for several years make use of the tech that nvidia spends a lot of money researching whereas miners they sell the gpu after a year or two and it goes on the used market and affects the pricing of nvidia's whole gpu structure it's it's a thing so nvidia keeping their their main demographic as gamers and satisfying the needs of gamers it's a good thing it's not just like you know any gpu that they sell is good and whoever buys it no nvidia would way rather have people that are gamers purchase their gpus for sure it's better economic value for them and it also works out for gamers as well now i want to just state one thing just because nvidia likes money and they do and they're trying to make a ton of it it doesn't mean they don't care about gamers because the truth is gamers make them money they care about gamers because they make them a lot of money so there we have it that's just my thoughts on this whole thing okay that is the rtx 3060 video i feel like regardless of this whole hash rate nerf it's still gonna be super hard to get like extraordinarily difficult to get the 30 60. you've got supply chain issues on multiple components you have bots that are buying up and reselling these things it sucks i know okay you know what i'll give mine away if you're looking for an rtx 3060 from evga i will give this one away just comment below with with your favorite color it's all you need to do okay for real hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
