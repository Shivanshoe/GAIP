okay so apple announced a bunch of new hardware today but the things that were most interesting to me were the mac studio which is a new very powerful desktop computer and then the studio display which is a monitor that they launched alongside with it now that mac studio is very powerful but it's also incredibly small it comes in around three and a half liters which is super small for a high performance system like this like i like itx builds most of my pcs have been put into very small cases and the smallest i've ever had was an eight liter case from loki the ghost s1 and this mac studio is half that volume it's incredibly small now inside it looks like the space is very well used it's not half empty like the m1 mac mini it's got powerful hardware in there along with an interesting thermal system it looks like two blower fans that suck air from the bottom and exhausted out the back so you can equip this system with an m1 max chip or the new m1 ultra chip so we're familiar with m1 max we saw on the macbook pros it's very impressive chip right but this new m1 ultra is on a whole other level so this is essentially two m1 max chips that have been fused together with this ridiculously high bandwidth connection called the ultrafusion interconnect and the whole idea behind it is that by having such a high bandwidth between these two chips the throughput between them is super super high and the latency is close to zero that the system and developers can treat this system as one chip and that's what makes it special because the whole idea of multi-cpu systems has existed for a really long time right just multiprocessors and one big motherboard like servers do it lots of systems do it but you can't treat those multiple cpus as one thing m1 ultra can so you end up with a chip with double everything double the cpu cores double the gpu cores double the memory double the memory bandwidth and double the power but hopefully with double the performance so apple showed a bunch of their performance comparison charts and those are honestly difficult to read too much into because you never really know what they're using to test this to get those charts but the general takeaway is that this m1 ultra is incredibly powerful and apps that can take advantage of multi-threaded performance will really benefit from this new chip and in terms of the gpu they're comparing performance on the m1 ultra to an rtx 3090 and it's coming out on top like better performance with less energy consumed now i did notice one thing in the spec list the m1 max equipped studio is significantly lighter it's 5.9 pounds whereas the one equipped with the m1 ultra is 7.9 pounds like that 2 pound difference is massive in a form factor like this like i'm assuming the big portion of it has to be a bigger heat sink right there's just more heat coming off that thing and they have to equip it with a beefier thermal system to vent it off but two pounds is a lot of metal for extra heatsink i feel like there has to be more to it like maybe the power supply is bigger on the m1 ultra who knows we'll see uh but i want to talk about pricing for a minute so the price on these systems like it's two thousand dollars for the m1 max equipped one and if you go to the m1 ultra starts at four thousand five thousand if you want to max out the gpu but my initial reaction to this pricing was like holy crap this is expensive right but here's the thing when you have an apple logo and you stick the studio moniker onto it like it's gonna be expensive there's no way this was gonna be cheap right but when you actually think about it and before the clown's going to the comments i'm like dave's an idiot this is super expensive it is i'm not saying it's cheap but three years ago the mac pro the cheese grater one it was like 6 000 to start and if you added components to it like the you know the xeon chip at the top and was like another like six or seven thousand bucks and you throw in the gpu that was another four or five thousand dollars like it was extraordinarily expensive it was almost recreational to build that system and be like how expensive can i make this thing because it was crazy expensive and because it was so expensive so few people bought that thing but this system this new mac studio it's priced at this price point where like professionals look at me like that's very reasonable like if your career is to like make money and do things with your creative work their pricing is expected but at the same time reasonable it's kind of confusing to me like i'm looking at the price and i want to hate it i'm like four thousand dollars what the hell it's so expensive but at the same time it's like that's kind of cheap for what that is anyways i'm going to move this conversation over to the studio display so this is a 27 inch 5k display and it costs 1 600 and it comes with a stand that you cannot adjust the height on if you want to you can pay the extra 400 and then now you have a height adjustable stand it's a lot cheaper than the pro xcr display but i have some thoughts about the pricing now i have the pro xcr display and this is the stand from it this is this was a thousand dollars uh this is a review unit i got i was i haven't sent it back don't tell apple um this is a very expensive piece of stand it's piece of metal now i'm not gonna justify that it's like oh this is worth a thousand dollars i'm not saying that but i will say that this is incredibly difficult to make like if you look at the machining and the kind of weight that this thing can hold and how sturdy it is and the mechanism behind it this is again i'm not saying it's worth a thousand dollars but i can see why it's priced at a thousand dollars but i am surprised and honestly a little bit disappointed that they use the same kind of mechanism on this new display because this is supposed to be a more entry-level affordable option not a 5000 display with a 1 000 stand they don't need to make these super fancy stands like why are you using that same mechanism and that kind of pricing on a mid-range display it's crazy i feel like there's no need to go ham on the stand but they did so this display is 60 hertz there's no pro motion and it's not mini led it's got no hdr that can't get super bright like the xdr display that can hit a thousand nits sustained 1600 at the top end this is a 600 nit panel i don't know if it can go higher but that's the listed 600 nits and that means no real hdr and on a creative display and they're showing like the marketing material where they got people making movies on this thing it's like i felt like they would have gone brighter with this panel there's a built-in webcam and it supports center stage but there is no face id now i don't know if there's kind of technical obstacles or security obstacles when it comes to putting face id on a computer like this because they tend not to it only tends to be for the phones but there's a lot of bezel i feel like they could have put it in there if they wanted to without a notch but yeah no face id it does have built-in speakers which presumably have great sound quality apple's saying that these are the best sounding speakers they've ever had on a mac but a 60 hertz panel with no hdr no face id for sixteen hundred dollars without even height adjustability that's deep like there's just so many good displays out there on the market that i don't know we'll have to see but i do think it's a nice looking display probably better than most of the panels out there uh the back of it doesn't have like that cheese grater look if that's what the you were looking for but yeah there you have it so the studio display and the mac studio i don't know i want to see what this thing can do when i get it in because that kind of computing power in a three and a half liter box is unheard of really okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music] you
