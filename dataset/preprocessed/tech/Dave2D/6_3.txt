so apple had an event today wwdc for 2022. uh they launched ios 16. i just installed it before i started shooting and just seeing this home screen is so weird like just seeing widgets on a home screen that has been relatively unchanged for what like five or six years is pretty cool okay i want to talk about a few things that i thought were very interesting i would say this is one of the more interesting events we've had from apple in a while so let's start off with m2 they launched or they announced their newest addition to the apple silicon family m2 and they stressed the point of how they're still focusing on energy efficiency but this new chip has a significant bump up in transistor count and memory bandwidth and you get faster cpu performance you get significantly faster gp performance and depending on your workflow or whatever app that you use you can seemingly get some very significant gains in performance over the original m1 now the headlining product that they have this new m2 chip in is their new macbook air and this is a slimmed down version of their 14 or 16 inch macbook pro it's super slim at 11 millimeters like that is very thin for a laptop even compared to like some of the thinnest devices that you get in the windows space this is super thin so it comes in four colors there's a silver a starlight which is kind of like a champagne gold they got space gray and then their new color is midnight it's like this dark blue that's almost black but not quite but i think we've seen this color on the series 7 apple watch like it's a very appropriately named color midnight it's still a fanless system so it's a completely quiet laptop but it has a slightly larger screen so 13.6 inches it's like vertical space that you get and it's a notched vertical space kind of like the 14 or 16 inch macbook pros but it's still extra screen uh it has magsafe charging with a color match cable to boot it has a quad speaker system a high impedance headphone jack for high-end headphones and it still supposedly has a monster battery life it looks like a fantastic system but it is a 200 price bump from the previous generation of m1 macbook air now the old one like the normal m1 macbook air from two years ago even right when that system came out i thought that that was a great value for a laptop like not just for an apple product but for laptops in general i felt like the m1 macbook air was just a fantastic overall system this at 1200 it's a better product for sure than the original m1 and they've grabbed a lot of features from the 14 and 16 inch macbook pro it even has that nice 1080p webcam but 1200 is just it's just a lot more money than what you would expect kind of like the entry-level macbook air product to be it's just expensive um i still think it's a great device but it's just that that original like love that it had for the m1 macbook air it was just like an easy recommendation right it it feels like that's a little tougher to give now because 1200 bucks gets you a lot of laptop it doesn't matter which brand or which os you go with really um okay the weird product to me is that 13-inch macbook pro so this is a product that's been updated with this new m2 chip and this is a laptop that isn't as powerful as a 14-inch macbook pro but it's not cheap by any means like it's still a 1300 device so it's technically more than a macbook air like the base model but it has a 10 core gpu and i think once you match the processing capabilities like it's the same price as a macbook air but this device this 13-inch macbook pro doesn't have new design or new colors it doesn't have a new notched screen it doesn't have a new 1080p webcam it doesn't have magsafe it doesn't have fast charging capabilities it doesn't have the color match cables you don't get all of the cool new stuff that's in the new macbook air but it's still a 1300 device now you do get a slightly bigger battery and you get the touch bar if you're into that and you get a 67 watt charger if that's something you're looking for but it's just so weird to me that that is a product that exists alongside that new macbook air for that kind of price point now the one feature that i can see that might explain why this product even exists is the presence of the fan so like last year the macbook air is fanless but the macbook pro still has a fan it means the same product but just with a chip drop and this is like just a theory but i think that this new m2 chip because the gpu has the capability of running just a little more wattage than the m1 gpu it's better performance but if you look at the charts the m2 gpu does have the capability of pulling a little more juice but i think in a chassis that is fanless that extra bit of wattage is just enough for it to make a difference in the sense that for the people that do pick up the the 13-inch macbook pro the system that does have a fan you're gonna be able to use the gpu just in a more capable fashion than the macbook air whether it's for an extended photo or video editing session or if you're playing games because this time around i believe that this m2 chip because it has a little more power draw especially when it comes to gpu use if your tasks for games take advantage of that stuff you'll want to pick up the one with the fan because last generation like the m1 macbook air and one macbook pro even in gpu intensive tasks they were so similar to in performance between the two products and you have to lean on other characteristics of those two devices to guide your purchase decision purchase decision but this time around i really feel like the m2 will shine with a little airflow now i do like the pacing that apple has chosen for these new products like it's been two years since they launched the whole idea of m1 uh and like i like a two year product cycle instead of like yearly you know like m2 m3 m4 like if they'd done it every year i just think it would have just i don't think that would have been good for the industry like environmental waste for one but i just think that the pacing of this is proper on a two-year cycle unlike the competitors that are literally dropping chips like sometimes more than twice a year okay i want to move this conversation over to ios 16. so it has a completely revamped lock screen it looks and feels just so different i think i was just so accustomed to apple's uncustomizable home screen that just got used to it and like it was almost comical as to how uncustomizable it was compared to android phones but this is just so much nicer even that font changed the moment i just updated my phone to ios 16 i was looking at the beta i was like just the thicker font looks so strange to me because i just haven't seen anything like this on an iphone you can change the style and font of the date and time and you can add these widgets that just fundamentally change the functionality of the lock screen it is so much better this time around and it seems like they're encouraging the user to frequently change the lock screen like you can just swipe through it and over the course of the day just try out different things it might be a little bit too much to change it all the time but having access to something as simple as like the weather widget right on the lock screen is just it's so good this is the way it should have been and having the ability for photos to go on top of the numbers to give it that kind of layered effect is kind of neat okay i want to talk about messages so they have two features that i think are of note for me personally about messages one you can edit recently sent messages and you can unsend very recently sent messages and i think that's just such a nice feature like everyone's been there right not just on iphones like on any phone or any messaging service or app like you sent something you intentionally sent it out and then like once it's out you're like oh my god where did i send that like you just feel like a complete clown or an asshat because you said something that you just you want to take back and you normally can't on imessage but now it's there now as for the new mac os ventura there was one crazy cool feature that i saw during wwdc and i was like how are they doing that so they have this demonstration where they take an iphone and they stick it on top of a macbook and you can use the camera on the iphone as a webcam it sounds like a simple idea and it is but it's more of the kind of complications of how you make that really easy for the user it's like no connection no cables just place it there and it works and seemingly apple has done a good job with that but the crazy thing is they show this example of how the user was able to use the ultra wide camera to create this artificial top down shot it's the craziest thing like that is on such a steep angle and they're able to manipulate that video feed so that it looks like a top down shot it's so cool and like the number of times that i would've found that useful like when you're doing something in front of you like you know normally when you have a webcam and you're just like interacting with someone on the webcam you have to lift stuff up to the camera for them to see or like on a laptop to like tilt the screen down and try to like finagle the things so they can see what it is that you're looking at like tilt it back up so they look it's such a pain in the butt this is maybe it's super simple and like there's no one's thought of it but it's like so cool if it actually works the way that it does in the demonstration but you see that top-down image on that screen that's been created with the ultrawide camera in a terrible position and if they're still able to make a usable image like that that's impressive okay i need to spend way more time with ios 16 and mac os ventura to be able to get some real thoughts on it uh and also that m2 device when one comes in hopefully we'll be doing a proper review on it but there you have it this is my kind of early impressions of the new stuff at wwdc [Music] you
