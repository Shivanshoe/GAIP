so a couple days ago oneplus officially stated that they are supporting 30 watts wireless charging on the oneplus a pro which is very exciting for a lot of people like we've never had wireless charging capabilities on any one plus phone so it's really cool that they finally brought it into the device line but as I looked at this article I was like I had never actually seen the specs before because I like I did some early design coverage like some of the leaked aesthetic design of the phone I never actually looked at the specs until yesterday and some of it is still rumored but a lot of it has been confirmed by one plus but we're looking at stuff like 120 Hertz screen snapdragon 865 5g support superfast Ram superfast or just got that 30 watt wireless charging feature it's got a single hole punch camera up front it's got a triple camera system in the back and the whole thing is now IP certified water-resistant so the whole phone is like it's clearly feature packed you look at that list and the first thing that came to mind well two things first thing is like wow that's very impressive but the main thing the main thing that jumped out at me was like this is now a bonafide flagship phone like this is the first truly flagship phone that one-plus has ever put out in my opinion like they've always had phones that they labeled as flagship but they always had features that were missing like the wireless charging and like water resistance or at least IP certified water resistance and when I take a step back and I kind of look at the timeline of what oneplus is done over the years it's very impressive what they've done like it's been a six-year ride for them they went from nothing to a at least in the enthusiast crowd a well-known name for smartphones but they're now competitive like they can actually make smart phones that compete with the best manufacturers out there they were just really impressive but over the years I feel like they've had to kind of tweak their formula kind of adjust what their goals were every year to kind of like tweak things and shift things but over the past couple of years they've been really focused on speed like making these phones super fast to the point of like they've been tunnel visioned on speed to the point of almost exclusion of everything else and sometimes that focus is great like they were one of the first phones out there that brought high refresh screens to consumer phones like there were gaming phones like the ROG phones like the two razor phones there were other companies that were bringing high refresh screens but they were clearly gaming oriented this was a phone like the 1 plus 7 Pro was a screen that was like it was geared just to the enthusiast the smartphone enthusiast that cared about speed and they did a really good job at it and they also made it a desirable thing right now a lot of other companies are bringing in high refresh screens and they're now bumping theirs to 120 Hertz this year and oneplus phones also have incredibly fast face unlocks incredibly fast fingerprint unlocks like they have some of the fastest mechanisms built into their phones even their collaborations with brands like they go for race car companies like they're clearly interested in speed even their storage the running UF s3 storage very fast stuff and the RAM on the oneplus a pro lpddr4 it's just it's bleeding edge super fast stuff even they're charging like I feel like I'm driving the point a little bit hard here but if you think about phones like one plus three I think was the one plus three the first included the - charger like they were already including well at the time super fast charging into the phones we look at that you know 20-25 were charging now and it's not super impressive but they've always tried to incorporate like the fast experience for their user base it was what they were good at now there is a flip side to this because there are disadvantages when the company is so focused on this whole thing about fast experience when you look at older oneplus phones and you look at their lack of wireless charging it's weird right these are glass backed phones you could easily put Qi wireless charging into this stuff if you want it's not super expensive there's like $5 mods out there we can upgrade like older oneplus phones support wireless charging it's very doable but the reason why at least they claim the reason why they didn't put it in was because they they weren't satisfied with the speed of wireless charging back there so for three or four years we just did not have wireless charging on oneplus phones even though everyone else in the world was getting it they didn't support it because they do not find the speeds sufficient to their vision of what a 1 plus phone should provide for their user base and like you see what I'm saying that's kind of like okay I mean I I understand that you're going for speed but we don't get wireless charging for a year there's the other bigger problem of pricing because when you want to have the fastest phone possible and you want to try to provide the best smoothest and speediest experience for your user base you have to put in bleeding-edge parts you have to put in very expensive storage it to put in expensive Ram it's put an expense of everything expensive screens the whole phone becomes very expensive and that's one of the reasons why one plus pricing has just gone up in Upper veers because they've been so focused on that goal of the fastest user experience so this is my question at what point does this pursuit of speed become something that's just like a little too much like I don't know the fault the pricing of these 1+8 phones yet we won't know until next week but there's a part of me that's like I love the idea of a smart phone that's super fast I enjoy that speed a lot of people do but these phones are becoming crazy expensive because of that pursuit and it's not just the SOC right it's the RAM the storage the display the charging like every component of these flagship phones has to be focused on performance built to fit that whole design mantra of speed is important and also we'll be surprised if that focus effects there like their their decision-making when it comes to adding new features like what if they have some offbeat idea that isn't focused on performance if I have a feeling it wouldn't fit into their designs because there's just so tunnel visioned on speed right now so if your oneplus van or even if you're not is performance super important to you or do you feel like companies should focus on things that aren't just speed speed speed like I feel like there's personally I feel like there's a lot more to phones than just performance but I'd like to hear what you think ok hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it I'll see you guys next time I think I said the word speed like 200 times this video [Music]
