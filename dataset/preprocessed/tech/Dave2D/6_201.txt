all right eight months ago I did a video that was entitled I've escaped from Apple and the video was about how and why I'd left the Apple ecosystem and as someone that was a relatively long time user of Apple's products like both her mac books and their iPhones it was a relatively big move for me so I switched over to the 1 plus 7 Pro the main reason why I switched over to this particular device was the display it had this 90 Hertz display what has this 90 Hertz display very fast high refresh rate that just makes stuff look very smooth and when I first use this phone and I think this applies for any consumer or reviewer that just looks at a phone that has a high refresh screen it looks remarkably smooth and compares in to something that is like the traditional 60 Hertz but then over time you question does this high refresh screen have an actual benefit does it bring an experience that is truly useful for the average person and I will say that my opinion of these types of displays these faster refresh screens kind of shifted over the past eight months okay I'll explain the majority of time that you're looking at your phone you're doing stuff on your phone you're either looking at a still image or text because you're focusing on the content or you're watching a video that's probably playing at 24 maybe 30 frames per second occasionally 60 frames per second even twitch streamers they can go to 120 frames per second sometimes but most twitch streamers even the most popular ones stream out at 60 frames per second so the vast majority of content that you're consuming on your smart phone is going to be at 60 frames per second or slower it's really only a handful of games and mainly the UI that take advantage of the 90 Hertz and then a fast UI is nice I mean a lot of people talk about how it's like super important but is it really though like it's nice to have a you know a faster refresh screen is smoother but it's not it's not a game changer I don't think at least not until the content and everything else catches up to display higher frame rate stuff the other thing I liked about the oneplus 7 pro is the software I think it has the best iteration of Android out there I prefer it even over what pixels offer it's super clean but also gives you this level of customization that I just like like the fact I can stick this icon pack onto this phone without having to download an extra launcher the fact that I can change the UI colors like it's just it's something that I like and I just really like the software the other thing I noticed about this phone the software patches yeah you know a lot of phones get frequent software patches but I feel like with oneplus they frequently update features on this phone that I actually care about like the RAM management the camera the accidental touch detection on the screen there's a lot of stuff that they've done to make this phone a better experience for me personally and I love that I just I think one plus does their updates really well I also want to talk about the build quality in this phone I came from an iPhone 10 a steel-framed phone to an aluminum framed phone and this stuff is soft like I've bumped it a few times I've dropped it a couple times and it scratches very easily and I've actually cracked the back glass on it I mean that's what you get when the phone is cheaper I get it but it's something that you know if you're an iPhone user and you're used to that durable steel frame it is a more fragile device but the good thing is that it's cheaper way cheaper to repair this thing than an iPhone like this is I think 80 to $100 repair whereas an iPhone 10 is significantly more expensive because you have to replace the whole back of the phone not just the back glass the camera so one of the other prominent features of this phone is that it doesn't have a front facing camera well it does but it's not built into the screen or the bezel it's a pop-up and that's also one of the features that I was drawn to when I switched over to this phone but I've noticed that it's been more inconvenient than I thought it would be like just the whole pop up mechanism is a little slow when I'm video conferencing I do pretty frequently you got to wait for that thing to go up and down and it's okay but I going forward I don't know if I would go for another phone that did the pop-up mechanism because of just my personal use now the oneplus 7 pro has been an awesome experience over the past eight months it's an easy phone to recommend easy brand to recommend they do a lot of stuff right but I feel like the initial reason as to why I switched over to this phone was a little bit short-sighted that whole pursuit of like high refresh higher frame rates on my phone screen it's cool it's just not a lot of content at there takes advantage of it so if you're in the market for a new phone this year in 2020 because a lot of brands are pushing out i refresh screens as like a flagship feature think about the stuff that use your phone for and whether or not a high refresh screen can actually take advantage of it okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subsidy loved it see you guys next time [Music]
