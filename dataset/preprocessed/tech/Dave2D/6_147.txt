hey how's it going dave2d here so i was able to get a microsoft surface duo into the studio this isn't a retail unit it's not like a fully functioning one that you purchased in september it's an engineering sample that has some limitations but i wanted to do a discussion on the kind of hardware on it like the physical hardware not the actual internal components but the the feel and the vibe that i'm getting from this device so i've had this for a few days and i saturn it for a little bit before i made this video because this is a novel device i've used other foldables before but this is a completely different type of form factor and a different it's just a completely different type of machine so uh yeah i'm gonna get into that but before i talk about this thing i kind of want to talk about the other kinds of foldables now in my opinion there are three main kinds of foldable devices i mean that's up for debate obviously you know you can probably categorize these things differently but the first type of foldable to me is something like this the galaxy fold this is the first generation and i would peg the huawei mate x into the same kind of category obviously those flip differently like the actuate in a reverse manner but the idea is the same in the sense that when it's open it's a large screen almost tablet-like experience but then folds up to something that's a little more manageable not super small but a more compact device that you can put into your pocket but the idea being when it's open it's a big screen right okay that's type one in my opinion type 2 is a smaller device so when it's fully open this is the z-flip or z-flip in non-canadian language the z-flip is a device from samsung that when it's open looks like a regular phone i guess but it folds up to something that is more compact in this case it's a square device but the usage between these two devices despite having very similar screen technologies like they both flip open and they both have screens that actually fold on the inside the screens are so different that you can see where the usage would differ right this is going to be way better for media consumption you're just getting a really large screen experience and this is just like a regular phone that is becoming more compact when you fold it up now there is technically another type like on twitter people are talking about this but this is the velvet from lg so this device it's got a screen that's like an optional accessory right it's technically a foldable because it does fold and there's two screens but i don't really consider this in the same kind of category because this is an optional accessory you can tell from the hardware and the software that it's more of like a bonus right plenty of people are gonna be purchasing the velvet without ever having a secondary screen attached to it and the software shows which is why i personally wouldn't consider it to be a truly you know foldable device in my opinion okay now let's get back to this guy service duo this is a device that was designed with right it was designed with that function in mind it's designed to open up it's designed to fold and close and be a true foldy boy this is meant to be exactly that now the first thing i noticed when i got this thing in i thought that this thing would be made out of metal i thought just like all the other surface devices that this was some kind of magnesium clad device it's actually glass it looks cool i just thought it was magnesium so if you're like me and you've seen a lot of surface devices expecting this thing to be a magnesium alloy device it's actually a glass one a very nice looking one but it's glass it's probably a good thing though like if this thing was made of magnesium i feel like the scratches on it would get really bad after a few years but like any other kind of glass-backed or glass-based phone i think this will age relatively nicely now the other thing i noticed is it's super thin not the whole device like the whole device is kind of like a regular thickness but each individual slab is super thin i looked it up it's 4.8 millimeters when you hold it in your hand especially when it's unfolded it is weird i have not held an electronic device that was this thin in a really long time it feels like a really small booklet and i gotta be honest i like how it holds i like how it fits in a hand and it's just the ergonomics on this thing are really nice now the other thing i noticed is that it's a very wide device and i think under normal circumstances it doesn't feel too wide like when i first got it i gotta be honest i was like whoa this is wider right this is wider than any phone i've ever used before but then once you kind of handle it a bit it's like it makes sense the only time i feel like it might be a bit of an inconvenience is when you're making calls like to make a call you have to flip it so the screens are both on the outsides and then you hold it up to your head and now you're holding a device that is really wide for a phone right depends on your usage if you're on the phone all the time every day you're probably not going to want to use this but just putting it out there i think for phone use it's going to feel a little wider in your hand than most other phones but otherwise i'd say that the width is likely going to be a non-issue so i also want to talk about build quality now when it comes to build quality with phones usually we're talking about slab phones right phones that are honestly easy to build well in 2020 even like 200 or 300 smartphones are built well they usually have it's not hard to have good build quality in a smartphone nowadays but when it comes to phones like these where there's moving parts this is where good build quality really shines and i think this is it's an engineering marvel i hate to use that term i feel like an ad at this point but it is so much better built than i thought it could possibly be considering number one how small these hinges are but two it's also the range of motion this thing has full 360 degree flip and it's super smooth like there's no clicks there's no clocks there's not even like a a portion of the rotation that's like faster or slower than the rest it's this ultra consistent movement that's just really good build quality the hinge tension feels just right and it feels balanced like the left screen and the right screen feel perfectly balanced i can't weigh them individually but i feel like they designed this thing in a manner so that you wouldn't ever feel like this thing had any kind of imbalance when you're opening and closing the device there's one camera and only one camera it's kind of like a front-facing camera used for video conferencing but if you want to you can just flip the screen to the back and then now you have a you can use like the touchscreen controls to shoot it as a regular camera right just because of the functionality of these two screens there's also a fingerprint sensor on the side it's just right below the power button and i noticed the sim card tray doesn't have a rubber gasket like i popped it out there's no kind of even basic water resistance so i feel like you know if if you're someone that goes for dives with their phone this probably won't be great for that now i want to talk about the main feature of this phone the the screen or the screens so this is 8.1 inches spanned across with each individual panel being 5.6 inches but the first thing you'll notice right away is that there's a gap a very noticeable gap when you have this device opened up wide now here's my take on this on the gap the situation with the gap under very certain circumstances having the screen split like this can be advantageous you'll understand in a minute but for the vast majority of usage and the vast majority of users this is just it's it can range from a minor inconvenience which you can just kind of ignore to being something that's just downright unpleasant the first thing is that if you're purchasing this with the intent of media consumption you're going to watch stuff on a single 5.6 inch panel you'd have to be some kind of psychopath to want a line right down the middle of your content it's just it's not a good look and this is without even seeing the device do this right this particular device can't i can't load stuff onto this screen but you can just tell looking at that gap but what i think it's really good for this is going to be in my opinion the first device out there that's going to be really good at doing lots of stuff on your phone at the same time all the examples that microsoft has had in their commercials and their press material they're showcasing this thing going through some incredible workflows and it looks so appealing to me like one of the things that i've never loved about foldable phones is that they never really brought anything that i wanted to do with my phone and this is just from personal experience and i feel like this kind of goes beyond me like if you look at even tech youtubers people that have access to this stuff not a lot of people are using foldables as their main device because it's it's cool the tech is awesome but right now in 2020 it doesn't bring enough to the table to kind of go through the the negatives of carrying something that's larger and has like some compromises when you go with these devices but because this thing has the separated screen and this is the advantage i was talking about earlier it allows you to it allows developers to make apps that are designed in a more tuned manner than something like this because apps that are built with the surface duo in mind have to take in consideration that gap and when you do you just have proper usage of this real estate like these panels are wide right you can fit so much stuff on these screens if you do it properly you get an experience that you just cannot get with these regular foldable phones but that being said i don't think this is the end stage right i don't think that microsoft wants to have a seam or a gap right down the middle but because of the limitations of tech if they want to keep a device thin like this you have to have two separate panels otherwise if you're bending screens and folding screens you need to make them thick to house that mechanism that actually rolls the screen on the inside but the thing is when the technology does come where they can actually have a seamless or gapless experience the software the stuff that i was talking about before where you can actually move stuff around and take advantage of a screen like this that still works really nicely with those newly updated screens so i think this is cool i think this is a great direction for microsoft to be taking i think that this will likely be the phone that i switched to it's super expensive and it's not even available in canada i have to go order this thing from the states and get it imported here but this is one of the first phones this year that's really moved me and thought and made me think this is something i would actually want to use like this looks like something that i think a lot of people could make proper use of but that is the microsoft surface duo it's like an early look at it and i guess when i get my real unit in i'll be doing a proper review in it but yeah what do you think of the three different kinds or four if you count the lg velvet but of the three kind of main kinds of foldables what is the one that speaks to you most right now like if these ones were all the exact same price you could choose whichever one which one would you actually get imagine you could just turn your phone into a folding phone would you want something giant that falls into something smaller something that is regular size that falls into something more compact would you want something like the surface duo where it's meant to be super thin but provides a different type of user experience all right let me know i'm actually really curious hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
