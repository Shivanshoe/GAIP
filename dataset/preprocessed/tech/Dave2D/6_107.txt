all right 2021 it's a new year and welcome to my condo if you've seen some of my older videos i have shot some of them here but this is where i used to live and i've had to move all of my gear my like youtube stuff into the space because my office that i regularly shoot from is it's going under renovations super messy dusty can't use it so here we are in a space that's a little bit different it sounds a little bit different it's lit a little bit differently but we'll make some really cool videos and i think you guys will like them okay here we go [Music] yeah this is a very greenish yellow dining table it's casting a green glow on my face it's casting a green glow on this white paneling here it is not ideal i'm probably going to deal with this in the future but for today this is what we have okay this is a desktop pc this is the first piece of tech i brought in here for the new studio it is a bit of a different build than i normally go for so normally i build in small itx cases i like the compact size of these things i like the challenge of building something that's pretty powerful in these kind of space limited cases they're cool they're fun they got a nice look to them but for this one because this is going to be more of a workhorse i want it to be more traditional but at the same time i haven't built in a large atx case in like five or six years it's been a while so i went with this thing the case i landed on is the nzxc h510 elite this is a pretty popular case it's got a nice design aesthetic to it it's got a nice front panel that showcases the light up fans in there however it's not a particularly well reviewed case there are a lot of hardware enthusiasts and thermal enthusiasts that would consider this to be a more mediocre case in terms of its airflow but i'm very particular about my pc builds they got to look a certain way now in the system i'm running an amd 5950x in my opinion it's the best cpu you can have right now for both gaming and for video editing 16 cores super fast it's an awesome cpu now this was originally water cooled it had an all-in-one water cooler from nzxt i ended up swapping it out for an air-cooled solution this is the d15s from noctua it's a different aesthetic but i went for this just for reliability i wanted something that just had very little chance of failure and i've had issues in the past with all-in-ones so air cooling this is running some white chromax plates and we also have 32 gigs of ram now because this was an amd cpu the original plan was to run an amd gpu as well i had a 6800 xt i never shot the review for this thing i had an awesome thumbnail to go for it but i just didn't have the time to make the video this is an excellent gpu like so much better than i thought amd would be able to deliver and it's great however when i had this thing installed there were a couple things that deterred me away from using this in this particular system number one i edit in adobe premiere and nvidia's cards just have some slight hardware optimizations that make a noticeable i wouldn't say it's massive but it's a significant increase in performance significant enough for me to switch to a nvidia based gpu it's unfortunate because i i really want to support amd i think what they're doing is awesome and i just i want to give these guys some love however because of what i do this is a better gpu for video editing the second thing is ray tracing now i've gone on record i've even i'll say it again i don't think that ray tracing is super important in fact i would just say that if you're purchasing a gpu ray tracing should not be a deciding factor for which brand you should go with right however cyberpunk 2077 this is a game that looks amazing with ray tracing i would say it's the one game that really defined what ray tracing could be at least for me nvidia card is doing better it's a game that i played a lot of over the holidays and i just that's why so here we have an nvidia rtx 3080 it's the vision from gigabyte and it's a very nice looking white card they also make a 30 90. i was trying to use so i i stuffed this thing in here for a little bit it fits it's big but it runs hot in this case it just pushed it a little bit too deep into the heat for me so i went with 3080 and for the type of games that i play and the type of video editing that i do this is almost identical to the performance of a 3090 it's vertically mounted i had to get a vertical gpu kit for it as well as a pci4 riser i don't know if it was really worth it that's like 120 130 bucks canadian just for the hardware to mount this gpu in a vertical fashion and i mean it's got a look and it's popular nowadays but having done it like i wanted to see it right i've never done it on a large case a vertical mounted gpu it's nice but it's expensive and it really depends on the gpu like some cards don't even look that good vertically mounted this one looks i think it's okay but i don't think it was worth the extra 130 bucks now in terms of thermal performance it's decent like it's a solid five six degrees warmer than a heavily perforated high airflow case is that significant it really depends on how you look at it like for me personally i'm happy with it i would be even comfortable bumping this even hotter like add another five degrees i'd still go for this just because of the design aesthetic i've run so many hotter cases like itx builds like i hit like 85 close to 90 degrees this is nothing man i'm good with it okay now that's me right if you're someone that wants your system to last as long as possible with the fastest boost clocks there's probably a better case than this now the monitor that i use is the lg 38wn 95c awesome monitor terrible name but excellent display so widescreen 38 inches super bright very color accurate 144 hertz super fast for gaming it's the perfect screen it does everything well now the keyboard that i have for the setup is a special keyboard this was built by nathan from te had types he's got a custom mechanical keyboard channel i'll link it down below and this is something else so this is the dixie bauer it's a high-end mechanical keyboard and it's a work of art it's got the teal coloring on the back plate it's got some nice white cerakote material it's got my logo etched into the front of it this thing is beautiful 65 keyboard teleo switches lubed it just types and sounds like something else yeah okay so the mouse that's going with this setup is undecided still we got the logitech g pro super light we got the viper ultimate we got the pw ultra custom all of them in white all of them would look really good in this setup but i haven't chosen one yet and the mouse pad is the razer pro glide simple gray mouse pad that looks really nice and the headphones microsoft surface headphones two it's like the second generation of the surface headphones they are fantastic now having built this system and looking at it now from the perspective of an owner of a large atx case again not that this is massive but it's a lot bigger than a mini itx case i've kind of forgotten the charm that comes with building one of these systems like they're fun right they're just there's more room you don't have to think about like do parts fit like you have to take some of that into consideration it's not nearly as strict as a small case and it's just it was a fun experience that being said i still think i like small cases i'm going to use this thing as my main rig in here right i need the reliability i like the space that this has to kind of give me that peace of mind knowing that there's going to be zero thermal issues ever i hope knock on wood with this system but there's something about small systems that i'm always going to have a soft spot for them okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music] you
