[Music] all right so samsung has announced their s21 lineup of phones and this year the spread feels more distinct like the s21 and the s21 plus are more feature stripped and further away in price point from the s21 ultra than previous generations of samsung galaxy s phones so this video i'm going to focus more on the s21 ultra because this is the one that i'm most interested right now it's got the most kind of new features and just stuff i want to talk about but i'll be definitely doing a full review of the s21 and s21 plus in the future uh okay i'm gonna focus on the design and the finish first because during the presentation they spent like five minutes talking about the color black on this phone it is i mean it's a nice black it's a matte finish and i've always preferred this kind of muted black look instead of the super glossy black finishes that samsung usually puts on their galaxy s phones but i don't know if it's like super special right if they hadn't told me that they had spent a crazy amount of effort and time to create something more unique looking i would have just assumed this was just a well-engineered and well-made but regular black finish okay on to the kind of design of this phone the most iconic part of this phone is gonna be the camera area right it's shared between this phone and all the other s21 phones it's got the two curved corners and i like the look now when i first saw the leaked images of the stuff last year i didn't really like the design aesthetic of this camera area maybe i've seen it so much that it's grown on me but in real life they've done it well uh there is a very thick camera hump and even compared to like the s20 ultra from last year so the camera hump on the previous generation this didn't really embrace the hump right they just kind of made the camera segment stick out just on the camera component but here because the camera area just goes right up to the edge it gets really thick at the corner of the phone the rest of it doesn't feel as chunky like if you grip this phone in a regular fashion away from that camera hump it feels like a big thick phone but it's just this corner that's on another level now inside this chunky zone you have a new camera system so it's a four lens camera and because the new hardware you get some cool camera capabilities you get some multi-camera recordings you can record from the rear-facing cameras at the same time as the front-facing stuff so you get like two camera streams at once and the snapdragon triple eight or the exynos variant will be able to handle that without any issues and in the directors mode you can view and choose between the different cameras on the back just there's a lot of video streams being piped in at the same time and you'll be able to view and select it all in real time it's a lot of processing capability on this camera system and it's partly in due to the camera hardware as well as the soc itself now the most interesting thing on this camera system to me is the zoom capability so like last year it has the 100x space zoom but the hardware and the software both seem improved to be able to execute this idea in a way better manner so right off the rip you're looking at a 10x optical zoom which is improved from last year's optics but another big thing is the software so they now have zoom lock when you're dealing with you know trying to snap a picture from something that's super far away which is when you'd use 100x zoom handshake is a real issue like even the slightest movement in your hand amounts to a huge movement in your framing so samsung now has a zoom lock where if you hold your camera steady for a couple of seconds on a point of interest it'll recognize that as the thing you're trying to take a photo of and a lock onto that just to allow you to take steadier shots when you're using that 100x zoom and you can also set it manually as well by tapping on the screen now on the back of it you also have a second telephoto lens so you have your 10x optical as well as a 3x optical so depending on how far you zoom in to your shot it'll switch between the two different lenses and that's nice to see like it just gives you a nice range of optical clarity on your zooms now the screen up front is really nice it's 1440p up to 120 hertz and because it's an ltpo panel it can down clock pretty aggressively you can reach 10 hertz when it wants to just for energy efficiency and it's also bright 1500 nits but keep in mind when it comes to knits it's not linear like just because it's let's say 25 higher knit count doesn't mean it's 25 brighter to the perception of your eye it's probably half that just because our eyes are more logarithmic it's some nerdy stuff but it's not going to be 25 brighter than a screen in terms of how we visually perceive it but it is a very bright screen now there's also a new fingerprint sensor it's qualcomm's second gen ultrasonic sensor and it's supposed to be 77 bigger than the previous generation as well as 50 faster but we'll get into that in the proper review of this phone now in terms of the other hardware there's no support for microsd which is strange for a samsung device especially one that shoots 8k videos and in the box there's no charger there's no earphones but there is a charging cable thanks to that other company now i want to end off this video with the talk of the s pen so s21 ultra supports s pens which is a very new and interesting inclusion for galaxy s phones now this only works on the s21 ultra doesn't work on the s21 plus or the s21 now this pen is a it's a separate purchase so i believe the pen is 40 and the case if you want to house your pen in a complete package is a i think 60 or 70 purchase now my initial thought when i first saw this thing like uh at the announcement was like hmm that's weird right not just because that this is new for a galaxy s phone but this package when you look at it is very unassuming it doesn't look like a complete package the way that note phones do right when you have a note the pen it's built right into the device there's a slot right for it and if you don't use it or you use it it doesn't matter because it's part of the phone comes with it whatever right on the s21 ultra i think for a lot of people they look at this like huh that's just uh that can't be as good as a note but having used this just for a little bit of time i will say that the pen first of all is a thicker pen this feels like the girth of like a chopstick let's say i don't know why that came to my mind don't don't racially judge me but the pen that comes in the note is a very slim and slender unit every time i pull this out of every note i've ever reviewed it doesn't feel like a proper pen it just feels like a like secondary thought that and they have to keep these things small right because it's got to fit into the note device this guy because it's attached on the side you can make a little bit thicker and it's like this rubberized soft touch material it just feels a lot better and when i use this this felt nice this felt like a legitimate writing tool it feels the way that like a stylus should on any kind of portable device i've always thought that the pens that came with the note they're like dinky little tools that are just like if you need a pen you got one but this is like if you're someone who uses a pen regularly i think you're gonna like this a lot more than the pen in the notes but you do have to number one purchase it separately and number two store it outside of the device which for some people might be a huge negative i look at this like it's a really nice value add way more than i thought it would now keep in mind that this is just a first impression of the s pen hardware itself the capabilities and functionality of this isn't as robust as the one that comes on the note right this has bluetooth connectivity and you can control stuff in the air and if you walk away from the s pen like the device will let you know that you're separating from it so there's definitely advantages to it but this is nice and i just thought of something i think the reason why this one is rubberized with this soft touch material and not the regular notes like this is a really slick material maybe it's because you got to put it in and out of the hole and if it was this more frictioned rubbery material it would scratch up or just cause issues but on this one because it's an externally mounted one they can make this thing chunkier and nicer to grip i like it i think for a lot of people this is going to be a nice option if your kind of workflow can make use of a good pen and the case itself is this kind of industrial black silicon look yeah okay that wraps up my first look at this stuff i'll be doing full reviews on the s21 ultra as well as the s21 and the s21 plus in the near future so stay tuned for those and be subscribed if you want to see that stuff all right hope you
