alright let's talk about Apple silicon I wanted to shoot this video like two three days ago right after WWDC I had all these reactionary thoughts I wanted to share with you guys but then I was i sat on it as I let it simmer in my brain I realized that this was this was big this was much bigger than I'd originally thought not just for Apple not just for tech enthusiasts like you and I but for just the entire computing industry I think this is going to be it's going to be something big okay so just to explain in the one sentence what is Apple Silicon Apple has the two-year plan to transition their computing hardware like their laptops and desktops away from Intel chips to their own custom in-house made silicon kind of like their iPads and iPhones so I'm going to start off this conversation with a topic of hardware so Apple didn't announce any retail or consumer grade hardware at WWDC right they did announce this developer transition kit it's this Mac Mini enclosure equipped with the a 12 z chip from the iPad pro and it's device that they did most of the Big Sur demos from during their presentation it's a $500 kit but it's a rental right you use it as a tool for whatever development purposes that you have and then when it's done you send it back to Apple very similar to the developers transition kit they had a few years ago now this is not a consumer grade product it was meant to it was meant to basically showcase to developers and the world what their path was going forward with these new processors it's not to be used as some kind of like benchmark or guidance as to what their upcoming consumer grade products are like not at all like that a 12z is a powerful chip but that hardware was put out by Apple as something quick and inexpensive for developers to get onboard to this whole transition process the real hardware that is coming out is rumored to be either a 13-inch MacBook device or a 24 inch iMac device and these are slated to come out at the end of this year or early next year but in either of these cases the processors that are in these devices that are coming out for consumer level consumption are invariably going to be more capable and more powerful than the a 12z that's in that Birkett like for sure now there is something to be taken away from this developer transition kit and it's the price tag so $500 is a lot cheaper than the thousand dollars that they had for the old developer transition kit when they went from PowerPC to Intel and it makes you think why is it so cheap why is it half the price of the older granted things are different now right Apple is now in a position where there's so many more developers around the world that are making apps and things for the Apple ecosystem so maybe they wanted to be as inclusive as possible make this kit available to as many people as possible and there's also the other consideration where Apple is a company now where they're trying to encourage everybody to just get into development so again it's like you know try to get more people onto this thing but I think a big part of it is the cost of the components when they had the old developer transition kit they had to use an Intel chip and we've talked about those four in previous videos Intel stuff is expensive like you just can't get away from the price point of Intel's chips you put one of their chips and your products you got to pay up but this time inside that Mac Mini enclosure is an 8 12 Z it's something that they put in their iPad pros it's something they have tons of and they're inexpensive to make and I think we're starting to see the benefits one of the benefits of what ARM based chips can do it's you you have cheaper stuff now I hope I hope right that it's going to be cheap for the consumers it's clearly less expensive for Apple to produce a ARM based Mac Mini than an Intel based Mac Mini right 100% sure it's cheaper to make this dtk than the Intel based thing that they sell to consumers right now but I I just feel like they're gonna make it cheaper for consumers I just have this gut feeling it's so uh napple and it's you know I've seen it in the comments I've suggested this before and everyone laughs at this idea because Apple is just gonna rip people off if that's what everyone thinks well that's a lot of people think but what if they made it cheaper because they can right it'd be pretty sick and if you look at some of the cost breakdown of Apple's products that use custom silicone right now those chips aren't super expensive at least not in comparison to Intel stuff ok I want to move this conversation to software particularly about the software that they have to use to do this whole transition process now before WWDC there was a lot of concern from articles and comments that were written about like the difficulty the obstacle of how hard is it going to be for Apple to transition both their developers and their user base to this new ARM based product and here's the thing about transitions when it comes to moving between platforms like this the definition of a successful or proper transition is if the user can't even tell that they've made the transition right for you and I as enthusiasts we want to see how this is working and we want to understand the nuance of all this stuff but for the average user they want this to be as invisible as possible like you used the old Intel based Apple product one day you're using it and then the next day you switch over to this Apple silicon-based one and there should be no difference your programs your apps everything should just be exactly the way it was from your old one and that would be the dream that's what Apple wants and that's what the user base wants and I actually think apples gonna pull this off because if you look at their tech demos they have two tools to make this happen their new Xcode will to build binaries that can run on both platforms at the same time so you can have one file that runs both on Intel products and Apple silicon products but the most impressive one to me was their demo of Rosetta - so this is a tool that allows you to use regular Intel binaries like stuff that's made for the old old but stuff that's made for existing Apple products download that thing and then run it on a device that uses Apple silicon now the example that they use like the demo that they did during the event was a game and people looked at this demo the wrong way when I see the comments about this like people just missed the point of it that game is old and the graphics are very unimpressive but it's not a gaming benchmark they're not even trying to showcase Hardware here they're trying to showcase the software the whole idea is that you can take a program or a game that was built for an Intel system run it through Rosetta - and it'll still run like without alteration of the code it'll still run in a very viable form now that being said I do have some concerns about and graphics dependent apps running on Apple silicon during the event they showcased Maya but that scene was preloaded and they didn't do any edits that would tax the CPU or GPU very much it's cool that it runs but I really like to see more and then when it comes to Windows apps and games there's no boot camp there's no way to directly boot into Windows and I think for a lot of people that use their Apple systems to play games like that's like the that's a very common way for people to play Windows games on Apple systems right now you can do through virtualization and stuff down the line but we'll see how that pans out the big thing though is that there's no discrete GPU all of the graphical performance from these apple silicon based systems I think they have to come from that from the chip the a 14-8 13 a 15 whatever it is that's the only thing that can provide the graphics for these systems now if you look at Apple's kind of graphical progress over the years they've made some big strides and what they've been able to do with graphics on the iPads and their iPhones it's impressive for tablets and phones but when you compare that stuff to what we have available from like AMD and NVIDIA there's just no comparison I think there's gonna be some pressure on Apple to deliver something that is competitive in the graphical Department like I think their CPU stuff is that's fine I think they have that covered it's just the GPU not that everyone needs graphics capabilities but for the people that do they need to step it up and who knows maybe by the end of the year we're gonna see some really impressive GPU capabilities coming from those new a14 base stuff who knows I actually think that because they can cool these things actively like we can throw fans on these devices like for their laptops and desktops it'll help a lot in terms of what they're capable of but yeah I'm excited I am definitely excited to see what Apple does not just like this year next year but like what does it look at the two year transition line what does that look like like you know Apple they already have all this stuff planned out they know the devices and the chip so they can be placing out for the next two years they know exactly what they're gonna do but what does that look like what does the end stage look like and yeah I'm glad that we're able to see this okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it something you loved it I'll see you guys next time [Music]
