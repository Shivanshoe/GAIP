so i managed to get my hands on an iphone 14 replica this is a replica of the iphone 14 pro max and it was originally made for case manufacturing so it's supposed to be a fairly accurate representation of the final product and it looks like all the leaks we've seen so far so it still has lightning port no usbc the button layout and the stainless steel frame are quite familiar the camera hump on the back is a little bit bigger than the one on the iphone 13 pro max but then up front this device no longer has a notch and instead it has a pair of punched out holes a pill shaped one and a circular one now there's supposedly gonna be four phones this year two pro models the iphone 14 pro and the 14 pro max both of which are supposed to be rocking those new punched out apertures and then two non-pro models the 14 and 14 max both rumored to retain the existing notch now the good news is they don't need to go pro to get a big boy phone anymore but the small phone is seemingly done there's no more iphone mini but the talk of the town isn't about phone sizes or about punch hold cameras it's about chips because some of these new iphones are supposedly going to be running an older chip so the iphone 14 pros are going to be running the upcoming a16 bionic chip but the regular iphone 14s are supposedly running the pre-existing a15 bionic which is the same chip that's inside the current iphone 13 and it's got some people concerned but i think there's more to it so i don't actually think it's the same chip or at least not quite all of the iphone 13 devices run the a15 bionic chip the regular model runs four core gpu but the pro model runs a five core gpu and it gets more ram but the extra hardware allows the pro models to be equipped with a better camera system now for the iphone 14s if they're really going to be running last year's chips inside the base model iphone 14 it can't be the base model iphone 13 chip that they take i think they'll take an iphone 13 pro chip with its five core gpu and then stick it into an iphone 14. i feel like they have to that's the only way they're gonna have something that they can sell like the iphone 14 has to have a very clear and compelling reason as to why you'd want to purchase that over the iphone 13 and it just has to have a better camera system it has to have better hardware even if it's slight because they can market slight hardware improvements like i can already see it on stage right they're like we took our best iphone camera the iphone 13 pro camera we took it from that and we put it into the iphone 14 and it cost less money you can market that you know you can't mark it like we took the iphone 13 we did some software tweaks and this is the iphone 14. no shot timmy you can't market that uh as for why though like why would they do this they have done it occasionally on their budget devices but to see it happen to the iphone 14 it does feel bizarre okay and there's some theories of like you know we got the chip shortage that's happening right now it's a very real issue but i feel like this is apple like everything they do is super deliberate and if i had to guess i don't think the chip shortage has much of a play on this i really think that it's just part of their plan they want to like the one thing that comes to mind is like this allows them to separate their regular models and their pro models much more aggressively like right now in the current iphone market even last year the iphone 12 iphone 13 the difference between the pro and the regular is quite slight right it's it exists but it's a 200 price difference and the feature set is for the most part pretty similar okay if you split it like this like maybe the iphone 14 has a slight price increase but over time it allows you to make that divide bigger and bigger until you just have like drastically different products and where one is truly pro and one is truly amateur which is not pro but it allows well two things come to mind number one it gives apple the opportunity to push their customer base towards like like more adoption right imagine um like ar they're working supposedly on like apple ar like their apple glasses imagine only the iphone pros with the you know better chips and the more capable gpu capacity only that can do the ar stuff in order to connect it with apple glasses maybe i'm just saying that it allows them to differentiate their products like that really nicely and obviously the other thing is revenue by doing this you're just you're you're making more money as a company if you do this split and you can put more features more capability to the bigger phone the better phone but a way higher price tag and that is apple they're really good at it now there are a couple things on this replica iphone 14 pro max that i find interesting on the front it's a pretty big visual shift away from a notch but i don't know it's just because i've been staring at iphone's notches for like four or five years and just so accustomed to seeing that but this looks different i will say that if you overlay the previous iphone notches onto this device you kind of appreciate it but the process is apparently quite expensive so it's supposedly triple the cost of making this front-facing camera system compared to a regular notched camera system the pro models are also supposed to get a 48 megapixel main sensor and that is a very big step up in megapixel count but also in processing requirements like i feel like it's going to need a significantly more capable chip than what was in the uh iphone 13 to be able to process that stuff properly because one of the things that apple does is they're kind of real-time processing of when when you're framing shots right when you're just holding up your camera and you're looking at something whatever it is before you snap the shot whatever you see on screen is usually a really good representation of what the shot's going to come out like and if that's for real 48 megapixel sensor that's being been down to like a regular 12 megapixel file that's gonna need a lot of processing capability i imagine that's what that a16 will be able to do better than the a15 uh but there's also rumors of like 8k video i don't want that man it's like huge files like really huge files it'll chew through storage like crazy but hey maybe we'll see it 8k video uh okay that's my thoughts on the upcoming iphone 14.
