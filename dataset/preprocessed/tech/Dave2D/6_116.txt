okay so the year is wrapping up and this year in 2020 we saw a pretty decent selection of gaming laptops that came out right there were a few that stood out as being pretty special like the amd based gaming laptops those were nice to see but i really think that 2020s gaming laptops were mostly refreshes of older devices which is perfectly fine right some some years are going to have like a slower year like that like an eco round next year i think we're going to see three big developments in the gaming laptop space number one i think we're going to see way more premium amd based gaming laptops like just high end or like ultra premium devices that are really well made yet rock the new amd stuff hopefully secondly i think we're going to see a bunch of the rtx 30 series gaming laptops who knows what the performance will be like but i think they'll be pretty solid but the third one and this is what this video is about i think we're going to see a lot of devices with this screen in it so this is a device that i was sent and i think this is like the world's first 1440p 165hz gaming panel it is high resolution high refresh laptop gaming so i was able to get my hands on this unit because electronics the company that makes this particular device they're the first company to actually sell these types of panels on gaming laptops they're gonna beat everyone else they're literally the first to market super fast response time i measured at 2.95 milliseconds it's fast and the best thing about these screens is that they're not super expensive this is a regular screen it's made by boe it's like maybe 50 more than like a 1080p panel it is a regularly priced screen and this was the thing about high resolution gaming laptops before you could get 4k panels before right 120 hertz they had slow response times but you could get them but they were like four or 500 premiums over regular gaming laptops right so it was just a really hard feature to recommend this panel just makes so much more sense and i think because of the inclusion of these new powerful gpus like rtx 20 series 30 series it just makes sense to have higher resolution screens on these devices now i've played a lot of games over the past couple of weeks on the screen this has been the only machine that i've been using for pc gaming and there's some very obvious advantages that come with high resolution stuff but there's some disadvantage that i feel like you guys should be aware of because this will be coming down the pipe this will be a readily available option for i think the vast majority of gaming laptop manufacturers coming the next couple of months okay advantages first obviously high resolution gaming looks really nice right it's a lot sharper and in some games you're seeing details that just didn't exist at 1080p and websites they tend to look a little nicer with more resolution same with your desktop you have more pixels you have more real estate to place your windows around and when you sit at a regular laptop distance right when you're i don't know 18 20 inches away from your screen that's how i imagine most people use their laptops it feels super sharp it's just you don't see pixels like you normally see on a 1080p screen however there are some disadvantages and a couple of them didn't occur to me until i actually started using this so the big one when it comes to gaming is that when you have a higher resolution screen your gpu has to work a little bit harder to pump out the pixels to fill it all up right and you're seeing a drop of about 20 to sometimes even 30 depending on the game and the graphics settings and it's significant right it's not something that you would just be like eh whatever i'll play at the higher resolution you do have to kind of pick and choose your graphic settings in a more conscious manner because of the higher resolution now i would say that the vast majority of modern day gpus can easily handle aaa titles at this resolution right you saw this year 2020 we saw a ton of games come out and the rtx 20 series just they handle it so easily it's kind of weird to be doing benchmarks at 1080p it's just like you're getting 200 frames per second right so it it's dropped but now it's more appropriate to the caliber of screen the other disadvantage that i noticed is scaling so let's say you're playing a demanding title like the upcoming cyberpunk game and you're playing it on this system with a 1440p panel but because the frame rate isn't amazing you want to drop it down to 1080p because of the way that 1440p panels work when you scale it down to 1080p it becomes blurry it's noticeably less sharp and i mean less sharp than even a regular 1080p panel and that's just the nature of how 1440p displays scaled down the other thing is battery life so when you have more pixels it just takes more juice to power it and based on my limited testing with this unit it's noticeable but i wouldn't consider to be really significant in terms of battery life for regular use now when it comes to a purchase decision i do think that the availability of a high resolution panel makes things a little bit more complex like you now have to be more mindful of the type of games that you're going to be playing like if you're someone who wants to play more open world environmental games that tend to be a little more demanding you're gonna have to make sure that if you pick up a 1440p screen that your gpu is very powerful or else you're gonna be forced to be playing at 1080p in like a blurry scaled mode or you're gonna be lowering the graphics settings on your game just because you didn't combo all those pieces right so you just you got to be aware of the purchase right you just got to think about what you're getting and what you're getting it for it's a little bit weird right it's strange to think that this has become more of a thoughtful choice but it's just the nature of having options one other thing i want to mention if you've if you're curious right does higher resolution somehow make you a better gamer i don't think it does over the past couple weeks i've been testing it and my performance seems to be identical i still get rolled but uh yeah this is kind of like an early look at the high resolution 1440p gaming laptops okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music] you
