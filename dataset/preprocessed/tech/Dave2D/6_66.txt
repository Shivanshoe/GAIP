all right so for the past year and a half when it came to gaming laptops or performance laptops in general intel products have had to take a bit of a back seat because amd's ryzen chips were just so good they made these mobile devices that were just so much better than what intel was offering with their 10th gen stuff right they were better performing they had better thermals it was just hard for people to recommend a 10th gen intel laptop over what amd was offering and this product at the time this one came out like two or three months ago as a 10th gen chip and it was available for review at the time but i didn't want to look it i was like why why would i even show this to people when it's running a chip that's over a year old it did not make sense to me right i knew that the 11th gen stuff was coming right around the corner and i was hopeful for it and this is a product where the difference is going to be most noticeable like on a very powerful system with like all the bells and whistles so i said i waited for it and i'm so glad i did because the 11th gen version of this product is just it's something else so this is the msi ge76 and it is the most powerful laptop i've ever had in the studio it has the highest gpu score i've ever gotten in 3dmark it's just it's an absolute monster so let's get into them so the exterior of this device is a bluish gray color it's a metal finish that's metal on the top panel metal on the keyboard deck and it's a really nice looking finish to me now this particular device is running an unlocked 11th gen intel cpu the 11 980 hk it's the fastest laptop cpu you can get on the market right now and it's also running an rtx 3080 the fastest laptop gpu you can get on the market right now and it's all packaged to a 17-inch device with a sweet ass lighting system up front this is really cool looking to me now normally i skip over the rgb elements in gaming laptops because everyone's doing it and they're all pretty similar to each other this one is different so normally you'll see light strips right like a strip of led stuff on a laptop that lights up you can change the colors this ain't no strip at least it doesn't look like one it looks like this glowing block up at the front and when it's off like because the plastic is tinted or smoked it's got this like dark haze to it you can't even tell that it lights up it just looks like a regular laptop when i first got i was like does this even light up it looked like it did in the pictures but this is just black plastic how's that supposed to work and then you open it up and it's like oh the whole bar lights up and if you look closely at it it almost looks like a fluid on the inside that's glowing it's just really unique looking to me now because it's a smoked plastic it's a bit darker than i would like like i wish this whole bar was a little bit brighter like you see in the marketing material but it's still pretty cool looking to me uh okay so performance cpu fast af gpu also fast af so it benchmarks really well now these scores are obtained with the regular default settings like it's running an extreme performance but there's no undervolting going on there's no kind of tweaking in the settings it's just the regular default stuff out of the box you can undervolt it and because if you take a look at the internals the thermal system is very easily removed so if you want to you can replace it but that's something that we don't see very often right now in 2021 so many of the gaming laptop companies are using vapor chambers or like special thermal compounds sometimes we're running liquid metals sometimes there's like that new stuff the phase change material those types of thermal systems you cannot pop open and repaste easily like you can if you're more technically inclined but for the average person you don't you don't touch that stuff because this is kind of like the tried and tested simple heat sink and heat pipe you can easily pop it open and tweak around with it if you're into that kind of stuff now in terms of the default thermal performance it's quite good for what's happening here so because this is an unlocked cpu it's just gonna let it rip until it hits that thermal wall and i'm actually pretty happy with the numbers i do think that with some undervolting and a repasting you could get some really impressive numbers on this particular system now in order to hit these numbers the fans need to be quite loud and when you're in that maximum cooler boost mode you absolutely need headphones on or else you won't be able to hear a thing when you're playing games it does also seem that the gpu area has a better or just more robust thermal system there's just more heat pipes on this side and because this is an unlocked cpu i'm just curious what this system would have been able to do if they had an equivalent number of heat pipes on the cpu side as well but overall thermal system is good you can also see there's two nvme slots down here this is pcie 4 so the speeds are super fast you also have two ram slots and your wi-fi card the battery down here is big it's the biggest you can get 99.9 watt hours but even then because it's a big screen 17-inch screen with a powerful system and with rgbs off i'm still only getting five hours of battery life just over five hours so you're definitely gonna need that ac adapter if you go around it's a 280 watts not crazy heavy but it does add to the package weight now keep in mind that on a system like this because it's thick they're able to cool it so well right any time you take a system and you try to shrink it like every millimeter you shrink it becomes exponentially more difficult and exponentially more expensive for the product so this i still think this is a very portable package it's not like super lightweight but it's like i don't know i think this is a very viable system considering how powerful the components are on the inside uh okay so just to wrap this up the screen and the keyboard so this is a 1080p screen at 360 hertz it's super fast and there's also a 1440p option as well as a 4k option and then the keyboard this is like a standard msi keyboard it's kind of weird how consistent msi is with all of their keyboards on their devices i have the same layout the same kind of chiclet style to it i like these keyboards but i feel like you do have to get used to them there's they're not like immediately enjoyable keyboard to me and same with the trackpad it's decent but it could be better i don't like the surface texture on this as well but the click mechanics are good it's just the texture is a little bit too smooth for my personal taste in terms of the speakers they're loud quite loud maybe to combat the fan noise that it can reach sometimes but they do not project through these speaker cutouts on the left and right of the keyboard those are like a faux cutout these are bottom firing speakers and they sound loud and reasonably clear but they're not like macbook quality if you're hoping for that now the ports there's an sd card slot there's an ethernet jack it's got basically all the parts you would want on a high-end gaming laptop like this yeah it's a pretty complete package i think for people that are looking for like ultra portable devices this ain't it obviously right it's not super super light and thin but i think if you want something that's like the best performance possible this is it this is better than any amd system i've seen so far and it just delivers performance that you can tweak right you can definitely replace this thing i don't know if it voids your warranty but it's very easy to access and this to me is a really good example of what you can do with an intel system if it's cooled properly you just get the fastest literally the fastest okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music] you
