get over here okay so i had some thoughts about the new oled nintendo switch that i want to share with you guys i'm someone who plays a lot of switch i have three of them i've busted a bunch of controllers like drifting controllers but in general i like the product but i do not follow the leaks and rumors and kind of news around consoles very much right i got my hands on other tech but a couple days ago nintendo announces the new oled switch and my first reaction was like that's awesome an oled screen a bigger screen an updated dock with the lan port on the side like it seemed like a nice little refresh but then i hop into twitter and i go and read it and it seems like people are pissed people wanted more they expected more right and i think a lot of it stemmed from rumors and kind of early leaks that may have been mishandled but it just seemed like people were expecting a brand new soc like a hard refresh and when i first see these comments i'm like yeah i agree a new soc on a nintendo switch when real would have been real nice but then the more i thought about it i was like did the nintendo switch really need an upgrade like i come from a world of smartphones and laptops where you know a manufacturer changes the color on the back of the device and people are like that's awesome and they go and buy it so to me a nice refresh like this i thought it was pretty cool and then i looked into these rumors there were reputable sources talking about the possibility of a 1080p oled panel and a device that could be docked and output 4k 60 like it it seemed it seemed like a pipe dream right we're talking about a small nintendo switch that is a very small fan pulls maybe 10 12 watts in the soc you think this thing can output 4k 60 to a tv like playstation 5 xbox series x those have a tough time doing it already and those are big devices that have a ton of power draw i get it nvidia dlss the whole idea of it it sounds cool on paper but to be able to pull that off on this size right now especially i come on man what are we talking about and the whole idea of a higher resolution screen you want these things to be 720p you want them for the lower power draw the less strain on the gpu putting a 1080p panel on a device like this that's not the move like this is i really think this is what it should be an oled panel bigger screen 720p you don't need to bump the soc but the big thing i want to talk about the thing i think a lot of people are kind of missing from the conversation is scale the thing when you look at the numbers of what the nintendo switch really is it kind of puts things into perspective so nintendo switch super popular device this is a at this point four-year-old device and they've sold i think around 90 million units right a lot of devices very popular and in their latest fiscal year so from march 2020 to march 2021 they sold almost 29 million units of the nintendo switch it's just a very very well selling device but you need to keep these numbers in mind so it's a four year old device 90 million units roughly sold over the past four years and in the last year like the one that just passed almost 29 million units sold okay so if nintendo was to come out with a new product like a new nintendo switch pro whatever they want to call it they would need a ridiculous number of chips like the fabrication to make a new chip for this new product would be impossible right now like if you think about the gpu shortage you think getting a graphics card was difficult over the past year can you imagine a switch there'd be no shot it'd be like a scalper's wet dream to have nintendo switches that could scalp for like a thousand bucks it would be impossible but the bigger thing i want to draw your attention to is the success of the switch over the past year so during the pandemic for whatever reason the nintendo switches just exploded in popularity normally on a fourth year of a device you do not see a massive uptick in sales right it's just that's not normally how things go it's like the first two maybe three years any consoles like this right it does well then there's this natural decline but on year four of the nintendo switch it blew up the pandemic and like the desire for gaming just exploded and they are writing this sweet sweet wave right now and to introduce new hardware right now at the peak of their popularity that'd be the dumbest thing to do they'd be who would want to do that any kind of business-minded person would be like nintendo don't put out new hardware right now with a more powerful chip you only want to do that when you have to when your brand is on the decline and people aren't as interested in the console that's when you do it that's when everyone does it not right now at the peak of their popularity when they sold 29 million units on their fourth year like to put that into perspective to put that number into perspective playstation 5 i think they're gonna hit like 11 maybe 12 million units on their first year like the most popular year for the playstation 5. same with xbox that's probably gonna hit eight maybe nine million units sold you see what i'm trying to get at for nintendo to be like yeah let's break that momentum let's just like you know cut our sales and put out new hardware to appease the enthusiasts what would that achieve for them if anything i would go so too far as to say that even if they did have something planned like let's say they had hardware lined up and they had the supply chain ready to go pull the plug on that project you want to ride this for as long as you can that's the most nintendo thing to do because if they sold 29 million units on year four number one they don't need new hardware number two people are clearly satisfied with the existing hardware like i don't care what the enthusiasts tell you the numbers speak for themselves people are perfectly happy with this just enough and you know what nintendo's the king of doing just enough like the bare minimum to keep people happy and to make a ton of money in the process but that's my take on the new oled nintendo switch i think it's kind of cool like i think an oled panel on a handheld device is really nice but the truth is they don't need new soc they really don't right now okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you
