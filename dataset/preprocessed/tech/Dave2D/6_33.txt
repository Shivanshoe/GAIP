okay so intel dropped some new chips the 12th gen alder lake cpus and as usual i wanted to build the system into a small itx case and this is the case that i've been infatuated with recently it's the nr200 from cooler master in the sick blue color now i was sent two chips the i9 12 900k as well as the i5 12 600k all new architecture supports ddr5 a lot of impressive claims from intel and these were going into the asus rog strix z690i motherboard a very well featured itx board and we're running 32 gigs of ddr5 from g scale as well as the rtx 3090 and all of it was supposed to be fit in here and i wanted to cool it so this is where i ran to a bit of an issue i could not find a air cooler that could fit and properly cool this motherboard like the vrm heatsinks are pretty chunky here so a lot of stuff didn't fit but even the few that did fit just didn't have the capacity to pull enough heat off of this chip so i was forced to use water cooling which i normally don't like doing in a small itx case like this it's just messy in there but i had to do it because i couldn't find anything else that worked so i went the corsair h100i elite lcd and i stuffed it in here but i got to be honest this has to be one of the messiest if not the messiest builds i've ever done in years like the cable management here is non-existent it is a gnarly mess in there but it's cooled properly and that was what was important for this particular build but this is the first time i've ever had an itx build that could not be cooled properly on air i've never had that before i had to use water cooling which says a lot about the chip so i plug it up i ran some benchmarks and the performance is awesome like straight awesome it's really fast it flies in cpu benchmarks it's excellent for games and if you compared to amd's 5900x the intel is faster in most games but i don't feel like gaming performance is a strong differentiator between the two chips but the 12 900k does come out on top more often than not now in terms of video editing this was very impressive so amd's chips for the past year like the 5000 series chips have been so far ahead of intel stuff that it's just it's just made intel look super bad to be completely honest this time intel is better straight up it's so nice to see what a little bit of pressure a little bit of competition from amd does to intel because clearly they're capable of making good stuff they just need someone to let a fire under their ass and now they make something that's truly competitive in this space which is unlike what they've had for the past couple of years now the performance overall is great but there is a bit of a catch here in order to get that kind of performance you need to feed it a ton of power you also have to enable like a turbo mode equivalent but if you do and you feed it the wattage it will make great use of it and give you some good numbers right and for enthusiasts like you and i like sure this is great we have full control over how we build our systems if stuff doesn't you know have the have the thermal capability to remove the heat we can make adjustments it's good because we're sweaty desktop nerds and this is it's good right but there's a huge chunk of people who aren't and if you're buying a pre-built that has this chip in it you are you are dependent on the vendor or the manufacturer to be aware of how important that cooling is so here's a good example this is the alienware aurora r13 this came in a couple days ago and it's been completely redesigned for this year it's a new case with a resin window you can see inside it's got improved airflow improved water cooler and it's running intel's new 12th gen chips and i was very excited to test this thing out and to compare it against my system that i'd built a week ago the thing is that thing throttles and it shouldn't right that has been redesigned for this year it's got a significantly improved airflow it would not have throttled on last year's 11th gen chips but because these chips are so power hungry it throttles on that system it doesn't inhere because i adapted to it right but alienware couldn't they had to design that case way before they could have known how hot those new chips would get now their single fan route is okay for most games and apps but if you push the chip hard it chokes so if you're one of the people out there who are buying pre-built systems you just have to be like acutely aware of how important it is for this year's chips to be cooled very well or else you're just literally wasting the capabilities of alder lake you can overclock these chips quite extensively but because of a smaller case and i'm already at the cusp of the kind of thermal solution that i'm comfortable with i wouldn't do it on my particular system but overall i'm very impressed with what intel has done they have something that's truly competitive like if you wanted them to blow amd out of the water i don't think they did and if you wanted intel to rot and die this time around for whatever reason they didn't do that either they're competitive and it's really nice to see like as a consumer like this is what you want right you want to see competition between the two major players and it's what we have but what i'm personally most interested in is how do they implement this in laptops right because with mobile chips you can't just pour wattage into it and just make it run faster right on desktops you have a lot of cooling solutions you have ways you can manipulate wattage so that it you know so you can get good performance with that wattage but on laptops you can't do that i want to see what they do because it's going to come out in a few months a couple months actually let's see what they got okay uh there you have it alder lake it's impressive i like what they're doing okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
