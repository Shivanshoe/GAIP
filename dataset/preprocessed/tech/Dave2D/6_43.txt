okay so i got the new iphone 13s in and as i was unboxing some of them i realized there was something interesting going on with the package so i want to share this with you guys so normally with an iphone there's like a plastic shrink wrap and it's not there this year maybe it's in an effort to reduce plastic waste but if you look over here there's this plastic tab now traditionally when it comes to apple products the plastic tab will go on the outside of the box right you peel the tab and then that seal is broken but this year that seal is invisible like it goes on the inside of the package i'll just show you real quick here i hope i don't screw this up but if you peel it it comes off and it just it's a piece of plastic but you don't actually see the seal being broken and i have this theory it's really easy to counterfeit these plastic seals right if you purchase something and you don't you don't know the source and how reliable that uh purchase decision is this can be easily faked if it's going on the outside but this year because on the inside i actually think it's very difficult to create a counterfeit iphone that's just a theory okay i want to show you the insides of these things i haven't seen this one yet so we have four devices there are four different devices and also four different colors we have on the far left here the uh the seal is still broken okay this is the iphone 13 pro iphone 13 pro max in the new sierra blue color this is the iphone 13 mini which is a nicer blue than last year's blue for sure and then the last one here is the iphone 13 regular so okay first impressions this blue color is a lot nicer in person than it is in photos like the original photos and videos i saw this thing were there's like a really light pale blue this is still a light blue but it's actually a nice kind of shimmer to it i like this but the this one is the one that speaks to me so last year's iphone 12 had a blue that was just cheap it almost felt like a fisher price blue this is a i like this blue it's a lot nicer i'm going on and on but blue but i like my blue so this is last year's iphone 12 pro this was the pacific blue i like this one the most if i had to choose a color the gold this year is a pretty soft gold it's like a pearly champagne color i don't love gold devices so it doesn't speak that much to me but i really like the pink this is like a millennial pink the sierra blue is like a it's almost like a baby blue it's it's very trendy of apple to go with these colors man i feel like they know what they're doing their design team their aesthetic team they know exactly what they're doing all right so i'm going to pop them out and we'll take a look at the actual devices themselves oh in the box no charging brick uh it's a standard usb-c to lightning cable so yeah the stainless steel rail it's a very very like this gold color has done well they know how to do their golds yeah i have i've always had a preference for the regular devices rails i like that matte finish i know it's aluminum and it's not as durable as a stainless steel but i just like this finish so much more than the kind of shiny finish of the i mean look at this i've handled this for 30 seconds there's fingerprints all over uh the shiny stainless steel cool all right inside i want to see the 120 hertz display first that is uh the most interesting thing to me boot er up yeah you can immediately see that 120 hertz also the notch supposed to be 20 smaller i actually want to compare it to an existing 12 just kind of see them side by side that looks smaller than 20 percent smaller like if i had to eyeball i wouldn't like that's 40 maybe 50 smaller but yeah that's actually very noticeable i didn't think it'd be that noticeable based on the kind of paper specs of it but there you go new notch smaller notch okay i got to set these things up all right so i spent the past few hours taking a quick look at these phones the 120 hertz promotion display is nice it's fluid but it's so weird to see on an apple iphone like we've seen this tech on android phones for years but to finally see it on an apple handheld is like it's a little bit weird on the brain i threw a game on it it's fluid very nice to look at there is the ability to disable it like you can go into the accessibility settings to limit the frame rate i do feel like this would extend the battery life to some degree but i'll have to test it more thoroughly in the future review so the camera systems i spent a little bit time on them they are a noticeable upgrade this year particularly with low light now i need to spend a lot more time with these devices before i give any kind of conclusion in terms of the camera capabilities but the initial reaction was they've made a significant step up with their camera systems the cinematic mode i tested out real briefly again i feel like i need much more time before you give any kind of feedback on that thing i did check out the macro mode so i like macro photography and it's nice to see apple finally putting this feature onto the phones it uses the ultrawide camera and the system will automatically detect when it thinks that you're trying to take a macro photo i took some photos of the shrimp in the aquarium while they're running around it's not as clean of a shot as a still object but it was impressive that the iphone could keep up with a moving object like i've tried it with the samsung devices and the oneplus devices with their macro mode and when there's a moving object it's tough now the last thing i want to talk about are the photographic styles so both the iphone 13 and the pros have the ability to set and customize these picture profiles or these photographic profiles so you have stuff that's more vibrant and more contrasty a warmer shot a cooler shot and you can tweak all that stuff in the settings but all of this stuff is done in advance of you taking the picture and in addition to that it's baked into the shot so if you take a shot that's i don't know let's say you have it on a more vibrant style and you've cranked up the settings you take it you can't undo that in the at least not easily you have to bring it into an editor and you'd have to try to tweak it and undo that the processing that was done to it now i get why they're doing this right it's the it's a whole idea of apple's images being too flat for some people they're too natural looking and now you can preemptively set up your camera so that your shots will always have a particular look to them and it's cool that they're doing this but i didn't realize it was baked into the shot like i thought it was just a filter that they're applying but it's part of the image processing as you snap the shot and it'll adjust it based on the skin tones and it'll tweak certain parts of the photo based on the kind of profile that you've set for it it's weird but it's the new apple it's very unlike apple of the past okay so that's a very cursory light look at the new iphone 13s i'll be doing a full review on i think every single one of these things but there you go the new devices hope you guys enjoyed this video
