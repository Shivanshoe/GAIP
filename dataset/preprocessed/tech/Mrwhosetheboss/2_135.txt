wow the design of this is kind of amazing i've been wanting to do this for a long time now just go online and buy the most ridiculous phones i can find and you probably guessed my weapon of choice for that is wish.com okay so we're gonna start fairly tame let's have a look at s20 wow straight away i see galaxy s20 ultras for 84 pounds what could go wrong let's just go crazy let's go s 30 see what happens there's like literally no shame in these posts they've labeled this phone as the 2020 s30 plus but i feel like we could do better than that what happens if we just type in mini smartphone oh my god they've got one of the mini um nokia 3310 ripoffs okay let's grab one of those we've got one here that looks kind of iphone like what if we go for like a giant smartphone wait what uh what's going on there that's a one pound tablet but you know what on the subject of tablets there's one here for 22 pounds but actually now's a pretty good time to say thanks to surfsharkvpn for sponsoring this video no way they've got the lapbook pro step aside apple oh that looks interesting i'm trying to think how to reach the weirdest stuff on the site [Music] oh dear okay uh this is kind of what i was looking for there's a phone that doubles as a car oh okay okay that's more like it this is an ultra thin mini phone it almost just looks like a sheet of glass but this is the kind of thing i was looking for okay i'd be curious if they've got the new huawei phones oh my god no so this isn't the p40 this is the p43 pro it's 112 pounds it's one of the more expensive ones but discounted from 2175 2020 new 5g super smartphone they've got loads of cases that is the most hideous thing i've seen all day they basically put the camera lenses that would be on the back of your phone on the back of the case so instead of actually looking like a normal case it looks like you're holding a transparent phone unless of course this is an invisibility cloak and it actually makes your phone see-through let's grab some cool headphones for these very interesting pair of headphones here [Music] all right okay i need to stop let's go close my eyes and do it okay let the uh waiting games begin all right well this has been ridiculous um i've waited four months for this all right so we'll start with the accessories and then we'll get to the phones okay box me okay the bows [Music] the sennheisers which kind of look a little bit like they've been punched on the way out the factory let's start with bows so they kind of initially look pretty convincing but you realize the entire thing is plastic and not the good kind of plastic let's test the active noise cancellation they sound very base heavy but actually not that bad it's stuff like this it reminds you that it's not very expensive to make a decent pair of earphones who made this box okay well this is actually a really nice ear cup design these feel these feel pretty great [Music] and that actually sounds even better oh by the way if you're enjoying this video a sub to the channel would be incredible all right product to me this is our transparent phone that we were sold it's just a it's just a cheap naf tbu case as we expected oh this is actually kind of nice well a little bit less nice now it's out the package but you can see the kind of all the icons floating around in this kind of like liquid it's not the worst i've seen would i use it no now this probably is the worst i've seen this is oh my god it's almost worse in person do i look good now unless i'm completely mistaken this is our glass ball yeah i mean it inverts everything i'm seeing it's kind of trippy let's give it a go i'm gonna pull up my camera take a photo okay uh that doesn't work as advertised okay what if i what if i lay it down [Music] it's a really good ball though like it's just very very smooth no way okay i've never seen a laptop with nothing on the front oh uh it's booting up in chinese that's not a good sign six hours later this is just painful do you know what forget it to be continued [Music] okay uh tablets it is tablet time oh no wait okay so this is i think this is our one dollar tablet let's give this a go i'm very very curious about this because it just the business model doesn't make any sense i'm not even sure how they make money off this and there is a tablet here there is a tablet here what is this i mean it looks terrible but is it gonna work okay it's got a boot screen it says android it does appear to be loading it was one dollar i'm pretty i'm pretty sure it's free shipping as well [Music] working android tablet it works android tablet works all right let's see the more upmarket version of this [Music] okay so it's the same it's like the most disgusting looking cheap plastic mass-produced tablet ever well i wonder where the inspiration for this package came from wow wow that's not bad you know oh it's okay it's not great from the front but you know i i quite like the design and we've clearly been lied to by the photos i saw but that was expected oh that is not a pretty loading screen it looks respectable but not like something i would ever recommend anyone buy i'm still very confused about that one dollar tablet oh my floor looks very good right now if only you could see it i don't show them all right we've got three kind and now we are starting on the phones the kind of the dumb phones not the smartphones yet this is probably the cutest phone i've ever seen so cute it's kind of adorable like i kind of want one how do i look does this does this look good i'm almost i kind of want to almost put my sim in it would my sim even fit in that maybe it's so small like it's smaller than your airpods in your pocket okay i've actually no idea what's in this one and this is our car phone this is exciting this is the moment of truth right here yeah it was a bit anticlimactic it's got a good like closing snap not a very good opening snap so i kind of like to just and that was my finger okay this is our this is our old last smartphone and this i mean the design of this is kind of amazing i mean i guess it's not feasible to actually build a smartphone with this kind of form factor but if possible this is nice it actually shares a lot of traits with smartphone design as well it's like a single unibody metal phone i really like this i've also got two more what i think are mini phones and i don't think these ones are smartphones but we'll find out smaller than expected oh my god look at this thing and it actually does look a bit like a what is this this is like an iphone 6 design i mean get an edge to edge screen in a form factor like this and i am sold oh is this this is android maybe funky boots of animation wow this is android this is a fully functioning iphone clone the size of like my two smallest fingers let's have a look at the camera oh wow this this is terrible has it got my face in it all right and the other one is in a pretty non-descript package let's have a look it looks very similar wow okay that's this is for a different video yeah all right let's get smartphoning that's not for this video if someone could just write the name on the box some of them are labeled some of them aren't some are in these 100 plain white boxes and others actually have quite a lot of attention to detail put into them i mean it's not convincingly real but at least it's not this you know so let's start with the s20 ultra this will be interesting oh no okay is it just me or does this look even bigger than the s20 ultra i'm pretty sure that's bigger than it should be oh my god no what all right so this is a galaxy s20 ultra this is whatever on earth we just got it makes it look like a light phone that's nuts and there's the welcome screen did you look at that okay so we get it and everything is absolutely super sized okay we've got our fingerprint there that somehow worked [Music] just to be sure can you put your finger on that screen yeah and just to make 100 sure let's go for face beauty mode on the front camera i look very pretty yeah you know what i will say this i don't hate the finish and i don't hate the size i hate pretty much everything else about it but oh what is it with these boxes this feels like huawei p40 pro plus yes that's what it is okay so it's kind of got the the camera module of the huawei p40 pro plus but everything is obviously not real oh that's a shame as well there's no hole punch it's just a notch on the top it looks dented it looks dented oh no you're right there actually is a small dent on the back maybe someone threw some smartphone boxes on it and i'm assuming that we only actually get one working camera on the back oh god so i just tried zooming in and this is what it looks like at four times zoom could be better but all right p40 pro plus is a 20 20 phone we can't expect too much but here we have the p43 pro so phone from the future this could look like anything let's have a look this looks exactly the same this whole thing is so weird right we've got two phones here they look almost identical but there's so many subtle differences it makes you think are different companies actually making these or are they the same company just trying to make it look like they've got different models [Music] same theme song again a few dead pixels around it's like wish.com it's so strange i do feel like these phones must be linked they all say welcome on the start screen they all have the same startup sound and they all suck all right mate 36. oh this is a sick looking camera i just love the way this camera looks i'm just waiting for the theme song to drop it's coming it's coming i told you absolutely like no effort at all put into this camera software it's just absolute base stock android and now for a mystery box all right wait did i did i order another s20 ultra well this is i think a correctly sized yeah it's actually bang on correct galaxy s20 ultra but the camera module is smaller i've got an android let's just wait for the welcome [Music] [Applause] i've got the s20 ultra default wallpaper and kind of a standard samsung skin except everything looks slightly inverted in terms of color it's like copying the homework but changing it up a little so no one notices and the last phone is the mate 40. um not sure about that one actually oh and they've swapped out leica for lyowa and this is again using huawei's own mate 30 wallpapers but with a slightly different software skin and that's the mate 40 pro probably the only mate 40 pro you can get in the us okay so about a year ago surfsharkvpn contacted me and they asked if i wanted to partner up with them and i remember thinking i haven't heard of surfshark but sure let me give it a test and see if i like it and i did it gives you everything you need vpn to do like that peace of mind that your browsing is secure and anonymous also i'd be traveling around the world for launch events and i'd be using it to access uk netflix while i'm sitting in china for example so that's fine but i've now been using it for almost a full year and it's becoming pretty clear that a lot of vpns out there are borderline daylight robbery they'll charge you like 20 30 per person per month for vpn access surfshark costs 1.99 a month for an unlimited amount of simultaneous connections and there are some unique features too this hack lock a feature designed to give you alerts should your passwords or email be compromised and i like that using the surfshark app on my macbook i can tap once in the bar at the top and quickly connect to the last server i was connected to so check the link in the description and use code boss there's now a bigger discount than ever it's 85 percent off and an extra three months for free thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed this video the sub would be incredible my name is aaron this is mister who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
