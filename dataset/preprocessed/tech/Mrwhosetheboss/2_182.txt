oh I can safely say I didn't wake up expecting to make this video welcome to the Escobar fouled to the $399 Penta camera foldable smartphone and just before I unbox it there is a bizarre backstory to this see Escobar Inc the company that put this together it's not a phone company it's not even really a tech company it's the holding company of a now deceased Colombian drug lord called Pablo Escobar that means it basically looks after the Escobar family assets it tries to turn existing money into more money so with that in mind right at the end of last year they made their first smartphone the Escobar's fault one and it was just cryptic you'd think when you first enter the smartphone market you can make any type of smartphone why would you make a foldable the most resource intensive cutting-edge form factor that's out there right now they had a launch trailer alongside it which I'll probably get demonetized for if I show more than a few seconds off and then a closer look video where you can see the details of the design especially the massive logo planted on both front and the back and paired with these were some pre spectacular claims like the fact that the smartphone was indestructible and the fact that Escobar Inc was going to sue Apple for 30 billion dollars for and I quote cheating people by selling worthless phones anyways long story short it turns out the Escobar fold one was more or less a rebadged smartphone instead of building from scratch which let's be honest would have been borderline impossible for a company that had never made a phone before they repurposed the existing royal flexpay which was the first proper foldable smartphone in the world but even then that doesn't at all explain how this phone was so cheap the fall ROM was priced at 349 dollars the flex pay was based off was priced at 1500 it just didn't make any sense so at that point I would say curiosity got the better of me I'm not sure what exactly I was thinking but I just thought as a curious customer you know what let's see what happens so I ordered one I used my personal name my personal email address so that it couldn't be linked to the channel mister who's the boss this was just me being a curious customer and I was fully expecting to never see that money or a product again there was just a small glimmer of hope that it would come true then things got weirder so much weirder for starters I get an unexpected delivery contain two things firstly a book was titled I made billions selling coke now my smartphone will destroy Apple and Samsung is written by this guy the brother of Pablo Escobar and from what I can see it is what it says on the tin I've only scanned it but it seems like a pretty unfiltered documentation of the lives of the two brothers and it gets pretty dark it talks about life in prison and running away from the cops just as an example so anyway the second thing is a note congratulations it basically says I've been given a complimentary upgrade to the Escobar fold - and I just didn't really know what to think I mean how many times have you bought a smartphone earning to then be told by the company you know what now we're gonna send you a different one top five strangest things I've ever seen but you know I was treating this as an experiment so I just kind of went along with it besides it's not like they were downgrading me they were giving me a fault - instead of a fault one so for all intents and purposes it was a good thing and at this point I'm not exactly sure what happened but the company seemed to figure out that I was mister who's the boss even though I bought and ordered the phone using totally separate information they then told me that a review copy of the fall - is on its way to me ASAP so even though I'd bought the phone as a customer I think I've only received it because I'm a reviewer if that makes sense alrighty so just fully crack open the box for ourselves I did earlier today have a quick look at the homepage for the fault - and the claims it makes are even bolder than the full one it's a $399 foldable smartphone with high-end specs and five cameras and this launch came with a whole slew of new promotional videos the most interesting of which was this one it's a girl destroying samsung's galaxy fold with a sledgehammer it almost seems like whilst Apple was the target for the first fold one Samsung has become the target for the Escobar's fault - what's even more curious though is that the video is titled r.i.p samsung and if you actually try to visit the webpage wwr IP samsung comm that takes you back to Escobar so to clarify Escobar Inc has bought the domain name r.i.p samsung ok slightly longer intro than I planned but I think that backstory is kind of important here they don't know what to expect it and it's actually one of the nicer smartphone boxes out there it's actually got a metal plate on the front with the Pablo Escobar logo and in the back is another metal plate which has all the specs of the phone so I've gotten 12 gigs of ram 512 mb in Hong Kong alright so look at this well ok this is very simple packaging we just have a USB to USB C cable and small fare itself by the looks of it the rest of the box is completely empty there's no charging brick alrighty so mine is pre turned on already teeth I can see that the front display works and it's got a photo of a believe that's probably Pablo Escobar and it opens ok it's got a crease going down the middle it's got the notch and the camera module up top as far as I can tell this is 100% a samsung galaxy fold and it looks good which is a sign that this is actually not a phone that the company have made themselves the only real changes are the wallpaper and the fact that the internet icon has been replaced with a Escobar Inc webpage icon you've also got fold 2 in gold going down the hinge from what I can see these look a lot like just stickers I actually wonder if I could just peel this off okay yeah that that comes right off all I'm assuming than a look a lot like this you get the idea ok so we'll set it up quickly let's see if everything works I'll create a new Google account as well just for this a few moments later alrighty and we're in so Play services are still working on this let's try download and to - just to check the specifications because well my initial thought was that the anyway they've managed to achieve a price like this was by using knockoff parts from China but it feels just as fast as the fold so actually it could well be fully SPECT what's also interesting is you can tell this is the second refined model of the galaxy fold because it has these t-shaped pieces that were added in to prevent dust getting under the screen alrighty and - - so the device literally straight away comes up as a samsung galaxy fold so Qualcomm Snapdragon fifty-five I believe yet and twelve gigs of RAM as the Box said okay it's a galaxy fold but that makes it more bizarre how on earth did the company manage to buy two thousand dollar galaxy folds customize them create their own packaging and then sell them for three hundred and ninety-nine dollars well at this stage I thought we're already in contact I might as well just ask them for the answers and to be honest I've got some surprisingly complete answers first of all they described it as an entry-level phone they said that Samsung failed with their fold they pressed it too high the only reason people bought Samsung's folds apparently because they wanted to gadget as opposed to an actual phone to use day to day I mean they described this fault to as entry-level but nothing about it its specs or its design is entry-level at all so the question I kind of needed to ask was how did they do it essentially according to the CEO of Escobar Inc they bought three kinds of Galaxy fold a insufficient items ones that didn't meet Samsung's own quality control be returned items ones that people bought and then set back and see overstocked items they were apparently too many retailers and wholesalers who had overstocked on galaxy folds and they just needed to get rid of them so Escobar bought them all this company spent zero on traditional advertising and they let word-of-mouth do its job and apparently that's it I'll let you come to your own conclusions as to how you feel about it but the CEO did give me another bit of info he said that there's a bigger plan here the fold one the fortwo they're just the beginning created presumably just to get the company's name out there but an actual in-house smartphone of their own is in the works he also added that it will not be a foldable I mean we just gotta wait and see so to sum up this whole thing was weird I mean I've got the phone in my hands it's real it works and I only paid $399 and it is completely up to you how you spend your money but I just can't personally vouch for or against the company because from my experience they've been friendly and helpful and I have seen videos on YouTube of seemingly legitimacy who claim to have received this but of course the plan was to go in as an anonymous consumer to actually see if my device would get delivered and that didn't go to plan so essentially I would need to see other people's orders actually getting delivered before I could even think about recommending oh also just by the way I have launched a massive giveaway of five Samsung smartphones so if you want to be entered into that links are in the description with that being said my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
