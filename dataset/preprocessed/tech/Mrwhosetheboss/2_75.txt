[Music] this is my most expensive unboxing ever because in front of us right now are 12 super limited edition smartphones starting at 700 going all the way up to almost 170 000 so surreal to say but even at the lowly seven hundred dollars you can still get something pretty special so you might have heard of the oppo vino 4 pro it's a pretty standard upper mid-range phone but for the limited edition oppo partnered with pantone who are like the color company to create a green glitter version and providing you like the color you really have to like this color i think the packaging is beautiful it's lightly textured on the outside but also this whole glowing green theme they've got going on it's everywhere it's in every insert it's on this rather unusual case you get inside it's on the usb-c cable the earphones they catch light in a really mystical way even the charger on the front it has the pantone branding and on the back green glitter a great success as for the phone itself there is a lot going on it's kind of amazing this silky matte finish paired with all these little green flourishes the buttons the text they've even changed the color of the side rails the antenna bands and the inside of the usb-c port just to fit the theme only thing is that's a lot of text i think in the pursuit of trying to make something that feels limited and special oppo's kind of left elegance and subtlety at the doorstep but this was oppo in 2020 and i would argue that it's taken them till this year to finally nail this concept of experimental color so this is the rather elegantly named oppo reno 5 pro plus 5g artist limited edition i feel like at that stage why not just call it reno 5 max and be done with it but this phone changes color the packaging is immediately striking i feel like with limited editions the default option is to go down the route of luxury but this one's just more quirky it doesn't come with any gold-plated accessories or super high-end materials but the visual design here is so unique [Music] that's what makes oppo's limited edition so fun like it really looks like they've just handed their phone to an artist and said you want to paint something on it knock yourself out and here's the magic thanks to electrochromic glass which uses energy to change the physical arrangement of the molecules with just two taps on the back we can shift color that's so cool like could you imagine a few years down the line being able to just swipe on your phone and cycle through till you get the exact finish you want it does make you wonder what a 170 thousand dollar phone is going to look like though now for 50 more than that is a phone that means business you might have heard of red magic they make high-end gaming phones that don't cost a leg i've got their latest red magic 6 here which is their 2021 offering with all the bells and whistles like the world's smoothest 165 hertz display and seven separate cooling mechanisms all meshed together but for the purposes of this video the one that we're actually interested in is a special edition version of their last phone the red magic 5g and what makes this noteworthy is that this is a transparent phone we've seen transparent phones before they often use these kind of fake components just beneath the glass because well the real components don't look that great but the one difference here is that this phone has a fully working fan so this is a fog machine it's fully loaded up with fog juice so if we turn that on you should be able to see how the air is coming in being used to cool the internals and then getting pushed out on the other side you could say it's red magic i love myself the effort is definitely here the software is heavily customized the keyboard feels like it's from an alien planet they've even created a wallpaper that allows you to see the fan in action on the front too a bit tacky in my opinion but i appreciate the effort okay picture this it's 2016. samsung's announced the galaxy s7 edge it's high-end it's got these new exciting curved edges it's regarded by most as the best smartphone the world has ever seen and then they warn up themselves again by launching the injustice edition of that phone i wanted this thing so badly so the fact that i finally managed to get one is kind of surreal sadly it isn't sealed but it was as close as i could get the first thing you see is an enormous bad signal logo proper metal job this there's a thick batman case we've got the phone which i'll get to in a sec and a gear vr headset at the time this thing was samsung's vision of the future but it just never quite took off vr is expensive it's kind of an isolating experience and i guess just the idea of sticking one of these on in public like samsung was promoting just felt a bit awkward to people on one hand i'm looking at this thing thinking what a phone this is so cool and just marveling at all the little easter eggs hidden in the software but the other part of me is thinking this feels so old and even though i can distinctly remember the feeling of looking at this like it was the pinnacle of cutting edge i can't help but look at it now through my 2021 lens just like it belongs in a museum somewhere but that's just the beauty of how fast things are moving pretty exciting but on the subject of samsung they've started doing something pretty clever recently so you know how you can buy a samsung phone almost anywhere right a walmart a flipkart and tesco that's intentional it means that samsung has the best possible reach however in some sense ideal world all the customers who could would actually buy direct from them because that way they can charge the same price but not have to pay all these retailers a second extra cut so samsung have started encouraging that in a not so subtle way by giving free bonuses like earphones and google play credit and now also exclusive limited edition color variants they take at least two weeks to deliver because they are made to order and for the s21 plus this year they've designed a color variant that when i saw for the first time i was like we've got to get this on the channel because i love it i've showed it to two other people they hate it so i want to know what you think the box is identical to the other normal variants this isn't like some super high effort luxury edition but look at this they call it phantom red and it's pretty much everything i want in a foam finish it's jazzy and fun without looking excessive the matte texture is grippy and also keeps itself clean there's no flexing at all in the body and they still manage to get that complex light refraction that gives it an extra aesthetic layer also this feels like a weird thing to say but this is one of my favorite phones ever from a bezel perspective because it's still one of the only devices on the market where the screen feels like it's evenly stretched around the canvas of the phone so there's no weird jutting corners or thick chins it's just pleasant design okay moving up the price meter i think they've done something even more interesting with the exclusive version of their s21 ultra you've probably seen a fair bit of this black one maybe also the silver too because these were the ones sent to reviewers but as a consumer if you go through samsung's own store you can find something called phantom brown which i mean i don't think the words phantom and brown belong in the same sentence but the end result is a phone unlike anything i've ever seen before you see on one hand it's just brown it's not one of those super vibrant colors that you usually associate with wowing people but when was the last time you saw a brown phone and i actually think this soft phantom glow paired with the carbon fiber themed camera setup and the black rail that goes all the way around the sides it sneaks up on you a bit it feels surprisingly distinct i feel less like i'm holding an official samsung product and more like one of those fan made concepts but in a good way i think i might have just scuffed it now you might have heard of harrods they called themselves the world's leading luxury department store and they built a bit of a reputation for selling things like a 160 000 golf putter a 200 000 bottle of perfume and a one million dollar advent calendar so compared to that this feels like a bit of a bargain inside this box is the two thousand dollar harrods limited edition iphone 5s and given that there were literally three of these on the entire internet and the 5s is pretty much my favorite iphone ever they had to get this it's a seriously heavy duty wooden package it even needs a key to open it although this feels more like a gimmick than security and here we have it and so on the left is what looks like a gold usb stick not the most inspired design i gotta say but then the phone itself yep to be clear i'm not a particularly showy person so this whole idea of like sticking a thousand swarovski crystals on something and then plating the rest in 24 karat gold it kind of horrifies me but the level of precision here is blowing my mind this whole idea that like every single crystal you see here has had to have been individually planned and implemented whether that's the six they've managed to fit onto the power button the four they've got onto the alert slider or the 65 carefully placed inside the apple logo and every single one has its own separate enclosure just to hold it in place also just like the size of this thing it's like a relic of the time when phones were actually usable in one hand right we're in the top five actually just gonna bring this closer so i can look at it okay imagine this it's 2012. samsung has just announced the pebble inspired galaxy s3 apple is readying their thinnest iphone yet and blackberry is getting slaughtered by the competition so what they did is revamped their operating system and as well as releasing their standard mainstream 700 bold 9900 they also created a limited edition porsche design version and called it the 9981 for some reason it's definitely packaged like you've just dropped some serious dough on it we've got the phone which we'll get to a custom charging stand they've even got a porsche design battery manuals a cleaning cloth below that are the more standard blackberry accessories as well as though what looks like porsche design earphones too they didn't have to do that that's a that's a slick move i will say this there was a time in my life when i thought blackberry was the coolest thing in the world but pretty much as soon as that first iphone got announced and i saw the value of touch-based apps and games the whole appeal of blackberry just just kind of disappeared but if i was going to use one this would have been it the stainless steel body the sharp lines the leather bag the laser etched logo the edge-to-edge keyboard it all gives the impression of rugged engineering this is one of the few phones that you could throw at a wall and worry about the wall and now the room is open plan it's just a shame that such high-end hardware was let down by really a laughable software solution now after that package i was kind of looking at this one worth 2450 thinking really this is the alpha one and the only justification for its price is that it's lamborghini branded so this is not like an oppo or a huawei phone that's just licensed the lamborghini name this is being sold to people as the lamborghini phone but with that in mind the one thing that it then needs to do for two and a half grand is to convey luxury and i don't think the packaging really does that the cable is generic the charger just has a logo slapped onto it and while you do get a nice sim ejector tool i'm really not wowed but then i realized why because on the face of it yes this is a really nice premium well-built luxury car branded phone it's got a liquid alloy frame which is highly resistant to stains and dents and scratches this rather lovely circular power button and some extremely plush stitched leather on the back which just kind of makes sense here it's a high-end material and it also ties back into lamborghini cars but depending how much time you spend watching tech videos you might recognize this camera setup ah yes let me introduce you to the zte axon 7 a phone which is spec for spec identical to this and it's very clear that all lamborghini have done is taken that and repurposed it and that includes the packaging ztes was the same just a different color that feels pretty disingenuous to me i actually think it's cool when companies make luxury high-end variants of their existing phones but this one has purposefully distance itself from the device it's based off to basically trick people like i can imagine the majority of people who bought this probably thought they were paying for lamborghini engineering when they were actually paying for zte engineering with a bit of lamborghini leather slapped on top right now we're into the top three and with a value of about three and a half thousand dollars we have something that i don't think you can just hop online and order so you might know that xiaomi's recently dropped their full flagship me 11 series of phones this is meant to be a commemorative package for that and so far so good they've even created like a xiaomi branded suitcase for it okay let's get inside this could be anything whoa okay there's three phones here the first one is the mi 11 lite surprisingly affordable phone at like 299 euros then got the mi 11 pro all the way up at around 1 000 euros but for some reason this one isn't releasing globally and then finally the 11 ultra which i've already done a full review about but i believe this is a ceramic white model which i haven't seen in person yet but there's more we've got a me band 6 which is their latest activity tracker i've got to say while xiaomi is up against strong competition in the phone market these bands are one area that they've just killed it mostly because i think their competition wouldn't even want to enter this kind of price point and then this one's very curious it's an 80 watt wireless charger which is incredibly powerful but what makes it strange is that xiaomi doesn't make a phone that can charge with 80 watts wirelessly and this 80 watt wireless charger comes with a 120 watt wire charger but xiaomi literally has one phone that can actually charge with 120 watts so i think this whole package is less about immediate benefit more like a future-proofing solution the phones well they all do share elements like you can tell they're from the same lineup but each one has its own character the mi 11 light is slim and like its name suggests light but it also has a really fun finish that is kind of messing with me the way it reflects light almost makes it look three-dimensional and then as you get further up the lineup the phones get more capable but then also less experimental when it comes to looks like i do definitely prefer this white m11 ultra over the black one that i was sent to review but i do think it's a massive shame that all these ultraphones they play it so safe when it comes to color okay two phones to go and now is where we really start cranking up that price dial you've probably heard of caviar they've sent us a few um interesting phones before but this is what they're selling for 6900. nice so they're calling this apache not that kind of apache and it's like a limited edition iphone to apparently honor the indigenous people of america but this is the first time i'm seeing it i'm i'm kind of nervous um slightly shaking but it's exciting let's do it i mean it's just an iphone so far let's see what it looks like all right here we [Music] that's go so the bottom of this is a it's like a leather type material the top is kyranite black pearl which as far as i can see is a sort of highly durable acrylic and then all of these gold parts are brass underneath with a 24 karat gold plating on top i feel like if there's one word for this it's meaty like it's very clear this is a showpiece this is for someone who cares much more about the materials and the quantity of those materials on their phone than say how comfortable it is to hold would i personally use this probably not does it feel expensive and premium yeah i think my favorite design so far is still that titanic phone that i looked at about a year ago now i really like this black and red theme item that's so so premium international warranty and this is number one of 99 a normal apple charger earpods not airpods an apple cable but now it's time it's time to see what a 170 000 phone looks like that's enough money to buy 80 27 inch imacs 12 brand new chevrolet sparks or you know a beachfront mansion in nicaragua it's so valuable that you can't even buy it in one go due to online banking restrictions on their end it's so valuable that by the time you're seeing this video it's already been escorted back to russia where it came from i do just want to quickly say though that for the first time ever 50 of you watching my videos are subscribed so thank you to everyone who has taken the time to do that and for anyone who hasn't a sub to the channel would be priceless okay six digit lock on this i really hope there's not a code that would be a spanner in the works are we ready okay three two one [Music] oh my god [Music] so we have a caviar limited edition gold business card jeffrey preston bezos this like white and gold combination here this looks amazing let's have a look what comes in the box first we've got gold themed packaging on the accessories maybe we'll even get air pods so the cable is black cable and then we've got a gold caviar themed sim ejector tool oh right okay um samsung galaxy buds and they are literally just the standard black ones we have a black samsung themed charger the gold collection which i'm assuming is filled with a whole number of other stupidly expensive things and finally certificate of ownership this feels like like thor's hammer trying to pick it up okay don't judge me it was two for one i mean it makes me want to laugh and cry at the same time so this is the gold phone it is a samsung galaxy s21 ultra paired with one kilogram of pure gold i don't have any way of like verifying those materials myself but more importantly who is this for because you've probably noticed that whilst the past phones for the sake of luxury and beautification we've lost wireless charging this time we've lost the cameras sorry that i have to say this but fingerprint magnet not to mention that it literally weighs a kilogram plus the weight of the phone's own internals and here it is samsung galaxy s21 ultra gold brick in case you're wondering this is what the camera looks like literal just black straight up weirdly the selfie camera doesn't work either but i guess if you can afford this you can probably afford someone to take photos of you i was curious so i just looked up the price of a one kilogram block of gold it's coming out at the equivalent of 55 000 us dollars which is still crazy expensive but it's not 170 000 i guess the main value add here is that caviar apparently offers a swapping service so two times for each customer you can apparently tell them i want to swap the phone's hardware to it could be an s24 it could be like an s27 at that point value for money anyways if you did enjoy this video then we've got my last ridiculously expensive unboxing up here and the thinnest smartphone in the world up here thanks for watching my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one
