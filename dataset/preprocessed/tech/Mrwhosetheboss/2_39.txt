oh my god my heart that is wild welcome to 15 of the most futuristic gadgets you might have ever seen we're talking speaker systems you can wear on your face heat shrinking technology lasers that can burn through things levitation and more and we're going to go in order of how exciting i think each one is so number 15 it's a strange kind of future i'll tell you that you can now buy shower heads which are also speakers you have this outer portion which will spray water and then this magnetic inner portion which is where the sound will come from doesn't feel like a particularly strong magnet but i think they forgot to put them okay i promised lasers number 14 is a laser pekka it's probably the most dangerous pekka you've ever seen oh god i just had to agree to like five separate disclaimers basically even though a laser is just light the power of that light combined with how concentrated it can be means that this light can burn through stuff so i've got a phone i want to burn here and the laser pekka app here you pull up an image that you want on this app and then you just hit print see what happens oh my god look at it it's like pools of smoke should we get a fire extinguisher it's blowing my mind that that is just light that is wild look at that and this is not just like a drawing this is etched into my case okay next up we have something from xg me they're the sponsor of this video and their projector the horizon pro is the most capable most futuristic one i've ever used so that right there is a 120 inch screen up here is the projector that i used to use on it it was like five thousand dollars the speaker system to go along with it was like six thousand dollars right well this little thing is so good in terms of the picture quality and the quality of the inbuilt speakers that no joke for 1700 it has replaced them both but the only reason i actually said yes to it for this video is that it's also a smart projector it has sensors that allow it to autofocus and auto keystone correction so i've literally not once had to fiddle with a manual focus ring it can detect where your screen is and align its image inside it it can even reangle the picture to make it appear completely flat even if the projector is firing downwards but my favorite thing is that it in itself is also an android device which means it can use android apps and as such also wipes out half the boxes down there too how small do you think the smallest gaming console is this big maybe uh maybe this big not quite what you're looking at right now is thummy a fully operational handheld that you could very easily swallow if you're not careful so i'm just loading up tetris right now and i can't believe this is like fully functional all the buttons work as expected this for all intents and purposes is a working game boy but with an oled screen can you imagine like going back 30 years and telling someone that their gaming console that was like this big would one day be this big i wouldn't have believed you that's even cooler than i was expecting it to be wait till you see number one on this list though you know something i never expected to feature in a video about future gadgets was a paper plane the times are changing gone are the days where you just take a sheet of paper fold it three times and you're done good thing i'm not a pilot nope i spent a good 15 minutes building the power up v4 precisely folding taping and even adding bluetooth control propellers time to see if it was worth it so i've got my app here i'm going to unlock the propellers oh my god okay three two one oh too much too much throttle ultimate test let's go come on come down come on come on come on oh my god it's still going oh sh yeah we're uh we're not getting that horn back but you know there's something that's had me even more excited than high-tech paper this is what's claiming to be the next era of mario kart i am such a child if you haven't heard of mario kart it is like the staple family racing game and this is what happens when the game becomes real oh all right so inside the box as well as the cart i also got a bunch of these gates and the idea is you place these gates around the room you want to race in and then the cart itself has an embedded camera that can use these gates to turn your room into a real-life mario kart course oh hello milo it's mario versus milo come and get me come and get me it feels like jurassic park like walking with the dinosaurs so the physical cart is moving through my physical room but on my screen i can actually see my virtual opponents and the virtual items i pick up and then i can use them in the real world and because you've got a physical car in your room all the physical objects automatically become obstacles in the game okay so we've had computer mice for the best part of 60 years now but have you ever wondered what's next okay you probably haven't you're not sad like me but according to the zephyr pro it's having a mouse with a physical cooling system inside i kid you not this mouse as well as being built with a honeycomb structure to dissipate heat also has an actual fan inside of it so you click this button to change your lighting mode and then this one here will turn on the fan oh wait it is on it's just that is completely silent it's not as powerful as i was expecting but i guess that kind of makes sense i mean it's trying to keep your hands sweat free not freeze them off i love gadgets like this clean presentations slick design funny names because all the good ones were taken this is nollie specifically the nollie battery system why is it a battery system you might ask well compared to just a normal charger this system has quite a nice self-reinforcing loop that makes it almost idiot proof so for starters it's a main socket that can charge your phone through the usb port onto op you also get a six thousand seven hundred million power power bank with its own inbuilt cable of your choosing as well as its own usb port to charge something else but then the power bank magnetically connects to the main socket so that you can charge both your phone at the same time that the power bank is charging and the whole thing will only take up one socket with no spillover or blockage to the one next to it so what on earth tops that well this is a piece of technology that i think 10 years ago people would have laughed at if you suggested it a smart ring and i did not think it would be as capable as it is this thing is packed with sensors and it measures almost all the same data that a full-on smartwatch would i've been using it to monitor my sleep my levels of activity we're talking a level of sophistication such that this ring can detect the onset of a virus before you can by noticing trends and fluctuations in your body temperature my only gripe though is that this company aura have actually just introduced a six dollar monthly subscription if you actually want to get all your data and that's on top of the 300 price of the ring itself which i guess is very much the future we're moving towards but not necessarily in a good way speaking of subscriptions though if you do enjoy my videos a sub to the channel would be free all right i'll tell you one tech problem that i would love to be left in the past fraying damaged cables don't even get me started on how many macbook wires i've had to replace mostly due to wear and tear at the neck which is the part that tends to receive the most bending and pulling well with the help of heat shrinking tubing this is actually a solvable problem so i've got my damaged cable here what it says to do is to slip one of these tubes on top of the neck and then when i heat it it says to use a lighter i'm not gonna do that it should apparently compress by a factor of three let's try it oh wow it's working look at it closing up the hole's no longer open and that is completely sealed up so this will insulate the wire it'll protect it it'll protect you it'll also make it waterproof and the insides of these tubes are lined with adhesive such that once you've heated them and they've sealed they will stay like that okay so you might know this about me i kind of have a thing for funky looking lights but how do you take a light to the next level i'll tell you magnetic levitation so we've got the base here when i plug it in this will become a wireless charger for my phone and then up at the top this just looks like a normal magnet right magnetic bulb magnetic top except when i plug it in hopefully this should become an electromagnetic field and the light will turn on oh my god that's so cool let's just see what happens if i put some paper in between [Music] it's got to be a permanent part of the setup now on a related note though you know what's even cooler than electricity-powered anti-gravity anti-gravity that doesn't require any electricity this is the tipsy tray it doesn't look like much but bear with me here because this company is saying that by using this tray spilling drinks will become a relic of the past now that's a pretty bold claim if you've ever seen me trying to carry a cup of tea but i'm ready to test that theory okay four glasses of hot tea ready to go the concept is that because i'm holding them from above it will create a center of rotation at that point it should mean that if i swing the tray like this it will exert a force on those drinks from that point of rotation which in theory should temporarily glue them to the surface but it's time to test that the stakes are so high here i could burn myself i could cut myself here goes five four three two one oh my god my heart it works not a single drop look at it that shower head incident scarred me all right we're in the top three so it's probably not a surprise to you that more and more in our day-to-day lives we are using wireless earphones people don't like wires and people don't like big bulky headphones that mess up your hair but in-ear earphones come with their own set of problems and the ole dance wearable stereo is claiming to fix all of them so right off the bat this company isn't even calling these earphones the way they have these dual compartments means that they can hold themselves in place without actually needing to go inside at all they feel less like earphones more like a a private set of speakers if that makes sense secondly this dual chamber design means that there is literally zero risk of these coming off which is sometimes an issue for normal earphones and they sound really nice kind of like like an outdoor concert and finally because this second chamber is almost completely filled with battery unlike normal earbuds that might get like four to five hours before you have to case them up these can last 12 to 16. the only things you need to consider are if you like the way they look which i'm not too sure that i do and if you actually want to pair with no noise cancelling this is listed as one of the features of the product you know like be aware of your surroundings at all times but equally it does mean that you lose that in your own bubble feeling that you might get from a pair of airports pro for example all right so you know how those things were like mini speakers well here's a not so mini speaker this is the mars pro special edition and if you're someone who worries about robots one day taking over the world then you probably shouldn't buy one it's made of like proper metal and i'm still in shock that this is an actual working speaker but what's probably more surprising is that this company is claiming that it is of audiophile quality i'll be the judge of that [Music] okay i am genuinely surprised by that you think by looking at this that this is kind of just a showpiece but the base that it's managed to achieve in such a small package is phenomenal i still don't know about audiophile though so what in earth is number one then enter the try screen 2. and this one gadget can turn your normal lowly laptop into a triple screened behemoth there's no magnets or glue the system uses elastic to adjust to the size of your laptop and then once it's on you pull here and pull here and then you plug one usb cable into this one one usb cable into this one and that's it look at this this is wild so if i've got a window over here i can drag it all the way onto the main display and then through that to the right or i can just have like three full screen windows open at once and if you're wondering what happens when you take this concept to the absolute extreme this is the expandscape aurora 7. i was actually planning to go hands-on with it for this video but we just couldn't make timings work essentially though this company has figured out a way to make a top spec laptop we're talking latest i9 chipset 128 gigabytes of ram etc which can fold out to not one not three but seven displays i am still gonna try and get hands on with it because this is completely next level but long story short expect the final product to be released in a matter of weeks to check out my last gadgets video click here or to find out why the metaverse is both hugely exciting and kind of horrifying click here my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one
