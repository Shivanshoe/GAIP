did you know that you can buy a power bank that charges itself a building that's actually alive or a worm that could save the planet welcome to 21 heavenly inventions that will restore your faith in humanity from divine to glorious to godly now one of humanity's key crimes to this planet is how we've littered plastic everywhere this is a brand new cloud as well however there's a company called reprieve who is collecting that plastic and using it to make clothes like this this jacket right here is 30 recycled plastic bottles and if you go to their website you can actually see the live counter of how many they've taken out of seas and landfill they've just passed 30 billion so i'm gonna give reprieve a two out of ten blissful invention don't get me wrong it's just things are about to get much cooler put this back in my cloud storage because it's not just water bottles one of our main contributors to plastic waste actually comes from toiletries every single bottle of shampoo or body wash that you buy has its own separate plastic packaging it's not mine i promise but thanks to a german product designer johnna breton hoover there is not a chance i've pronounced that correctly we are getting the soap bottle packaging that can store liquid personal care products but the minute they're finished can be used for soap it's one of those ideas that would never randomly occur to you but as soon as you see it it just makes sense and not gonna lie i think they look gorgeous too three out of ten so i got a box from xiaomi the other day but what's really interesting about it is not actually what's inside more what it came in this packaging has a very unusual almost like spongy texture to it and after looking into it i realized that's because this box is made of mushrooms you can get literal factories now that stick fungus sprouts into a mold and then just leave them and allow them to grow into the shape of that mold it's so nature friendly that i can just eat the box into the ground and it will break down and feed everything around it four out of ten joyously simple did you know that a french company called new wind has started building wind trees where each leaf is a blade that generates electricity using the air and while i would say that wind isn't the most reliable energy source i think structures like this are the way to go you just build them once and you have a permanent tourist attraction that can also generate electricity continuously and silently i tried to climb the tree i promise now number 17 is a piece that was recently on display at the london design festival and for good reason i'm talking about a living chandelier which instead of glass or crystal is primarily surrounded by lab created leaves that contain actual living algae the benefit being that it still lights your room using a bulb on the inside like a normal chandelier but then that bulb also doubles as a source of light for the algae which can then photosynthesize take in carbon dioxide from the room and purify the air four out of ten but you can take this to the next level there is already a company called arep who's making algae-powered buildings i can't stress how cool this is these buildings are surrounded by large panels filled with algae that are not just purifying the air around them but are also using sunlight to generate the energy that's then harnessed to power the building and on top of that once the algae is fully grown it can then be taken out and used as fertilizer i gotta give this a 5 out of 10. these plants are literally god's gift to mankind right so here in the uk one of the ways that the government has tried to reduce our impact on the planet is by getting rid of single-use plastic straws and while i do think that the idea is right plastic straws regularly end up in beaches in seas and unfortunately in animals the alternative straw solutions kind of suck or should i say don't suck if you go anywhere now and order a soft drink you will get a paper straw and you'll basically have this continuous race to finish before it gets soaked and then starts to go floppy but this right here is a foldable reusable straw so you drink with it just like you would normally but then when you're done you can unfold it give it a wipe and then store it to be used again and again and again and the material is coated in such a way that it's naturally antibacterial now one of the biggest trends of the entire 21st century is the shift to vegan foods it can be better for the health whilst at the same time only causing about half the carbon emissions so for a lot of people it's just like well why wouldn't i bacon has been a pretty strong reason to not for many years until now where thanks to the whole load of proteins that we've managed to extract from all sorts of vegetables and crops the production of facan has become possible apparently this is going to taste just like the real thing we'll do a taste test when it's fully cooked it smells amazing though and related to bacon you know what leather is right this premium material taken from a cow but have you ever wondered what on earth is this vegan leather that we keep hearing about it's actually kind of genius there's a company called pinatex who gather the leaves of pineapples which are usually just a waste product not needed by any other industry extract the fibers from them and then mix them with corn and they end up with a material that bears striking resemblance to the real thing and it's even better because it's not just that you're saving the animals but it's also that if those pineapple leaves weren't used then they would have instead been burned which is even more damage to the environment that we're now saving ourselves from six out of ten it really does give you hope most people don't realize this but every single time we take a shower we're using on average 2.5 gallons of water per minute for some perspective that means that if you treated yourself to a nice relaxing 25 minute shower that's the equivalent of 1 000 glasses of hot water literally down the drain just try to imagine a thousand glasses in the room you're in right now more than likely it would fill up every inch of space you have the general advice from governments is to well just cut your shower time by three minutes versus your normal but there might be a better way thanks to a company called nebia you can buy a shower head that atomizes water into millions of micro droplets that might sound like it would be really unsatisfying but the shower head has an extremely high internal pressure which means that these micro droplets are actually being pushed out three times faster than a normal shower pushes out water thus making less water actually have more washing power six out of ten i'm feeling wet just thinking about it okay this next one it's not a typo it's an unexpectedly brilliant concept so there are two current issues one around 35 of the trees that are being cut around the world right now are being done just to fuel the paper industry and two elephants are regularly being hunted and shot just for their tasks poo paper by a company called elicosi solves both of these problems they figured out that by collecting elephant dung boiling it turning it into a pulp and then leaving it out to dry they can form paper paper that doesn't require a single tree to be cut paper that makes elephants monetizable therefore reducing the incentive to kill them and paper for which profits are then handed to shelters that take in and then look after the animals probably the least cool idea i've ever heard that i will be double checking each letter i receive from now on okay top ten we are in heavenly territory now come on i don't know why i did that this is all flammable we've all seen power banks batteries to top up your gadgets on the go you've never seen a power bank like shine it's a bit of a unit for sure but the reason is that this power bank contains its own wind turbine to generate its own electricity so you charge as many devices as you want to and it can refill itself on its own 24 hours a day 6 out of 10. and hey if you feel like shining then a sub to the channel would be angelic everyone loves a barbecue hot summer's day sitting outside taking in those smoky fumes but barbecues because they're uncovered are hyper inefficient most of the energy from the coal you're burning isn't actually going into heating your food it's just reducing air quality the gosun fusion though is a fascinating alternative it still cooks your food but instead of being open-topped it does so in a completely watertight vacuum-sealed chamber which means that all the energy you put in is going straight into your food it is five times more energy efficient but that's not even the best bit because thanks to its reflectors that triple the amount of light captured the fusion can also cook using just the power of the sun tell me that's not a bright idea but it's one thing to have a cooker that can sustain itself what about an entire home this is the eco-capsule it's one of the cheapest houses you could buy in most countries at just 50 000 euros and yet it's got enough space for two people and the interior of a simple hotel this thing creates its own electricity using a combination of a wind turbine up top and a roof that is lined with solar panels plus it automatically gathers and filters water from every single time it rains oh yeah and maybe the coolest thing because your entire home is built as a single complete unit you can control the whole thing with just one app which i think moves this to seven out of ten territory okay our fakin is done uh the reason we waited for it by the way is because i wanted to eat it on number seven a very special plate this is made by a company called biotrem who are basically trying to replace every single bit of plastic tableware that you would otherwise throw away after using once with their alternatives which are made from wheat bran and there's no real downside biotrem plates are really strong they're non-porous so you can eat wet foods on them you can even put them in the oven but what moves this from good to god tier is that they're not only eight times less polluting than a plastic plate to produce but also that instead of filling up a landfill site when done you can eat them alright so let's get the bacon on there three two one that bacon is amazing it's really smoky and greasy and meaty just like bacon the plate less so still the tastiest plate i've ever had but i think number six is even greater air inc which is such a gloriously simple concept that i could explain the whole thing in three short sentences air pollution is a big problem in a lot of cities this company invented a device to capture the air pollution they've then turned that pollution into ink which sits inside actual pens that you can buy eight out of ten pretty incredible now we've seen lots of green initiatives over the last few decades people saying we should stop flying in planes people saying we should completely abandon meat and while these messages might come from a good place i think the main reason that they haven't stuck is that they require people to drastically change their behavior which most aren't going to do i think that the most viable technologies are the ones that can make the best out of our existing behaviors like pavegen pav-gen have designed basically high-tech tiles that you can line your floors with and then when people step on those tiles it converts the kinetic energy from the pressure they've applied into electricity this tech has already been used many times for example there was a nightclub in london where people's dance moves alone were powering sixty percent of the venue eight out of ten we all love a two in one one solution that fixes two problems and plastic road is maybe my favorite example of it see when it comes to protecting our planet plastic is annoyingly durable it can take 500 years for this stuff to break down naturally but if you think about it there are times when that kind of durability is actually pretty great like roads so plastic road is using recycled plastic as a key material to make roads they're more durable they need less maintenance they don't get flooded thanks to the ability to store water inside of them and they save up to 72 percent of emissions from the simple fact that they're built using materials that have already been made okay these top three though i think have a good chance of completely changing our world for starters mealworms see the reason that there are so many initiatives created to tackle the plastic problem is because plastic is non-biodegradable or in other words every single piece of plastic that's produced is another piece of plastic that's going to sit somewhere and take up our already limited space or get burned but that's probably even worse for the environment however these little troopers might be turning that entire notion on its head because they can digest it it's looking like one of the natural enzymes produced by these mealworms has the ability to break plastic down in the same way that you probably have lactase enzymes which help you to break down and digest milk so if we can find a way to extract that enzyme and mass produce it we could potentially solve the entire world's plastic problem in a few months nine out of ten now what's the one trusty classic planet-saving technique that we all know about [Music] planting trees trees taken carbon dioxide trees release oxygen trees stabilize soil trees are a habitat for hundreds of thousands of animal species you get the idea but if you wanted to plant trees to match the pace of how quickly humanity is taking them down you need to hire an entire army full time to do so unless you use technology introducing the flash forest company who are utilizing drones that can fly above the ground use topography to identify the healthiest sites to plant trees drop those seeds with the required nutrients they need water them and then even come back later to check up on them they're basically high-tech parents but parents who are extremely efficient because just one of these drones can plant 20 000 trees per day that's basically an entire forest at a price of just 50 cents per tree and just before number one quick reminder that i do have a whole series of invention videos i think they're some of my favorite videos on this channel so i will leave them linked after this one okay so you know that solar panels are a huge part of our move to a sustainable planet they're the most elegant way to harness the free energy that the sun gives us but so far they've pretty much been relegated to the rooftops of buildings in some countries that get a particularly large amount of sun they're not widespread enough yet to make a drastic difference well the holy grail of solar technology is now in motion transparent solar this has been a theoretical concept for a long time now if we can figure out how to make every sheet of glass every window every car every building made to also be able to generate electricity we would we'd become so self-sufficient we would pretty much rock it forward an entire stage in society but the challenge has always been if we're absorbing this light to then convert it to electricity then we're not letting that light through and so these aren't really windows this is where things get clever remember light is a spectrum and there's only certain wavelengths in that spectrum that we can actually see so what if we could have panels that let in all the light within the human spectrum but absorbed and converted to energy all the light that lies outside of that spectrum this is becoming possible through the use of clear organic salts that can harness that light and with this technology we've already reached up to 50 percent of the electricity generating capacity of our current opaque cells lots to look forward to he literally comes the second we stopped recording you're a little you all know what i've been drinking under the table while filming this video this is hule black edition it kind of tastes like a light chocolate milkshake but it has literally every single nutrient you could possibly need i'm not even exaggerating this isn't made of ice cream or sugar it's tapioca coconut peas rice flax seed and sunflower seeds and all the sweetness is completely natural it's mainly stevia and coconut sugar so for me huel is three things it's super convenient it's a full meal with literally 60 seconds of prep it's the one food that's always there each bag is literally good to eat up to a year after you get it and three is this reassurance that i'm being looked after there's 27 vitamins and minerals there's 40 grams of protein per serving slow release carbs this is a really carefully crafted formula so if you hit the link in the description and give fuel a shot you will also get a free shaker and a huge t-shirt trust me when i say best fitting t-shirts i own to check out the last inventions episode that video is there or for 21 toxic tech fails that's over here my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss i'll catch you in the next one
