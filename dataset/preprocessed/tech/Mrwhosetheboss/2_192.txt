the one-plus concept one is a mobile that defies convention it is innovative powerful and also a little confusing at the same time so let's take a look in case it wasn't obvious this device continues oneplus as collaboration with McLaren the company responsible for super cars like the McLaren 720's from which inspiration has definitely been borrowed here he used his McLaren signature papaya orange leather on either side and then a glass window going down the middle made to look like a racetrack it's premium obviously construction feels tight and refined and visually it kind of reminds me a lot of that Huawei Porsche design made 30 RS phone that I took a look at recently but what exactly is this phone well the oneplus concept 1 gets its name from the fact that it's the first concept phone from oneplus and the whole idea of a concept phone is to demonstrate new concepts so you could always consider it a showpiece of the technologies that oneplus is working on first of all the rim of the phone is surrounded by pure gold to which you might be thinking hold on a second what is true but maybe even more interesting is the tech behind it so a normal modern smartphone will usually have a stainless steel frame or an aluminium frame but with the concept one oneplus started with this and then used a process called physical vapor deposition to add a thin film of pure gold on top of it solid gold is converted to a vapor the vapor sticks to the phone's rim and then becomes solid again obviously using large chunks of gold wouldn't make sense it would make the phone prohibitively expensive and so this is one of the ways that oneplus can actually build a phone which has the finisher of pure gold without the cost no I'm not entirely sure gold is a good material to have on the outside of phones because of its tendency to scratch but this is more a proof of concept it's one plus saying we've done this with gold but really we could do this to create many more types of finishes so stay tuned and speaking of staying tuned if you do like straight-to-the-point tech content then a sub to the mister who's the boss channel would be incredible in all this time then you might have also been wondering iron where are the cameras well that's one plus a second trick here cameras that can disappear electrochromic glass is what it is for the glass for which you can pass an electric current through causing the alignment of the molecules to shift preventing you seeing through it one plus actually took inspiration from that McLaren car which uses this technology in its sunroofs but this is the first time we're seeing anything like it on a phone the idea is that whatever you're doing on your phone the cameras remain hidden until you launch the camera app after which they creep into view with constant refinements oneplus has brought the time this process takes down from about five seconds to about not 0.7 seconds in the concept one phone so it's just a fraction longer than it usually takes to open the camera anyways so this technology does have a few perks but it also has quite a lot of question marks first of all on the positive side whilst I don't personally think the cameras on most phones look bad for an ultimate minimalist I can see the appeal of this even more seamless look but as I guess you've come to expect from oneplus this is not a company that likes to do things just for show there is a functional benefit you might have heard of a neutral density filter it's an attachment you can get for professional DSLR lenses that can restrict the amount of lights that gets into the camera well this tin table glass for the first time ever replicates this functionality on a smartphone so when you're in Pro Mode want up on this button and all of a sudden the bright spots in your image become a little less bright and then of course there's just the fact that it's cool the invisible camera is a design feature in the same way that having an exciting color option is meant we've seen plenty of those in the last few years the but before I get to where I think this tech is potentially headed I got to say I left this event with almost as many questions as I arrived with but for starters this neutral density filter is no Enya's useful on a phone as it is on a DSLR camera one of the main use cases would be when you're taking photos in broad daylight and you want to use a lens with a wide aperture on there let's in loads of light a neutral density filter can restrict the amount of light and therefore prevent you over exposing your shot but on a smart phone a you can't change your lens anyway and be your camera software can more often than not automatically correct for overexposure anyways I won't go into too many details but there are still some use cases like being able to take those long exposure shots during the daytime but their niche I genuinely expect no more than two percent of smartphone users to care because ultimately reducing the amount of light in almost every situation means your phone actually captures less information there's also the fact that even when these cameras disappear you can still sort of see the outlines when the phone is in the light there's the fact that this is just yet another thing that can potentially go wrong and also that this whole process of tinting the glass requires power and therefore contributes to battery drain sure the battery drain has been minimized over the last 18 months it's been in development but if I was personally going to use this I wouldn't even sacrifice 1% of my battery for the sake of making my cameras disappear the feature has literally no benefit to me and the elephant in the room the biggest question that I don't feel like oneplus fully answered is why is this tech important in the first place they said it's been 18 months in development and usually projects that this kind of scale start from a place of trying to solve a problem but it's tough to decipher what problem this solves exactly that said I'd give oneplus the benefit of the doubt here the fact that they've released this in the form of a concept phone means they're fully aware this isn't something everyone's going to want to buy more of a heads up that a hey look this is a piece of tech that we're working on I've been told to potentially expect to see products using it as soon as this year and it's perfectly possible that by then there will also be more of a use for it whilst yeah I'm not exactly sure where the glass that can just get brighter and darker is particularly useful it could well be a stepping stone into glass that can change color what if on your future oneplus device you could use an app and just press a button to change the color of your entire external physical smartphone there'll be crazy we could go red green blue whatever you want to the phone to look like the other specs of this one plus concept one processor cameras display they're all identical to their recent oneplus flagships there's no next-gen snapdragon 865 chip for example so this is not the most exciting concept phone I've seen especially when you compare it to devices like the vivo apex we saw all the way in 2018 or jammies mimics alpha just a few months ago but nonetheless it's good to see oneplus shifting gear moving from just offering existing technologies at a lower price to actually pioneering new feature themselves and this electrochromic glass is just one thing there's a few other features which are likely on the horizon for oneplus we've seen Qualcomm's 3d sonic max fingerprint scanner technology being tested on one plus devices it would mean you could use almost entire bottom half of your phone to scan prints and even set it up to require two fingers at once to unlock making a phone many times more secure oneplus is investing more in making their phone cameras better and there's a good chance their 20/20 smartphones will swap out notches for what i think is better the hole punch for the front camera and the 90 Hertz fluid displays we loved last year may just level up to 120 Hertz plus as a final cherry on top a mid-range oneplus device is looking very likely so stay tuned to the mister who's the boss channel for more updates on that and where that being said my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
