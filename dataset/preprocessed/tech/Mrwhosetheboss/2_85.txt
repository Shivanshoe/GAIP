oh dear what if you could record every minute of your life no matter where you are without needing to take anything out your pocket well that's the premise of the insta360 go to a camera that that might well change your entire perspective on cameras so thanks to the company for sponsoring this video and these are my top 10 things to know have a look at this this is last year's insta360 go one and this is the kind of footage it can take it's you know it's solid just given how tiny the thing is but this is what the insta 360 go 2 can capture it's still this tiny little camera but it's now using the same size image sensor as a gopro hero 9 and as you can probably tell it makes the last version look like a toy now you might know this about me i don't personally mind using bulkier gadgets if i think they're better this is why i always buy the pro or the max sized version never the minis it's why i bought the ps4 pro and not the ps4 slim or just look at the camera we're recording this on but for this device in particular being this small is the reason it can be what it's trying to be it means you can fit it anywhere inside a packet of crisps inside an amazon delivery package even even a smartphone box if you wanted to that shot was actually from our recent video about lg smartphones but more importantly being this small allows it to be light enough that you can wear it and i don't mean wear it as in use a specialized four-way chest strap to pull it into your body i mean you can slip it onto your pocket and get a waist level view you can strap it onto your cap and get this really elevated above head perspective you can even put it on your shoe if you wanted to i still don't know why i did this it's a very weird angle but the point is you can that's what makes it fun and probably the most unique example of the mounting possibilities is this necklace you put it on underneath whatever you're wearing and the camera snaps on top and it's so weird when you record from this perspective it really starts to look like you're playing in your own video game like you could come back to this at any point and very literally put yourself in your own shoes now there's only one microphone on this thing and because it's facing directly upwards chances are it's only really gonna pick up your voice so bear that in mind but as a concept i'm totally on board with this this idea of of being in a moment of not feeling like i need to hold my phone in front of my face to capture what's happening instead just being able to appreciate it and they have actually made the magnet even stronger than the last gen one but you know it is still a magnet if you wagged it it would fall off we've done that twice three times but there's even simpler fact that number seven this camera isn't just magnetic it isn't just the thing that you could stick to a magnet it is the magnet which means that if you see a metal surface it could be the bars holding up a tennis net or just about any signpost on any street there's a pretty good chance that you could just slap this on and that is our tripod sorted and it addresses one of the main problems i've had when trying to use my phone to record things namely that you normally need a second person because chances are you're not just going to come across a ledge that's at the perfect height to leave it on and even if you did it takes a certain kind of risk aversion to want to prop your phone up against an object and leave it there in the public while you film yourself this does also have a socket to attach it onto an actual tripod but the coolest part of this is that the case of the go 2 has its own tripod built in now even if you can't find a magnetic surface and if you decide that you don't want to use the case's own tripod there's an accessory for that now this is not a cheap camera i will get to that but in an age where smartphones are no longer coming with chargers video games are releasing half finished so that the companies can charge you more later for the rest it is nice to see a product that just has everything you could need in the box and possibly the most versatile of those is the pivot stand if you struggle to put the camera somewhere with all of the above options this will almost definitely do it all of a sudden you can stick to any flat surface to be honest even the not so flat surfaces i was using this to stick it onto my helmet while i was cycling i stuck this in a car to act as a sort of premium dash cam and not that it's worth getting this just for this purpose but it looked good also as you can probably tell for just about every accessory here there's a dual purpose so in the case of this pivot stand there is a cover that slides over the sticky bit to turn it into a handle i don't want to tell you it's just it's just well thought out but you get the idea you can stick it anywhere but this is where it gets interesting because this is where the software comes in you can record slo-mo at 120 fps there's time lapses which i mean you probably know what a time-lapse is at this point but the thing with this is that it's easy i was on a walk a couple of weeks ago and i found this view that i really liked the look of so all i did was i grabbed this i reached through the fence and i just magnetically clipped it on and then i left it there i went on my walk i came back 15 minutes later and i had my time lapse and it even has hdr mode which you know every now and again when you've got that really bright sky it gets overexposed this somewhat addresses that the one thing i'm hoping for though is that this first go camera it it had the most ridiculous feature called interval shooting where once every few minutes it could turn itself on record like a 15 second clip and then turn itself off again it's amazing but the go-to doesn't have that so i guess this is my way of saying please okay number four of all the software features and trickery that it has one of them stands above the rest it can edit videos for you you just pick the clips you want in it or really just allow it to use all of them and this apparently uses ai to figure out what's important and it matches those important bits to the beat of a track which is a pretty good example of how this company knows what they are they know that this camera isn't about to replace the blackmagic cinema 4.6k camera we've got there they know it's not going to replace a stack of professional lenses but they are hoping that this is a camera you'll keep with you to potentially remember snippets of every day of your life and if you are going to use it for that purpose they're also very aware that even if you're like me and you loved editing you're probably not going to want to sit through half an hour footage every evening and chop it up manually you obviously can do it yourself if you really wanted to but i've not felt the need to okay number three there are three different levels of ways to control the go-to you can either use the camera itself there's a hidden button on it and you can make it so that like one tap starts video for example you can use the case which has buttons and a screen on it to change modes but the best way of doing this is via your phone because if you do it this way you can get a continuous live feed of the camera on the subject of that case though and this whole idea of like each accessory serving multiple purposes this is also a battery pack it can charge the camera three times over now as i've been using this over the last month i have put this camera in a lot of risky places but for the most part i've not had to worry about it you can splash it you could take it to a shower if that's what you wanted to do it's actually completely immersible in water up to four meters which i mean if i lived in a more tropical location i would have probably made this my go-to camera for snorkeling get it go too no okay um it actually comes with replaceable glass lens covers which means that if you do accidentally you know just directly whack it with a tennis serve you can swap the glass okay number one my favorite thing about this insta 360 go 2 is pro video mode and it's not what it sounds like it's basically a new type of recording format that you can pick instead of normal video and at the cost of taking up more storage it gives you everything the sensor sees think of it this way while normal video comes out at a 2560 by 1440 resolution in a 16 to 9 aspect ratio the full sensor can actually capture a little bit more horizontally and a lot more vertically it's got a 2688 by 2688 resolution meaning that it's actually a square and the implication of this is that even after you've taken a video you can completely change the aspect ratio i can shoot one clip and from that export both a widescreen version for youtube and a tall version for an instagram story it means that i can reframe my footage if i cut something off accidentally and it even means i could keyframe i can create motion even if the camera was still like let's say i took a static time lapse i can scroll up and set that as a start point and then i can scroll down and set that as an end point and this means that even without using a professional slider or really even a tripod at all i can take a moving time lapse with this tiny camera without losing quality i could even make my normal footage do a barrel roll if i wanted to without cropping in further now the final and arguably most curious thing that pro video enables is a feature called horizon lock or in other words no matter how you orientate the camera no matter how you rotate that sensor because it is a square with room around the edges it can keep itself completely upright like just for a bit of fun i put this in my washing machine this is the result so that's the go-to it's 299 which it feels like both a lot and a little at the same time depending on how you look at it because yes you can get cameras that record higher quality footage for 299 but you probably can't get cameras with this many alternative perks it does make you wonder is this the world we're moving towards are we moving towards a world where everyone's going to be recording everything maybe i mean if small cameras are improving this quickly i could see it anyways i will leave a link in the description down below for this product like i said this is a sponsored video but part of my conditions for that to the company with it i was allowed to speak my mind okay thank you so much for watching my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one you
