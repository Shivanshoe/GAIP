okay in theory the 1+8 pros camera should be a massive improvement over the past 1 plus phones its sensor is about 40% larger and it's got a more advanced image signal processor but the question then becomes is it enough to keep up with the absolute best phones out there well actually yeah bear in mind with this comparison that while these are the three best phones each company offers there is a price disparity with Samsung being the most expensive while my first observations with this new oneplus phone was just how much the company has improved video dynamic range on the 8 Pro I didn't think I'd be saying this but for everything I've seen it is iPhone 11 Pro quality Samsung meanwhile it's sometimes not so great like here where the details and the dark areas have all but disappeared but it's sometimes good like here where it's able to light me up fairly well even though the Sun was directly behind me but oneplus is actually quite consistently good because it's a cheaper phone to even if it turns out equivalent to these other two phones I'd consider that a victory so it's cool to see that at least in some aspects it's better the only thing I would say is that there's a hint of redness with oneplus that shouldn't really be there and Samsung is slightly on the warm side versus iPhones cooler tones but between those two I'd say it's personal preference what is significant you've probably noticed this already is that the stabilization is uniformly fantastic in this comparison all three phones have optical image stabilization plus software stabilization and it shows even here when I was trying to walk like a maniac each of them have managed to smooth it down to something that looks almost rhythmic this is all being filmed at 4k resolution by the way if we move to low-light video oneplus is actually brighter than the other two low-light video has always been a weakness for Samsung but it's cool to see that this one plus can also find more light in the sky than even Apple's best my main complaint with video on this 8 Pro generally is focusing take a look at the iPhone for a second they can easily and reliably switch focus back and forth between the flowers in front and the flowers behind but both one plus and Samsung have a real tough time being able to do that but focusing on faces is fine but both of these two phones just fall apart on small finicky subjects you probably knew this it's easier for a camera to take a good photo then it is to take a good video so it's kind of unsurprising that all three of these have stellar photography your note is pretty early on that the large sensor sizes on one plus and samsung the result in much more natural background blur when you're capturing close-up subjects these are all not portrait mode shots just normal photos also quite a parent does help both these Android versions they tend to apply more contrast to images they often come out as more processed more altered perhaps but I would say it's not necessarily a bad thing like let's crop into my face in this shot you can see that both 1 plus and Samsung they seem to have detected that my face is there and it kind of adjusted it to look like how a face should look offense slightly taken but I think most would agree that I look better in those photos which is what most people want and on the note of cropping into things you might be wondering which camera captures more detail a simple question as always though the answer has a little more to it at face value 1 plus is main camera is 48 megapixels Samsung's is 108 and the iPhones is 12 so if you take a max resolution shot on each and crop all the way in its samsung fairly closely followed by 1 plus and then iPhone the thing is though most of the time you'll be on auto mode and on auto mode each phone actually just takes 12 megapixel shots Samsung still has an edge in detail though thanks to one of its pixels being made up of effectively 9 smaller sub pixels the oneplus 8 pro has a couple of other interesting photo features a macro mode which is pretty much the best macro mode I've ever seen on a phone it lets you get many times closer to objects and still keep them in focus I've been working on a painting over the last week and with this mode I could get right up next to it and get pictures of the finer details the other addition to oneplus is a color filter mode the phone's got a separate camera dedicated to just taking these quite strange inverted looking shots I'd say in a best-case situation they're curious but in any indoor environment the quality just falls apart all three phones have ultra wide cameras and actually one plus ultra wide sensor is like twice the size of the sensors on the other two phones ultra whites the fun fact the ultra wide camera on the oneplus 8 pro you is the same sensor as the main camera of the normal 1+8 I really can't tell much of a quality difference though and more obvious is the fact that Sammy and Apple just have a much wider field of view and zoom it seems to be a bit of a trend this year to stick of massive zoom camera on your phone something something has taken very much to heart credit where do though at 10 times magnification it is noticeably ahead of the other two and if you go further if you go to 30 it's in a different league altogether with one plus in second it's pretty similar situation for video - the only thing to bear in mind is that video quality tends to deteriorate to faster as you zoom in than photo quality because the phone can't apply all of those image processing algorithms in real time and slow-mo all three can record slow-motion at 240 frames per second actually this clip here is another example of Samsung's sometimes finicky focusing let's try a new one okay see a 240 frames per second slo-mo and you know I like one plus each phone is obviously taking a quality hit to record this many frames but it feels like with one plus you're losing the least and on one plus and samsung you can dial it more the former can record continuous slo-mo at 480 frames per second well something could do short bursts of 960 this is a really cool feature but it just would have been cool to see some sort of quality improvement since they introduced this years ago what about as the light starts to dip well shooting the dark is always something I get quite excited about this is my favorite section because night mode is a real test of how powerful a company's camera software is as for how the oneplus fares I say it trades blows sometimes it's behind sometimes it's ahead as with a lot of it's daytime shots it does still have that slight red tinge where it probably shouldn't and I kind of wish that oneplus spent more time capturing at night as things stand it literally takes its night mode photo in one second while the Samsung and iPhone they take their time with three to four second captures and that basically means that with the oneplus is not giving enough time to let more light in you do get the option though with each of these three phones to stick them on a tripod and capture for 30 seconds flat and to give you an idea of how much difference that can make it turned these shots into these shots quite a nice little jump there I do you think that oneplus takes the best flush photos if you're less of a knight mode type of person it has really good range and fill and the software takes an extra second after you take a flash photo to kind of piece things together it's worth the wait iPhone still takes the best portraits this title hasn't been contested in quite a long time I'd say both of these Android phones and a lot of Android phones is sometimes the blur doesn't look quite right sometimes the faces are a little soft sometimes they're too dark sometimes they're too light I just feel like Apple has figured out the secret sauce for taking reliably good portrait mode photos and so to wrap this comparison up a selfies we're at a stage now we're in the right lighting selfies can look as good as rear camera photos but as the light dips they diverge Apple kept as the light similar to how it was one plus and Samsung as with their rear cameras they tend to brighten and sharpen faces with harsh backlighting I'd say oneplus struggles and in super low-light you just can't see anything on the iPhone so that leaves us with the big question which phone one I'm gonna leave a poll here so you guys can vote on your favorite phone but what's becoming pretty evident to me is that these three are incredibly well matched it's hardly a case that one phone is just bulldozing the other two and more a case that I'm evenly handing our awards to each of these three phones depending on the category so in terms of your buying decision it's probably going to be more a case of by the firm that you want the software from and the user experience from and then you can rest easy knowing that you're also holding one of the most capable camera systems out there if you enjoyed this video do watch out for my detailed battery comparison coming tomorrow and with that being said my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
