okay foldable phones up until now they've been something that we love to look at but also something that very few people should actually buy oppo is claiming they've just changed that this is the find n the finding nemo no i'm just kidding it's the company's first ever foldable and from what they're saying it finally fixes them they're saying that this is the phone that will turn foldables from novelty to necessity you get a 33 watt charging brick in the box a couple of manuals a usbc charging cable and hold up a second that's not a big phone i really should stress that it is tiny like when i first heard that oppo was making a foldable i just kind of assumed that it would be the size of samsung's fault which is almost two full phones but in actuality even completely unfolded this thing is barely bigger than one and in four key ways the fine end does actually make you think yeah this is how foldable should be for starters the hinge every foldable has a hinge it's how they fold this is by far the best one i've ever seen and it's not just that it's really firm in that it can hold its position anywhere from 50 degrees to 120 degrees it's not just that it's been tested to last five and a half years of folding with no issues it's not just that there's no gap when the phone is folded and it's not just the immeasurably gratifying sound it makes every time you snap it shut no the most impressive part of this hinge is that it practically eliminates the crease on the screen every single foldable that i've ever used has a crease going down the middle it's not surprising it's like falling a piece of paper when you open it up again you're gonna see that line but this hinge it prevents the screen from needing to fold if you watch really carefully when i close it you'll see that instead of pressing it into a u-shape it's actually allowing the screen to rest in a water drop shape kind of like if i held a piece of paper like this and because it's not squeezing it shut oppa is saying that this phone will show the crease up to 80 less than other foldables which at least from my eight days of using it pretty much means you can't see it when the screen's on i mean who knows if i gave it six months it might develop a crease but i can tell you that other foldables have a crease straight out the box and thanks to surfsharkvpn for sponsoring this but there's another pain point that oppo is saying they've solved here to make this the definitive foldable phone the aspect ratio problem that is disgusting the fact that if we take samsung's foldable for example is this super thin tv remote like experience when folded and then almost a square when unfolded two screens neither of which are ideal for phone related content all amplified by the fact that it's slightly taller than it is wide and so if you actually wanted to consume content there is one extra step in that you then have to rotate it too well the find n goes for a stockier approach because it's so much shorter it can afford to be just a little bit wider while still being usable and that means one you can still use the front 1080p ish screen almost as if it was just a normal phone it is a little bit wonky looking and i did think it was weird to start with that one side of the screen is flat while the other is curved but having used it i'm pretty glad it's like that because it makes navigation gestures just way more pleasant than if it was a sharp cut off and two is that the second you unfold it it is still squarish but because it's wider than it is tall you're automatically in landscape mode ready to consume media and hey if you like consuming my media then a sub to the channel would be opportune but it's not just that they're making good decisions when it comes to the hardware i wasn't expecting how fleshed out the course software would be see when i first got this phone there wasn't a single leaked photo on the entire internet no one knew what this was which is rarely the case just before a consumer-ready phone launches and so i just assumed oh it'll be some sort of internal prototype concept device but no the software experience makes it clear that this is a phone oppo spent a long time planning for as it turns out even though this is technically their first ever foldable they told me they've spent the last four years making six other foldable phones this is just the first one that they thought good enough to release so either they're extremely good at keeping leaks or well or no one cares but what i'm trying to say here is that while the phone is first generation the internally developed first party software has clearly been in the works for a while i did notice two instances where words were cut off in the ui but apart from that it is fast smooth and tactile the camera interface makes really good use of the space provided the live wallpapers that open up proportional to how much the phone is open are delightful and the split screen multitasking is handled greatly you feel like you're literally playing fruit ninja something like that i can't believe i actually did that didn't realize it would squirt so much and then the final cornerstone of the find n is its price now because this phone is being launched in china only for now the only pricing info that i have is that it will be less than 10 000 reminbi which i realize is not a hugely useful figure given that no one watching is from china i think but it's useful for context because we do know that samsung z43 is about 12 000. so assuming that oppo does one day launch their foldables globally i think there's a pretty good chance that they will actually undercut samsung i should probably put this knife away okay all that great stuff aside there's three reasons that i don't think oppo's quite nailed it yet and contrary to the marketing these are significant enough reasons that i don't think this is the phone that will change foldables from novelty to necessity a big one being that even more so than its competition i think this is a novelty like why does someone buy a foldable phone it's so that they can either have a huge screen that can be folded into a normal phone form factor or a normal size screen that can be folded up into a mini form factor right those are the only two credible reasons in my eyes but this isn't really either it's not small enough when folded that you can just slip it into a shirt pocket or women's jeans and even when it's full size it's not big enough to satisfy a power user's needs corners a corner this is only a 7.1 inch screen and so as far as i'm concerned the only real benefit from it being smaller is the novelty factor i mean it's it's kind of cute but there is a real cost the fact that it's so short and stumpy makes it not just less elegant but it also means that i almost can't hold it without in some way touching the module and that they've had to make it thicker you don't notice it so much when it's unfolded but when both layers are stacked on top of each other you really just wish that you could just slice the bottom one off actually where's that knife like this is the arc that my thumb makes even though it's a titchy little front screen the thickness means that there's a good 30 of it that i've still got to reshuffle to be able to use now remember how i said that oppo's first party software was awesome yeah well the third party software on this ain't so hot now takaopo some slack this is launching in china only and the key chinese apps seem to be optimized fine but assuming that the plan is to make their foldables global one day this is just me saying there is a lot of work to do tiktok opens sideways instagram looks like it was optimized by my cat and pretty much no app that you'd want to use around the world has any support for the phone's screen splitting flex form feature and this is the problem when you spend too long prototyping the fact that oppo has been working on this for years and that they've gone through so many different hardware iterations is great for their own software it means they've had ages to make sure that it's just right but as far as external partnerships go like working with google to optimize their apps and add exclusive foldable features it means that they're pretty much right at the beginning but my most fundamental reservation with recommending something like this is that opposed claiming they fixed foldables here they're basically saying look poor hinges and poor durability are the current key problems with foldables we've sorted them and while it does feel like they have sorted those things i don't think those were the main problems the reasons that i've so far held off on recommending one are not screen creases it's more fundamental things like the thickness from having two layers the inefficiency of having to have two separate displays and three sets of cameras when you can only use one at once the fact that the inner screen is basically a square which is not ideal for anything except specifically split screen multitasking watching my own videos for example i'm ironically getting a bigger viewing experience on my iphone and the space constraints which mean that foldables have never had the best camera systems and really the find n doesn't fix any of those problems to clarify the camera is really not bad this uses the same 50 megapixel main camera as opposed find x3 pro their highest end phone so far it feels premium and i have taken some great photos with it it's got plenty of fun toys to play with for example a rather decent cinematic video mode and even the ability to use the hinge as a tripod to take time-lapse videos of the night sky but you will feel the compromise when switching to the ultra white camera which is much lower resolution and the zoom camera which has just two times magnification and like this is a fast phone snapdragon 888 up to 12 gigs of ram 512 gigs of ufs 3.1 storage but it doesn't feel as fast as it should be because of the inefficiency of having to make two separate screens for a foldable you see because making both the front and the inside screens high refresh rate 120 hertz panels would push the price of the phone up a lot opposed decided to make the inside screen 120 hertz and then the front screen 60 hertz now that might sound like a good compromise but if i slow both of these down you'll be able to see how much of a difference there is like having a 60hz screen in of itself is fine you get used to it and you don't really think about it but having both a 120 hertz and a 60hz screen on the same phone is like taunting you it's letting you experience the good life every time you open but then reminding you of what your life used to be like every time you close here's the thing though well i'm not necessarily saying you should try and import one of these yourself the fact that this exists and the fact that oppo has got so many things right on the first try especially that price is exciting and it's really good news for anyone thinking of getting into foldables in the future because it's gonna push the market forward okay at this point i probably don't need to tell you what a vpn is if you want to either browse the internet anonymously change the location of your device to another country to watch tv shows from that country or just to avoid censorship or to escape data throttling from your service provider then a vpn is the way to go but then you're faced with a question of which one and at least from what i've seen there is no vpn on the planet that is offering close to the value of what surfsharkvpn is unlimited number of users and 24 7 support for this kind of price if you use the code boss you get an 83 discount and specifically for this holiday season an extra four months for free which takes the total price to like 2.13 a month we spend more on paper clips than that oh yeah and it also has the
