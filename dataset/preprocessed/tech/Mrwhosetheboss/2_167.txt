if you see my last video you'll know that I've been using the Huawei P 40 Pro for a while now this is the one everyone's talking about but the company actually released three phones a 799 euro p40 the 1999 European Pro but then also a 1399 euro P 40 Pro Plus the ultra phone and after a bit of a stuck in custom situation I finally got it and this might just be a world exclusive so please subscribe if you want to see more of those okay so the packaging is externally standard Huawei fare their boxes of lot like this for years now it says 8 gigs of RAM and 512 gigs of storage that is a lot of storage but half of the 16 gigs of ram that Samsung's s20 Ultra comes with the phone is on top we'll get to that in just a second there's your sim ejector tool a standard clear TPU case USBC cable wired earphones and a Huawei 40 watt supercharger okay it's $400 more than the p40 Pro the packaging is basically the same bar a little plus sign next to the logo so what are you getting here well the p40 Pro Plus has three main pros Pro Plus plus Pro blow three main advantages over the p40 Pro the design the charging and the cameras so first of all if I put this side by side with the p40 Pro you can tell they're from the same family they've got the same shape the same size that two-tone style camera module that's all unchanged but the most obvious shift is the material is moved from reinforced glass on the pro to nanotech ceramic here and this is a cool material to have on a phone it is harder than glass for starters which means it would take more for you to scratch it and would probably hold up better if you accidentally chucked it into the same pocket your keys are in we've all done at once or five times it's more conductive so it can take the heat inside your phone and dissipate it better in theory so it should stay cooler and then will also be a very slight performance bump as a side effect also based on what we saw from the essential phone a few years ago which ironically ended up being anything but essential but their phone did have one thing going for it a ceramic body and it pretty much aced the durability tests so you could expect something similar here I've actually got my most picks the ones used to test hardness sitting literally there and I won't lie to you my hands came close but it's probably a little early for that and then as for how it actually looks I'd say it's not for me but I get it I was promised reflective and they weren't lying this is effectively a tinted mirror I can check my teeth in this but this kind of reflectivity has two implications it looks stunning when it's clean but also it's hard to keep clean and to that end the normal p40 pros finish does a better job of resisting fingerprints also if I had to pick I'd probably go for the silver on the pro as opposed to plain black that you get on the Pro Plus but there is also a white one which I haven't seen that might completely blow me away the other thing you'll notice design wise is that the camera module is even bigger yeah more cameras in fact in total this phone has seven cameras dotted around it two on the front and five on the back so that five times optical zoom sensor on the probe this sizable one on the bottom has now been swapped for two cameras three times optical zoom one here and then a ten times optical zoom one here it's literally twice the size of the one on the p40 probe and I thought the way they had achieved it is pretty fascinating they reiterate here if you told even techie people a few years ago that they'd be getting ten times optical zoom on a smartphone they would think it was some kind of late April Fool's joke admittedly a really sad one but even me when I was getting briefed over like a video call when I first sort of saw the phone I had to double take I had to double check that it was in fact ten times optical zoom and it is so just generally to achieve magnification optical zoom you need distance between the sensor and your lens the obvious problem though trying to do that on a smartphone is that you don't have the physical depth to be able to create that distance so what a few phones have done in the past is create a periscope system so light comes in through the lens gets reflected internally and then hits the sensor sitting in the body of the phone it is seriously cool and some phones in the past have used this to achieve up to five times optical magnification but to hit the 10 times seen here you've got to create more distance you've got to create the longest possible pathway for that light to travel between the lens and the sensor so just for this phone by the looks of it maybe they'll use in future ones to always create a completely new system that bends the path of the light five times within the body of the phone regardless of how important it actually is to have 10 times optical zoom I'd think the mechanism is such a clever piece of engineering okay so that's design I got a little bit carried away there but charging the p40 Pro has 40 watt wired is super charging and then pretty fast at 27 watt when you go wireless the p40 Pro Plus has wireless super charge so you might have guessed it that's 40 watts of power even when you're Wireless you do need to buy hallways own proprietary charger for it to work I'm not personally much of a wireless charge on myself but it might just be the most powerful commercially available wireless charging out there okay but the main thing with the Pro Plus is cameras I've been playing with it for a bit now and to make one thing clear this is super early software this phone is coming out later than the p40 and the p40 so I'm told the software is not even close to being ready so I can't show you camera samples yet but I can already tell you that this is the first time a phone can consistently see more detail further away than my eyes can and you notice it particularly in video for one key reason you've probably seen the galaxy s 20 ultra that phone has a 100 times space zoom camera on the back but it's not quite what it seems the actual optical zoom range is about 4 times but it compensates by being a high resolution sensor so when you're zooming in to take a photo when you go past 4 times you can keep zooming for a while and still get a sharp picture because you're cropping into the high-res sensor this doesn't really work for video when you zoom in above 4 times for video on Samsung it won't then start cropping into its sensor to maintain that crisp 4k quality it'll just use digital zoom so the other way to achieve 100 times max zoom is to do what we always done to have a lower resolution camera but with a further optical zoom range you could think of it like this Samsung's optical zoom will only get you to here but because it's a high resolution sensor you can keep cropping quite a bit further always optical zoom will get you all the way to here but because it's a low resolution sensor you can crop a little bit further so in terms of how photos will look at a hundred times the software is a bit early for me to say but for more Holly saying it should be much better than Samsung's we'll have to wait and see on that one though but the big gap something I can see already even with this incredibly early software is when taking video you can get what looks like almost full quality video with ten times magnification you know how would most parents you see a jump in quality as you're kind of zooming in as your phone switches to its telephoto cameras yeah well as you zooming in here you get that jump twice once when you hit three times and then again when you hit ten times I've never seen anything quite like it of course everything else seemed I've wanted to do with zoom is better here too like zooming all the way into the moon for example yeah pretty much everything else is the same as the p40 Pro the same software the same display and while this is not a review by any stretch of the imagination I can already say that if you're a Wally fan and you're looking at this lineup wondering which one to get it's probably going to be the normal Pro the lighter body the matte finish more importantly the much lower price tag gives it that mainstream appeal but as far as having an extreme phone to kind sit on top of that lineup there's a Corbett a kit and I'm excited to see how it gets better with future software updates if you enjoyed this video a sub to the channel would be incredible there is a lot of content coming up next week with that being said thanks for watching my name is Aaron this is mr. Hughes the boss I don't catch you in the next one [Music]
