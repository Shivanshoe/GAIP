are you closed it's 12 on a tuesday so over the phone there's no one i can talk to please enter the call on me in all my time reviewing phones and watching tech videos there's one question i've never seen answered but it's an important question how much does each company care about their customers we're going to contact some of the biggest tech manufacturers from samsung to apple present them with a fairly simple problem i'm just going to tell them that my screen has gone black and then see how long it takes them to figure out that it's because my batteries run out okay this is samsung customer satisfaction do i need this every time i go on a call we aim to answer your calls within one minute what is wrong with you shut up hi yes so i have purchased a galaxy s21 ultra and i'm finding that my phone is dying at about six to eight pm every day the screen just goes black and i i don't understand what's but the happening is still active not shutting down or anything else i don't know the screen goes black and the only way to get it working is to put the wire in well uh just to have much more information uh our technical team maybe they could just need to just fix the settings on your phone and everything will be okay so it's such a simple problem it's kind of a shame that they've already had to redirect me once i feel like the best companies will solve things in the first call how long is this going to take maybe lots of people having the same problem as me hello and thank you for calling samsung camcorders they've just sent me back to the start they ended the call i can't believe it okay well that was terrible they sent me on a complete loop around their system only then to hang up on me zero stars i'm afraid not a great start [Music] we may share your personal data with her she sounds like she doesn't want to be there welcome to unpleasant how may i assist you the screen just goes black could you just explain me a bit more regarding how it happened like for the first time so i i put wire in once and then i take the wire out and then later it dies do you have to wire in again after eight o'clock like yeah that it happens every day right yeah how often do you charge your phone uh i put the wire in in the night the charging may only require one or two hours if you're playing it placing it for a long time it may affect the battery of the device okay but the battery should last three years right yeah it will last three years but the battery to last three years it requires its own nature the battery may be like right now not performing well is the phone not running around and deserting me uh like after like during the six to eight once you plug in does it turn on yes yeah the reason for that is the battery being draining down that is a reason that was decent a bit of a roundabout way to get there but we got there was someone hoovering right next to him though i'll give this three stars now we've got huawei welcome to your huawei service hotline huawei would like to wish all its customers well and suggest following government advice are you hopeless mr hancock i don't think so as much as possible that's nice the screen goes black i have to plug the wire in when you plug your wire charger like your battery like how much it is uh i was told the battery would last on your phone i was told the battery would last three years when your phone goes black is it like it run out of charge or is oh run out of charge i don't know do you do a lot of videos on the phone uh yeah yeah a lot of videos pretty much it's like a heavy usage okay because i thought i thought my phone was letting me down pretty much running out of charge thank you for calling flowers and have a great day that's how you do it that was amazing that was fast that was to the point that was that was exactly what i needed this is a 4.5 out of 5. i'm really curious when we get to apple is that going to be even better hi thank you for bringing xiaomi uk customer support the phone stops working yeah i have to put the wire in afterwards by the way who am i sticking with today could we please try to reboot the phone using the volume app and then the power button at the same time i just want to ask is your phone needs to be plugged in with the charger first before it works yes is your phone have its full charge or the phone is fully charged very fast very friendly quite impressed again wow this person you could tell that she was really friendly but also she really wanted to solve my problem and she did it really quickly so easy 4.5 out of 5. time for blackberry please provide your blackberry imei this can be found in your device settings if you do not have your device or imei available please call us back later they're not going to talk to me until i have an imei number feel free to visit our website closed is 12 on a tuesday for a one-time fee you can purchase blackberry smartphone incident-based support directly from blackberry for 35 us dollars per instance not very impressive to be honest like i understand why they keep their services like this but it really feels like the second your warranty ends or the second you decide that you're not a blackberry customer they don't care i didn't get an answer i didn't even get to talk to anyone so i can't give this any stars it's oppo time thank you for calling [Music] my phone just the screen goes black you can hear him looking through his manual right now can you go into settings on your device okay now scroll down until you find do not disturb mode okay and is there like an option uh refresh that that's something that corresponds to the times when your device switches off no there's nothing oh this is not going well for oppo and at the bottom again yeah they said my phone would last for three years yes my best setting was turned on which forced the device to switch off and this one we are doing we are system setting reset right now your phone does not fully discharges and then just turns off because there is no more battery so the battery needs to be recharged and if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be acceptable that was pretty good he was very method driven so he kind of over complicated the problem a little bit but he stuck with me and we did get to a solution it's a fair play i think that deserves 3.5 stars it's vevo time we are experiencing a high volume of calls and all every day it seems to just go black the screen is is it good i'm sorry no no okay we're just the repair center would actually be further south sorry so we'll be okay until we do have the device in here unfortunately i just wanted some advice okay i can get someone to maybe give you an email back regarding it we're not technically changed i wouldn't be able to help if i can take as much detail as possible and i can email over so what would be the make of the device sorry uh vivo so over the phone there's no one i can talk to uh no unfortunately not sorry okay and how long will an email take i i don't know usually they do send an email the next day but i would be able to guarantee unfortunately thank you oh that was going so well she answered quickly she sounded like she was about to drop some info but then she said that vevo doesn't answer technical problems over the phone she at least did offer to send an email though which is something but she did also say that this will not happen in the same day so given that it's such a simple problem this is one star territory it's apple time i'm an automated system that can handle complete sentences so tell me how can i help you today my phone's screen is going black i'd like to speak to a representative okay i'll get you right over to someone in our technical support area to help with your iphone what apple product or service are you calling a bite the passion fruit wii yes or no was that an ipad it's not far off to be honest yeah to get your display repaired you'll need to send in your ipad or bring it into an apple service center can i please talk to a person what's that send me the text yes or no no the screen turns off did you see your iphone screen thumbs up every evening yes 10s max can you tell me what your email address is uh yeah yeah yeah uh richards yeah l-e-y at googlemail.com the iphone in question the iphone xs max you don't have it here with you uh no do you have any idea what the what the problem is yeah we need to have the phone with you probably we need to do a text on the phone if you have internet connection you need to find out what is wrong with the phone okay so you can't diagnose without the phone no thank you i i'm never going to say goodbye though say that again hello not as good as i was expecting to be honest it was a long initial wait time and their help was conditional on account details even if the problem that i was having didn't necessarily need that still relatively friendly and useful once i got through to them though so 2.5 stars okay so to answer our original question xiaomi and huawei are the two winners of this experiment was that what you were expecting to be clear we've only made one call to each company from one country so this is not a conclusive experiment but it should give you a taste of what to expect if you enjoyed this video then i've got a gadget here that you definitely should not buy or a guide to crypto for someone who knows absolutely nothing about crypto thanks for watching my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss i'll catch you in the next one
