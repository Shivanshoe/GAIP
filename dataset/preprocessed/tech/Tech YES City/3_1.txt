this here is the asrock desk meat b660 audience meet the b660 meat meat meet the look all i'm going to say is it's a friendly unit it's so friendly in fact that it's spelt with m-e-e-t not to be confused with me80 meaning it's also a vegan-friendly unit though speaking of friendly this contains a b660 itx board not to be confused with mini itx and so what it means is it's got that extra width on the right hand side of the motherboard allowing this board in particular to host 128 gigabytes of ddr4 memory over four slots compared to mini itx boards which usually only have two ram slots available they've also custom fitted this to the case i'll put the dimensions up on the screen but at the front of the case you get four type a usbs already hard wired and a usb type c and a four port mic in audio out hybrid and then on the back you get three display outs as well as four type a usb ports rj45 and then your standard line in mic in and audio out ports though inside the unit we've got here two m.2 units one at the front one at the back both of those support pca gen four x4 and also the 16x slot for the pcie graphics is a gen 4 solution too then you've got two fan headers one of those most likely being used by the cpu cooler which allows clearance up to 54 millimeters on the cpu cooler then for the graphics card you can fit a two slot solution up to 206 mil even though they say 20 centimeters on their site i did measure up to 206 millimeters but before we get on to the testing and building this thing up it will retail at least what i'm seeing here with the street pricing around 250 us dollars and for that price you get the chassis the case and also the b660 itx and a 500 watt channel well 80 plus bronze power supply which is custom sleeved with the runs for this particular case so all up in terms of the value it is looking impressive out of the box but when it comes to a build are we going to come into any issues since i will be using an i5 12 400 32 gigabytes of ram and an rx 6400 which asrock did send over they wanted me to take a look at it but you guys already know when it comes to 6500 xt's and rx 6400 i'm personally not a big fan but since we do have the quick sync encoder on board the cpu that should account for any of those mishaps that the rx 6400 lacks but let's whip this thing up tech yes city style and then see if we can undervolt it and what the power consumption versus the frame rates are going to be so now that we've built the pc up it's time to get into the proverbial meat and potatoes of today's video and that's reviewing the desk meet b660 and testing out the i5 12 400 with the default intel cooler you'll definitely want to undervolt this cpu in my opinion where even on an open testbed system in a cooler environment the stock cooler is just barely going to do the job i've tested this cooler in the past i'll put the link to that video up here and this is where i decided to undervolt the cpu down to 3.6 gigahertz we got around 65 watts down from that 86 watts and this was throwing out much better temperatures in terms of consistently under 70 degrees also when we're gaming it's getting around these temperatures too but this is because it is an itx build and i do stress that airflow is not going to be the best and in fact if you're going to do a more higher end build with this rig say for instance you're throwing in a 3060 ti mini or you're going with a 6600 xt mini then you'll definitely want to get a fan installed somewhere in this build to get some airflow going through it though there were a couple of bad things couple of good things that surprised me and we'll get the bad news out the way first and that is the pcie gen heatsinks are absent there is none so if you are running a gen 4 drive do make sure you have your own heatsink to bring to this build because you do not want to run gen 4 and vme ssds without heatsinks they will have a short life as opposed to a gen 3 that's usually fine i do recommend having a heat sink on them even though this budget option and the motherboard didn't have any heat sinks so we can run a gen 3 drive without heatsink should be okay though another problem that i came into personally was it's not really a problem it's just i'd like to see more ventilation on mini itx especially since this board is pretty capable and that has the four dimm slots can support the i5 12 400 or the i3 12 100 i personally wouldn't go any heavier on a cpu in this configuration as then the heat will just get literally too hot to handle and speaking of heat here is where we had the rx 6400 we had that i5 12 400 and we're playing apex legends and we're getting around 147 watts out of the box total system power draw but then when i undervolted the cpu i dropped it down to 3.6 gigahertz from four giga it's all core default and then i drop it down to minus 50 millivolts we were able to get some good numbers here of 137 watts and you're probably like well brian did you undervolt the rx 6400 and this is what surprised me about the rx 6400 it's completely locked out i couldn't undervolt this card at all the options just aren't there in the adrenaline software or it's not there in the uh msi afterburner so if you get an rx 6400 you're just gonna be completely locked out so you can't do anything with the card but that said it does look like it has some pretty good what per fps performance we'll put up the whole build here i played some apex legends 1080p low settings with four gigabytes textures we're getting 120 average fps and 85 one percent and then 74.1 lows throwing our project cars this defaulted to just auto settings on medium at 1080p we're getting just under 60 fps and the one seven point percent loads were decent going over to do maternal here's where we had 1080p high settings we're averaging around 71 fps with 56 and 44 17.1 lows so the gaming numbers were decent and the temperatures were okay the single fan rx 6400 was running around 77 degrees and this is in a 30c ambient environment so it is pretty hot here in japan and the cpu temperatures were okay as well but here's where i'm going to weigh in with my experience on itx builds and say that with the desk meet i wouldn't be going any higher than that i5 and that sort of low power consumption budget gravis card say for instance you want to go with an rtx 3060 ti a mini or an rx 6600 xt mini and an i7 then you will have to add in some extra fans definitely to get heat out of the case get some airflow going through this thing though in hindsight if i had the option to do this build again i'd be going with an i3 12 100 and say an rtx 3050 mini and then undervolt that rtx 3050 or of course a gtx 1650 super that would be my two picks to go in this build then now it's time to get on to the positives with this build and i was just first of all surprised on just how easy and quickly you can build up an itx rig in an 8 liter form factor in this thing it took me 10 minutes from start to finish extremely easy just put the cpu in put the ram in the cooler on put your ssd in and then put your graphics card in and wire your 24 pin and 8 pin and if your graphics card needs a pci connector wire that up and then insert the power supply and then you're good to go now the power supply area you can mount an atx power supply or you can mount an sfx power supply and if you mount an sfx power supply you'll then get extra clearance height on the cpu cooler an additional 23.5 mil so we'll bring the clearance up to around 77 mil if you're going with an sfx power supply and then the last thing i noticed that was pretty cool was if you're not mounting a graphics card in this build say for instance you're going with no gpu and you want to make things really quiet then you then got the option to mount say a 120 mil water cooler in place of that gpu and have cooler temperatures on the cpu the last real good positive with the b660 desk meet that name's a funny one i i i gotta keep sort of reminding myself not to say the desk mini because that's how i always think of these from asrock the desk minis and not the best meats so the bias on this b660itx board is great the utilities there you can do all the options from under vaulting to even setting in custom memory timings which in this case i was actually really surprised because i cheaped out so hard on this 32 gigabyte kit of memory that it didn't have xmp profiles but it did have the memory information that sort of team group set in the jdec information so i was able to copy those settings the main timings the cast latencies then things like the t-ras and after that i turned on the asrock secondary and primary optimization and round-trip optimizations and it did the rest for me the memory was then able to work not at 3 200 megahertz however since the memory was that bad i got it to work at 3 100 megahertz even though it booted at 3200 megahertz it froze but thankfully we had that manual tuning there that was actually really good to use on this board so the bus works really well but let's quickly recap this build and give you guys a conclusion and so when it comes to the shell right you've got the pricing there that is about 250 usd at least that's the pricing in japan and for that you're getting a motherboard the chassis the enclosure and also a decent power supply that's all wired up in terms of its cable lengths to do the job and i think in terms of value for money and how they've wired up that front output as well as the whole motherboard in general and how it's mapped out with the bios i think they've done an extremely good job on this one though i will say know the limitations on this build it's an eight liter so it is a small case the ventilation could use a bit of improvement in my opinion i'd like to see much more mesh on this thing as well as possibly the option to mount even say a very thin 10 centimeter or 12 centimeter low profile fan i know they exist and they do serve very well in mini itx builds so i'd like to see that option and then you could go for say that i5 12600k maybe and then get a water cooler in there or get some better cooling and go for the 360ti mini and that would make the potential of this so much more for even custom itx enthusiasts that wants something powerful in a small package though as it stands it's more orientated for an i3 12 100 or i5 12 400 build with say 32 gigabytes of ram and a low power consumption graphics card that is of a smaller stature but when you do get this build set up it is a breeze to use and it does work extremely well and i was impressed with how everything turned out so it's a good option especially for people who are getting into itx and want something easy to build in one song is going to give good value for money and they don't want to break the bank the limitations are there do keep them in mind if you want to go with a build like this and with that aside do let us know in the comments what you think of the desk meat b660 itx love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from dude spookum and they ask so i'm trying to clarify roughly 10 000 yen equates to around 100 usd or am i totally off on that and that used to be the way everyone described um a hundred dollars in u.s they'd be like yeah a hundred dollars buys you 10 000 yen they equal the same but the us dollar has gotten a lot stronger especially in the last year and so the exchange rate is more 100 usd we'll give you around 13 500 yen which does make for some bargains outside of tech i'll put a link to the recent japanese parts hunt we did for you guys and with that aside if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell to get the content as soon as it drops and i'll catch you guys in the next one peace out for now bye and it's taken me back [Music]
