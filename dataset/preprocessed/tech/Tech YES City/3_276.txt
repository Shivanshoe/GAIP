well i guess for the n-key rollover this keyboard supports
two-handed tech yes spam optical mechanical switches these are the best
you can get in gaming peripherals whether it be a keyboard or a mouse
though corsair have now introduced these switches into what they call
their kpx linear switch on the brand new k100 rgb
keyboard coupled with the 4000 hertz polling it makes for the fastest gaming
keyboard i have tested to date and in fact even faster than any mouse i
have also tested here at the studio in terms of input lag though exactly how
much faster is it well let's find out
[Music] the optical mechanical switch differs
from a standard mechanical switch in that a micro beam is used to actuate the
key press as opposed to the standard mechanical
switch which uses a traditional lever this allows for even more consistency at
a micro level when it comes to typing and actuating
keys though testing out the input lag figures on this keyboard
it is simply the best numbers i have seen here in the studio of any device
tested so far scoring roughly one to two
milliseconds on average lower than that of a logitech mouse
it is quite an impressive feat and again this kind of gear is
although in the grand scheme of things better for competitive play
it is not going to magically make you a better player per se
so i will preface this video by saying if you suck at 5 milliseconds input
delay then you're still going to suck at .5 milliseconds delay
though if you are winning games in high ranked tournaments then that 2
milliseconds could make a difference and this is why i'm sure highly
competitive gamers at a pro tier level will have keen eyes for gear like this
firstly part of this latency advantage is due to the 4 000 hertz polling rate
which is native to the k100 rgb and this is a four-fold improvement over
the previous models that carried a thousand hertz polling however this
difference alone will actually only account
for a shift in roughly 0.375 milliseconds
average over that of a thousand hertz 0.5 milliseconds average versus 0.125
milliseconds average if you want to understand the mass
behind this then i'll leave more details in the description below the rest of
this extremely quick and sensitive key press
lies in one more factor the height of the actuation itself
this is an extremely high actuation point where in the b-roll you can see
that is almost immediately actuated after a slight press
this is good for getting the fastest reactions for gaming however there is a
trade-off in my opinion of more typos which is where i
experience the lower words per minute score
when typing as a consequence versus my traditional score which is around 125
words per minute however since this is a linear switch
there is also no feedback which having no resistance is
preferred by most gamers the keycaps are double shot pbt so they
will last a lot longer than cheaper abs and the sounds to the presses is very
pleasant to the ears i will let you take a quick listen so the hardware is definitely there for
gamers however the k100 rgb also features a
lot more the included wrist rest has a soft cushion fill with artwork and the
corsair logo printed over the top and it is actually very comfortable for
an included wrist rest to the likes where it's easily the best
wrist rest i've seen included with a keyboard
to date on the left hand side is six programmable macro keys
and you can use them for other functions if you wish which you can then just
above that at a heartbeat change to a different set of macros by
simply pressing the profile button which is the sign of a person this will
also change the lighting if you have set that to the different profile too within
the iq software you can also program each individual key
with multi-layer rgb effects and link that to other corsair gear that has rgb
and iq enabled as far as how many profiles you can have
i believe it is unlimited though to the right of that is a custom
dial knob that can also be used for a variety of different functions
with its own backlight to indicate which function it uses
whether it be changing tracks in spotify or changing the brightness of the
keyboard basically you don't have to be gay to
appreciate this knob to the right of that is a windows lock
key function then in the center is an led visual display to inform you of
things like wind lock numb lock and scroll lock etc
then the last but not least feature is the media keys which having a mutant
volume scroll is essential for me personally lastly
included in the box is two different sets of keycaps
which have different textures if you want to provide a different look over
your wires keys and there is a keycap puller if you wish
to take off the keys and clean the keyboard itself the board
underneath has one layer of tilt adjustment
and the sides feature clear which allow the leds to breathe through
which if you are wondering yes those lights too are individually backlit
lastly the base of the keyboard has a brushed aluminium finish and a mix of
hard plastics on the sides is used to reflect the rgb and so with
all that out of the way it's now conclusion time and who is the k100
rgb for well if the price tag of 230 usd
or in australia 380 aussie dollars doesn't deter you at first then this is
a premium keyboard that corsair have quite simply
nailed i wouldn't ask for anything more from a keyboard personally
the layout the materials used the wrist rest the noise and the feel of the
switches double shot ppt keycaps amazing bling coupled with the software makes
for a keyboard that has so much customization
and expandability whether you are a competitive gamer playing for some
serious cash or you're a wannabe placebo pro that
thinks that having a 5 millisecond advantage
is going to make your pro even though you suck or you're a video editor
needing to make limitless macros or remap keys
then this keyboard is definitely going to impress also if you don't like the
uber responsiveness of the keys as well then i am told that there will be
different mechanical flavors of this keyboard being introduced
which will have lower actuation points and may be better for people like me
who are prone to making more typos on the linear high actuation switch
like this one on the k100 rgb optical anyhow if you guys enjoyed today's video
