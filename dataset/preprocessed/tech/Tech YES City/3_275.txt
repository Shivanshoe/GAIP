today is an absolutely amazing day if you are a tech enthusiast and that's because amd have announced their new zen3 processors with four different products that they were showing off in the presentation but the most important thing coming out of this announcement was their 19 ipc boost in performance and that is instructions per cycle so basically if we have a 5900x and also 3900x that's the previous generation xen2 cpus clocked at both four gigahertz all cores on average the 5900x at those same clock speeds is going to give you 19 more performance which is a huge gain especially in 2020 and if we look at intel for instance they haven't really given us any ipc gains for a very long time so the fact that amd's doing this and this feat alone is really exciting for tech enthusiasts in the land of cpus however another big thing that came out of this announcement was the topology and the way that they're structuring the zen 3 cpus where they're still using seven nanometer however within this field they're changing their ccx module design and that is what they call the core complex from four cores per ccx module to now eight cores and so what this will help do with the zen 3 cpus is reduce latency as well as of course improve performance and so bringing this back now to the gaming numbers we're seeing here the amd 5900x as a result of the ipc boosts and also the different ccx module design is set to give a 7 performance boost over that of intel's i9 10 900 k even and then a 26 performance boost at 1080p gaming over the previous generation ryzen 9 3900x which if these numbers are true and of course we're going to have to wait and see until we get our hands on these and actually test these cpus but if these numbers are true and amd can even just squeeze out the gaming performance crown over intel on these 1080p titles then this is huge news because it means that amd are now going to be the performance king as well as the value king as well as the multi-core performance king as well and so this is easily looking like it's going to be a huge release for amd if they can indeed especially in the gaming performance numbers pull off this feat over intel now in the title of my video today i'm actually more excited about the 5800x ryzen 7 over the ryzen 9 5900x now i am very excited don't get me wrong about the 5950x ryzen 9 as a video editor personally but as a gamer the 5800x being on a single ccx module i believe could give even better performance than that of the 5900x where we've seen in the past for instance i'll give you guys an example with the 3300x cpu that was four cores eight threads but when i put that cpu through the gaming benchmarks that was giving sometimes better numbers than even a 3900x and a 3950x and that was because it was on a single ccx module and so it had the best latency out of any amd ryzen cpu so the 5800x being on a single ccx module but offering eight core 16 threads over the 3 300 x's 4 cores 8 threads and of course having much better ipc is something that i'm really looking forward to personally and i feel like this cpu could be the one to get if you're a gamer so back to the announcement here's where amd talked about four different models being released on november 5 so that's roughly in a month's time and the biggest differences here was that there was actually a trend across all these four cpus and that was that there are fifty dollars usd more than their previous predecessor cpus of the same core count and similar modeling for instance the ryzen 9 59 50 x has 16 cores 32 threads and so did the ryzen 9 39 50 x and another trend that's going through all these four models is that the base clock frequencies are now 100 megahertz lower but then the boost frequencies are advertised as being 200 megahertz higher and that's basically the max single core performance where the 5950x is said to have a 4.9 gigahertz single core boost which will make this the fastest ryzen cpu in terms of single core boost frequencies out of the box to date but if we look closely as well with the coolers we'll notice one more thing and that's this time around besides the flagship 3950x and this time around the 5950x not having an included cooler there is no included cooler now with the 5900x and in particular the 5800x where those cpus if we look at the 3900x and also the 3800x they came included with a wraith prism cooler and honestly i absolutely loved this raised prism cooler i thought it had the bling it also had decent cooling performance and for an included cooler it just made a ryzen cpu purchase just that much better value so i am a little bit sad to see that amd is taking away this cooler with the new 5000 series cpus where if we looked at the ryzen 7 3700x for example that came in at a price tag of 329 usd had that really good cooler and had those eight core 16 threads of unstoppable performance but then we're looking at the 5600x and there's a similar thing going on with the cooling situation here too even though the tdp is that of a ryzen 5 3600 of 65 watts so it's actually 30 watts lower than the 3600 x they're including the wraith stealth which the 3600x traditionally had the wraiths by a cooler included with it so they have upped the prices a little bit and they have stopped including as good as a cooler or no cooler at all versus the predecessor cpus that they launched last year however on that note amd as a company i do like to see them making better margins it's something they have to do for ongoing r d costs and to make sure that they can get those gains and keep delivering as a company though in relation to the zen 3 launch the last thing to talk about is the motherboards and this is where all the 500 series motherboards will support the upcoming 5000 series cpus you'll most likely just simply have to update your bios and then you'll be good to go but in terms of the older boards say the b450s or the x470s there's no word on this and whether they will support the upcoming cpus but i believe if a320 is anything to go by i remember when ryzen 3000 was announced there was this word that the a320s wouldn't work with the new cpus but lo and behold about a month later the board vendors are releasing bios updates and the new ryzen 3000 series back then were working with a320 boards and i thought it was such a good combo to have a ryzen 5 3600 for example with the included cooler and then have those boosts out of the board which worked on an a320 by the way and those memory speeds the 3200 megahertz xmp profiles that offered some incredibly good value for money if you're into the proverbial cookie cutting of pc building which i personally love to delve in myself the last thing i couldn't help but notice with this presentation especially even on the cpu side of things was that there was a real heavy focus on gaming as opposed to especially in the last few launches of verizon they've focused a lot on both and in particular the productivity numbers where this time around they did show some boosts of course in productivity which i'm looking forward to as editing in adobe premiere pro a lot and doing a lot of productivity on my computer personally but the gaming focus was definitely a big thing this time around more so than it's ever been so i do think it's possible that amd will come out on top this time around as the gaming king and i really hope they do and that will just make such a new world for amd in the cpu side of things so let's talk about the radion rx 6000 series cards where they showed us a 4k slide here with three different games and that was borderlands 3 call of duty modern warfare and gears of war 5. now out of these three titles i have done a lot of testing recently with call of duty modern warfare and especially at max settings now in this game in particular there is no quality preset so amd radeon saying ultra quality could mean a variety of different settings but at least when i did my testing i tested at max settings of 4k and i found unfortunately for these numbers that i'm seeing here on the screen that the rtx 3080 was coming a bit above these numbers right here so just being straight with you guys these numbers don't look that impressive initially however if it's one thing that we've seen from amd especially in the last few years and especially in terms of the radeon division is that they love to play mind games and debate the competitor nvidia into doing some funky stuff with pricing and right before release date performance figures where with the 5600 xt we saw this last minute change where reviewers got given these v bios updates and i got given this v bios update and it changed i had to go back and retest all my numbers again so hopefully we don't see a repeat of that hopefully we just see an awesome launch that does bring if it's not going to take nvidia's performance crown hopefully it does bring a lot of price performance competition to the market and that's one thing i'm hoping for personally but one thing that's been left out on nvidia and amd's side in relation to all the products is that there's no real focus on entry level products this time around and you may be wondering that why are we not seeing the x cpus being talked about why are we not seeing the four core ryzen 3 5300 or something like that not being talked about and this comes back to the fact that i think in 2020 there is actually a shortage on silicon out there in the market especially the stuff that everyone wants like seven nanometer and in case of nvidia they're on eight nanometer from samsung and so these companies are going to prioritize their higher stacked products where they're making more margins on those products per se so i believe that this time around you may actually see the delay of these entry level or value for money orientated products be delayed more than they have been in the past compared to the higher performing and also flagship products that have been released initially and you'll see this with say an rtx 3050 that probably won't be released for quite a while yet and i'm just hoping that as a budget and price performance enthusiast myself i'm hoping that either of these companies can release something on this market here because i think it's just as much in need as the higher end stuff is in need as well for people who want the latest and greatest and with all that out of the way do let us know in the comments section below which of these ryzen 5000 zen 3 cpus are you looking forward to the most and why and with that aside we've got the question of the day here which comes from ar drixby and they ask is a ryzen 5 good yes it's good i hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far then be
