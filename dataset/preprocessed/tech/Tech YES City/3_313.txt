this right here is one untested
banged up 50 aussie dollar pc that we picked up now
this is the process of i guess today we're going to go through the process of
making a banger into something that can play
games so first of all we've got the power
supply here i mean the whole thing looks like it's been sitting in a
garage for probably a year or even more so what we're going to do is go through
piece by piece before we even try to boot it up because
i'm guessing if someone sold it for 50 bucks something doesn't work
so what i'm going to do is go through each part starting with the power supply
which we pulled out now and then we will go through the graphics
card and then we'll go through the single stick of ram the motherboard and
the cpu but i got a good feeling i mean i3 cpus
especially fourth gen and upwards it's almost impossible
to blow these things up if they're not overclockable and
you're probably thinking how do i know this well i've actually tried before
but uh on to that let's start piecing this thing out and seeing
what the problem is if you want to cop yourself a legit
windows 10 pro oem license then today's video sponsor
scd keys has you covered for as little as 15 bucks
using the coupon code tyc you can get yourself
one of these keys instantly delivered and they've even got paypal
links in description below [Music] and our power supply it ended up being
faulty it wouldn't even give out a signal
at all which is already not looking like it's good news for this build so
we do have a power supply replacement here this is a
real budget power supply that you usually find within budget cases
they it says 685 watts this thing is not even
200 watts uh looking at the 12 volt rail there however this is what the i3
and also the gtx 750 in waze was designed for it's designed
for low powered builds you could just shove a
gtx 750 into practically any pc and you would then have decent gaming
performance though the single stick of eight
gigabytes of ram like i mean an i3 two cores four threads
is already pushing it in 2020 for low frame rates so i'm going to at
least change over this eight gigabyte stick to two four gigabyte sticks but
what we're also going to do now is take this motherboard out
and the graphics card and just start checking everything to see
what actually works inside this build as well as give it a bit of a clean
since it is looking a bit filthy [Music]
[Applause] so we've now booted this pc up and
everything is looking good so far the gtx 750 is giving out a
signal the eight gigabytes of rams being
recognized and also the i3 4160 is working too as well
as the motherboard so there's four pieces
that it's working now i did get asked in a previous video
it was in the flip up challenge video where we're going from 100
to a high end gaming pc i got asked why don't i test the parts individually
before putting the whole pc together and so simply the reason for this is if
you're building up a few pcs every day or
even if you're just building up one pc a day if you're saving a lot of time
that leaves a lot of time open for especially if there's a crucial time in
the market where everything's just selling
you want to be flipping more pcs so putting it together
as fast as possible and testing out to make sure everything works fine
you've got to find the efficiency curve there or the best balance
and so that's why if everything works from the get go
i'll work backwards pretty much all the time except you saw in the intro today
where we started with the power supply first
that's because the whole build just wasn't booting up at all so it's
generally either the motherboard or the power supply and since the whole build
was filthy i just tested the power supply was gone
then after that i'm testing all the four parts at once
and that's just to save time if everything's working here then i don't
have to go through every part individually
and i've saved myself a lot of time especially if we get to windows
and then we just run heaven overnight before we sell the pc it's stress tested
it's working absolutely fine low settings is going to stress the cpu
a bit as well as the gpu ram is going to be getting thrown in
there as well dynamic load so it's good for everything essentially
if we do that test that's what i've been finding lately
is just the low settings haven't benchmark high settings it actually
finds out a lot of faults very quickly you can also run call of
duty warzone if you want to just find a spot in the campaign
but that of course that game takes such a long time to install especially if you
don't have a copy ready and it is a big game to download
anyhow from here on in we are going to put the build back together
i'm actually going to change over to two four gigabyte sticks right now
just test everything boots up fine then we're going to put the build back
together and start testing it out to see how well
this little i3 4160 and gtx 750 holds up
[Music] so [Music]
and the i3 system is now complete for a grand
total of 65 aussie dollars now we installed windows 10 home
because i saw a windows 7 home sticker on the build to begin with
so i kind of put two and two together and figured hey they probably upgraded
their windows 7 home to windows 10 home and that's
exactly what happened so windows 10 home was already activated
on this motherboard which saves us bouncing a key
and wasting a key of windows 10 pro on this particular build but
another thing is too you're probably wondering it's late at night
and this was all happening during the day and i was
on our discord for a lot of today just talking to all the folks there
they're all we've got a really cool community going on but originally
there's a big announcement actually and that is
um science studios greg salazar he just messaged me and decided he just didn't
want to be part of the discord anymore it was no like
there was no bad reasons or anything like that he just didn't have
the time to be part of the discord anymore so he left and
um now we've kind of just we used to be science yeah city
but now we've just reloaded it to tech yes city and so
if you guys um if there's anything that's happened and you've
been sort of like we had to re sort of fresh the whole discord
so if you got kicked or anything like that then i'm going to put
a discord invite link in the description and also in the pinned comment for you
guys to see so if you want to rejoin if you got accidentally booted or
anything like that just rejoin and uh yeah it's going to be called
pretty much it's going to be the focus of a lot of people basically
over time maybe greg left because the whole discord just became talking
about deals used deals meadows and everything around use versus
new price performance and stuff like that so
might have just not been greg's kettle of fish i don't know but anyway
it is what it is so uh greg and i of course there's no
hard feelings or anything like that we're still gonna do live streams we're
still really good friends um there's nothing like that at all so
don't even don't even go there if you're thinking that because
greg and i are absolutely we're pretty cool don't worry anyhow onto this pc
everything worked out fine with the whole build itself
the build is running smoothly everything's working fine
though we are on a 1080p monitor at the moment and of course we're downloading
call of duty which just so happens to have yet another
update which is 50 gigabytes which is bigger than a whole lot of
games out there for their initial size but
you know good old call of duty with its massive massive massive massive game
size we're going to download this after we do
that we're going to switch over to this budget little combo right here
where we've got just a banger keyboard mouse and monitor which
i got all these three components for free because a little 17 inch monitor
not bad and just a free keyboard and mouse that i've cleaned up gave some
tech yes loving and the gtx 750 that is a one gigabyte edition i
believe so it's not really geared up towards
1080p gaming and so i figured with the i3 and the gtx
750 i just want to see if it can play call of duty war zone on
a little monitor like this at a lower resolution
and also if and how well it runs valorant
on this little monitor too because i want to put together a little budget
setup and then see what we can come up with but of course
we just gotta wait for this game to finish now [Music]
so starting off with this gaming pc experience the monitor
it's extremely weird a 5 by 4 aspect ratio
so most monitors will have a 16 by 9 aspect ratio nowadays
this one it's pretty much as close to a square as you can get
and if there's any monitors that are lcd and are a one-to-one ratio
i would love to know what they are but in the meantime this
monitor's resolution is so weird that it's actually not natively supported
in valor and nor is it supported in call of duty war zone so
i actually had to drop the resolution down slightly to the
960p from 102 4p and that did the job so that being said
it does work you just got to change it to
another slightly lower resolution and that being said it is a 75 hertz panel
so it was running really smoothly now we're playing a team deathmatch here i
really am enjoying this it's just like constant
action and i guess if you're playing a twitch
studio your wise will just be twitching all the time so
one good thing you'll notice with the fps is that it's actually pretty smooth
like this is giving out a decent experience
the 0.1 lows there was some noticeable stuttering from time to time
and uh most the time however it didn't happen a whole lot
but in some clutch situations it can happen so
i guess that's the downside to using an i3 in 2020
even on an easy to play game like valeran but for what it's worth
you can still get good on this setup that's one thing you'll notice is that
you can still get frags you can still play pretty smooth on this
game with the i3 now another thing is two right in the
top left hand corner we're going with the smaller monitor because the vram
requirement wouldn't be anywhere near what it would be
on a 1080p 16x9 monitor so i guess that's the benefit of using a smaller
monitor is it's not going to stretch your graphics
card as opposed to bigger and better monitors
than this one now moving over to call of duty war zone this was a different story
for starters the aspect ratio was weird this is the best i could get it where
it looks closer to a 3x4 in this mode where you had to change it to window
mode because i think the maximum supported
16x10 or something in this game so we got away with uh sort of this weird
resolution in windowed mode did the trick but the fps you'll notice
here it's only going to 39 average and then the 1 lows are actually pretty
decent compared to the average fps it's just
the 0.1 lows are dipping really low and that's uh one thing you'll notice
about i3s in a lot of the titles you run these i3s
through where even if you're putting 16
gigabytes of ram on them they're going to have a stuttering and they're gonna
you're gonna notice that with the 0.1 law of seven
and in valorant under 10 as well you will notice that if you are
gaming competitively if you're not gaming competitively though i mean look
40 fps average it'll do the job i mean you'll
be able to still get some frags it just won't
be um anywhere near as good as even a 60 fps experience or in this case
since it's a 75 hertz monitor a 75 fps experience but that being said
the gtx 750 it just doesn't really have the grunt to
push out frames in this game the one thing you'll notice
is the vram is going up to pretty much two gigabytes and it's pegged
at two gigabytes even at this lower resolution
the gpu is pegged at 99 the cpu is pretty much pegged near 100 to a lot
of the time so basically all these components in this
build are just getting maxed out in call of duty warzone
which is good for the i guess this resolution and this is even on the
lowest settings here so we can't drop anything else to get the
fps higher pretty much unless we lower the render resolution
but even then since the cpu is getting pretty much
pegged at higher percentages it's not going to up by fps much we might be able
to pull an extra 5 if we're lucky 10 fps out of this rig
so that's pretty much the limit for this poor little i3
the last two things to talk about with this rig is the temperatures i'm really
happy with the cpu and the gpu you can see here
they're pretty much under 60 degrees at all times
then we've got the power consumption which from the wall is going about 120
watts in warzone so that's a really good thing
in this case because this power supply is just a banger it's going to probably
have around maybe a 70 efficiency if we're lucky so this whole
build is literally using probably around 90 watts
direct draw so under 100 watts it's absolutely fine there's really nothing
to worry about let's get over now to a conclusion and
with all that gaming out of the way we are now here at the
conclusion with the i3 in particular this one we've got
here the 4160 we got it for a really good price a
local deal we took the gamble there could have been
more parts that were faulty with it but at 50 aussie dollars for me it was a
no-brainer we even got lucky with the gpu that it was a two
gigabyte gtx 750 not a one gigabyte because i think the
two gigabyte could barely just play warzone even on
this weird five to four aspect ratio but the one gigabyte i would say
warzone would just be out of the question now
valorant that ran really well even despite the
0.1 percent lows being a little bit worrisome and i think this in particular
point one percent lows is the main problem i have with two
cores in 2020. even easy to play games like
valorant don't run like they run well and you can
be pretty good on this cpu and valerian but
sometimes there's going to be that little stutter and that could cost you
the game which could make you a lot more frustrated and in that
respect i would much rather you even go for something like a first gen
xeon x3450 which is a lot better in my
opinion and it's going to give you a smooth experience
the i3s i mean look in this case this setup is going to be
a budget valorant cs go even fortnite gaming pc but it's still got a little
bit to be desired i'd much rather an i5 in there and that in turn helps with the
whole gaming experience another thing is too if you want to go
out and buy it now which a lot of people do complain about in some of my videos
they're like look dude this is a local deal
it's not replicable and what i say with deal hunting is you've got to be patient
you always have to be patient for the good deals
and you've got to be on point you've got to know when to quickly snap up a deal
if you know it's a good price so at 50 aussie dollars the deal was
solid but if you go on ebay and you check out the i3 systems even in
the us dollar terms they're at the very least
going to set you back 75 and then you're still going to put a
graphics card in there so you're going to be going over 100 usd for an i3
i'd much rather you try and find the i5 variant where
that tends to be just priced a little bit more in these system packages
but it'll give you a better experience overall but anyway the negatives out of
the way this pc right here today it could still
game the i3 it can still give us a playable experience i could still get
some frags in valorante and one thing about
valorante was i haven't played it that much but i
enjoyed the team death match a lot more than the standard multiplayer
so hopefully they can work on the team death match a bit more
and maybe do like kill streaks and stuff like that because i used to play black
ops 2 and i used to really like team deathmatch in that
so hopefully they can add that to valerant that'd be pretty cool
and then i'd probably play it a bit more but other than that
i guess the i3 is the gateway pc like i'd call this still capable of
being a gateway pc and that i've heard some people out there they
play on these old laptops and they're getting like 15 fps
unplayable experiences and with that fps you would honestly not even know if
you're good at the game or not this pc here even on warzone getting
like 40 fps you'd still be able to figure out i
guess if you were good at pc gaming and if it was for you and whether you
want to spend more money on the actual hobby itself as opposed to
the really bad laptop which is probably going to turn you off pc gaming to begin
with so something like this will do the job and
i guess it's a great little entry pc if you can pick it up
cheap enough another thing is too i would definitely recommend
getting a mouse pad that was the biggest thing that paved me off
this video and that was i just had no mouse pad so i had to put a mouse pad
down to play because i was really losing it
um having no audio as well you definitely want to have some audio
if you're playing games even a cheap pair of headphones but that being said
i'd rather you get a if you're going to go with a cheap
pair of headphones i always say this lately anyway go get the kph-30is
even though they might be a little bit more expensive than some budget
headphones out there they're going to be a keeper for sure
even if you come into a higher end pc you'll probably find yourself
keeping these headphones and with that aside if you guys
enjoyed today's video then you know what to do hit that like button also let us
know in the comment section below what you think of today's build today's
pc love reading your thoughts and opinions as always
just like this question of the day here which comes from
peter janer and they asked what x58 motherboard do you recommend that has
triple channel support and for x58 motherboards i've been
saying this in the past my go-to for a good experience on x58
has always been a zeus motherboards i find like back in that era they got
everything right in terms of platform stability
in terms of overclocking and holding overclocks and in terms of also
longevity of the boards so they're like a shining star on x58
azus boards even on x79 they did some of the best work there too
then after that the other board guys started to catch up
a lot and so x58 definitely go with an azus board if you
can that's just my personal experience going through a heap of different x58
boards here at my studio and also when i was back in japan back in the day
hope that answers that question and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying
that tech guest content then don't forget to grab that mouse
and with no mouse pad too make sure you just take the mouse pad up
and do it on a rough surface go down click that subscribe button
ring that bell and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon
there's a message it's like uh someone's probably like yo
brian i need i'm hungry for that i3 pc i know you haven't even put it off for
sale yet but i need it in my life so i'm gonna go flip it now i'll catch
you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
