x58 and the accompanying i7 cpus
were released all the way back in 2008 and then two years after that there was
a architecture known as westmire which was released in the form of the i7
980x and also on the xeon side the x5650
and also one of my personal favorites the x5675
now these days these six core 12 threaded overclockable xeons
can be had extremely cheap on aliexpress starting at around 10 bucks you can get
the x5650 and then if you're feeling a little bit more enthusiastic and
passionate about x58 you can get the x 5675
which is a better bin at least from the testing i've done here
and that you'll get better overclocks for the same voltage
versus the x5650 however today i'm going to be using my rampage 3
extreme now this board is pretty special to me because
i got given it to me for free in a deals hunt because the person
who gave it away thought that it was broken because the water cooling kit on
it had cracked and it had water that had leaked on the motherboard and
then since then i gave this board a bit of
tyl that is a tech yes loving for those of you who are new here
and i put two aftermarket heatsinks on there in a janky kind of way
and this board it checks out it takes my x5675
all the way to 4.5 GHz and ultimately that is what
used price performance is all about it's about getting those parts cheap
and then making something out of it they can play games
just as good as the new stuff can except you're saving over half your money
however here is the kicker today we're going to be pairing
this x58 motherboard this cpu with the overclocks and some ddr3 2133
megahertz in triple channel versus the 1680 v2 in quad channel
versus the i9 10 900 k in dual channel with ddr4 corsair dominator
and the ryzen 9 3950x with a rtx 3090 this is the big
grand behemoth of gpu gaming graphics cards right now
which if there's differences between these cpus it is
definitely going to come out with this configuration
so let's get into a good old-fashioned cpu comparison
and see where our little zeons lie in 2020
and that's like liars in like placement not
liars in telling a lie but nowadays i kind of have to clarify my english
because people get confused but you won't get confused about this quick
sponsor spot right here are you sick and tired of that windows
needs activation message in the bottom right hand corner of your
screen and you want to unlock some extra features in windows 10.
well if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14
and a half dollars you can instantly get that key and you can check out with
paypal make sure you use the coupon code tyc
for an 18 discount let's get back to the video
now before we get into those gaming benchmarks
there's something that i like to do personally and that is to disable
spectrum meltdown updates i found that although there could be
some risk your computer could be more at a risk of being hacked
i've personally found that there hasn't been one documented case
of someone an individual being hacked at their own home
and furthermore the performance hit of spectrum meltdown takes around
10 percent performance away from xeons like the x5675
and also the 1680 v2 now i've included the 1680 v2 which is a third generation
ivy bridge xeon for those of you who can't wait for an
upcoming video we're going to be specifically talking
about this xeon but with that aside let's roll through the 1080p
benchmarks first where in shadow of the tomb raider
our poor little friend here the x5675 he did take a bit of a beating
moving on to do maternal showed a similar trend but then moving over to
modern warfare showed that the actual lack of avx instruction sets or more to
the point avx-2 showed that even the 1680v2
was experiencing a little bit of a bottleneck here versus the ryzen 9 and
also the i9 moving over to mechwarrior 5 showed that
our x5675 was falling behind a little bit
too here then when it came to fortnite it was still putting up a respectable
battle royale if that was what we would call it against the other cpus
tom clancy's the division two it was a pretty impressive result
and same with the outer worlds it was doing its
job and then moving over to 1440p it's actually more a similar trend
to 1080p where although the gap does minimize a bit
it is still there and it is still significant in a lot of these titles
and then lastly when it comes to 4k this is where
things get pretty interesting because in some of the titles you'll notice
that there's no difference between this 10 year old xeon
and the latest and greatest 10900k and ryzen 9 3950x though
this is where the question of what is the x5675
good for in 2020 comes about because this cpu if you want to go get
it which a lot of the times the x58 boards you
can pick them up very cheap on the used market i'm finding
that they're starting to become less popular as the years go on and
rightfully so as time goes on things get more obsolete
and of course the parts get more at risk of failing which
those two things combined makes them a lot less desirable
however even on places like ebay you can pick up an x58 board nowadays
for quite cheap and coupled with a 10 cpu
you can get some really respectable performance if you also couple it with
say a snowman 20 cpu cooler you can be
tasting 4.3 even 4.4 gigahertz on daily overclocks and getting some
really good price performance for your dollar though
the best part with x58 as we said before is when we get them on these deals hunts
where people think that the parts are so old then they must be worth absolutely
nothing altogether and of course that x58 motherboard being
the key element to getting the most out of this older
platform whereas to me personally when i found that i've overclocked on these
older platforms i've had a lot more success overclocking
on the zeus motherboards versus all the other
brands back in this era if you do want to check
out how you can overclock one of these cpus then i'll put a
tutorial right up here though one more thing to be aware of is
that there are these boards out there that are being manufactured new on the
x58 line even in 2020 however these boards
pretty much don't have any support for overclocking so that's one thing to be
mindful of if you want to get the most performance out of these older cpus
then you'll definitely want to get a good motherboard but generally with x58
you'll want to stick to a zeus motherboard but if you can't find that
evga and gigabyte do make some solid boards however with the
gigabyte models i've found that sometimes they just have
rare issues where the bios just doesn't work properly no matter what you do
and you're just scratching your head as to why overclocks don't work
if you're in that situation don't worry it's not just you
that gigabyte motherboard has probably just seen too much use
and it's acting a little bit finicky though in terms of msi motherboards
you generally would have to go for the higher end boards because i've tried a
few of their entry level x58 boards and let's just say it hasn't ended well
they have either even failed on default clocks
or they just have really weird issues then
the azeroth boards you're probably thinking what about the asrock boards
i've actually had one of these boards come through and
although they are decent i just find that they're so rare
on the used market that they're not even really worth
mentioning back in this era because there wasn't that many of these
boards manufactured to begin with then of course there are some other
brands out there most notably the intel x58 boards
but they dropped support even stopping the bios downloads completely
for their x58 motherboards so i would try and avoid them
if you can anyhow with that out of the way we've seen the fps differences
between our beloved x58 and the latest and greatest stuff
and somewhere in between and that leads me at the question of
well what graphics card should you be pairing
with an x 5675 xeon and well i cross referenced this with my rtx 3090 review
and we've got some pretty solid i guess consistencies
running through these numbers at least at 1080p
for instance if we look at tom clancy's division 2
we can see that it lines up roughly around a 2080 super
then if we look at the outer worlds we're sort of looking at around again a
2080 super then moving on with fortnite we're at
those levels of around a 2070 super then modern warfare 2080 super and then
mechwarrior 5 20 70 super and then do maternal 2080 super and then
lastly shadow of the tomb raider vega 64. so that pretty much averages
out in my opinion with the best card if you're going to
overclock an x5675 for example the 4.5 gigahertz and give it some decent memory
the best graphics card to match with that would be the rtx 2070 super
or a 1080 ti or of course you can get any card
under that in terms of graphical performance and you should be
having happy days where you're not missing out on anything because
in my opinion when it comes to gaming on pcs
that's the definitely the one thing you want to do is get the most out of your
gpu and make sure your cpu is in a bottleneck so if you go out and buy a
2080 ti for example and you're going to play at 1080p then
this cpu will be letting you miss out on a few fps more than you otherwise
should be able to obtain if you had a better cpu though on the
flip side of things the cpu and the motherboard combo
can be had for a ridiculously good price just keep in mind that there are a
couple of downsides to using this architecture the first
that we mentioned before is that there's not even avx instruction
sets nor the avx-2 instruction sets avx was introduced in sandy bridge error
that's second generation and then the avx-2 was introduced in
fourth generation that is haswell and upwards then for the
motherboards they generally don't carry usb
3. there are some models that do carry usb 3 but they're a bit rarer
than the ones that carry usb 2 which is pretty much all
the x58 motherboards then for the sata 3 ports
they're actually not true sata 3 so think of it more of
hey you're still going to be ending up with sata 2 though for most part
that's not going to make a difference when it comes to playing pc games
and then of course you're still stuck on pca gen 2
x 16 but i've done a recent test in this and even an rtx 3090
can't completely saturate the pca gen2 bandwidth believe it or not i'll
put the link to that video up here if you wish to look into it more so all
these negatives won't stop you however from playing
games unless it's horizon zero dawn which unfortunately
wouldn't load due to it having no support for that avx
instruction set so this is the one outlier where the
games come out and the developers are just not even
going to bother patching in support for the older cpus
and so unfortunately we couldn't run the benchmarks
for the x 5675 with horizon zero dawn but that aside
that one game aside and i think there's only one other game out there
that does this as well they are certainly not going to stop you in 2020
from getting one of these motherboards and a 10 cpu
and having at least a 144hz gaming experience
they can get up and boogie still in 2020 and they can give you an enjoyable
smooth gaming experience even if you couple it with the likes of
an rtx 2070 super or 2080 super you can have ultra settings 144 hertz
gaming and still have no issues and that's all
for today folks do let us know in the comments section
below what you think of x58 and also those budget xeons in
2020 do you share my same sentiments or do you think
differently love reading your thoughts and opinions as always
and also don't forget to toss us a like on the way out because we got the
question of the day here which comes from carter demon and they
asked would it be good for video editing in davinci 2. and
they're referring to another xeon which we might be testing in the future as
well when after i do a build with it and that is the e5 2678 v3
this is a haswell 12 core xeon 24 threads that although
locked does give a lot of good value for money too
and doesn't really carry those limitations that the x58 carries
even in 2020 but to answer the question yes it will be very good for da vinci
especially in terms of value for money because you can couple it with ddr3 ecc
registered memory which is very inexpensive and you'll
have yourself a 64 gigabyte 12 core 24 thread
video editing workstation beast on a budget and with all that aside i'll
catch you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye [Music]
