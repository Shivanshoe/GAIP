welcome to tech yes City and what we've got here on the desk is a build that's going to be done in 360 degrees so if you're on a small fund where you computer you probably notice that you may be able to move around and see everything in the studio so if you want to zoom into this gtx760 right here you can move down to it zoom in now if you want to zoom into this beautiful important 71 pound supply with an RGB LED event you can do that as well but that aside what we go right here is a bill that's totaling 234 while zeros are 150 USD so it's just basically a budget build that I've managed to sort of get some pasta together pull and accommodate and meet at the moment and that's basically to get budget pcs out there on the market because people are so hungry Pro right now so without further ado let's start building this thing and we've got right here the Nimitz end live it's like a case that essentially is a it's 45 buzzy doubles so what you're going to get in this case is something that the scoldings boys pounds apply it to a little bit of room enough to support a micro ATX motherboard and that's what you really need when you're on a budget now I have added an exhaust fan into this thing and also with this motherboard here I've got to connect up and I'm also using a little sense of curve as well so there's gonna be a few things that I'm going to show you guys unedited into today's video that I usually don't show on the channel because I'm usually bagging music in the background while I'm building AC so we're gonna go through everything with this instant 360 camera and then at the end of the video we'll talk about what I like and what I don't like about filming on this right here that means the 360 because there are a few good points about this hold so that a lot of negatives as well especially if you're looking in the market to buy one of these we're gonna go through all those positives and negatives without further ado let's get this build on the way today's video is sponsored by UCD keys for as little as 13 dollars and forty four cents after using the coupon code TYC 20 you can get yourself a single and Windows 10 Pro licensed or if you want to get a 2019 office Pro license then you can get that for as little as forty dollars using that same coupon code and that can be tied to your Microsoft email account meaning you can use it on different systems wherever you go links in description below to find out more now I am going to be using my standard screwdriver that suppose the electric screwdriver we probably give the up 10 five movies a rip session which let's see how quickly we can build this thing essentially we go gold bang way we good and I'll try to give you guys the best angles while I'm building this thing but yeah shouldn't take too long hopefully we get a timer up on the screen yet and see I want to take since we build this PC right here see this is where this is where my uh my electrics miss it already I'm doing a favor for your Ian's in the process now another thing about building these budget pcs is you notice off the back here there's a little hole here for the CPU at full pin or a pin and you'll see soon after I install this hard drive and stuff like that what you'll see is that this rack here you have to put this in before you put your motherboard and the reason you do that is because otherwise you won't be able to get it in later so it's a bit of a design flaw on these cheap banging cases but just gotta get this one in and then I'll show you the rest basically this is the way you'd mount like this case is a real real cookie cutter so in order to finish up a build on them you've got a sacrifices need to be made just brings the cost out of the case and essentially as you'll see right here there's the hard drive right there you got to mount it coming through the back there so don't put them all screws mounting it towards the bottom of the tray so again I guess you could call it cookie cutter or you could probably call it a smart design which I'd probably go for the smart design and there's always going to be a mistake when you're building a PC and that is I put my drive back into front so actually we can take it out there okay and also when you're building pcs do take your time even though we're doing a bit of a speed build today especially if it's a first build just take your time that way that way has to be facing back mistakes were made now you can in these cases you can mount to you came out to hard drives in this case is thought it's not if you mount a second one like righty-o you will have some like problems getting your cables in if you want to grab them through it this way usually one hard drive is standing in my budget anyway if you wanted to put more than one hard drive in it just to just get a better case these faces do have their drawbacks see here it's pretty finicky as well.i things aren't gonna go super flush we shall endeavor so now what we've got here 34 70s to 80 gigabytes of RAM Lenovo motherboard and we've also got this case right here gtx 760 and 500 megabyte hard drive so it's going to essentially be just to change real sort of budget bang on does it still be able to play like apex legends called war zone Mike yeah Mike not highest apply settings it will still be out of play that's what you want now I don't think to these IO shields you see them right here there's a little trick if you bang them out of the Lenovo cases this is a little trick you're going to do here and that is you going to grab your pliers and bend these little pins down right here and once you do that you'll be able to fit it in but it still won't fit in like a bowl so I fit in like a normal eye or shield you've got to still then sort of like time everything and that just let me get the CPU getting out at first and we get that in so it's kind of tricky in this case you can go to the fight of CPU a pin and then you've also got two of them note and I can't really do this standing up the Irish goes in there and once we're balancing it I've got a bed push it in with the modern ordinance grow up the multiples all in rapid succession otherwise this there began never scruff motherboard done easy and the good thing is I did pre check these pots before I did this build it is it's one thing I've been doing a lot lately because if you come into problems after you've done you boot it can be really just annoying so even if you're booting in UPC I'd recommend just checking your pots put it on a box quickly put it on mother mold box including on the mold box and then just yeah switch everything on make sure you get a signal out of it and then you get to go otherwise you've got to say focus ticket Fran say the graphics card might have a problem might be faulty GPU also by that you can at least get around that and save yourself having to pull things out off you've done you build just do that done here on the main I was gonna say the main gel s-capepod again my language skills most fulsome dumb build down motherboard got that in now there is another trick to these lenovo's so weak CV ghosting on the board in its all screwed off and we're gonna plug up this exhaust fan now if you don't have an exhaust fan in on Lenovo it'll come up with an error message which you can switch off in the BIOS if you want to but I've tested this in the past and you always want to have an exhaust fan even if you've got like a low potato you do one Dingles and just makes a world of difference now nothing is too with this right here you see this connector I mean you've got to pull this out of the Lenovo cases these are the temp sensitive you don't have one of these there's either two things will happen and that is your Lenovo will either overheat because the CPU fan just staying idle all the time just reload the loss rpm steak or what will happen is it will either just spin a full bottle and so it'd be max speed so you either got two scenarios that will happen and so you don't want either because want to annoy it and use it really badly and the other one let's see the other problems with corruption of nagato this ephemeral trimming anyhow we got this right here this is the 14 pin 2 2014 adapter and then plug that in I'll actually just route it through autumn quickly saves me a little bit of cable management time to wrap that in thank to easy now it's also got to do cable management at the back soon that's what I want to show you guys is the front panel IO has to go in a little bit different and is also one more little thing you may need so it's reading that through here here's your front panel i/o connectors which you're probably used to you if you've been building normal pcs this is a little different on oh those basically you'll there's like your pin layout your hard drive will go to the right in a vertical level so there's your hybrid that mine that's my house that's my balance which looks similar to this so there's a hard drive there put that in Rodham the you're looking at it face down left hand side vertically and the positive has to go on all my belief now this is the bench on the bottom rank you got to leave one free slot off to that and then you can put the positive and the negative negative effects and then besides that you put your power switch and then above that on the right hand side on the top is you've reset and so it's a weird combination I'll see if you guys will see that soon of that 360 degrees and another thing is - you'll notice this is a headphone connector right here and you can put this on you and then you can route it through the back and that is now essentially front panel audio for your Lenovo and even a bird it's getting it down the back you can see once this build done yeah and that's right awesome look at that cable management is we're close to getting the cable management done now just that's actually a magpie out of the bag so you should with Lenovo boards - you want to use this one right here this is a flat head and we can usually plug it in on this slot well especially be using a long rap stuff you're not using a long gravis color and you don't have to worry too much but we grabbed that right there and you wrap it around I have a saw just one short Jesus both of them see it flat like 90 degree angle head like that in my kit in the first orange slot that's your deck a bring it down and yeah now you know put our craps cotton and you probably see here I've added a molex extendo and also this house white includes an 8 in already so we now add our gtx 760 and its pretty long card so this case is kind of like already you can see this case is kind of struggling but everything works out [Music] dum-dum-dum if you look around like you go down you probably see the nine fibrotic right at the door they're trying to get some trying to get some scraps you can tell you that besides one more molex connected up and up on front 20 will show you guys some amazing cable management right there bollocks - this is just your front panel light RGB it's not really like it is the basic idea it's not really big standard RGB so you can get 360 degrees see me grabbing some zip ties and we put our 24 pin pretty easy I mean when you see a lot of these like videos I do it does take a little while extra to build the piece especially since especially since we don't generally like when you're not having to record it does I guess I can move a lot faster but the record I got to be careful of all the angles and stuff like that doesn't make sure you guys able to see what I'm doing and if not then I'm going to take time and all that to do it usually you can get it built on I'd say like much you didn't after you gonna scrunch all this up to get off this is just as I call it QD cable management quick and dirty and it usually does the jump there it is to cable management not even and yeah time to put outside panel back on and boot er up I usually always do that now just put a face down that way you can get it ready for the boot now another thing about OEM systems - one thing I will let you guys in on here is that sometimes when you plug the pouch straight in you won't even turn the switch on it'll just automatically power on that's because a lot of our ends had a system a setting in the basketball power on/off the system power loss so basically we will see in the we'll see now about keyboard now so here but actually first what I was gonna do firstly it's like usually because we do b-roll after we finish the build I figured I can just give you guys some yeah you know that's what we'll do I'll give you guys some quick payroll this'll be the bigger often ending grab your PC and you guys can can fall around also around and this is BC right then just ran us to see great baby wrong see ya know not automatically and that's what I was telling you about is power loss stuff so this Lenovo just loves to food itself up now I think you should be able to still now see me to like because I'm using the PC from this angle will make sure you can see what's on the monitor etcetera etcetera but this monitor was just some rated is probably just switched to a dpi so anyway we are now into gaming PC and we that we've got a ready to go ready to go for you guys a heaven benchmark low settings 720p now depending on your CPU and GPU if you got a really good GPU you can do 1080p low settings because what you want to do with the low settings you want to be stressing out CPU and the GPU at the same time it's just really like it's well as realistic gaming scenarios so I can leave this gone for a couple of hours come back if it's still running and the temperatures are decent on the GPU it means that we've got a successful building it's been you warranty you flip it and you're good to go and that's really just the this is the whole unedited gist of what goes on around here with one of these builds now this is I'm just trying to think there was something else with these bills and that is you with all the M's you a lot of the time get Windows 10 debated on them already so that's a big bonus so you might have to go out and buy a kit usually it comes in either Windows 7 Windows 8 CoA and then you use that key and then upgrade your motherboard if it says Windows not activate it's upgraded in activate Windows own so that's actually one of the benefits of using these OEM systems of course the Lenovo's I would say it generally the best pick because of the compatibility is pretty good from second like first second third fourth gen I found I haven't had really many problems at all besides faulty motherboard here and there widget motherboard but everything else on these checks out like the HP's these error messages that I'm still trying to work on ways to get around them because of the USB 3 connect professional fault gen does the USB 3 connector and it just all these error messages that I can't get around I noticed people in the comments like it trust and biases but they work I haven't been linked to wrecked trust and bothers to the ones up trying to do that being said yeah HP is definitely one of the most difficult but because there's a lot of HP's in circulation you can get some really good deals on them Lenovo is probably the top same with the ACE of baritones they're pretty good as well especially the fourth gen so a thermal ANOVA old-school OEM the German the best to work with you can get a deal plus then you got the pre-built systems the all duplexes and also the HPG blood stations they're pretty good and you only have to do a genuine static rapscallion and you're good to go so that all we have life and go to PC that's run really well I mean look at the FPS at ap we can expect apex to run many medium settings more zone run low settings won't stop it down to 720p are you gonna get more FPS and that's about it 360 degree build so what we're gonna do now is quickly talk about because I was using this camera yesterday right this instant 360 and there's a few perks there's a few negatives and just as we're talking about this camera it overheated so let's just dive straight into the negatives with this thing and essentially there are a lot and what it comes down to is basically integrating this into your workflow especially if you're doing like if you're doing YouTube content or you're making kind of whatever it is amateur pictures or you want to make fancy adverts and whatnot it's gonna be very difficult to add the whole 360-degree function into your videos with regular footage it may be used to so what i film with is a sony a7s - that's my like low-light camera i do everything on this in terms of b-roll and getting shots that it that other cameras couldn't get and the audio on this - this is another important point the audio on this you record whether it's on the internal mic if you've got no mic on the go or you plug a lav mic in the audios gonna be really good same with this right here this is my vlog cam is what I do all the parts on this for you guys with it's got the built-in zoom it's again the audios phenomenal it's what I record most my voice work here on the channel is covered with the LAV mic and then it's also 2,000 FPS so I'm able to do monitor reviews with that and it links in perfectly with like editing the footage in Premiere Pro is really easy it's smooth there's no complications and then this is the last one here that's found my way into the tech gasp work clone that's the DJI Osmo pocket and I use this on the pods ons when I'm out and about and I need to quickly get footage that I otherwise couldn't get these cameras are either too big or there's a lot of movement cheering so this has got a gimbal built-in and if I need to I can use the audio on this reliably because it's actually pretty good if I don't have a lav mic on me so that's the three things that I've got going on in terms of my main sort of filming and getting you guys content the instant 360 just doesn't integrate into that current workflow at all maybe because it's got a different file format and that's like editing that in 360 is just it's you've got a recording 5.7 K the bit rates are way too high to then utilize the part that you want to use and then integrate that into the premiere pro workflow not to mention that there's software that they've included it's terrible like editing in this is just there's really nothing going forward so you don't want to be editing with this software because do much with it except editing some glamour videos and that's what it comes down to with the insta 360 I think it's more of a glamour cameron that you can get these pretty cool shots and you can do a lot with it but really getting integrating it into a regular workflow just I don't see it happening and that's because the audio as well now I've tested this on another one called the 1x and now the one are the audio is terrible you have to essentially do heavy noise reduction in post otherwise the noise is going to sound like this I'll just let you guys have a listen and that's the audio so you can do background noise removal but it's gonna be terrible because the they're put in a cheap ADC and that's essentially an audio to digital converter and that's what makes the audio sound either tinny or introduce noise you can hook up an external mic to this but again since the 80s is bad is still gonna have to do noise removal in post now another thing I noticed as well is any of the other formats if you want to record 4k on this to lower the bitrate the quality reduction is huge so you have to record it pretty much the max res otherwise you're not going to really get usable footage and also not to mention if you want a live stream with this thing on YouTube or twitch or any other platform you're just not going to be able to do that because the bit rates needed to do that essentially around 90 megabits per second to get a decent picture in 360 degrees so yeah coupled with the noise live streams for not chatting on Big Show so you're left with something that again is just really for taking these shots where if you I think they've got this included tool where you can throw the camera and you can get these really cool light tracking the 360 degree shots that's what it I guess it's mainly for is getting different shots if you need to and then integrating that into your current workflow with this kit right here the one are they did include another camera which is like a GoPro kind of thing where it's 4k it's a wide angle and you can that's got this a flow stabilization which does work pretty well but again if you're buying this into 360 free buying for the 360 degree aspect and at the end of the day it's a camera that does what it does and if that's for you and you need that in your workflow they definitely go for a bit in terms of me and integrating it to the regular pod songs and stuff it's just going to take way too much time to get the footage that I want edit it and then put it in and even then you got to lose this around 60 degree aspect you're using it with capture footage on my computer and all the footage I've got here from other cameras so at the moment I think it's a good concept but really integrating it is just another different thing so anyway big thanks to into 360 for sending this out to us but the end of the day I just I'm giving you guys my thoughts and opinions on it I think it's yeah it's a nice kit with nice potential but really using it now especially with the overheating issues I'm having while recording this it's just one of those things that yeah anyway with that aside we've got the question of the day here which comes from Craig Sutton and they asked can you do a follow-up showing how to overclock your existing wanna do a refresh rate and with monitor overclocking I did that a few years ago especially with those Korean panels that we're getting solved really cheap they had the ability to overclock them and I found every time I overclocked them even the ones that people said would overclock well there was a thing known as frame skipping and it was every time I overcome tomorrow I'd get frame skipping didn't matter if it was on ad room video GPU or just skip frames and so that's why I haven't recommended it even though some of the syncing on the by Google Chrome and stuff showed that it was overclocked and it was sinking fine it actually wasn't syncing to mine when we checked it with a high speed camera so is and even then even if it passes those tests you jump into a game like dota 2 and you you literally noticing hey this frame should be here it's not so the frame skipping thing on monitors that don't officially support overclocking is one thing we'll worry about it but also there's another thing too and that is if you're going to overclock your monitor just use the OSD setting like this I know some of the monitors out there they have the ability to overclock by the OSD say for instance the risk viewsonic we did 144 Hertz native but you can try and over up to 165 and if it works it works if it doesn't the manufacturer doesn't be actively that's the only really way that I know how to overclock is it's got to go through a scaler in the day and even if known that the scaler most likely will frame skip so that's what my that's my findings with monitor locking it just didn't work out for me when I tried it in the past anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comments section below what you think about 360 degree of recordings did you enjoy today's video I will say that it was just extremely hard for me to get even just this footage out and edited and get it to you guys so I hope you didn't enjoy it and the post-processing on the audio wow that was something else yeah there's a lot of just be careful with it if you go to buy an insta 360 he's thinking about using it as a main camera especially there's a lot of negatives there as well on top of what you may see out there in terms of what's good about the camera so just understand the there is a lot of negative points be careful of if you want to buy one in sync every guys I'll catch you in another tech video very soon we go on the use part on soon so stay tuned for that and I'll catching the next technically very soon he's out for now bye [Music]
