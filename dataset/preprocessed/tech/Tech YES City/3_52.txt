[Music] today is going to be a very different video where there is someone who's moving overseas and i got word of this through forums and they're clearing out a whole storage shed of just various parts pc parts they've got some retro gaming stuff but of course as soon as i heard pc parts i had to head on down and see what they had now what i'm going to be doing today is just going through the process with you guys on what i'm picking out as someone who does resell pcs i'm going to essentially be going through the cream of the crop in this storage shed and i'm just going to show you guys the whole thought process and then in the end we'll see what deals we come out with and i guess see how much we could have potentially saved instead of going to the local market like facebook etc so let's get straight into those deals and see what is cracker lacking at this storage shed are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as fourteen dollars using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro two links in description below so this storage shed is just absolutely chock-a-block with so much stuff uh we're in the process of just taking all the stuff out so i can just get a good look of it and see what you know see what's inside but so far i am getting into some of the stuff and as i go through these pcs i'll show you what i'm pulling out so the first thing we've got here that i was interested in was of course brand new cases still in the box now i asked them how they came into this stuff and they said there was a computer shop that closed down on the gold coast so they actually picked these up at sellout prices and so they're going to do them for me so what we're going to do right now is just put these cases to the side and we're going to start making the tech yes pile and continue on so the next deal we've got up here is a first gen it's got like a 4 gigabyte stick of memory the cpu is an i5 650 so technically an i3 and the main thing i'm interested in here is actually the motherboard and the memory sticks so of course i'll just offer them like something really you know low level because they're probably going to chuck it out anyway and then we've also got here a teddy bear but i'm not going to be taking the teddy bear a used teddy bear that's been in storage for quite a while and i'm not too keen on that i'll take it so this right here is probably something i would have picked up back in the day but nowadays it's just one of those things where you straight away see it's missing a 24 pin cable and i actually don't have any modular 24 pin cables that would fit a cougar power supply and actually have never come into one so this is one of those things where i'm actually just going to give it a miss simply because it's going to take too much time to try and piece that thing together and i mean yeah so some things you just miss based on time and that's one of those things but what we're going to do now is move over to some of these older pcs there is like some of these have already pulled them apart and they're just like they've got ddr2 inside so basically with ddr2 i don't know if you guys know but i've stopped i actually stopped a while ago with ddr2 pcs and the reason being with ddr2 is that it's just too old i came into simply way too many problems when i was reselling ddr2 pcs like literally like one in every two would just come back with problems and so again the time thing so reselling ddr2 pcs i'm really not into it but one thing that we can do with these old pcs is that they've got pcie wireless cards in them and of course wireless from the store is going to cost 15 bucks brand new and of course i deal with first and second gen pcs so for me i'm pulling out these pcie wireless cards out of these old builds because i can use them in say a second gen i7 rig with like a gtx 770 or something and that's adding 15 of value on for me which basically picking it up for nothing here so this next one here is an antec case it looks pretty decent and then when looking inside we've actually got a semi-decent power supply and also an p7 p55 motherboard so this motherboard's actually decent for a first generation motherboard so upon seeing this whole little package here i figured i'll take the whole thing because i'll be able to definitely piece out a budget rig with this right here but this next one here is a lenovo i don't know if it's third or fourth gen but it does have m2 wireless on it so that's an indicator it's probably 4th gen and it does include the fsp power supply which actually is really decent so that'll power easily a 1050 ti if i put an i7 in there and um since it's got the power supply it's got the cooler we're pretty much all good to go we just make sure we pull out those temp sensors as well so that's important and then we can re-case that and then this one right here was a p55 the zeus motherboard pretty decent so we're gonna take that now one thing you can always look for is the uh cooler indicates that since it's a really thin cooler i'm guessing that this is probably like i3 or i5 so don't even need to pull the cooler off to tell that that's a low grade cpu so pretty much just going to be bartering on the motherboard here and uh in terms of ram it's got two two gigabyte sticks so really not worth a whole lot so we just finished up round one and it is time for round two [Music] so we've gone through four pcs now we've found two eight gigabyte sticks of memory uh sorry two four gigabyte sticks and this one here is kind of like we struck a i wouldn't say gold maybe more bronze we've got a z77 motherboard again looking at that cooler looks like it is an i5 and 500 watt power supply so we wise we'll just take the whole case as well because we might be able to do something with it so let's keep the show going [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] as you were always [Music] so we're now about halfway through actually probably over about halfway through this whole pile here it's summer too so it is pretty hot i am sweating like a dog yeah so so far we picked up a lot of ddr3 memory there is uh also wi-fi cards that i've been picking out as well as i found some z like 97 h77 h61 i've picked all those builds out and uh right here is actually was stopped midway because this one's right here it's an old pentium i forgot which one this is like just by looking at it but i just know it's sort of a real older sort of um intel build and i'm not too sure it's got ddr is it ddr1 and 2. if any of you guys think this is an interesting um sort of intel penny bill let us know in the comments what this is and because i told i told the person with the i said you might want to keep this it might actually have some kind of collective collection value to it [Applause] hey [Music] okay [Music] and we have just finished up going through so many computers of course we've picked out the cream of the crop and then i just left those two computers there was two of those older intel machines i just said they might want to check them out but then out here we've also got just a heap of pcs that we've also went through so there was just so many computers and basically what we did we agreed upon a half a g for all this stuff so let's go get over to the tech yes mobile and see what's in the cab and what we're taking home [Music] so now back at the tech yes studio with 10 pcs in total plus the motherboard that i pulled out here and if i didn't do that i wouldn't have actually fitted all this stuff in my car as we also had those new cases too but of course them being new cases we don't really need to test anything and pull anything apart but the main plan with these computers here today is to keep some of the cases that have clear side panels and also aren't too banged up and then the others i'll be pulling the motherboards out but of course that's if the stuff inside works properly so i'll be going through these pcs three at a time and then if we come into any weird issues we'll see what they are and see how we can fix them up so this first pc here unfortunately it's pretty much a no-go completely the case is damaged the power supply let off a big pop when we first try to turn that on and then after that we did hook up a speaker to the motherboard just to see if there's any beep noises coming out and what happened here was when we tried to boot this pc up it's giving out six loud beeps and it's saying when you look at the diagnosis on the internet saying that it's a cpu error so we tried changing the cpu we tried different ram sticks we even tried a different cmos battery and the board is still letting off a loud beep which means that this pretty much this whole thing here is toast i'm guessing the power supply blew out and took the motherboard with it but what we're going to do is still uh take the ram sticks with us we'll still take these ram sticks with us and the cpu that we pulled out of this which was an i5 3470 so this first one is not looking too good looks like we got a bit of a hose job on the first pc so this next uh build right here is pretty much a similar story as the previous one except we may be able to salvage the power supply so we're going to take that out run it through a power supply checker but this one will just boot up there's no speaker signal coming out whatsoever tried different memory stick and tried a different cpu and it still just gives nothing like it's just booting and then it's pretty much frozen in that state where a good way to check if anything's coming out of this bill will be also to um check if the keyboard is lighting up say the num lock lights up your rgb mouse if you've got an rgb mouse that lights up basically saying that it's it's booting but this pc right here is just nothing is booting it's it's another a dud motherboard unfortunately so it's not looking good so far definitely not looking good so we've now hooked up a power supply tester and this is giving out some really decent figures so the power supply seems to be okay and worse worst case scenario we can reuse this case since it's already got three led fans installed and i just got to take that motherboard out and so we've got a sort of the base of a gaming pc for a later date so finally we got some really good news i was you probably would have heard me cursing from my place to your place if this one didn't work but uh what we did here was initially it didn't boot up properly and then i took out one of the memory sticks and tried using just one memory stick and we're getting a signal but then i tried the other memory stick and it wasn't booting so that means this memory stick right here is faulty and that was causing this pc not to work properly so this is really good news this is one of the best case scenarios when you've got a faulty pc because you can extract that value by just obviously changing the memory stick so one for three that's a at least not too bad i'm not feeling as hosed and now we're two for four with this pc also having an ssd installed and what i had to do to get this one working was take the cmos battery out then also change the memory stick over where the included eight gigabyte stick looks like it was faulty and so that's actually pretty good news again as long as the motherboard and the power supply is working then it's a pretty good trade-off so this pc right here was a pretty good outcome in that we tried two different ram sticks and the pc wouldn't boot but then we tried a different power supply and the pc is booting absolutely fine which means that this power supply right here is faulty since this case is also pretty banged up we're just going to remove the motherboard and the fan and the two sticks of ram and we've got a little bare bones kit right there [Music] [Applause] [Music] this next pc here has no power supply but also when we tried booting it up it just pretty much shut off within the first three seconds and then upon changing the memory stick around we've now got a signal so that means we have yet again a faulty memory stick installed on the pc so this is another really solid outcome especially since these pcs right here when it comes to fourth generation stuff the motherboard is actually a really important piece so this next pc that we got with an h81m motherboard it has an i5 4460 inside it didn't have any memory sticks and the power supply was really weird because the person initially didn't have the eight pin or four pin hooked up so i'm guessing whatever that deal happened here is someone was going to build a gaming pc and just gave up because they couldn't get the power cable to work probably but everything inside this build works so seems like we scored in the best way possible for this next one so this one right here is a unfortunate result of i would put it down to a bad power supply i think this one right here is called an abomb and that's um that's unfortunate because this is what when a lot of people say oh get a decent power supply this pc right here is is a perfect example of why where i think this power supply has caused this motherboard to fail over time uh because it's just got such crap power coming out of it now initially it just it would turn off it would start up turn off and then once we change the power supply around it actually gave us out a beep signal like it was kind of booting normally but then we got actually no keyboard signal lighting up which means that it just couldn't make it past post so unfortunately this whole system here we're going to just take out the cpu there was a ram stick included so we're just going to take that stuff out and then since the case really isn't anything special it's actually missing a side panel we're going to add that to the dump pile also we did try a different cmos battery also tried flashing the bios on the gigabyte motherboard where you can hold down the power button for 10 seconds or hold down the power and reset button depending on the model so you can cycle through those things and try and get the backup bios to initiate so this next one right here is a complete straight success story and this is the best outcome of course this one right here we are going to have to re-case it it is completely banged up but when the power supply motherboard the included ram stick the cooler everything works fine and the fan's not making any crazy noises this is one of the best outcomes of course it's got an i3 in it which is i guess why someone previously chucked it out but with these with these whole acer systems the second generation they're really easy to re-case because there's actually no proprietary connectors on them and also we can just change the cpu over to something like an i5 second gen or i seven so this is the last of the case pulls then after that we got one motherboard to test but this one right here actually didn't even have a cpu in it so i'm just going to pull out the power supply and the motherboard since the case is just totally trashed and we're going to see if we can put a cpu in and a ram stick and get it to work so this one here all we needed to do was just quickly boot it up and see if the keyboard was lighting up and it was but i mean a motherboard power supply and cooler isn't a bad thing i mean if i come into a 6700 for example i can pop that into this motherboard and these are pretty easy to get around in terms of re-casing i've already got the front panel audio connector here and also the front usb works normally like a standard atx usb type 2 connector and this last one here just uh powers on for like a second then just power straight off which is indicative of a motherboard that's faulty so uh this is the last motherboard and it sucks that we came into this problem again we've changed the battery on the cmos we have changed the ram so giving this thing everything we can it's time to wrap up the storage shed raid so here's our trash pile here and actually coming out of this i'm not as happy as i was going in i mean we've got four faulty motherboards and of course going into this second and third generation motherboards are usually the most expensive thing in that series where the cpus are really cheap and actually come into a lot of cpus and it's just the motherboards you want them to work but when they don't work they just don't work and you can spend a lot of time trying to get this stuff to work and trust me i've spent like days trying to get motherboards working sometimes and you just the amount of time that you're going to put into it is definitely not worth the return but over here is the finished pile and we have come out of this with i guess enough stuff to i would say dare break even but again it's this time around it's more so the time that i spent going to the place picking out all the stuff especially during a really hot day sweating like a dog and uh just what we're left with now is we still got to clean up a lot of this stuff and present it nicely and so here we are now at crunch time and what we saw today was my method of going through used parts with that whole 90 percent and then saving 80 percent of time so in other words if we were to put all that extra time in we may get one of those four faulty motherboards working but it's going to take so much longer than the time that we already spent which is half a day cleaning out that storage shed then another half a day going through all the stuff and quickly testing it seeing what works and i think that we came out in the end with the stuff that's also going to reliably work even if we get one of those motherboards working how long is it going to last for because i generally find especially if the motherboards just keep booting up and off they're generally at the end of their life cycle so i came into this thinking i was in for a massive bargain you guys probably feel the energy at the start of the video then i'm coming out feeling like well i kind of like i'm okay like it's fair value 500 aussie dollars for everything we got in the end is okay but i was kind of under the premise and i think the guy selling it also thought there was i7s in that stuff and i did not get one i7 out of that whole pick so if i kind of saw the sticker on the build this is one of the mistakes that i would correct personally next time i do meet someone and go through a storage shed like that even though it's extremely rare would be if there's an i7 on there and we both think there's an i7 in it i'll actually just quickly take the cpu cooler off double check there's an i7 and if there's not then i can say budge down the whole bundle down a hundred bucks because i feel like maybe the fair price on all this stuff was maybe 350 considering i had to outlay all that time and go through all the stuff and in the end it's going to be okay because i can use a lot of this stuff in budget pcs to get my money back but i am a little bit devo that if you guys didn't know it's like devastated that's short in australian for devastated that we didn't get any i7s but in the end we did get enough stuff working to peace out budget gaming systems and the whole process here is that if you've got a power supply and a good power supply like a decent one to test and then you've got a ram stick and then you've got a power supply tester and also a spare cpu you can pretty much get through a lot of the testing phase and also a little speaker as well don't forget the little speaker they can give you out some important information but if you've got these things you can just quickly go through and see what works what doesn't work know if you've got a problem and know what it's going to be so in some of the cases we had a faulty power supply we knew the motherboard worked the keyboard lit up the speaker was going fine giving out one beep and in other cases we just had that like that gigabyte at the start where it's just six beeps telling us there's a cpu error we've changed the cpu over changed power supply over change the ram and the motherboard's still giving out that noise so the motherboard's faulty and we don't have to waste any more time on it we don't have to try and diagnose it we just know that the motherboard's faulty and so we're moving through this stuff pretty quickly and at the end of the day if you guys watch this stuff and you pick up some tips and you're sort of recycling this stuff getting value then you're doing a really good job you know you're going to be helping yourself in the process too but again i gotta just wipe that wipe that negative energy out and uh stay positive so kind of in the end you win some you lose some i think i i kind of lost here a little bit today but i do like to show everything here at take a city on the channel i like to show that if you're getting into used pc parts there's going to be those big victories where you just a static everything works you've got some i7s in there that would have been the best case scenario here today 11 motherboards we had a couple of i7s i would have been over the moon but it wasn't the case four faulty out of 11 motherboards so we had seven working got a couple of power supplies in there some cases that we're going to clean up and no i7s also i've still got to go through a heap of the memory so even though we pulled out some memory from some of the other builds that we weren't picking up there was a lot of memory that we pulled out of the builds that were working in the end so i will go over those separately at a later date we also managed to pull out all those wi-fi cards so that's going to add some value on so every little chance you can get if you know there's value in something don't throw it out take out the stuff that's worth value and so that's what we're doing here today we're pulling out all the stuff that was worth value and just leaving all the old stuff behind especially the ddr2 stuff i don't think anyone's interested in ddr2 especially in a gaming pc for office pcs it's okay but even for office pcs my luck with a lot of that old ddr2 stuff it's just a lot of headaches i mean we had the ddr3 stuff here and even had four out of 11 boards faulty i could only imagine if i picked out some of that ddr2 stuff i would imagine that probably over half of it would have been faulty so again way more wasted time that you need and time is money when it comes to re-flipping pcs and adding value anyway guys with that aside do let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite pick here today for all this massive storage shed raid love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from n2tech and they ask being in somewhat of a closed system have you ever sold a gpu and months to years later buy it back in a deal and recognize it's one of the ones you sold and so when it comes to selling gpus actually in the last year and a half i don't think i've sold individually any gpus i'm in a gpu drought right now where i'm actually always trying to get gpus to put in gaming pcs but if i'm in an abundance of gpus i do sell them separately and i haven't actually had one gpu come back that i've sold separately but in terms of gaming pcs i have had quite a few times a gaming pc that i've sold and then the person who's bought it's actually sold it on to someone else and then that person's come to me traded the gaming pc in because they want something higher end and then i've noticed i'm like this is my gaming pc that i sold a while ago and i'm kind of happy because it's like wow that gaming pc still works absolutely fine years later so it is a testament to the used stuff and if you put good stuff in there and you stress test it properly you get a lot of life out of this stuff but the more common one is just me selling me pcs and then people trading them in who's bought off me before because they want to upgrade to a higher end system and so that's usually when i see the gpus specifically i usually see them come back here to tech yes city anyhow hope that answers that question if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that techies content be sure to
