[Music] in a previous video we took a look at the dell aurora r12 from alienware and this featured an i5 11400f and an rtx 3080 ti and the only reason i bought this was because it came up on a black friday sale for 2 900 aussie dollars which is a little over 2 000 us dollars now at this price in this current market environment especially with graphics cards being priced so high the price of this whole system actually came to around the price of the graphics card alone which means that not only did we get an rtx 3080 ti but we also got pretty much the whole rest of the system thrown in for nothing but in today's video we're going to be upgrading this system and hopefully changing a few things around for the better to see if we can get not only better specs in it but also better temperatures and we're going to be using the i9 11900k and we're gonna be upgrading the ram from 16 gigabytes to 32 gigabytes then we're also going to be adding in a four terabyte hard drive if you guys wanted to upgrade your dell aurora r12 for cheap then this video might be for you but for me i'm going to hopefully flip this thing and make a bit of profit riding the coattails of dell are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as fourteen dollars using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro two links in description below [Music] [Applause] this is basically a new pc and this thermal paste is already like literally crusty and dry i mean if double paste is good usually it'll retain that wet moist feeling even months after it's been used so dell i believe delve used some pretty cheap thermal paste here which is a good thing that we've found this because we can fix it very quickly and easily happiness is it truly meant to last forever [Music] so we've just switched the ram to 32 gigabytes we've added that i9 11 900k in the system and we've also added a hard drive in now upgrading your aurora i will say that you may come into some issues where initially when you turn the pc on there might be a light flashing at the front you may need to power this thing on and off a few times then you should be greeted with a screen that says you've changed your system memory or something's changed in your system and then from there you can just go into the bios and make sure everything checks out in this case we went into the bios we had our 11900k showing up now 32 gigabytes of ram and also the ability to lock in the xmp profiles now if you're in the dell bios and you want to overclock on say for instance 11 900k i wouldn't recommend it just by looking at the feature set at least the first time doing it life [Music] my life [Music] the queen's [Music] so after spending a few hours now tuning the system there's actually some pretty bad news in relation to using an i9 11 900k with the aurora r12 and it comes in the form of the motherboard having limits and then therefore the cpu is trying to overcome those limits but the cpu is essentially then being throttled by the motherboard and so what this means is if you're doing tasks like heavy video editing or if you're running a lot of simulations then you could be met with sub optimal performance take for instance the cinebench r23 score which we will show you guys out of the box we get sub 12 000 points now there's also in the bios two other overclocking settings that we talked about before and locking in both those profiles actually saw the performance drop even worse than compared to that of the default profile and then the second one dropped even worse than the level one overclock even though they were meant to do the opposite and they're meant to give you more performance so what we found at these levels was out of the box we're met with a power limit of 142 watts then on the level one overclock in the bars we're met with roughly 160 watts and then level two were met with 172 watts so even on that maximum overclock with that 172 watts i was actually happy to see that the motherboard wasn't getting too hot the maximum temperature i saw was 76 degrees and that actually isn't too bad especially in the long term where i've seen these temperatures in the past go past 100 degrees anywhere over 90 degrees is a bit of a worry and you should be fixing that but anything under 80 degrees i consider okay especially since we're running a very strenuous benchmark so the motherboard was okay and even in this sarcophagus style case we don't have to worry about adding any cooling because we're limited in that we can't get over this and we also tried the intel extreme utility to try and override these limits because dell know that the components that they're putting in especially in the case of the motherboard it's a mediocre board and so they know if the limits are unlocked then they could have a lot of returns on their hands so they're putting that in place to protect themselves against warranty claims though it's not all bad news for this aurora r12 if you guys have seen in the past i'm actually a big fan of under vaulting where you can extract a lot more performance given certain limits and in this case since we do have that motherboard power limit what i decided to do was actually undervolt the cpu where after a little bit of tuning and having a lot of resets and even telling me the overclocking failed even though it wasn't overclocking we managed to arrive at a sweet spot of a minus 120 millivolts and i'll show you guys the core ratio tapered down to 48 47 46 and 45 and here's where we saw actually a big performance uplift to now over 14 000 points day in day out with cinebench r23 which is still over a thousand points off the default 11 900k on a high-end motherboard but at least it's not as big as a difference as it was before and in fact more good news to come out of this is that we did drop the motherboard's temperatures slightly and the cpu temperatures are now maxing out at 83 degrees but what we're going to do right now is add an additional 12 centimeter fan to this water cooler to see if we can drop those temperatures even further and then we'll also run some gaming benchmarks with three different profiles to see how much performance you're getting out of the box versus the under vaulting versus the 11900k on a higher end motherboard [Music] [Music] and we just finished up with a heap of different testing the first one is the water cooler and the two fans that we changed over for the massive big nidex fan that dell includes on the 120 mil cooler and what we saw here was we had that 83 degrees and then that dropped down to now 75 degrees so we've got a drop of roughly 8 degrees and the good news here was that we'll then able to get an extra 100 megahertz out of our custom undervolt at 4.6 gigahertz as opposed to 4.5 now this is where we're going to go on to the gaming benchmark numbers where in the previous video we did we tested at 4k and 1080p and we found there wasn't of course much of a difference to be had at 4k even with an 11400f versus a 12900k so testing those numbers isn't going to make much of a difference especially if it's high settings at 4k which is what we were testing and that's where the gpu just gets maxed out and it becomes a gpu benchmark but we also decided to throw in some extra numbers so you guys can get a feel for if you want to sort of do what we've done in today's video you can extract the extra performance but on the same token i'm not sure if dell sells this motherboard on the aurora r12 with an 11 900k out of the get-go because if it is the same motherboard with the same power limits what you're going to get is a throttling 11 900k out of the box but stepping things down now to 1080p here is where we saw a performance uplift versus the 11400f and also if we decide to do the undervolting which i do recommend we can also extract a little bit more performance versus the default out of the box settings for gaming so just like we saw in the cinebench settings we were seeing that in the gaming numbers although of course not as dramatic and as big as the cinebench numbers but still a gain to be had nonetheless then i also decided to throw the 11900k on a test bed with a better motherboard and just show you what you're missing out on which isn't a whole lot of performance once we do the under vaulting the first up is age of empires 4. and here is where we saw a performance uplift of roughly 35 going with the 11900k over the 11400f and then moving things across to borderlands 3 we saw a nice uplift here in performance that came closer to that of the 12 900k and bridging that gap between the 11400 f and the better ddr5 cpu though the last game we've got here is fortnite and here's where we saw a big difference between the 11400 f and the 12 900k with the rtx 3080 ti at 1080p and the 12900k did bridge this gap but not in the same percentages as the other games so it does look like the new chapter 3 update with fortnite is loving those new 12th gen cpus and now it's time for a conclusion on the aurora r12 upgraded from an 11400f to an i911 900k and i am a little bit disappointed with the motherboard so in the previous video we found that the case was the weakest link in this video upgrading it we found that now the case and the motherboard are the weakest links if you want to go with the higher end cpu option the actual cooler itself the 120mm cooler when we change the fans over that did a phenomenal job given what it was served and this was up to 160 watts the 11 900k can juice up to around 200 watts even out of the box so it is power hungry but we're not that far off if we had a good motherboard then i'm sure this 120 mil cooler with the two fans installed would still be able to keep it under control keep in mind this is a 28 degree celsius ambient environment so it's not exactly as cool as other places in the world though the main saving grace for this build in the end was actually that power supply where since dell did include a solid 1000 watt power supply with what i believe is solid ripple suppression that means that we're able to get that minus 120 millivolt that we saw in the intel extreme tuning utility and so that then enabled us to match the cpu with the motherboard's limit so picture this before you do this what's happening is the cpu wants to go higher than it is but the motherboard's limiting it so then the cpu is all confused and that's why you see all the clocks jumping up and down but after we sort of drop the voltages down drop the speeds down we then match that motherboard limit and we get pretty good performance even though it's still not as good as the 11 900k to get on a high-end motherboard it still is decent and when i go to flip this thing i'll be happy to know that the person buying it isn't going to be getting a stuttering mess they're still going to be able to use most of the potential of the 11900k and they've got a pretty good looking system though we've also got out of this whole ordeal an 11 400 f 16 gigabytes of ram left over i'll put the total bill cost that this thing cost me on the screen for you guys but i'm going to estimate what the 11 400 f and the two eight gigabyte sticks of ram are worth to me since i will be putting them in a separate gaming pc which i will flip but what we're going to do here with this build is i'm going to hopefully try and flip this now for around four and a half thousand aussie dollars and so hopefully in this process i can make roughly a thousand dollars profit if i can get that that'll be very solid it'll be a learning experience for me because some people message me after this uh the original video and they're like brian are you taking a big risk are you okay you're sure this is gonna work out and my answer to that is i don't know i just don't know and that's why i just try new things and in the process you guys get to see if the aurora r12 is a decent buy or if it's just total garbage that you should avoid and in that case out of the box as we said in the previous video with the 11400f it was a decent buy with the upgrades if you know what we're doing in today's video and you're happy sort of custom tuning it and you can get it for a really good price then you can get around the issues that it does present with with an 11 900k but that being said we're not going to try and change the motherboard around we're not going to change the case around because then that'll take away from the whole alienware experience but also there might be some people out there like why don't you just change the motherboard and you just can't all pun intended with this case because you've got that alienware case you've got the proprietary connector for the front panel which also controls the rgb on this motherboard so if you change the motherboard around which in this case it's also a micro atx so it's not a full size atx you will come into issues using another motherboard even though the basic parts will work you just have a case with no rgb i'd have no idea how the power button would work after that too so it's just not worth it in the end you will get met with some proprietary brick walls it's honestly just going to take you so long to get your head around try and work it then the person buying it isn't also they're not going to have an original alienware piece see so there's those few factors that i'm putting in especially when it comes to the time that i'm outlaying versus what i intend to try and make in terms of profit on this build though that aside build ended up being okay not the greatest but certainly far from the worst and that was the aurora r12 experience hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to hit that like button for us hope you guys having a happy new years all around the world wherever you are staying
