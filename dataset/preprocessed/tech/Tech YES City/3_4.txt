it is a hot sunny day here in japan and it's also nearing the end of the month and so that can only mean one thing around tech yes city that is the used pc parts hunt of the month where today we've got two new stores that i'm just going to check out here that i've never been to before and they are john palah in chiba and also dos powder so both these stores hopefully might have some used deals and i'm really on the lookout this month for really anything motherboard ryzen older intel older motherboard related as well as of course graphics cards but i think in terms of japan the mining boom never really hit here so therefore the mining bust is probably not really going to hit either but let's see what we can come up with here both in physical stores and of course searching online to get the best prices possible [Music] if you want to get yourself a cheap legit windows 10 pro key license then today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 when you use that coupon code bftyc you can get windows activated right now links in description below so stepping foot out of both those two stores they were actually very good in fact they were so good to the point where they're some of the best stores i've seen outside of tokyo so i've been looking for some new stores to hit up in terms of getting used deals and i'm definitely going to be coming back to those in the future where we picked up an i7 7700 32 gig of ram uh 256 gigabyte ssd one terabyte hard drive had a bronze rated power spline side a zeus motherboard the whole pc was complete and just had a crappy gravis card and we got this for a little over 200 usd for the whole pc now you add in a graphics card that only needs an 8-pin power connector and you get yourself a whole gaming pc which we actually did get a graphics card with an 8-pin power connector we got the rx 6600 for a little over 250 us dollars so again these gravity scouts are coming down in price even the mining flood here is affecting gpu prices in japan so i actually expected the prices i was paying in japan to be a bit higher than what the us is seeing on ebay with all the miners dumping cards on ebay and the us and also in australia as well i think the graphics card prices are cheap there too but it's good to see that i can get some pretty good deals here on gpus in japan to the point where i also got an rtx 2080 and we picked that up for a shade over 300 usd so i think that's a pretty solid pickup too and you may be wondering brian these are used cards did you make sure they were working and actually dos powder was so good to the point where they just showed me it running fur mark they said look if there's any problems within a week on any of this stuff bring it back we'll give you money back instantly and they also gave me a one month warranty on the pc so they are guaranteeing their stuff and but one thing i mean if the card the graphics cards are running fur mark they're going to be absolutely fine then the last deal that we got at powder was a one terabyte hard drive and we picked this up for under ten dollars so that was solid they showed us that working as well then i went next door to jumper and they had a few pretty good deals i'd say the deals would be a little bit different to dos powder in the sense that they had a lot more older stuff in the terms of having a lot more i5 4th gen and a lot of monitors and keyboards and in the end they had a case as well a corsair carbide case which i picked up for about 15 us dollars and they also have some pretty good deals on ssds one terabytes and also 500 gigabytes but i forgot my passport here and they take 10 percent off at jumper where as opposed to dos batter they don't take anything off the prices there so i was a little bit like okay damn i forgot my passport today so had i brought my passport i would have ended up buying a few more ssds and stocking up on those because they had pretty good prices on used ssds at jampada but we ended up getting that case and they also had a taichi x370 and a ryzen 7 1700 they were going for around 70 each so i probably would have picked those up but i just settled for the case because i forgot my passport i'll probably come back another day if they're still there and uh get the ten percent off but in terms of moving to the next location now we're already on a bit of a roll but because i'm in chiba city there's a place called freso and i've been to this heart off in the past so when i go jump in the yes mobile go head to this heart off and see if they've got any deals [Music] so we just left that heart off and i've got mixed emotions because that heart off was literally like if you guys have watched tech yes city before i went back to australia and did full-time youtube that hard off was one of the hard offs where i got some of the best deals on the channel back in the day when we were building those under 100 pcs the league of legends pcs and stuff like that a lot of those deals were coming from the heart offs and this hard off was just one of those hard offs that was just amazing and now it's just a complete bust there is nothing there in terms of pcs whether it's junk or whether it's just regular stuff that is of any value i'm just shocked that they've just got nothing there that's just even a decent deal uh for instance they got a gtx 970 and they're looking like they're pricing it up like 20 30 dollars more than what the dos paddle was pricing it up at and then they've got gtx 1060s 50 dollars more so all the prices i'm seeing at these heart offs are just more expensive when they used to be the cheapest uh place around town and especially this one this one was a huge hard off that i used to go to quite regularly so what i've been seeing here on the last two months that i've been doing these parts hunts is that hard offs are just becoming really bad places to get pc parts and deals i mean maybe if you're at a different location in japan say for instance you're living all the way over on the west side of japan or you're in another whole different island maybe there's a heart off there that's got some really good deals but in terms of around tokyo and near tokyo these hard offs are just garbage they just got really not even worth going to i'm at the point where i'm going to try one more of these places and if if i can't get a good deal like if i just see absolutely nothing and it's literally getting to the stage where it's not even worth my time looking at these places for pc parts now i will pause and say that some of the times i've seen really good audio gear in fact i picked up an audio interface about a month ago from one of the hard offs that was a pretty solid price it was around 30 dollars and it was in immaculate condition for this audio interface so seems like everything bought pc parts at heart off can be a pretty solid deal but it just seems like in terms of pc parts in itself they're either taking the whole pc apart and picking out all the cream and just selling it individually or i i mean i don't know it's just it's really they've all the fun's just been sucked out of hard off now to the point where even i was thinking oh well i'll just go to the junk section go get a junk cpu cooler for the test bench where you don't need the mounting kit i used to pay like a dollar for these now they're asking five dollars so so i don't know man i don't know we're going to try one more place before we conclude it and maybe they've maybe you can give me some hope so i'm going to try a whole new place that i haven't been to in a long time and see if they've got any deals let's try we've gone from peak to the bottom all in one parts hunt and all in just two locations [Music] so [Music] so coming out of that next heart off it was just like the one before it a complete bust for pc parts in fact i had been to this one before two months ago when i did the first parts hunt when we came to japan here this year and since then there have been some pcs that are still sitting on there actually i think all the stuff that i saw there was sitting there again except when i went to the junk section there was some new additions on the shelves and this will give you an idea of just how bad the pricing is at the moment was they had a 4th gen i5 oem system and it's going for like a hundred and fifteen hundred and twenty us dollars now usually you can get an i7 and 16 gig of ram and know that the whole system works fine for that price so hard offs pricing is just really out of the mix right now i think they really need to calibrate their pricing properly before like maybe i'd be interested in buying something because i'm just seeing like prices are just off in yonder at the moment especially if it's junk parts and you don't even know there's no guarantee that they'll work i personally love it when you at least get a one week guarantee because then you can thoroughly stress test the parts run them through a build and if it works fine after that you know it's 99.9 of the way there for the final flip though going forward i think i might start skipping these places all together except maybe my local one where i found a decent case for a decent price and it's only five minute drive down the road but i'd love to hear your thoughts and comments in the comments section because i'm just ultimately i am wasting a lot of time going to these places and checking it out only to be either met with a mediocre deal that has like in that case of that motherboard combo we got it ended up having bad memory channels which they lied about on the description when they were selling it or of course we just come out completely empty-handed with a heart off anyhow guys i am at the last place here this local heart off i will check that in the one directs quickly and then we'll get back to the tech yes studio [Music] so that hard off ended up being actually pretty decent they had a few items in stock that i would have got especially if i was desperate i could have got a few more things like an additional power supply and a z68 motherboard but these are the two deals that i thought were the best there and that was a h55 from a zeus it's coming a little over ten dollars and then they've got a cx-430 modular power supply here coming in at around seven dollars so those two deals they put a smile on my face and i'm gonna still at least check out my local hard off which seems to offer the best deals out of all the ones i've been to but right now we are at this one directs and we went inside i've already checked inside and that was a complete bust so we went from like 5 out of 10 boss if we were to give it like a point score to a 10 out of 10 bust at this one direct so as soon as i saw 4th gen i5 and the price tag i thought wow some of these places really need to recalibrate some of their prices i just think they're way too high but let's get back to the tech studio and unravel what has happened here so far [Music] and we are back unloading all these deals on the table and you have to excuse me i'm a little bit tired i've logged all this stuff up five flights of stairs though starting off with the graphics cards i'm grateful to see that in japan the gpus are coming especially on the used market well below msrp and in fact there is a 10 tax here on stuff just like it would be in australia so the prices are actually even better than i expected here in japan now i came into this parts i'm thinking gpus wouldn't be anywhere near the decent prices they are on ebay in the u.s but i'll surprise with this 2080 and also this rx 6600 that they were the prices that they were and of course they showed me them completely working everything was fine so those gpu deals finally coming down to levels that actually scream good value now we got the 88r case that was a pretty good deal considering i already checked it out they showed me it in the shop and it was pretty much near immaculate but below that is a full build that's pretty much ready to go if you just add in a graphics card so we've got the i7 7700 32 gig of ram ssd backup hard drive decent power supply you add in the rx 6600 and you get yourself a whole gaming pc for under 500 us dollars that's actually going to be pretty solid performance though in terms of this build what i might do is change some things up say do a k-swap add a bit of rgb bling put in a bigger power supply just to make sure the person who's buying it not only has a better aesthetic but they're more comfortable with the power supply even though a 450 watt power supply with an rx 6600 it's not officially recommended but at least from the testing i've done here it will be okay especially if you undervolt the rx 6600 but again back to that mindset of the person who would buy a beginner pc they would sort of want that safety margin of having a couple of extra 100 watts of course the bigger is better motto when it comes to power supply sets in so i'm happy to accommodate that so after that we've got the really good price on the one terabyte hard drive and we got this cx 430 watt m power supply which of course we can use on builds say with gtx 970s gtx 1060s because i do believe the prices of those cards will be coming down very soon and if i have some builds ready to go at a low price point i should be able to make some decent money flipping now a lot of you guys asked me actually in the previous parts hunts that i've done here how am i going to price up these builds how am i going to start moving them i've actually been trying to get my yahoo account reactivated the one that i was selling on they of course want to see my id and my id has gone out of date since i haven't lived in japan for so long so it's actually a big mountain of crap that i've got to go through to get my seller accounts activated on some of these websites and so that will take a little bit of time but in the meantime i am hoping to try and sell some of these pcs at a free market basically no one has a car boot sale at a local place so i'll see how that goes if you guys want to see a video on that i will make that happen but could be a big fail as well who knows let's give it a go anyhow it's now time to conclude this month's parts hunt in japan where i'm very happy with these deals that i got here on the table and i'll put the price tally up on the screen for you guys do let us know what your favorite deal of the month here was i'm kind of leaning towards the h55 azus motherboard i know some people be like brian that's an old motherboard it's crap but this and also the cx-430m these are sort of coming in well under street price and especially if i grab a zeon for this little motherboard right here it's going to make for some of the cheapest price performance you can get especially if you're into say just getting into pc gaming 60fps on a lot of titles something like the old school even though it's really old it'll still be able to get up and boogie and be able to get up and boogie for like a tenth of the price of some of these newer builds and it seems like these kinds of builds will be coming back in season now that there's no gpu shortage going on where we all know where the shortage really happened it was just crypto miners buying off all the retailers at a higher price before all the cards could hit the shelves and guys like you and me could get a chance at buying them at msrp though of course the grass car deals that we got right here very happy with these prices and in general i just don't need to go on mail cuddy or yahoo this month because i can go back to that store which was about a half an hour 40 minute drive depending on traffic away from me and they've got some really good deals on ssds and also ram as well so if i need to go stock up on some of those parts for a budget build i can quickly jump in the car drive over there get some stuff that i need and then head back to the studio and put together a budget build instead of going on yahoo or mail cuddy i still have to pay more on those sites than i would at this local place right here so really happy that i ended up finding a new place to get some used parts from and i just love going to a physical store checking some of the stuff out it really is a bit better than going with the online experience even though most people shop online nowadays i just love picking the stuff up getting to check it out especially if you get to check it out before you buy it sort of i guess half the fun in used parts hunting anyhow guys with all that aside i hope you enjoyed this month of june use pc part time of the month if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know again in the comments what was your favorite deal have you been picking up some deals in your spare time love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from zx and they ask the real question is why didn't you start mining as early as everyone else and then they go on to talk about how much profit they've made people buying late panic selling and i've said this in the past on live streams so this comes from the gpu flood video that we recently made and the reason i didn't mind in 2021 2022 this whole latest crypto boom was because that i already mined back in 2017 i did the whole journey of getting into crypto mining using pc parts and the whole reason i didn't do it the second time around was because after the first time all it was was literally a ponzi scheme i mean in that message you've wrote written right there it just you're describing a ponzi scheme those who got in early made money and the guys who got in late lost money and what i saw in 2017 2018 was the exact same thing i got in early thankfully and i made money back then but afterwards i felt guilty and the time since this last crypto boom in the recent one crypto really didn't change i didn't see anything of productive value that had changed since 2017 and 2021. i mean all i saw was just like nfts come online and then the fees for those nfts were like 50 it was ridiculous people who wanted to really make artwork for cheap and utilize it on a decentralized network couldn't do it efficiently and i thought when crypto came into play years and years ago it was not only meant to bring the decentralization aspect but it was also meant to bring efficiency with it and so what i haven't seen in crypto is that leap in efficiency a lot of things are still very inefficient and so that's why me personally i haven't been a big bull on crypto i've actually been staying away from it because i want to see crypto in my daily life being utilized and in fact if it's being utilized i want to see it being better utilized than the current technology that i already have and especially that argument of decentralization when the developers which is where all the nfts are on the developers of ethereum basically saying that their network is essentially centralized that's a very scary fact as well so it seems like when it comes to crypto bitcoin is still the original and still probably the one to go for it's just that i don't believe in any of it personally because i don't think it's the solution to our modern day problems and if you guys have spoken to me off camera you'll know the only solution we really have to what we've currently got the word starts with an r and that's all we've got that's all we can really do bitcoin ain't gonna do it that's for sure anyhow hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and you'll get the videos as soon as they hit that sub box and honestly sorry if i'm looking like a steam oven in here that's because i am japan this year this is the hottest day in japan so far so i've got up to like 36 degrees celsius and i've even got my air con on and again lugging stuff up five flights of stairs it can get pretty hot here definitely humidity wise anyhow i'll catch you guys in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] but you'll always stay closed
