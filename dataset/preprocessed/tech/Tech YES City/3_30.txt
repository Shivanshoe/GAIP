what is crack-a-lackin tech yes citizens today is going to be a vlog where i'm going to be picking up some gpus some graphics cards so this will be the final hustle that'll take place in australia before i head to japan there's also some other things that i have to get ready there's things like paperwork there's also some other gear that i have to make sure i have before i head over to japan but there's also some other things that i'm doing and maybe it's tips for you guys as well if you're able to travel in the next few months where you can take advantage of prices in different countries and this for me personally is going to save me actually quite a lot of money and that's what it's all about here at tech yeah city is getting those deals and saving some coin and of course in the end getting the same price performance but also in today's video i thought i'd just talk to you guys in a more personal way where i'm just going to talk about some of the things that go on behind the scenes here at tech yes city in that i currently have a sponsor spot with scd keys and they are a long time sponsor here at the channel and and people like brian you always post up sponsor spots for scd keys so i'm going to be straight away transparent and say that i do seven spots for them in my sponsorship agreement with std keys but that's because i believe in their product and what they sell in that they sell single end user licenses for windows 7 10 and 11 and the great thing about scd keys is i've tested their keys in the past and they all come out as single end user licenses i actually did a video on this and i'll put the link in the description below so if you guys want to get a great deal on a windows pro license i'll put the link in the description below make sure you use that coupon code bftyc with that aside let's go pick up these two graphics cards right now where i believe i'm getting a pretty solid deal seeing as they just came up on the market [Music] so we picked up the rtx 2070 super and we ended up getting this for 500 aussie dollars and initially they had it up for 620 but uh someone else was coming in to pick it up for 500 and then that person flaked out apparently they got an rtx 2080 or something so i was like look i'll come in and get this 2070 super which it's almost the same thing as a 2080 if i remember correctly and so we got that for 500 aussies so that's a pretty decent deal the next deal we're going to get now is an rtx 30 60 vision gigabyte edition they're asking i think it was just under 600 aussie dollars and i put in an offer of 550 then they came back at like 565 or something i'm like well it's still almost 100 under retail so i'll come and grab that so we're gonna go get that deal now but also while we were at it the uh first person here with the rtx 2070 super though like man i'm clearing out these old games and i saw some of the titles that i used to play back in the day when dvd games were a thing there's a command in conker there's starcraft 2 diablo 3. and so i'm like yeah i'll take all like the favorite games that i used to play and even one of the games command and conquer 4 i think even though that flopped it was still signed by the main actor who plays kane so i was like man i'll take that that looks pretty cool and there was also half-life in there in the box so i don't know i'll just i'm like yeah i'll take this stuff because it was pretty cool even though i should be getting rid of stuff and not taking any more stuff sometimes you just can't resist some of those cool finds but uh let's uh let's go get this next deal [Music] [Music] so we just picked up the rtx 3060 and we got this one for 560 aussie dollars so they said uh i said do you have change for a tenno and they said no because it was five he wanted 565 and so i they didn't have change so he just said 560 was okay so i asked him also while i was there i was like uh you know you're upgrading you got any other parts sort of like the usual um questions that i ask anyone when i pick up used deals because we got those cool pc games those nostalgic pc games from the other guy but the he said he was upgrading to a 30-70 and he said he paid over a thousand dollars for this rtx 3060 and i'm just like man like please like i was telling people that here on the channel just don't pay for these overpriced prices though just way too much but i guess in videos nvidia's marketing man i guess it's that good they they know how to suck them in even at those really high prices so yeah i feel kind of sorry for the guy who went out and paid over a thousand dollars for this and then he's going to go out and now buy an rtx 3070 so he's just handing his money just handed it over to nvidia as opposed to me i'm actually getting the deal and we're putting together some juicy gaming pcs but right now i've actually just catching up with a few friends as well before i go to japan so making sure you know i have a have a drink with the boys and uh gonna have a little drink and then yeah we're gonna get home and build some pcs [Music] and now we are back at the tech yes studio the next morning and what i've done here is i've finished uh two pcs where i've got the graphics cards for pretty decent prices but just this is going to be kind of the opposite to the gtx 1080 ti video where if you guys haven't seen that one i'll put the link up here but basically i made a pc where the gpu i felt was overpriced and were coming into this new market so i quickly made really good value on the other side of the rest of the parts in the pc in order to flip that build to sort of branch into this new market and that's kind of what's going on here where i've got these pretty decent deals on these gpus and i'm sort of using that to then put into a couple of pcs just to break even on the other parts and that's because i feel like we're going into this new market where the economic conditions have it so that we've got potentially tightening on the way with what's called quantitative tightening and if that happens then wow i mean prices of pc parts i believe will come down but we've also got interest rates on the way up at the moment and of course if you couple in with reduced tourism reduced economic activity that's like a recipe for potential disaster if you look at it that way of course there's the option this is what i've always told you guys uh in the last six months is that always be on the lookout for what these central banks are doing are they going to be printing more money at any turn they can just ramp up the printers again and that just means well there's going to be more people buying graphics cards pc parts and whatnot so if that's the case you want to be stocking up on as many pc parts as you can if you know that the printers are turned on and this is pretty much like since 2020 the end of 2020 adapting to this game is just it's getting a bit ridiculous like when you really break it down and look at what's going on it's kind of sad what's going on where we don't as a people of our public vote for who's in charge in control of our money and that's uh like the money that we use every single day and pretty much everyone relies on this we have no voting power over it we have no control over it and it's kind of one of those things where now we're kind of going off tangent in the video but you guys love economic talk those three points that we mentioned when i get to japan we will be live streaming and talking about that stuff a lot more because i know you guys love it but in the meantime i'm building up two pcs rtx 3060 rtx 2070 super and we're putting them in uh the 2070 super's going with i3 12 100 f i bought this when it first came out the price was actually kind of a little bit higher in my opinion and so we're trying to move that in a system as quickly as possible because again not many people want an i3 12 100 f it's a pretty like i mean even though it's a good cpu one of the best value cpus on the market the problem with it is is that people see i3 and they just run away even though it's better than an i7 6700 or whatnot people just see oh i3 and so they'd rather actually have an i7 6700 the irony of pc gaming and computers so you sometimes you just can't fight it you've just got to quickly move and then move into that market so i enjoyed doing the testing and the videos but now we've got to move that thing and people like well brian you made money on the ads right with the youtube ads and and stuff it's like well that's you got to think of that separate because youtube like for me personally i just don't see look when we're not going there in this video but then the next pc is a ryzen 7 5800 x and we overpaid for that it's time to move that and we're moving that with an rtx 3060 so those are the two pcs i've gotten ready in terms of the other flips you win some you lose some but i like to take that saying and turn it into okay well you win quite a lot and then you don't lose some you break even some and so that's kind of been my motto over the last few years and it's worked really well and i hope you guys perhaps have the same model even better if you're getting better deals than i am so that's one of the things that we're looking at here is is that okay i've got to move just like that 1080ti rig so i've got to look at okay could the prices of this stuff come down even more in the future and the answer is a check mark to both those rigs that i just talked about and so i want to move them now and of course you can buy back the parts later and put together an even cheaper gaming pc because what i'm seeing on marketplace locally here is that there's a lot of these rigs that have just been sitting up there for months and no one's buying them they're just sitting there and so that's actually happening a lot in my local marketplace and you know i don't want to be one of those guys that's just sitting there months on a pc especially if it's under a thousand dollars or under two thousand dollars you want to be moving those rigs quite quickly because that's where the majority of people are buying a gaming pc at in terms of price point in australia and so now we're talking about going to japan what i've got to get ready i'll be taking quite a few things with me especially things that i just can't live without so we'll go what are those live without tools first of all it's going to be a pc of course i've got to edit videos for you guys and the pc is honestly just part of my life and the thing is i tried using a desktop you may have noticed in the past couple of months i tried using a laptop i bought one it was a good deal but i just can't use a laptop for what i do and so i got this mini itx rig i built this thing up 12 900k 3080 ti and this thing is literally the best pc i've got around here so i've got no need for these big desktops that have been in this uh studio and so we reduce this thing you're like brian that's so much heat for a small case we actually reduced this from 560 watts max power draw out of the box or out of the little box to 350 watts via under vaulting so when i get to japan i'll make some under vaulting tutorials for you guys for intel ryzen nvidia amd gpus like we'll do the whole four four yards there because uh undervolting is definitely where it's at it's the new overclocking in my opinion just because of the way nvidia intel and amd are carrying themselves in 2021 and 20 2022 where they just seem to want to just go max performance out of the box on all their stuff leave very little overclocking headroom and that just means that they've actually gone way past the efficiency peak curve for the average user and of course with power going up nowadays every i mean me personally is like well i want to use less power and save some money and make my components run a lot cooler too then we've got the documents to go to japan this has been an absolute nightmare for me to do i've had to get a visa that took ages to get because i had to get like 20 documents for that then we got written pledge then we got all these other things it is a nightmare at the moment people like well they're opening up the borders in japan it's like yeah they're they're opening it up still with the same process they're just letting more people in like you can't just get your passport and jump on a plane and go there like you did in 2019 so this is yeah this is what it takes now to travel and it's honestly a massive nightmare so now it's just a quick look at stuff that i really want to take to japan stuff that i have to take but i can't take as well and at the front of that is the data vac this thing is in a league of its own here at tech yes city it is s tier where everything else would be a tier b tier c tier this thing right here even though it's got a little bit of a steep asking price i think in australia there when i first got this it was like 70 us dollars uh and then it went up in price like massively but this thing right here saved us so much time and money cleaning where we didn't have to go out and get any air dusters and so cleaning the pc parts up it was absolutely phenomenal but somewhere along the lines i just started using it for not only that but also drying out pc parts after water cleaning them and it just does both jobs phenomenally well absolute workhorse this thing it hasn't blown out yet but it is looking really worse for wear so we've been using this thing i believe now over four years it has just been the best investment at tech yes city period this thing is in another league of its own and you can see here like the one common problem i had was that it did cut out three times since i've used it but i figured the main cause of that was they used sharp screws to plug this top port into the bottom cylinder and so i replaced them actually with pc screws and that fixed that problem also when i was doing that flood pc i like this grommet just blew out of the data vac so i think it's maybe it's on its way out i i know that it's starting to just literally fall apart while i'm using it but uh another thing is too you guys asked me about that pc the flood pc and so i'm actually as curious as you guys are to know how long that pc will last for so when i handed it back to jake i just said like look man this is all for free enjoy the pc so sorry to hear about your situation but do keep us informed on how this pc goes so as soon as i find that information out i'll relay it back to you guys actually a lot of people are just curious to know is this pc going to have long term problems so i guess uh jake's over the moon but he's kind of become a tech yes experiment so the next tool that we've got now is my electric screwdriver this is actually charged off usb as opposed to the datavac that only accepts 230 volt so i probably won't be able to use that in japan so that'll unfortunately have to stay but this is a 5 volt charge off usb so this is my electric screwdriver i'm going to take this with me because i've got the extended head for it and this just saves me so much time when it comes to building pcs we got the tension there as well one tension just for screwing off like cpu coolers then we just change it to max tension for doing everything else and it's just been an absolute workhorse as well without going in eight here but then we've got the multi-purpose spray just like the data back we can't take that with us but i'm gonna be finding the japanese meta solution in 2022 when we head over there but this stuff here is i mainly use this over brake cleaner a lot brake cleaner in 2022 even last year i shied a lot off it mainly because it was a lot more expensive than multi-purpose spray but also i only found it was really useful because i started washing pc parts in the ultrasonic cleaner i found it was really only useful for getting thermal paste like the real tough to get thermal paste out of near the dies especially on gpus so i actually used it on jake's computer when it came to cleaning the 3070 ti up we're also going to be taking this little brush with us this is important because the brittleness of this is just perfect and so me finding one that sort of can clean cpu pins down like this can i don't really know i don't want to waste time so i'm going to be taking this with me just to make sure that we've got the right brush for the right job so this was the one that i found that's going to stay in the kitty i'm going to travel with a cpu cleaning brush and now the final thing that i'm going to talk to you guys about is just how i the tech hustle sort of it controls parts of my life where even the camera gear we're going to talk about what's going on with the camera gear i'm going to be maximizing the value that i can get out of that where i've recently sold all my 4k camera gear whether it was sony or canon i sold all that stuff and i bought a 200 i actually got this off the market for 250 aud the panasonic g7 was a really good deal here locally because i had this lens that i kept ever since the japan days when i was doing those cs go potatoes and stuff i just for some reason i love this lens i want to keep it it was kind of like sentimental and so i kept that panasonic lens for this camera that we're filming on now with the wide-angle adapter that i picked up for ten dollars so we've got this bridge camera until we get to japan where the camera gear is like literally like 20 to 25 percent off at the moment because the uh aussie dollar where i'm at is so strong it's buying like 93 japanese yen so it's kind of funny how like all these things are aligning for just the tech yes value to go through the roof so we've just uh sold the camera gear here and we get pretty good money for it then we get over to japan and just buy the pretty much a lot of the same gear back and so it's kind of crazy especially if it's kind of higher end camera gear how much of a difference in the price there is between the two countries and so i'm looking forward to doing that but if you guys maybe want to see a vlog on that kind of stuff then i'll be more than happy to start doing different kinds of content for you guys because i've definitely been just focused on enthusiast tech i mean tech yes city it is mainly the focus is enthusiast tech but if you guys want me to branch out maybe do some different content especially while i'm in japan then i'm definitely all ears because at the end of the day i do make this content for you guys and thank you so much for subscribing and being a viewer really appreciate it and we've also got the question of the day here before we get on out of here and this one comes from michael surfer and they say thanks for caring for the fans i got one question though does the cpu internal thermal compound d-litting affected by the flood water too and this is this is a good question that got me thinking well this is the first time i've cleaned out a flood affected pc so i'm not entirely sure i can only just sort of guess as to you would definitely want to clean out a deleted cpu and change the paste on that but in terms of say a soldered cpu in this case the 5800x that's soldered i believe so we didn't have to take that apart or change anything because there was no problems with the ihs to the cpu so the cooling wasn't a problem there ended up being fine in the end but in terms of say an intel cpu that hasn't been deleted and they use thermal paste i'm not entirely sure how that would play out i mean for me personally any intel cpu that comes through here that's high performance say for instance an i7 8700k if that was flood affected i would definitely even if it wasn't deleted i would delid that thing and change the thermal paste because some of the thermal paste intel put on those cpus a few years ago it was just horrible the pace performance was pretty bad to the point where d-linning could drop your cpu 10 degrees anyway so i'd say if you had a flight affected pc with a cpu that could be deleted easily and it wasn't deleted i would do it anyway that would just be protocol for me and with that aside i hope you guys enjoyed today and yesterday's video if you did be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below are you looking forward to tech yes rocking up in japan is there anything you guys want me to do while i'm over there anything you have to see do let us know with that aside if you
