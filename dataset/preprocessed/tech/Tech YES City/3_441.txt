the risin 530 500x is a cpu that came out in later 2019 and it was originally intended for different markets for system builders in that it wasn't really sold on the retail shelves especially in the likes of Australia US and UK for example and in fact these CPUs did find their way to these countries eventually in the form of Aliexpress where I check this CPU out at its current market rate and I thought it was phenomenally good value for money and that you had a CPU that was so relevant for the majority of gamers out there especially gamers that played multiplayer titles like fortnight GTA 5 and Rainbow six siege for example this CPU had it all the latest IPC great price performance coupled really well with a 320 and B 450 motherboards and better yet it had an improved IMC over the previous generation Rison v 2600 if you want to check out the video I did I'll put the link up here though if what it's worth it was a CPU at a hundred and ten dollar market rate that's what you could get it for on Aliexpress however in the past few weeks we have noticed that these ads have been taken off I'll Express completely you guys have asked me to look into that as well as check out the Verizon v 1600 AF so today we're gonna be talking about both these CPUs and seeing what my research has unveiled though I do put out a disclaimer a lot of this is pure speculation [Music] so first off with the risin five-thirty 500x the sellers who were selling this on Aliexpress were forced to take these listings down by Aliexpress now I'll Express having commented when I send them an email as well as AMD when I ask them about this the only response I got was the risin 5 3,500 X was intended for limited markets and so we can only speculate here what has gone down although I highly think it's the most likely scenario and that is the Chinese division of AMD sent a cease and desist letter to Aliexpress saying look if you don't take these CPUs off your website and this could quite simply escalate into a matter that could cost Aliexpress a lot of money if they lost in court though this CPU being delisted our file express doesn't help guys like me in Australia or people in the US or the UK who want to get this CPU and simply utilize its price performance benefits so you're probably thinking well how do I get this CPU if I'm in one of these places so there's essentially two different ways you can do this still and that is you could go through sites like Taobao which for me personally are an extreme pain because I'll express does have a buyer protection program if you go through Taobao you're gonna have a really hard time since the sellers generally don't speak English at all and even you've got to use a third-party shipping agent and once that all adds up as well as currency transaction fees you're looking at a similar price to that of all Express plus all the extra complications though then there's the second option and that is if you do remember one of these sellers in their details especially their email contact from Aliexpress and you can message them directly you may be able to sort out some kind of direct deal however there is risks that are now outside of that and that is you could pay them for the CPU and they could just simply never send it so I would recommend using a medium if you want to do that like PayPal where you get some kind of buyer protection against that happening though in relation to that second option will just say that Curt said it not me yeah if you want a 3,500 X just get his contact details and message him directly gift so you don't even get any seller protection they're getting back on beaten track if those first two options seem like a massive headache for you then of course there is the risin 5 2,600 going for $100 ship worldwide of course you get 6 extra threads but you do lose those advantages of the 3500 ex which come to the tune of precision boost 2 and a better IMC all of which I feel are a lot better and beginner-friendly especially if you are building your first PC though speaking of the 2600 we're gonna segue into the next part of this video and that is the risin 5 1600 AF which gamers Nexus did a great video breaking the CPU down and they basically found it to be very similar in performance to the risin 5 2600 so basically this chip is a pod that is designed on 12 nanometer plus as a SKU number indicates this has the same AF identifier as the risin 5 2600 however what I find really ought about this CPU is that it was made in 2019 and now looking at the batch numbers we can get an idea of what year as well as what week these CPUs are made in as well as where they're made and also diffused take for instance if we look at horizon 5 2600 this example we're pulling up here it was made in 2018 as we can see with the 18 and it was made in the 50 second week of the year so basically around Christmas time if we look at another example this Verizon 520 600 made in 2019 roughly somewhere in early June they're back to this risin 5 1600 af it was made in 2019 most likely late February and it was diffused in Texas it also comes included with the Wraith stealth cooler the same as the risin 5 2600 and so you're probably thinking now well Brian if this is virtually the same CPU as a risin 5 2600 why didn't IMD name it as such and now here's where we're going to dive into the world of pure speculation based on rumors that I've heard that when I add it all up it does make perfect sense so hear me out with this 1005 1600 it's got a different IMC that's an integrated memory controller compared to the horizon 526 hundred and now if AMD for example were to have a massive oversupply of these IMC's for the first generation risin they probably scratching their head and saying how we can then sell off all this oldest stock since this is where the rumor part comes in there was a rumor that AMD's integrated memory controllers at least on first and second-generation Rison was sourced by a third party so they had to then order a mouse them out of those IMC's put them on their CPUs and then sell them as a rise in cpu so if tech yes speculation is right then that means that we have a risin 5 1600 2600 hybrid that we can't legally call a 2600 due to the inferior IMC and that's where it comes in AMD can't market this as a risin 5 2600 for reasons being if people found out that they were using first gen parts in there then they would have a massive legal problem on their hands hence why it's safe to just call it a risin 5 1600 though again pure speculation and the reason I don't have one of these CPUs is that the seller on amazon.com doesn't ship to Australia and there's only one seller and you have to click on it and go to the different offers and then you'll find it there for $85 which is at its current price point the nominal value for money for a 6-quart 12 threaded processor with a budget dual channel memory kit in terms of buying the verizon v 1600 AF worldwide however I think this is a CPU that's currently only being sold in America because I can't find it for sale and the likes of eBay or Aliexpress and the original story of the CPU originated on reddit where a person I believe bought it from Micro Center or something like that and just notice with the CPU Z readings that it was saying 12 nanometer plus now of course if you can find the CPU for 85 bucks shipped worldwide then that would be one to definitely consider snapping up anyway guys I hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comments section below do you have rumors and speculations of your own or do you have hard evidence love reading your thoughts and opinions on both the 3,500 X and this new risin five 1600 AF without aside we do have the question of the day which comes from dalla Almeida and they asked my Toshiba laptop wanted to update to Windows 10 now it failed to complete the update and I cannot get out of the blue screen at all I have tried a YouTube and try to fix it but to no avail do you have a suggestion and basically the only two ways to kind of get around this would be if you want to get your original install back would be to try to repair it when you boot it up and you have to have the Windows 10 installation disk for that or USB key or of course you can try loading up a backup image of Windows 10 if you can't do either of those or they don't work then unfortunately you will want to get your important data off that drive and then reformat Windows 10 because yet having Windows 10 failed during the update process is really not a good thing where files can potentially become corrupted and that's it for today's video if you're still watching and you want to see the videos as soon as they dropped and you're not yet subscribed most hit that subscribe button ring that bell and then you'll get email notifications as soon as they drop here on the channel and also if you want some relative links for things we've talked about in today's video then I'll put the links in the description below for you guys and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you [Music] and the last batch number we're gonna read here is a risin 530 600 where the bf means that the CPU has a boyfriend and at the end day you can see that it was made in a sauce
