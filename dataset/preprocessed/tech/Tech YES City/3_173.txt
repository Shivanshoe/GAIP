welcome back to Tech YES City guys and today we're going to be talking about just my problems and openly what's been happening in the last few months actually and also in since the start of april and first of all we'll address the hair what's going on there it's uh actually there's nothing really to that except uh in japan when i first started working in japan from 2007 i was fine there was no real gray hairs and then after i started working at another job in 2010 i started just getting gray hairs it was such a weird thing it was only happening on the sides of my head not on the top of my head and so over the years the hair started getting sporadically and for some odd reason just only on the sides of my head gray and i thought it holds me looking back now i thought it had to do with just that area or something in my routine where i was living in this city called torgani in japan and i don't know what it exactly is but the oddest thing is is when my friend who i handed my job over to in 2016 when i came back to australia he started working at the same job and then started experiencing the exact same thing as me gray hairs on the side of his head so to this date there's something about living in japan living in torgane and working this job that makes the sides and only the sides of your head go gray and not the top so this hairstyle i just thought i'd give it a try where i used to get teased about it in exactly this fashion so i was like well if i'm getting teased about it then i wise we'll do it the hair is not the reason for the slow uploads lately there's actually two big problems that we're going to talk about and one of them actually affects tech directly it's pretty in-depth but let's get on with that after a quick sponsor spot if you want to get rid of this annoying activate windows message then today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 12 us dollars after you enter that coupon code bftyc you can cop yourself a legit single end user license today links in description below from the start of this month i heard some news where one of my sister's friends they got to travel overseas and the reason they got to travel was to see their dog and when i heard this i was uh i was happy for them but for me personally i was actually kind of hit me really hard because i've been applying in the last few months to travel to japan to see my son and i really want to see him i really miss him and i mean it's one thing to have skype conversations every day but it's a completely different thing to see your own son and so it's kind of been tough on me and i really miss him during this whole pandemic period and i've been applying and applying and i just keep getting rejected i mean for me personally it's hit me hard because there's nothing more important in this world than my family so that's been weighing on me but i mean the solution there i'm still researching if there's anything else i can do and i'll be trying again and again i'm just going to keep trying but besides that there's also been another thing that's been brewing behind the scenes and this affects everyone worldwide especially if you're low or middle-class income earners and that is the inflation and the levels of inflation that the governments are telling us worldwide and what we're actually seeing and first of all it started with tech and i mean back in september i realized that okay maybe this is just what they're saying there's going to be some bumps in the economy and when we saw gpu prices spike i thought that was just related to simply way more demand outstripping supply and gravis cards but as the months go on i'm starting to see prices of everything in general start to rise and it comes from say for instance you go down the supermarket mints has now gone from ten dollars to twelve dollars and then there's other things like my favorite loaf of bread has gone up uh ten percent and so you're starting to see in general inflation isn't low it's starting to go up across the board and so coming from a financial background especially university i thought i had the education to deal with that it was funny because when i went to university we didn't really learn about milton friedman and i started looking for answers and i was like okay what is going to happen in the future going forward and really what's happened in the past and i didn't really get the answers until i saw one of these brilliant videos that was uploaded about money creation and inflation and so in this video it just basically gave me the answers to all the questions i had over the last few months and it's funny because the only thing we learned about in university was that milton friedman was a herald of the stock market where i'm pretty sure the only literature i remember researching on him was is that ceo should do everything in the best interests of shareholders and we never really learned about so many of the other brilliant things and so over the past few months i've had to educate myself outside of what i learned at university because i feel what i learned at university wasn't sufficient enough to explain all the questions that i had on my mind and then i stumbled upon videos believe it or not from the 1970s from milton friedman and these were starting to give me so many more answers and they're starting to make more sense than anything made before and so we're seeing is at the moment a worldwide phenomenon of money creation and it's created from the central banks of those particular countries so in america you guys have the federal reserve in australia we have the reserve bank of australia and essentially it works in different ways if the particular bank is doing what's called modern monetary theory then they're going to be purchasing bonds directly from the government in australia they purchase them through the secondary market but in this grand scheme of things it's still the same thing money is being created and it's being created at an alarming rate and now all things equal when you create more money and you have the same amount of goods it's naturally just going to increase the prices of things because there's more money flowing around and though another thing i had to research was the price of certain goods so if i go down the supermarket there might be a basket of goods that haven't increased in price and i started researching more into this and why that was and what i found was they were using cheaper ingredients economies of scale and so that made the price stay the same but if it's cheaper to manufacture something then technically that is inflation too but now tying all this back and what is happening the government's generally after 1990 they wanted to aim for two to three percent inflation they thought this was a good level and it helps the prices remain relatively stable because what you have is when you have prices go too low for too long it does create unemployment when you have prices go too high for too long that also creates unemployment and the goals of central banks or at least what they tell us is that they want to keep unemployment as low as possible and so for me personally i'm having a very hard time believing this when everything around me is increasing at prices that i've never seen before take for instance house prices stock prices and now even prices of pc parts if we look at a 1660 super now which isn't such a desirable card that is now costing 600 aussie dollars if we look back in 2019 this card i believe you could be had for around 350 dollars so when we look at the cost of that that has increased nearly double and this is one thing that's not reflected in the uh cpi so now it comes down to what the central bank's telling us and what we should believe and i'm actually having a very hard time in the last few months especially believing what the central banks are telling us in terms of our inflation seems to remain low or it's only going to be transitory well if that's the case then interest rates should also be spiking transitory high as well but they're not they're remaining low the cost of borrowing is only 0.1 percent in other words if you're borrowing then you're winning and the more you borrow the more you win in this environment however me personally i'm more of a person who saves money and i've always throughout my life saved money and worked towards things and if i couldn't afford it i didn't buy it and i'm sure there's a lot of other people out there who are very similar in their nature so basically they're admitting that prices will be higher but they're not doing anything about it in other words they're not doing their job properly and it's actually quite a scary thing to think about especially if you're like me and you save money because if inflation does hit really high levels and you're saving money then the value of those savings erode very quickly in an inflationary environment in a deflationary environment you actually do well but there's really been no evidence of a deflationary environment people like to refer back to japan and say oh well japan had deflation i lived over in japan and i lived there for nine years roughly and i really didn't see increases in prices but also at the same time i didn't see a decrease in prices either things remained relatively the same and people were like well the governments over there did do quantitative easing and i tried to get my head around this and i was like well yes the governments did increase money supply in japan however what i did find out is that there was actually inflation in japan it just didn't come in the way you expected it and actually if we look at japan especially since the 1990s there have been a culture of just saving money and so there actually was inflation but it was inflation in the personal savings accounts of most japanese citizens and when we contrast that to the uk the usa and also australia three countries that i've seen firsthand i can see that the spending habits are very different in these countries than they are in japan and so when you've got a spending driven country and you're creating more money that's naturally going to lead to higher prices and that's what we're going to see i believe now going forward with pc prices across the board and so a lot of other tech channels i think are oblivious to what's going to happen we all think this is just a transitory thing but i actually don't think it is a transitory thing and i think going forward it's going to be awkward to make content when suddenly the prices of things go up and you're sitting here talking about oh well the price was this two years ago and now it's this what's going on when in reality it's just a completely normal thing in that the value of your dollar has just devalued that much that the prices of those pc parts are now higher anyhow guys going forward people will say well the crypto miners are the fault for the gpu rising prices i actually don't believe it's the crypto miners now in essence i just believe it's the central banks without this printed money we would have never have had the crypto miners to begin with and prices would be absolutely fine the crypto miners and the crypto itself is just a symptom of central banks and money creation that is my feeling on that now that i've actually researched it in depth and educated myself a lot more on the topic and so going forward i would highly recommend if you're like me converting some of that cash into real assets however just like last year i did know one thing and that was it was going to be a very rocky road and the roller coaster is going to have its ups and its downs but one thing to take away from the video is the outlook of price increases from money creation and that is when you start creating such a large amount of money it takes about six months for that money to start flowing through then after about two years that's when you start seeing the prices increase a lot and so in the next year if we do start seeing prices rise and they rise very quickly then that's when you'll know that it's too late anyways it's always good to have a plan just like my plan here to ask you guys to hit that like button for us and i'll be back in full force but i will say just like this question of the day here things are going to be a bit weird when it comes to making especially price performance tech videos where the price is just going to be i feel anything but normal now let's read this question here from muhammad they ask bro a 1650 for me is 700 usd how are you getting them for 150 and i think the question needs to be refrained to how was i getting them for 150 that's no longer a thing i'm not getting 1650 supers now for 150. they're all out of stock and the 1660 super is now in my country selling at brand new prices of 600 aussie dollars so don't worry mohammed you're not the only one that's seeing all these high prices for gpus right now but answer that question directly i'm not getting him for 150 anymore anyhow guys i'll catch you in another tech video very soon if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content i'm sure hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now [Music] you
