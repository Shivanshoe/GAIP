where is that USED Tech YES Bogan is coming back guys and we are looking for some used price performance mate that's the cue for me to go look at the deals. Where i've checked them out already and this month unexpectedly could be a decent month for used parts now it's the last day of the month and i don't have another chance to do this. This is the first parts hunt for 2021 let's make it a special and first of all check out what we've already booked up in terms of looking through good old gametree and facebook and uh on this month's agenda i was surprised we found a lot of graphics cards already believe it or not i thought graphics cards would just be all snapped up but at least in australia the whole cryptocurrency boom thing where i'm at hasn't really taken on too much which is a good thing because that means all the gpus aren't being bought up as much as they're being bought up for you guys over in the united states for example so put those used price performance capes on and don't worry i haven't gone anywhere of course we're going to keep looking for deals this is a tech gear city and strap on in and let's get those deals if you've got this annoying windows needs activation message and you want to get rid of it for cheap then today's video sponsors cd keys has you covered for as little as 14 bucks after you use the coupon code pftyc you can get yourself a legit single end user windows 10 license today links in description below so after searching high and low and looking at what's been going on in the market recently i have to actually up my prices and bids on uh used gravis cards by around 20 to 25 percent that's the buffer i have to give here and that's mainly because even if i look on the retail sites for new graphics cards say for instance a gtx 1650 super that's gone up pretty much in accordance by the same amount of value so you have to look at the new market and also vice versa as well look at the used market and get the indicators from both to see where the pricing should be at and at the moment it looks like used graphics cards unfortunately after bid about 20 to 25 percent more than what i'm used to bidding on these gpus so first up here uh messages that have come back to me and accepted my offers that means we're going to be going and picking up these gpus very soon as well as some other parts we've got two gtx 980s here these are the azus strix models and we scored well we're going to score them for 450 aussie dollars for two of them so that's 225 each they look like they're in really good condition and then we've got a ryzen 3 3 100 they're asking 130 aussie but i put in just a little ten dollar shave here and we're going to get this for a 120 aussie that comes with a cooler it's pretty much brand new so when you can get something at 75 percent of retail for that's the cheapest price you can find it for brand new then that's an easy deal on new parts and they've also got the warranty paper as well like the receipt so no risk at all with that deal and then we've got an interesting one where there's 32 gigabytes of ddr4 ecc now the reason this is cheap is because i'm guessing a lot of people don't know what to do with ecc even if it's registered or not especially on the ddr4 side but because we've worked with those x99 one and boards in the past we know that we can get the cheap ddr4 and use it and then smash up the spec sheet especially if we're going to flip a gaming pc we've now got 16 gigabytes for instance for only 40 aussie dollars so they're asking 90 i shaved off 10 they've accepted we're gonna go pick that up and then looking through a different listing i saw there's a few different parts for sale gtx 1080 for 500 aussie dollars i'm kind of going to give that a miss but within that listing there was a gtx 770 which i've offered 50 aussie dollars for and they've accepted that so that looks like it's a pretty good price for that point and then the last gpu that i've put an offer in for and they've accepted is an r9270 for 50. so these are the deals we're going to jump into the yes mobile pickup very soon but we've also in that meantime put in a heap of different offers for things like gtx 1066 gigabytes i'm throwing down about 200 aussie dollars a piece for those i found some gtx 1070 ti's i've also found an i7 uh desktop a hp desktop that looks like it's pretty good i could repurpose this and maybe find like a gtx 1080 ti and i'd have a good flip on my hands but i've got to wait for all those people to get back to me so let's go hit the road and also go see les on the way up because he's close to all these deals and see what we can muster up here for this used pc parts hunt um [Music] to pick up on the way but it should be around 3 30 to 4. all right cool guys i'll see you soon brother [Music] and relax [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we just picked up the two gtx 980s these look like they were the zeus strix versions as well so generally when it comes to strix you pay a little bit of a premium and again as i said before in the intro we're paying about 20 to 25 more for gpus this month generally so i've picked up 980s in the past for around 180 aussie so me paying about 225 are popped considering there's two of them and they look like they're a really good nick i'm pretty happy with that deal i mean it's the max i would pay for a 980 so fact that it was a zeus strix and we hit that ballpark with two of them i'm pretty happy next up though we already stopped off at leisure's as well and we paid a little bit over half a g for five monitors and i think we got seven pcs like these are the bottom of the barrel sort of entry-level gaming pcs that we chuck graphics cards into so we did pretty well with that score but we'll show that when we get back to the studio and sort of do a recap after we've picked up some deals next up now we're going to go pick up this r72 i think it's r7 270 and that's around the corner for 50 aussie dollars so we're going to get that now then we've got some other deals and also gtx 1060 has come back to us gtx 1060 has come back and they said they would take 200 aussies as well for that 1066 gigabytes so we've got some good deals man we just got to go get them now let's continue [Music] oh on 16. [Music] [Music] [Applause] so we just finished up with all the deals here except a gtx 1060 has come up a six gigabytes so we're gonna go pick that up now hopefully that all pulls through 200 aussie dollars i'm okay with that we picked up the after leisures in the 980s we then went and got the r9 or r7270 and we also picked up the ram the 32 gigabytes of vcc memory and the ryzen 3 30 100 so we're in a pretty good spot right now we've got a heap of good deals in the trunk and this last deal this is weird you're probably like brown why are you filming in like a kind of like a bush here uh because it's australia besides australia and the bushland we're at this place and the guy sent me to his address and then i i messaged him and then knocked on his door and i've been waiting for it for about 15 minutes now the guy has not replied he has um not answered his door and there are cars like parked at the place so i mean i hope everything's okay in this place but sometimes that happens but the good thing is is that we've done the deals so that they're all close like all the clusters if a deal is like one and a half hours away from all the other deals i generally don't bother with it because when you're on the road you do run the risk of someone uh ghosting you effectively and then the second time i've been ghosted on a deal so it does happen you get have you ever i don't know if you guys have ever seen it back in the day we used to get our push bikes and we'd roll them down and then we'd jump off the bike and it keep going that was called a ghosty maybe i don't know maybe the guy who set this deal up just around the corner on a hill and he's got his push bike ready to go who knows let's go get this gtx 1060 though and uh see what's up and we just picked up our last deal right now this is eight gigabytes of memory ddr4 we got this for 30 and you're like where's the 1060 i'm thinking that's the same question i got asking myself where is the 1060. the guy he messaged me and he's like oh i'll let you know when i'm free and i'm kind of like well man i'm up that way like about 50 minutes from my home and you're around that area sorry just got to reopen the door and get the light back on if we're if we're up that way then uh it's kind of good if i just get the part while i'm up there so we'll have to miss that deal because i'm not driving all the way back up there to get that deal again but this uh this guy messaged me back on the way home we got the eight gigabytes of ddr4 for cheap chuck that in the kitty and that pretty much marks it for all the parts here that have picked up so far let's get home to the tech studio and unpack all this stuff right here and now we are finally back here at the tech yes studio and we've got the uh first deal uh of course we've got the lead stuff we'll get onto that last but we got the first deal we picked up here was the gtx 980 strix editions they they're looking mighty fine great gpu i'm definitely gonna get some mileage out of those and then after that we got an r7 uh r9 i think it's like r92 not 270 and then they called the r7 370. so yeah it went down from like a nine to a seven even though it's pretty much the same gpu that's why i think i get confused with that but there's three graphics cards that we desperately need i did have uh it was funny on the way back home driving back home someone messaged me saying oh i've got the tent because i i actually inquired about quite a few graphics cards this parts hunt i sent out a heap of feelers and so two people will sell me a gtx 1066 gigabyte one guy just doesn't know when he's going to be home yet and it's like already 8 30 p.m on sunday night and then the other guy messaged me back on like i was already practically home and he's up in brisbane as well so there's two deals that are about an hour drive from me for gtx 1060s and i'm like well i wish they messaged me earlier because i would have there would have been two 1060s sitting here as well which i i do need i'm going to be honest i do need those 1060s but we got this right here ryzen 3 3100 always good when you can pick up a brand new cpu at 75 percent of retail so that was a good pick up we had the ddr4 memory 32 gigabytes this stuff ecc so 80 aussie dollars that is a bargain considering we're getting eight gigabytes at 20 dollars a stick then we got an eight gigabyte stick here that was the last deal we picked up at 30 dollars a stick and the person who met me for the 32 gigabytes of ddr4 ecc they were like they gave me some ddr3 they're like you need some ddr3 i'm like yeah i mean sure thanks man and uh they said they'll like they watch the channel they're like when's the next parts hunt coming out man and i just my response was this is the next parts hunt so we got that all there on the table and this one right here les he threw that in as a sweetener with one of the pcs so we'll get onto these pc cases soon because uh we got this one here les gave this to us for free because i did have a faulty z210 that i just could not get going the other month and he's like look just have it on the house so les does guarantee his stuff i really like that so that one was kind of even though it was free it was kind of we paid for it last month then we've got these right here these dell precisions they've got like first gen four cores in them and he's like i asked les how much he wants he was like 80 a pop i'm like man i ain't paying 80 for a first gen like no way so we got these for 50 a pop and he did chuck in 12 gigabytes of ram so i am going a little bit stricter on first gen stuff because again when i sell this stuff i'm then guaranteeing it and i got to carry the risk that and i've got to give a guarantee so 50 of pop there's that's factoring in that this stuff is old and if i'm getting mileage out of it then i've got to take that risk on so that's where the premium should i say the lack of premium for these first gens is coming in and i'm picking them up for cheap so i mean in terms of what they've got inside they've got like x 50 x 55 50s and stuff like that i'm pretty sure they're just four core four threaded cpus um and then he has chucked in i did make sure he chucked in 12 gigabytes of ram because that's the deal sealer for me if i'm selling a budget rig and it's got 12 gigabytes of ram it's good to go then that motherboard that we saw before that z270 and that power supply the 650 watt he chucked them in with this deal here for a hundred dollars because i said because it said they're right up on the top of the deal intel mobo i'm just like dude believe it or not these 3rd gen and 2nd gen intel motherboards especially if they're h61s they carry a lot of risk in that they might not work with newer gpus and because the intel biases are now down from the website it's almost next it's really hard to get these things to update to the real latest bios to support gpus that work outside that secure boot so i told him look man this could be a real risk and a real pain that i'm not willing to take in that if i'm paying 100 bucks i want some something else thrown in with that so he said all right sure and the power supply inside this thing is also garbage by the way it's like some budget 300 watt power supply that does doesn't have anything so the best i can do with this is like literally chuck in a gtx 1050 which i don't have and uh make a gaming pc out of that so there was that one that was the sort of weird one out of the bunch whereas opposed to these dells they're actually pretty solid in that they've got good power supplies and you can chuck in graphics cards and you're good to go this one right here these were the other 200 options they've got a zeus motherboard so as soon as i saw that i was like all right you get your 100 bucks for the whole deal here so they got half decent cases i'll be able to give these a bit of tech yes loving clean them up they got third gen i5 8 gig of ram we just need to chuck the gravis cards inside and we are good to go and then last up here we've got the xeon uh so the person i picked up the ecc memory off he's like look i'm going to be honest with you brian i pulled all this out of like a server rack uh 32 gigabytes i'm like yeah that's cool man like you got to do what you got to do you know what i mean if you got to get that hustle and you got to get that hustle so um i just told him i was like well he's like look do you want the rest of this thing there's a xeon in there i'm like okay there's a xeon in there so it's a v6 zeon and as soon as i saw that i was like yes please i will take that now funny thing is though if you want to get this working in the gaming pc i'm pretty sure with the v6 xeons you need a special motherboard to get that working it won't work on a retail motherboard so we're going to pop that open and then uh find out what's inside what actual xeons inside and what motherboard we need for that and see if we can do anything with that and then the last piece of the puzzle was the monitors here and we got five of these in total for a hundred and seventy dollars so two of them are 24 inches or 23 inches and then three of them are 22 inches so all in all i have picked up stuff i need graphics cards though still being the main problem we're going to show you guys a quick tally but i think what we'll do is we'll quickly pull out the cpu in here so you guys probably as curious as i am to find out what's inside this thing [Music] we just got an e3 1220 v5 which i'm pretty sure is a 6400 equivalent i5 6400 equivalent we've got a motherboard a power supply and a pci express slot here 16x is anyone thinking what i'm thinking we have just stumbled onto the server rack gaming pc we are going to be alleviating people's price performance problems in 2021 and after all is said and done we've got a grand tally here of 1350 aussie dollars coming in at close to 1k usd and we've got potentially uh seven gaming pcs we've got three graphics cards so in order to fill the quota of these gaming pcs we're gonna need another three or four graphics cards so graphics cards obviously the biggest thing going forward looking for them any way you can is going to be one thing that i'm going to be on the lookout especially when i put the gaming pcs together but some of the other deals that we got that zeon i don't know that got given to me with the ecc memory that whole rack the person was cleaning it out and they said look i got this rack that i'm actually gonna chuck out do you want it and i'm like as soon as i see like anything soon as i hear the word zeon curiosity's like is dinging off the charts ding ding ding and i'm pretty much all right let's take this home and now we've got it here i'm pretty certain that we can do something in the realm of a gaming pc on a server rack so wait for it fellas wait for it it's coming that's my most exciting pickup which came from just it's so weird this is the weird thing about part science and this is why i think in ways it's so exciting every month you just don't know what's going to happen you put in a bid for some ecc ddr4 memory and you end up coming home with a whole server rack with a 4 core xeon inside and the memory and some ddr3 memory as well i absolutely love this stuff like it's just cool and then you're sitting there and you're scratching your head you're like what can i do with this and then it all comes together like magic and i can already see the video the video is going to be epic i can really see that i'm going to see the title the thumbnail and i can already see the performance which is gonna be pretty damn good too we just gotta find the graphics card for it the right one so i'm gonna be on the lookout for that so stay tuned for that video but other than that the gtx 980s the strix editions i'm happy to drop a bit more on them because uh i think anywhere in the world people go crazy for strict graphics cards they just do i found whenever i've sold a pc with a zeus strix i can not only market that but people see that and they're like if they show their friend the house friend's like oh man it's got this restriction you got to get that so there's that i mean to be honest the cards are really zeus strix models are really good so it all works hand in hand to make an epic gaming pc but other than that the z270 that les chucked in with another uh pc that intel mobo like 6th and 7th gen at the moment is really off my radar so like i'll probably just even just try and flip that motherboard itself for 50 bucks or something like that because i'm looking around for i7 7700s and 6700s and i've harped on about this in the last few months of last year and i've spoken about why i just don't like that generation because you've got the i3 10 100 f now much better value 119 and i guarantee you in australia i'm not going to find an i7 6700 or 7 700 for anywhere near 119 bucks it's just not going to happen so we're getting better value on the new market than the used market in that regard so what you're going to see here on tech yeah city going into 2021 is all these different matters where we're going through and we're combing the used market and seeing where the value lies and it's most likely going to be with things like zeons that people don't pay attention to on the mainstream but then when you say that in an ad you're like this is equivalent to such and such pc and cpu in performance and then you show them the fps i'm pretty sure they're like okay well i can save a couple of hundred bucks going with this guy's gaming pc why not so i think going in this year i'm going to be trying some different kind of curveball stuff because i think in ways i really enjoy it too that's the main thing like i love doing this stuff in that i like finding all these new little cheap tricks and hacks to get really good price performance and i hope this year that you guys are on board more than ever due to covert and raising prices of a lot of different pc parts so that's one thing i think the covered stuff has given me a challenge like no other now and when you when you get the yes down and you're like here's a challenge man i'm gonna be like well let's do this anyway guys i hope you enjoyed this month's part hunt the tally do let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite deal i uh i wasn't like honestly i'm a little bit upset that i missed out on those 1060s i mean i didn't miss out on them i can go jump in the car and go waste a heat more time late at night and go pick them up but it's just like i mean even then it's just like damn but in ways it's like why did it have to be the two gpus and even then the other guy that stood me up in the other place that we were filming at before that was a gtx 770 as well so there's like three gpus that i missed out on that i can get but i don't know anyway but that guy that also the guy stood me up just never messaged me back as well so that one's pretty funny anyway but i just the graphics cards man the graphics cards but there is a solution that i am in the works on in terms of getting a bulk buy of rx 570s i'm working on that right now it's going to be an overseas sort of in a massive box kind of thing so hopefully that comes through because i need gpus more than ever and i think everyone else if they're flipping pcs you guys out there as well you're like i need more gpus than ever too everyone needs gravis cards right now so please please in this way i think we're going to update that status please ethereum crash pray to your crypto gods that we get a crash from ethereum that'll be the one thing that'll send the gpus going down down down so one can only pray ethereum crash bring it on bring it on and with that aside guys i hope you enjoyed this month's used parts hunt for the first kickstarter of 2021. if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know down below if you've got any questions because we got the question of the day which comes from sfchad1 and they ask hi brian uh what would be a good cheap motherboard to overclock the x5670 on and a good motherboard for that is i personally prefer on the x58 and i've said this a lot in the past as well a good cheap one would be like the p6t from azus entry-level azuz board but still very solid for overclocking and the xeons do work on that board i'm all for zeus boards when it comes to x58 and overclocking they're just real good i've had no problems getting the levels that i want to get and i've had no like inconsistencies because i found on some other motherboards things can be so finicky and you're like you lock in something on even like for instance i've used the gigabyte x58 and i have all these settings in my head and i know they work and i go to another gigabyte motherboard and it just doesn't work that was on x58 so x x 58 zeus all the way uh deluxe is probably one of my favorite in terms of price performance and going a little bit more than the p6t but the p6t is definitely like that budget azus board on x58 that's gonna give you some good gains anyway hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in the next one if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then you know what to do hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in another one very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
