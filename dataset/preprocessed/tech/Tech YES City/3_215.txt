with all the rtx 3090 3080 3070 and 3060 ti's hitting the streets one must wonder which model do i pick and zotac have decided to come to the market with the twin edge oc rtx 3070. now this comes in two different flavors we've got a dark gray aesthetic and the one which is on this box right here which is an all-white aesthetic now we've got a 90 mil fan and a hundred mil fan and they are independently controlled meaning one can switch off and the other can keep going if that certain part of the card is hotter than the other side or vice versa and they can run at different speeds however this card weighing in at 800 grams is that going to pose a problem in terms of its cooling and temperatures they're coming in 200 grams lighter than the rtx 3070 founders is that going to pose a problem for temperatures and ultimately noise and here's where the auto fan profile surprised me a lot coming in with 70 degrees in a 28 degree ambient at 72 percent fan speeds now if you manually set it to 60 percent it does go up to around 74 degrees and it does drop the noise considerably down to around 34 decibels well we're getting around 39 decibels and this thing delta adjusting it drops it down to around 66 degrees and then 80 percent and 100 do ramp up the noise a lot but the temperatures do start to go down quite a lot as well so the cooling on this unit is very impressive it also comes in with a shorter total length and i'll pull the dimensions up on the screen for you guys than the founders edition as well as being a true two slot cooler so those who want to mount it in a mini itx build if they can fit the width that is which is a roughly 140 mil then they will be having a smaller card that will give them some good temperatures in a small form factor solution they're going on to the gaming benchmarks now where we'll go through 1080p 1440p and 4k numbers in a variety of titles here where first up is f1 2020 this card does perform very close to that of the founders they're pretty much neck and neck and a lot of these benchmarks and then moving on to cyberpunk 2077 which is a new game that we're adding into the mix here being one of the pretty much i think it is the best selling pc title of all time already making it just a huge game though it is very i mean i say this without ease very demanding on hardware especially the gpu so the 3070 will do a good job and i'll pull up some dlss and ray tracing benchmarks on top of that just to show you guys that you can use ray tracing in this game but you will want to turn on the dlss setting at least the quality and i found that the quality setting and i'll pull up a side-by-side comparison here i found the quality setting versus having dlss off you lose a lot of fps but if you have dlss on you don't lose pretty much any quality it's very unnoticeable especially at higher resolutions though continue on with the benchmarks we're going to pull up some different games here and just talk about this card in general and we're also getting a good under volts out of this card which if you do want to undervolt this card you're going to lose roughly i think i measured at a 1 or 2 fps at 4k so you're losing a couple of percent but you're dropping down the power consumption considerably and you're getting much better temperatures even on the auto fan profiles out of the box going from 70 down to all the way down to like 60 in a 28c ambient environment now the last test we're going to throw up here is the overclocks for you guys where i was surprised this card in particular was doing very well with overclocking just like the 3060 ti i think some of the manufacturers out there starting to crack on that you can get very efficient overclocks out of the 3060 ti and also the 3070 where here we're only using roughly an extra 20 watts but we're making some pretty big gains in the terms of the twin hoc so the gaming benchmarks show that this car despite its small size actually performed very well so good job to zotac here where i believe this card was performing better in terms of relative terms versus their trinity edition 3080 even though it's a 3018 it does have more power consumption out of the get-go this card here for a 30-70 with its small form factor was performing very well though one thing we're going to look at now is the price because this is going to be a big one if you guys are in the market for something like how much does this thing cost here's where i found two different editions of this particular card one's the twin edge regular and then this one here is the twin edge oc though from what i can tell the white edition only comes in with the oc model and that's going to set you back in australia roughly a thousand and thirty dollars and then in america around 560 us i believe the base model non-oc is coming in at roughly msrp and that in australia that's around 950 aussie dollars and you're probably wondering with the stock availability is this a card that i can actually buy and this is what i said at zotac before i reviewed this guy i said look this card's not gonna be in stock don't bother sending it through and so i'm seeing that it is available in australia and in america they told me that they're making sure that shipments are running because demand is huge for the 3070s and 3080s in america at this current point in time so the stock issue they're working on getting these cards out this model in particular is a very nice implementation it's got the white back plate the white fans the white ascetic and you've got good speeds out of the box but the final things to go over is we've got three display port outs and an hdmi 2.1 and the side light here the zotac gaming that lights up white out of the box and with all those numbers out of the way it's finally time to wrap things up for the twin edge oc and i like what zotac have done here this is a really good model that impressed me more so than the trinity edition did where i thought that was coming out as just a run-of-the-mill 3080. this one right here has the small form factor it's got the white aesthetic it's got the good speeds out of the box got the low noise and that surprised me as i said in the intro coming with the 800 gram weight i didn't expect it to perform as well as it did but it did a very good job so if you're looking for something that's an alternative to a founder's edition then this is definitely going to do the job it does require two 8-pin connectors doesn't use the standard nvidia 12 pin which is the founders cards are the only ones that do that 12-pin at this current point of time at least the cards that come through here but they include an adapter for that but one more cool thing is the power connectors are recessed so if you're doing a mini itx build then you can have the power connectors coming in and that will make cable management a lot easier too and to answer the question directly of should you buy the twin edge oc if you're looking for the white aesthetic this is definitely a good option if you want to save a bit of money and you are comfortable with afterburner whether it's under vaulting or manually overclocking i would save some money and go for the non-oc and the model itself solid model solid implementation and if you guys enjoyed today's review then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comments section below what you think of this model right here is it enough to convince you or enough to not love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from damien and they ask so straight from the box won't run is another cpu needed to flash the bios and they're talking about the a320 video we did with the ryzen 5 3600 unfortunately if the 3600 doesn't work out of the box with the a320 then you will have to use another cpu to flash that a320 so for me personally i have an a ryzen 3 1200 on hand and i use that to flash all the older motherboards and best bet it would be to go to a computer store and just say hey could i quickly do a flash or i think you can contact amd for one of those cpus really like i think it's like they gave a cpu that could flash biases to people if they couldn't flash so amd might loan your cpu depending on where you live but the best thing to do is always if you don't want these hassles out of the box is to check and make sure that ryzen 3000 ready sticker is on that a320 motherboard box before you buy it and in due time this will also become relevant to ryzen 5000 series cpus so i hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that like button and ring that bell and i'll catch you in another one very soon peace out for now bye you
