now we've finished these six builds I can tell you how much I'm gonna price each of them up for and I know what those price points that I'm gonna be winning because I put them together for less than that so we've got 380 at the back 350 moving on here for 20 and move over here at 620 over here at 950 and then lastly at the back 750 so in total the profit is going to be I would guesstimate in the air welcome back to takea city and over the last month for some reason in the last month you guys have been asking me quite a lot whether it be through DMS or comments about how much I sell my builds for and what goes through my thought process when I'm going to sell those bills so today we're going to actually make a two-part series because it's important to break away the objective from the subjective so part 1 is going to be all the objective side of it which really is akin to some of the things you see on camera as well as some of the things you don't see on camera to then part 2 I'll be going over all the personal stuff and my own finishing touches when it comes to selling pcs like this now in the last day I've put together 6 of these builds and they really when it comes down to it all relate to different price points and that's something we're going to go into straight away with the objective side of things so the first thing and one of the most important things in marketing is the willingness to pay and that is a buyers willingness to pay a certain amount of money for a product and this relates to pretty much every single product sold on every single shelf all around the world and not just in relation to tech but also in relation to things like cars homes and let's break down an example with a cart first we've got for instance a hundred percent of people are willing to pay zero dollars for a car then we move up and we might have say fifty percent of people are willing to pay $10,000 for a car but you'll start to see as we go higher in price that amount of people that are willing to pay for that particular product start to diminish and so with that what you're going to see is all you should see is an abundance of ads in relation to those price points so now relating this to a gaming PC we can say that for instance 80 percent of the market is willing to pay $300 for a gaming PC when we step it up to say $600 we may have a drop-off of now thirty percent so fifty percent of our total market out there looking for a gaming PC aren't willing to pay any more than six hundred dollars we stepped up to a thousand dollars we now only have maybe thirty percent of the people in the motor for a gaming PC willing to pay that money so for me now I can jump on gumtree and Facebook the places will the two most popular places where these gaming PC's are listed and I can then look for cracks in the market and so this is me now using the objective knowledge that I've learned and relating it to the actual local markets and testing things out and so now when I went through the intro you'll notice that I built up quite a few low in pcs because that was me scanning the market and saying that wasn't a whole lot of low-end pcs in relation to say the 506th price points on gaming pcs however we can then use this in the inverse scenario and that is for instance if we look at the high end and there's absolutely nothing for sale there is still going to be a demand whether it be say for instance is only 3% of the population looking to pay $3,000 for a gaming PC or more that population and market is still there and if there's not any single ads available then making one available is always a good thing to do they're coming back down to this willingness to pay this is where things start to get even trickier because at this $300 price point we now have different types of people who are willing to pay for different types of specs so we may have say for instance 80 percent that we said before they may be willing to pay $300 for a gaming PC with say an i7 and a gtx 750ti but they might not be willing to pay $300 for instance for say an FX 4300 and a GTX 650 Ti boost so just because they're gaming pcs at $300 it doesn't mean everyone's willing to pay $300 for that particular price point they're willing to pay for I would say more so a particular type of spec within that price point so relating this to my example here we've got a PC with a z2 70 motherboard it's a g40 560 gtx 750ti 120 gb SSD one terabyte hard drive someone that might be willing to pay $400 for this and I'm selling it for 350 dollars and now they're going to see that and they under jump on it and they're gonna be like wow I was prepared to pay $50 more so thereby a surplus is now $50 and if they get home and they enjoy it it runs their game smoothly they're gonna be over the moon because they in their minds got a bargain for this PC even though I'm still making profit on it if you consistently give your buyers or buy a surplus that's when you're going to get good feedback and you're gonna get a good repertoire out there in the community where they're gonna then tow their friends hey go check out this guy he offers better value than the competitors and now I get asked this a lot in the discord people say okay how much should I sell this PC for am i selling it to cheap etc etc and the answer is if you're making a comfortable profit off your build say for instance you're making $100 off a PC that he's selling for $400 having regrets about oh I maybe should have charged $50 more you shouldn't really be having any of those regrets because you're offering a better buy a surplus if you can keep getting the deals that you're getting or you can keep producing peace that's gonna be one happy customer that then he's going to pass on that feedback to a friend and help grow your sales in the long term though reverting this now back to willingness to pay and also the buyer thresholds these are two things that go hand in hand there is ways that you will see over time with marketing and especially with buyer threshold that sellers used to essentially trick customers into thinking that things are cheaper than they otherwise are say for instance the good old PC for 199 dollars that person may be willing to pay a hundred and ninety dollars for a PC or 150 dollars and suddenly that $1.99 now gets their attention because it's in the same ballpark as what they were thinking if we had for instance $200 on that PC it may be okay straight away that's out of my reach because of that first two in that price tag and now graphics card manufacturers CPU manufacturers they do this all the time there's always gonna be a 99 on the end instead of a $300 for example so you're gonna see a graphics card coming out it's gonna be $2.99 instead of $300 and that's going to be a strategic thing to try and suck in all those people that had to buy a threshold in the $200 field and didn't want to step it up to $300 so now with all this theory out of the way and all these willingness to pay for particular specs in particular price points you guys may be wondering what specs should I be buying at what price points should I be getting an i7 or an i5 or what's the best GPU to get right now for flippin pcs and this is where that willingness to pay on a PC itself relates exactly to the parts that we're putting in because we cannot assume that the majority of consumers are stupid we have to assume the opposite and that is when a consumer is looking for a PC at that particular price point they're then going to break down that spec list and go check out those individual specs and see how much they cost individually and so here's where we look at market prices for instance an i7 $2,600 us or it might be going for 70 AUD now if I can go get that seven 2600 440 Ozzy dollars for example I've then got a deal compared to the market rate and when I go to put that in a PC for the final flip I've then made more perceived value because I got that deal to begin with initially and this is where it all relates back when you watch my parts hunts every month or my mid month hustles or whatever I'm doing if I'm overseas getting parts I always stick to the discipline of getting a good deal and so I've got a price threshold that I'm willing to pay personally it applies to me a hundred percent to in that I'm doing the same thing when I'm going out and buying PC parts though too quickly interlude and give you guys a personal tip that would be to go buy the cheapest i7 you could find or of course go out and buy a cheap second third or fourth gen om system something like a lenovo a Cedella HP and then go get a cheap graphics card like an RX 470 or RX 570 put together that gaming PC with a decent case and a bit of bling and then you get yourself a decent profit margin there moving on to the next important thing when it comes to a gaming PC we have to look at the most important components in a gaming PC itself and that would by far be the two most important component would be the GPU and the CPU I would argue that the GPU is slightly more important than the CPU in that I've seen really old CPUs actually sell really well with systems because they've got a good graphics card but I haven't seen the opposite in that you can have a really nice CPU and say for instance a GT 1030 and that system will still sell pretty well it generally won't so looking at what I've experienced and coupling that with the fact that I think the GPU is the most important component you should therefore be spending the most amount of money when it comes to putting these systems together on the graphics card so now we've identified the most important part for a gaming PC and in this video and even in the next part of this video we're not going to go into the editing for instance workstation pcs because the market for them on nowhere near as big and I generally don't delve into that so I don't have really any experience but I'd argue on that side of things the CPU the memory and the SSD would more important as opposed to this side on the gaming PC the graphics card is the most important thing however graphics cards aside we've got the price points of those GPUs and what they're sold at which will dictate where our gaming PC prices should be sold at as well for instance in Australia we can get an RX 570 brand new off the shelves for a hundred and $69 dollars if we look at an Aliexpress price for that same GPU we can get this for under $100 dollars so if we go by that GPU we're technically and putting it in the gaming PC we're then creating about $70 of perceived value assuming that the person buying it doesn't care a whole lot whether this part is used versus new and of course there are going to be consumers that really do care and of course those consumers aren't going to be even in the market for a used gaming PC on Facebook or Gumtree there with this price point of this rx 570 to one hundred and sixty nine dollars you dollars we can then say okay the maximum threshold for a gaming PC with these components is going to be say 700 ozzie dollars anymore people want a hiring gravis card whether it be a gtx 1060 or they're going to want to go for an RS 580 or RS 590 so we've got a maximum and threshold that's related to the actual cost of the GPU core component because that is the most important spec so do keep that in mind when you're going to be selling a PC always make sure that your graphics card is matching the price point of those pcs and how much they solve for and you're probably gonna round and say well how do I know how much to sell that for with that particular GPU well that's of course a great question and I'm glad you asked it because here's where we can go on our local competitive marketplace and check out the going rate and if we can't get any prices that are accurate from there we've been going to eBay in our country and go check on completed listings and see what gaming pcs have sold with those particular graphics cards so there are some hints for you guys about how you can establish different price points in different pcs for different specs always check out what their going rate is especially if it's a completed listing on eBay because that again has tapped into what someone was willing to pay for those components and now it's time to talk about the last component that applies to deal hunting and getting everything involved in making the final PC so possible and is market efficiency and so any market that's really efficient will basically over time make the opportunities for arbitrage become less and less and what would be considered arbitrage in deal hunting would of course be picking up an extraordinarily good deal compared to the going rate of that price now when I picked up my RX 570s and I picked up a lot of them for 60 LZ dollars a pop and there's even our x58 he's thrown in there that was a really good deal according to market efficiency that shouldn't really happen a whole lot and to be fair I was really quick to jump on that deal that was within I think it was an hour of listing I jumped on that and it just so happened to be that the person had a lot more than what they're offering initially in the listing and so I went and cleaned that up and here's the most important thing about market efficiency really when it comes down to it relates back to supply and demand and if we look at the a market of use PC Potts three years ago when I came back from Japan there was so many good deals I could just go out on gumtree on any day of the week and find a decent price on a GP or a oh em for example but fast forward three years later we've got a lot more players in the field at the start of 2020 this market is pretty much saturated in that the demand for these used parts has increased substantially but we've got to assume since the population of the Gold Coast where I'm at the population of Brisbane that's the city up north that's remained constant therefore supply is going to remain constant so the market has become more efficient over time in that we're seeing these valuations on PC prices the moment they're under a certain price someone's gonna snap that up a lot quicker because there's those other players in the game that are constantly looking for PC parts every day of the week and now there's two things that can come out of this and basically if deals in your area have started drying up that basically is an indicator that markets have become more efficient it's not really anything to worry about except the fact that you're not going to be getting as many deals as you used to get though on top of that it still doesn't eliminate the fact that you can still get good deals you just have to be more on the ball and the good thing is with more components coming out like rising CPUs other CPUs from Intel like the 9400 and stuff like that those cpu is coming out with low price points has brought down the prices of used parts in that there's now a bigger pool of deals to be had though the same goes for GPUs that we will talk about that more in depth in part two because there is a lot more than meets the eye in relation to this field and now relating all that information back now to the conclusion of today's video how much should you price the PC for that is basically all related to how much you're paying for the deals to begin with and of course it's related to what pcs are selling out there on the market remember the born lessons of today's videos is the willingness to pay how much are people willing to pay for that particular spec of PC if you find that out and you're able to pick up those deals cheap enough then you can get yourself some decent profits and so now the six pcs I put here on the table are all related in terms of their price point to the graphics card being used as well as the fact that I got really good deals on SSDs and one terabyte hard drives which in itself does add value to the flip remember anytime you're putting in a highest spec component compared to the competitors you are adding value at that particular price point another thing on top of all of that if you guys watch my deals hunts you'll see there's actually a lot more than meets the eye yes I pretend to be kurt the bogan and yes I am a bit blase when I told you people liked less but really when it comes down to I stick to a strict discipline on what parts I'm buying but you may also notice when I'm buying PC parts I'm in the market for practically everything I'm not looking at one particular price point or one particular part I'm always looking at different price points and different deals because over time if I'm collectively getting good deals on all different price ranges then I'm gonna be collectively making more money and so here's where it gets down to the final point of how much should you charge for a build and the simple answer to that is do your own research I can't stress this enough me I do my research in my local market here on the Gold Coast which does service other parts around it because people are willing to drive an hour plus to pick up a gaming PC however what's going on and even and the likes of Melbourne or Adelaide for example I don't have any idea because I'm not really servicing those markets so wherever you are in the world research your market know what the going rate for the pcs are and then you'll be able to make a bit of profit considering you get the good deals to begin with then with that aside if you guys are wondering how much I'm charging for these six bills I recently put together and what components are inside I'm gonna be going way more in depth into that in part two because there's a lot more than meets the eye that's the basic theory in part one here today but when it comes to enthusiasts PC gaming desktops there is more to know than meets the eye for instance we've got the i7 phenomenon we've got the Nvidia phenomena these are things that exist when you're trying to sell a piece in you've got to know how to account for those things so in part 2 we're gonna go a lot more down subjective Avenue but with that aside I hope you guys enjoyed today's video of the objective nature of PC hustling if you did then be sure to hit that like button also if you've got any questions or comments or any theories or anything that you think I missed out on be sure to drop a comment in the comment section below because I love reading those thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of thoughts and opinions we've got zu path swag and exclamation mark and they say eh what's doin Tech yes I'm in Brisbane and I've got 250 $300 max what's the main cards or CPUs or PC gear I should be trying to aim for - flip so this came in the last seven hours and basically it depends if you're looking to get the whole bill done for 300 bucks if so you're definitely best off trying to go for like an OEM a case pounce playing an RX 570 then maybe trying to flip that for 450 or something like that that would be your best bet but if you go for like a single GPU around that price point definitely looked for like a gtx 1070 it's got the eight gigabytes of vram definitely a good selling point and we will be talking about more of those things in part two so make sure you stay tuned guys I'll put the link for that video when it's ready up here and I'll catch you in the next one this one has been a a different look into the whole thought process there is more than just going on and looking for a deal there's so many factors that are at play and you got to learn those over time and realize that this is just the way it works so if anything try to identify trends as well this is an important thing try to identify trends before they happen so if you look back in some of my videos fingers in 2018 I said that there was going to be a bust when it came to the GPU mining I knew that was going to come and of course there were so many good deals to be had on GPUs when that bus did come along so always try to identify those trends if they're strong and you know they're gonna happen then jump on them before everyone else because that is going to be your arbitrage before the market efficiency catches up anyway I'll see you in the next one peace out for now BAE I guess that wasn't such an efficient outro that means there's room for other YouTube is to come along take my spot [Music]
