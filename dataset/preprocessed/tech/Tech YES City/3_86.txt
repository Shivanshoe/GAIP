and the 6 pro is easily the best phone i have used to date google please update these phones immediately there's currently an issue where the performance cores are running at 100 active state when doing lightweight tasks for instance when i'm using android auto and i've only got spotify and google maps open this phone will get extremely hot to the point where it's shut down already and in the long run this could mean that the phones could potentially die early and the users will need to get them replaced there's also some minor bugs where apps are semi-freezing though with those issues aside which i hope are patched very soon this is the 6 pro and the 6 and the 6 pro is easily the best phone i have used to date let's get into this review today comparing both these phones against each other and their 4k video capabilities versus the main camera that i use here at techya city this is the canon r6 with a 15 to 35 f 2.8 lens [Music] welcome back to tech yes city and the first thing to talk about with both these cameras is the new updates google have introduced with the pixel 6 and also the 6 pro they now have their own in-house tensor processor which is much more powerful than previous pixel phones and the camera has been drastically updated to the point where i'm not sure why they called this a pixel they should have gone with a new branding name because it is that much better than the previous pixels the pro sports 12 gigabytes of system memory versus the 6 which sports 8 gigabytes the resolution is slightly higher on the 6 pro and also has slightly bigger dimensions with a 6.7 inch screen versus a 6.4 inch screen and they are both oled however the 6 pro does implement a better version of oled aka a ltpo or low temperature poly oxide crystalline organic light emitting diode screen on the front of both these phones you get gorilla glass victors then on the back of the 6 standard you get gorilla glass standard and then you get the victus on the 6 pro on the back as well now as for the cameras on the 6 pro and the 6 you get a 50 megapixel rear facing camera but you also get on the 6 pro an additional 48 megapixel telephoto 4x optical zoom sensor and lens this is a big deal for me personally and ultimately it's why i'm going to be recommending the 6 pro over the 6. we're out in the field especially during the day you can get absolutely gorgeous recordings zoomed in from the 6 pro versus the 6 which will then start to do what's known as a digital zoom which essentially will degrade the image there's also an 8 megapixel front facing 1080p camera on the 6 versus a 4k 30fps of 11 megapixels on the 6 pro and the final main two differences is a slightly bigger battery on the 6 pro and a 120 hertz screen versus a 90 hertz screen on the 6. but now it's time to finally compare these phones where i think the biggest appeal of the six and the six pro exists and that is the video capabilities here is where i went to an island for a day and here is where i'm going to say if you're looking for a phone to take with you that is going to be reliable and get you amazing shots especially during the day the 6 pro and also the 6 will deliver 110 here is where i'm going to show you guys some examples pulling up the 6 versus the 6 pro versus my canon r6 now of course when you're shooting with something like a dslr you're going to want to have the subject and the lighting situations a lot more different than just random daytime shooting but this is where the appeal of the 6 and the 6 pro come into place the automatic hdr video capabilities make it so that you can pretty much get a very good shot at all hours of daytime light and i do put an emphasis on daytime light because when it comes to night time shooting of course the dslr the full frame r6 that i'm using here at my studio is going to start getting a much better image so you may also notice when we pull up our favorite subject and australian kookaburra that the bok air or essentially the out of focus blur on the canon r6 and more importantly the lens attached to it is a lot more beautiful than the 6 and the 6 pro and this simply has to do with the fact that this lens is massive compared to what they're putting in the 6 and the 6 pro you simply can't expect a phone that comes in a little over 200 grams to be able to do what a 1.2 kilogram professional dslr will do the other features that really blew me away on both these phones with some of the new video modes and photo modes that exist there's a motion mode where essentially it'll keep the static image in focus and it'll essentially take the moving objects and make them into this beautiful futuristic motion look the x4 and x8 slow-mo modes if you're especially in daytime shooting will do a phenomenal job and even record audio while you are shooting your subjects though going back now to the night time shooting here's where the six and the six pro will do a phenomenal job at night time providing you leave it on the standard one x sensor that is default out of the box photo settings on the rear facing cameras here is where i noticed the least amount of noise where if i stop it down to the 0.7 x wide angle you'll get a lot of noise coming into the sensor and of course if you want to zoom or on the 6 pro use the telephoto zoom these will incur a lot more noise so basically if you want to do night time shooting on the six and the six pro i'd leave it on the default one x on the rear facing camera and then also if you're not recording videos you can take advantage of the night time setting shooting which will essentially take a heap of images providing you hold the phone still and then we'll make a beautiful noiseless very clear picture also going back to more of the features in video mode there's things like cinematic pen and also extreme image stabilization both work phenomenally well though again providing you have good lighting conditions and i will stress that throughout the review don't buy this phone going into an indoors environment expecting it to pull out dslr like images but if you do go into well-lit conditions this phone can essentially double down as a professional video recording device anyhow with those video comparisons aside both these phones carry a two-year warranty and they both have android 12 installed natively from the get-go which has things like the inbuilt magic editing tool from the get-go so you can edit out with ai processing things like annoying photo bombers so let's go over some of the final points that i like about both these phones you've got an optical fingerprint reader the inbuilt speakers on both these give you surprisingly a very rich sound from the get go as well as the inbuilt mic sounding phenomenal if you were close up to the phone so you had to use this phone to make very good high quality 4k content even in my opinion being able to run a whole youtube channel from something like a phone though the final differences that i really liked about the phone is the advanced call spam detection which lately i've been getting so many call spams every single day from people who just want to blatantly rip you off and this gives you a warning so you can just delete and block the number straight away they're both ip68 water and dust resistant and they both carry sub six millimeter wave 5g support so all that aside now it's time to give you guys a clean cut conclusion and basically me personally as a reviewer i review enthusiast tech hardware i never really take a look at phones but google sent this over and they didn't even tell me any points or anything to look for they just sent the phones over and said have a go and usually when a company does this whether it's a phone company or a company sending over a computer graphics card or cpu it usually means that they are very confident in their product and i would say here that google has a winner both on the 6 and the 6 pro however that said i would like to see them immediately patch the issues that i'm having personally i'm sure there's going to be a lot of other people having issues with these phones that are making it so that they're not getting the best experience that they should be and in the case of me being a desktop hardware enthusiast guy i know how much heat can be a killer of components so they really need to get the heat issues fixed with this phone especially when it comes to having those big performance cores running at a hundred percent active state when they don't need to be as opposed to having those little cores working a lot more efficiently to reduce the heat of the phone especially when you're not doing strenuous tasks though ultimately you're now left with the decision if you want to get one of these phones do you get the six coming in at 600 us or a thousand aussie or do you get the six pro coming in at 900 us or 1300 aussie dollars and for me personally after using both these phones the way i've been using them over the past week i would definitely go for the 6 pro but that's because i'm a guy who loves photography and video work and that telephoto zoom as well as the extra video capabilities especially the more control you have in the camera software itself with the color temperature and the brightness just leads way to making the 6 pro a better purchase in that regard you've also got the hardware upgrades in the system memory the screen the battery life and it just makes for that polished phone that really does scream flagship now also if we're to compare that to other phones out there in the market this flagship price is actually pretty reasonable with the 6 pro and even with the 6 the video capabilities are phenomenal and it does justify the price as well but for me personally i'd be going with the 6 pro but i will state that both these phones do have a two year warranty though if you wanted to keep this phone for a long time which i feel it will be relevant for a long time then i'd opt in for a longer warranty say something like five years anyhow with that aside i hope you guys enjoyed today's first review of a smartphone that i have done in a long time if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what you think of the 6 and the 6 pro i'm pretty sure google will be reading these comments as well so it's always good to let out your frustrations if there's things that you find wrong with the product then i'm sure they'll be reading as i don't think they want a product that isn't working at a hundred percent out there on the market so the sooner they can get some of the issues fixed the sooner this phone will be in my opinion the best phone out there on the market though there's also some little extra things that they sent over like a 30 watt usb fast charging hub which will charge the phone in roughly an hour and a half it does charge very quickly and there's also some wireless earbuds that they sent over that do a very good job if you want something to match your six pro of course they do cost extra anyhow guys i'll catch you in another tech video very soon if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll see you next time peace out for now bye [Music] you
