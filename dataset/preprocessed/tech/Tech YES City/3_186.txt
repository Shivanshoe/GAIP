Another day and another gpu launch this time it's from team red with their 6700 xt and this is the thing with this card i asked amd i said supply and pricing please let's get these confirmed before we do a video and they're telling me it's going to come in from 429 usd and then i asked heavily about the australian pricing and i kept getting met with uh blank stairs in the case of meeting people at retailers in real life and then in the case of internet chat i got met with just uh no replies so no one knows how much this thing is going to cost in australia the pricing is still up for grabs and it's still a day until it's launched so it's not a really good sign in terms of how much this thing is going to be priced at today we're going to look at two different scenarios we're going to look at in a perfect world where there's no crypto miners buying up all the new gpus and if the card came in from 430 msrp that's usd and say for instance australia pricing was maybe from 700 aussie dollars what would this bring to the table then we're going to look at the realistic scenario first and that is that the card's probably going to be sold out within a few seconds at decent prices and then the prices are going to go up for the ones that are in stock by probably 50 plus percent and then tomorrow this is the thing we've got two of these cards here two sixty seven hundred xt's we've got the gaming oc which you're gonna be taking a look at today in terms of performance figures and all the goodness and then we're gonna take a look tomorrow and come back and revisit the situation in this review where we'll review the card but also look at what has unfolded on the launch day release so gigabytes gaming oc 6700 xt we've got here a length of over 280 millimeters you've got 380 millimeter fans and this is their windforce design which out of the box carries some very good temperatures where they go to 66 degrees this is in a 23 ambient environment by the way so things have cooled down you can see that i am wearing a jumper in this review because that's uh that's just how the weather goes just like hopefully the crypto market's going to go but we'll get on to that soon but the 60 here when we up the span speeds of 60 we did get a significant raise in volume levels and then going up to 80 percent saw the volume levels increase like literally exponentially so basically from these graphs you can see it with the fan speeds versus the temperatures you will want to leave this card actually in my opinion on the auto speeds as that's a definite winner in terms of temperatures versus noise so gigabyte have done an excellent job here out of the box of giving you not only the temps and the noise but we'll move on to the performance figures where the 1440p and this is what amd is saying with the 6700xc they're saying this is a 1440p qhd card and looking at the numbers i would have to agree this is definitely bringing in some very hard value at 1440p though when we step it up to 4k that's where you'll definitely want to perhaps go with a card like the 6800 with its bigger bit bus where we've got a 192 bit versus 256 bit on the 6700 xt versus the 6800 for example and then you've also got the same amount of stream processors as you did on the 5700 xt's last year edition but we can see here from the performance figures if we move through the games where i tested four different games here we got a shadow of the tomb raider in the fall we got fortnite and also cold war black ops and f1 2020 you can see here the numbers are showing that it's outperforming a 5700 xt by quite a bit which the 5700 xt that was no slouch that was a very good card in terms of amd hitting the market in terms of price performance so i did like where that was coming in last year and the 6700 xt that if it's coming around msrp in the future will also bring some good value to the table though before we move on with this review of course the big elephant in the room is just the horn is coming in he's like address me address me and here's some good news and this is that the crypto hashing rates are quite low on this card considering its price point especially if we compare it to a 30 60 ti for example and even the recently accidentally unlocked rtx 3060 where we can see that the hashing rate's around 40 megahashes out of the box now of course you could tune that if you're a crypto miner but it's not promising at all i mean i believe the 5700 xt is getting a better hash rate than this card right here the 6700 xt so that's good news it means miners aren't going to be going out in droves desperately looking to get themselves a 6700 xt which will make the pricing a bit better and it will mean that more gamers will hopefully be getting a hold of these cards now the performance numbers looking very solid i decided to do some more tests outside of that where you guys love it where we do the under vaulting as well as some overclocking and here's where this card right here the 6700xt at least the gaming oc this performed and responded really well to under vaulting where we dropped it down to around 1025 millivolts and that was down from 1200 millivolts which i will admit out of the box the 1200 millivolts does seem a little bit aggressive considering the other cards that have come through here they have been lower than that but dropping this down to 1025 millivolt as well as dropping the clock speeds down did show a significant drop in power consumption so if you are into running your pc more lean then undervolting may be an option but at the same time this is the biggest drop i've not only seen in power consumption when i've done the under vaulting here at the studio it's also the biggest drop in fps too so out of the box the performance is really good but under vaulting you will save a lot of power but you will also be losing a bit of performance leaving that on the table overclocking it didn't respond that well here's where i did up the speeds a bit on both the memory and the clock speeds on the core and this is where it was limited at 1200 millivolts so i couldn't extract a whole lot more but i did manage to squeeze out an extra 2 fps in the shadow of the tomb raider 4k benchmark but that did come at the detriment of roughly using about 30 more watts from the wall the final thing to talk about is the outputs where you've got hdmi 2.1 you've got two of these on this card as well as two display port outs meaning you can hook it up to hdmi 2.1 something like an lg oled 4k and get 120 hertz native however if you're going with that route you may wish to get something like a rx 6800 if you can of course where that will be a bit more 4k friendly as we saw with these gaming results and some other things to talk about amd have increased at least this time around with the default drivers they have increased the max fan target to a hundred percent where in previous reviews i did in the driver set it was capped at 50 which i thought was a little bit awkward since the temperatures of the rx 6800 xt when i reviewed that they were getting a little bit hot and so i like the fact that they've removed the default limiter to 100 that means people who go out and buy the graphics card won't have any problems with temperatures especially if they live in a hot ambient environment and then you've got also the technologies on amd's side versus nvidia side there are differences there in the case of amd you get the fx fidelity upscaling and fx sharpening and they've got their own tech such as anti-lag and anti-chill as well and then on nvidia's side you've got dlss 2.0 uh this does support ray tracing as well though it still is coming a little bit behind nvidia's side at least when i tested fortnite the ray tracing was a little bit lacking in this particular title there are other games out there that in time will get more optimized for the dx12 ray tracing support on amd's side which on nvidia's side they do have their own ray tracing optimizations that they work for especially in conjunction with dlss 2.0 though all that out of the way it's time for a conclusion with this graphics card right here the 6700 xt what do i think of it and it all depends on what is going to unfold tomorrow again around msrp this card is getting a big yes from me but i just don't think it's going to come in at around msrp and if it does it's going to be sold out within seconds that's just my thought with this card right here but what i saw out of the performance figures was something that compares to um roughly a bit better than a 3060 ti and it's definitely beating the 5700 xt from last year and in fact i'd say it's more of a raw gaming card for 1440p high refreshed users and even people who want to go say with hertz 1080p this card is going to be bringing the hard value there if it's going to be coming in around that msrp in the future i'd say this crypto boom while we're going through it while the price of bitcoin's so high in the cryptocurrency mining profitability is so high as well you're not going to see cards gpus anywhere close to msrp that's just the reality of it and i think any of us who have tried to buy a graphics card lately will realize that pain however speaking of pain we've got the opposite here we've got some really good news because you stay till the end we've got some great news and that is gigabyte are going to be giving away a gaming oc 6700 xt if you want to get in with a chance there will be a gleam link in the description below all you have to do is click on that enter

already know what's unfolded so we can discuss it in this video right here which i'll be recording tomorrow and talking about the reference design especially versus the aftermarket design but we'll be talking about the stock situation more in depth and we got the question of the day which comes from marco and he says is this the beginning of the tech yes goatee tech yet no it wasn't the beginning it was the end of the tech yes goatee so what i'm going to raise to you marco i'll make you a deal if you start growing a long beard i'll grow a goatee and if we got a deal then you'll see a tech yes go or maybe you just want to see a techies go to let us know in the description below but if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now [Music] bye [Music] you
