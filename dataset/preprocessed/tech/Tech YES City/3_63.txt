i'm assuming if we start running a load cycle on this uh for the next couple months it'll probably blow up probably did i make myself a huge mistake are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2 links in description below welcome back to tech yes city and here we've got the dell aurora r12 now i got this on an ebay black friday sale for 2 900 aussie dollars and when i saw the price i was actually taken back because that's a little over 2 000 usd with a whole system with a 3080 ti now for you guys that aren't looking at gravis cars basically the price that i paid for this whole system you can buy at retail just the graphics card alone so rtx 3080 ti's in australia are pretty much going for around 2 900 aussie dollars so the fact that we got a whole system with that graphics card included actually on the surface looks like it's one of the best deals of 2021. but before buying this i was really nervous because i watched the gamers nexus video on the aurora r10 and i was very shocked at some of the things dell tried to get away with in that build the most important ones that i was paying attention to was the fact that the airflow at the back there was just this little space that still exists on this aurora r12 and even though this is the intel version and there are a few different things i have started pulling this apart and i will point out that there are some of those similar design flaws that do exist on this model so besides the terrible inflow at the top of the pc which is then covered by a power supply which then covers your vrm and covers your ram they have tried to alleviate some of this problem by installing a 120 mil water cooler on the cpu so besides the rtx 3080 ti being the biggest selling point of this pc i'll run you guys through the rest of the specs here's where we've got an i5 11400f six cores 12 threads we've also got a z590 motherboard with onboard wi-fi six bluetooth and then they've got 16 gigabytes of ram spread across two 8 gigabyte sticks at 3 200 megahertz with the ability of course if you want to upgrade it to 32 gigabytes or replace it and go up to 128 gigabytes those for the rest of the specs we've got a 1 000 watt power supply here is where dell's actually done a very solid job fully modulated as well so you can take it out with ease it does look like it's a very high quality unit 80 plus gold and also the fact that you've got up to over 900 watts on the 12 volt line so even for example if you want to upgrade your cpu to an i9 11 900 k add in more memory more drives you wouldn't have to worry at all at whether this power supply is good enough for the job because it is more than good enough for anything that you could do with this system then the final component in the build is the 512 gigabyte nvme ssd looks like a standard pcie gen 3. though as you may notice here we have pulled this system apart and what we're doing is testing out the rtx 3080 ti which looks like it's dell's own design for this graphics card and looking at the temperatures on an open testbed system in a 28c ambient environment this card actually is pretty solid needs two 8-pin connectors which of course is all pre-connected in this build ready to go but it's also got two 90-mil fans that do a decent job of cooling out of the get-go and also if you want to manually tune this especially if you are into under vaulting then you can actually get so much more out of this graphics card so that's pretty good to see that the most important component that most people would be buying this unit for is actually pretty solid we've also done some 1080p and 4k benchmark numbers on the gravis cart on a 12 900k system and then we're going to throw that gravis card back in this system and then run some tests and see if you are missing out or if you aren't missing out on a whole lot by staying with this pre-built alienware aurora r12 [Music] [Applause] [Music] we've now just finished a heap of different benchmarking on this system right here and there's actually a lot of good news to report about the r12 and that is for starters the cpu temperature and the vrm temperature now albeit it's an 11 400 f and i5 so it's not a power hungry cpu to begin with but the motherboard did an okay job when i was stress testing this on cinebench r23 the maximum temperatures that we got on the cpu was 68 degrees and this is in a 28 degree ambient environment and then the most i saw on the motherboard when i quickly took the tray out after stress testing was about 52 degrees on the surface temperatures so that was really these scores are pretty decent now it's nothing to really worry about at this level with the poor ventilation at the top however of course if we started going into say an i7 or even an i9 for instance at 11 900k which we will be looking at in a different video that could spell a problem for the r12 but in its current form if this was the unit you were buying the cpu and the cooler on it and also the motherboard wouldn't be much of a concern you wouldn't have to worry about it now there's also the gpu this was a little bit more worrisome in the fact that i think this case design does let down the gpu temperatures in that when we saw it on the open test bed we were getting in a 28 degree ambient environment out of the box we've got 74 degrees at 60 percent fan speeds auto this was going up to 78 degrees in this case and the fan speeds were going up to 66 so it's not as good as an open test bed though i have seen cases of course some of the best cases for pc cooling that come through here are of course the ones that give you lower temperatures than an open-air test bed so this giving higher temperatures and also of course higher fan speeds on auto means that the case design isn't that good so if it's anything with dell i'd give them some feedback to improve the airflow not only on the uh gravis card where they've although they've got a 12 centimeter fan bringing air into it and they've got side ventilation it's still a 3080 ti so it is a power hungry gpu and it does need a good cooling solution not just on the cooler itself for the gpu but also its environment so pretty much all pun intended in this case it's the opposite to what gn saw with their amd r10 so those critiquing points aside that is only one of two mediocre things with the r12 the intel version the second point is the bios as well when we go into the bios it's very basic to the point where if you're an enthusiast you're going to be surprised with the lack of options you cannot really tune any voltages any speeds and you've only got the option to lock in x and p profiles and also if you've got a k cpu you can then unlock a different tab so there's not much you can do here in the way of tuning but at the very least they have given you the option to at least lock in those xmp profiles where you're going to get a big uplift in performance as opposed to having it turned off but all that considered it's time to move on to some gaming benchmark numbers now which is the most important part with a gaming pc and here's where we tested against the 12 900k system and here is where we're going to throw in some bonus numbers on the under vaulting as well as power consumption figures so the first game we're going to pull up here is borderlands 3. here we've got 1080p numbers where they're virtually coming in the same league where we've got this at ultra settings and we saw on the 12 900k ddr5 system and this is where we're getting 154 average fps versus 142 on the aurora system then we move over to 4k and we only got a difference of one average fps so there's really no difference if you're going to be playing at 4k ultra settings which the 3080 ti as we can see from these fps numbers is perfectly capable of doing the move over to age of empires 4 my favorite pc game at the moment really good title especially if you're into rts here is where we got a 4k 88 average fps versus 86. so there wasn't really any difference we had between going out and getting a really expensive cpu motherboard and ddr5 memory versus what the aurora r12 is offering in its current form however stepping things down to 1080p here is where we saw a sizeable difference between the 12900k system and the 11400 f system so we're getting 155 average fps versus 101. so pretty much over a 50 percent uplift going to the 12900k at 1080p now moving over to fortnite the final game in today's comparison here was where we tested 1080p low settings with epic view distance the competitive pro settings and we got here 469 on the 1200k system versus 293 on the aurora r12 in its current form stepping things up to 4k just like the other two tiles we pulled up here saw a similar trend of 79 average fps versus 76 so you didn't lose much fps at all by playing at 4k ultra settings however at 1080p in some titles you will be losing some fps especially if you want to play competitively so that's pretty much the difference between a 11400 f and a 12 900 k however there are some differences too when it comes to power consumption and here's where this built at 4k in borderlands 3 we decided to do power consumption tests between the different systems and we got here a maximum of 520 watts on the aurora r12 at 4k max settings and then if we undervolted the gpu we then stepped it down to 457 watts whilst basically only losing 2fps so we saw a big drop in power consumption so if you want to undervolt you're going to get better temperatures you're also going to get better power consumption and that's also going to be less heat in your case overall so i really do recommend undervolting if you're on an rtx 3000 series graphics card also for amd on their latest rx 6000 graphics cards too they benefit greatly from this though contrasting that to the 12 900k system we did use up a little bit more power in this particular benchmark that's of course because it is the latest and greatest and it is a 5 gigahertz cpu so it does run pretty high in terms of this one right here single core goes up to 4.4 gigahertz multi-core goes up to 4.2 gigahertz across all those six cores 12 threads so with all those gaming benchmarks done and dusted it's time to give you guys a clean cut conclusion on the aurora r12 and straight away i'm gonna say would i buy this again at 2 900 aussie dollars and the answer is overwhelmingly yes this thing for the money and what i paid for it so it's a little over 2000 usd i'm getting a lot of computer and performance especially at 4k for my money and so what we said in the intro rings true you're basically getting a whole computer at least at the price i paid for just the price of the graphics card so i can't really complain in terms of the value because the value this thing is bringing is actually pretty good though in a perfect world if i was to change things with this build the only thing i would really want to change would be the case the airflow more specifically whereas we saw that gravis card test it was pretty bad and then if we saw with that airflow covering the vrm on the motherboard it was kind of like this sarcophagus that gets your motherboard and cpu and your ram gets encased in and that can be bad especially over the long term but the saving grace here is that the motherboard's vrm has a heat sink on it it's got a pretty decent vrm especially for 11400f and the cpu isn't that power hungry so you pretty much get away with it in this build though i don't know what happens in the upcoming video where we're going to change some components because you're probably like brian why did you buy an aurora r12 and actually the reason i bought it because i want to upgrade it and then try and flip it and make a profit that's why i bought this thing because at 2 900 aussie dollars i can then add a cpu flip the current cpu in it and then also add 32 gigabytes of ram and a four terabyte hard drive and so off the top of my head it's probably going to end up costing me an extra 350 dollars and i'm then gonna have a four terabyte system a 11900k i9 and also 32 gigabytes of ram so on the spec sheet it's going to look phenomenal it's only going to cost me around 3 300 aussie dollars and then i'm going to hope it to flip it for over 4 000 aussie dollars so that's the real reason i bought it personally but in the process i want to take you guys through a tour and say hey is this worth getting and so the answer to that is in its current form yes but it's not without problems it's not a perfect pc so if you've watched this review you'll know that the airflow on the case isn't the best and that's pretty much my only gripe with it everything else other than that does check out and the rgb at least on this pc does look pretty cool but by default the rgb is turned off so you will have to go into the alienware command center and turn it on though with all that aside it was a completely different experience to what gamers nexus got with their aurora r10 i think those guys honestly for the price they paid like 1800 usd i'd say they got hosed where the motherboard the vrm and the cooling solution in that particular build was just absolutely horrible this thing however is a much better solution where i didn't come into any thermal throttling and overall it should do a good job even in the long term anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to drop a comment in the comment section below let us know what you think of the alienware aurora r12 i honestly i'm surprised that it was this cheap because usually the dell alienware stuff carries a pretty hefty premium i'm actually surprised that it came up at the price that it did but overall i mean dell can improve on some things and i think if they did that have an absolute winner on their hands i think the aesthetics however is a pretty cool point about the alienware stuff so do let us know what you think in the comments section below just like this question of the day here which comes from dartmaster300 and they ask how many languages can you speak up bro and uh so in the recent live stream i was speaking a bit of japanese and i only speak english and japanese and that's because i lived in japan for quite a while uh in terms of learning other languages it's actually really hard i struggle learning languages the only way i learned japanese wasn't by studying it was just going out and constantly speaking to people i'm actually kind of pretty bad at learning a language via pen and paper so hopefully that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell hope you guys also have a merry christmas wherever you guys are in the world and also if you want some behind the scenes footage you can also hit the join button for as little as a dollar a month you get the behind the scenes tech yes videos and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] you
