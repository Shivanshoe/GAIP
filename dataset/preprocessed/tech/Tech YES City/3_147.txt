my computer won't start it won't boot 
there's a black screen every time i hit   the power button what can i do to solve this 
problem now we're going to go through the most   obvious one first which is the most common when 
i sell a pc i actually get quite a few people   that message me saying there's a black screen it 
won't start so this problem is easy to fix if it   is this problem and that is first thing you have 
to do is uh take the little battery out so make   sure the power is disconnected from the pc and uh 
press the power button a few times just to drain   all the power then i want you to take out this 
little circular battery and then leave it out   for about 20 seconds i usually find that's long 
enough to reset the whole pc you can leave it   out for a minute if you wanted just to be sure and 
also you may have to take out your graphics card   for this as well in this case we can just pull it 
out since there's no screws attached but you may   have to unscrew the graphics card and take it out 
and then put it back in because the little battery   may be underneath the gravis card now once you've 
done this put your battery back in if you have to   reconnect your graphics card then go do that as 
well and then i want you to make sure that your   monitor is plugged off of the gravis card not 
the actual motherboard itself so a lot of people   will get the pcs and then they'll plug their 
motherboard will have what's called a display out   and they'll plug it off the motherboard and 
they'll get a black screen when they're meant   to be plugging off the graphics card or of course 
if the pc's bios has been trained to work off the   motherboard and not the gravis card when they go 
to plug the monitor off the graphics card it also   gives out a black screen so essentially resetting 
the whole pc by doing this and then putting the   graphics card back in and then plugging your 
monitor off the graphics card will train the   computer from the get go to work off the graph 
scope which is definitely what you want especially   if you're on a gaming pc or you're using 
multiple monitors from the graphics card drivers   so that is the most common problem when your 
computer won't start and you have a black screen   however there are some other problems and recently 
there's been two computers that have come to me   especially this one on the desk here which is 
now the fourth time this pc is coming back and   i'm going to talk to you guys about the more rarer 
problems that can occur and how you can fix them   right after this sponsor spot did you just 
shriek because you saw the price of windows   10 pro key licenses online yes well shriek no 
longer with today's video sponsor scd keys you   can get windows 10 pro single user and license 
activated for as little as fourteen dollars   using the coupon code bftyc links in description 
below welcome back to tech yes city and right here   we'll give you guys a rundown of this computer on 
the desk this is actually a different pc to the   one i initially sold so when i sold this pc the 
first time around it was working it had a 1050 ti   it had eight gigahertz of ram and a 4570 and when 
it came back the computer was completely gone   so it wasn't even booting and i was sort of 
scratching my head because these pcs that i sell   on the lower end here they're actually very sturdy 
because they're x business like high-end business   server pcs that people use for 24 7 reliability 
so it's kind of rare for a pc like this that's   come out of the studio and it's fully working to 
then come back a week later and it's completely   gone there's not even intermediate faults 
it's just gone so what ended up happening was   that computer had a faulty power supply and i 
and because i didn't have time i ended up just   saying look there's probably something else going 
on here so i replaced the whole pc for the person   until i could have time to inspect the original 
pc so that person then got the replacement pc   with everything changed everything had been 
changed on this pc they then come back to me   another week later and said this pc something's 
not working it's giving me out a black screen   and i was then i knew i was like okay this is very 
weird and what had happened was the graphics card   that's the thing i'm holding in my hand right now 
there's two of them actually it ended up being   toast it was gone there was no bringing this thing 
back and so i thought okay perhaps he got unlucky   and the gravis card was on its way out so i then 
replaced it just to check i then put in instead   of a 1050 ti i put in a gtx 750 just to check 
because if he's got something wrong on his end   bringing back the pc constantly and me fixing it 
isn't going to fix the actual issue so i put in   the gtx 750 and sure enough another week later 
the pc came back and this gtx 750 i'm holding   in my hands is now kebonkers it is gone and this 
is one of those things where okay at this stage   i'm um i'm actually going to be charging to fix 
this pc because i know it's not a problem on my   end so i've told them look we're putting in now 
a gt 740 until they fix their issue and i said   to the person who bought this piece i said look 
there is something going on at your house and they   admitted to me that their dishwasher had recently 
failed as well and so i'm thinking to myself okay   well what it is in this case was i've come into 
this problem twice in the past once was when i was   living in japan and that was that the powerpoint 
that you're plugging into wasn't grounded properly   and what this does on most devices is it will 
create a discharge and so for instance if   you're connecting something that's plugged in to 
something another device that perhaps is grounded   then there can be an initial discharge from 
that cable that you're connecting to the   said pc device and so the easiest way to check 
for this is especially if it's a hdmi cable so   you're plugging in a monitor that is not grounded 
properly to say a computer that you've just set up   and you haven't turned on yet the easiest way to 
check is just to touch the tip of the hdmi cable   and so if you get a shock from that do make 
sure that you're inserting your gravis card   and it's a non-discharge cable in that both your 
monitor and your pc power points are grounded   properly and in terms of grounding all that means 
is that there's a extra point in the power line   that goes to the actual earth inside the earth and 
it lets out all the discharge into the earth so   it's important to do this for pc parts otherwise 
parts can be overloaded and with pc parts they can   quickly become toast if they're overloaded and so 
in this case with this pc right here i definitely   want the said person to fix up their problems 
before i'm sending out the pc again because a pc   having faults every single week definitely 
spells something seriously wrong on the said   person's uh powerpoint perhaps that particular 
powerpoint that they're plugging the computer off   just wasn't grounded properly and the same for 
the dishwasher but other power points in the house   were grounded correctly so that's something to 
look out for that can be a weird issue but can   definitely cause you damage financially because 
it's going to cost you money to replace the   said parts so the next problem is interrelated i'm 
actually going to put out two recommendations here   and that is actually becoming increasingly more 
common and that is faulty cpus on older gear so i   recently had a friend who came over with a pc and 
he said brian can you help me fix this computer up   uh it's just it boots and then it just as it's 
going to windows it just gets a complete black   screen and i was like okay that's really weird 
but because it's doing this problem consistently   i had a suspicion that it was actually either 
the power supply or the cpu and so we tried a   different power supply and it still did that same 
problem but then after that i actually changed the   cpu out and it was an i5 2400 and i changed that 
for a spare i5 2400 that i had on hand and sure   enough that fixed the problem straight away so 
basically this i5 2400 cpu that we're using had   been used for so long that it just had degraded 
over time to the point where it was failing to   boot to windows properly and so what happens on 
this case especially if it's a pc where you can't   get into the bios you sometimes can't change 
the said default voltages but if you're on an   aftermarket vendor board like a zeus msi as rock 
or gigabyte sometimes you can go into the bios   and change the voltage settings and up the 
voltages even just five percent across the board   and that can prolong the life of your cpu but 
on the back of that ddr3 memory or ddr4 memory   this stuff can be faulty and actually it's one of 
the most commonly faulty parts that i come into   on pcs however i find with ram if it is 
faulty it'll either do two things and that is   a faulty sticker memory the computer just won't 
boot at all but if it's faulty to the point where   it can still boot usually the behavior will 
be erratic and unpredictable in that you may   make it to windows sometimes you'll boot up a 
program the whole pc will turn off or sometimes   a program will crash or sometimes the pc will 
just freeze upon booting and give you the said   black screen but in this case if you want to check 
if your computer is faulty because of ddr3 memory   and especially if you open the pc up and you see 
there's two sticks of memory you can just take   out one stick at a time and alternate your usage 
on the computer between those sticks of memory   and that should give you an idea if perhaps one of 
the sticks of memory is faulty and now it's time   for the last problem and i mentioned this one last 
because it is my opinion the most rarest problem   that i've come into i've only ever come into 
this once where a power supply is faulty   but it passes all the power good tests absolutely 
fine so all the lights light up the uh the power   supply tester is showing that this power supply 
should be good but then you boot it up and you   get stuck on windows things freeze and things just 
don't work properly in general so typically if you   have a faulty power supply things probably just 
won't boot up at all or you won't even make it   to the bios screen but in this case if you do have 
a faulty power supply but it's not showing up any   initial symptoms it can be one thing to try and 
change especially if it is from a no name brand   and you've never heard of that power supply before 
you check the price on that power supply online   and it's a very cheap power supply so in this 
case i always do recommend if you're using a   pc especially if you're serious about gaming then 
you should step things up and get a decent power   supply at least one from a reputable manufacturer 
anyway guys with that aside i hope you enjoyed   today's video on how to fix a pc that won't boot 
or just gets a black screen another thing that   you can try too is if your pc has a speaker on 
it then you can usually listen to the pc and if   it's booting to windows but it's still giving 
you a black screen it can mean that the pc is   working normally but it's just the graphics card 
or maybe the hdmi cable or something like that   isn't working properly so in that case an easy way 
even if you don't have a speaker an easy way is   to test if the computer is working fine still but 
it's just say the graphics card or in the graphics   card pipeline is to turn the computer on and then 
leave it for about 30 seconds or even a minute   and then press the power button again and see if 
it cycles down normally and so that means if you   press the power button even when the computer's on 
especially in windows 10 it'll just automatically   start turning the computer off for you but however 
there is a few seconds delay there before the   whole system shuts off and so that can give you 
a indication if the computer is generally working   fine versus uh something that's wrong from the 
get-go with say the motherboard the ram or the cpu   but i will refer you guys if you want some more 
tips and tricks on how to fix some weird problems   i'll thread you to another video that i made but 
besides that it's always a good thing to have a   little speaker on your pc and if you're getting 
beep codes that are outside the ordinary beep code   that can also tell you problems with your 
computer and you can refer to the original   manufacturer's guide so speaking of questions we 
do have here the question of the day which comes   from randy sprouse and they ask as much as i like 
your content i have to ask a difficult question   aren't you driving up pc part prices with 
your reselling so to answer this question   directly it's a good question i'm happy to answer 
questions like this you haven't been rude at all   or anything like that you're just just asking a 
question man so i'm more than happy to answer that   and basically i think that we don't use pc 
resellers don't drive up prices we actually   bring prices down because we're competing with uh 
new sales which those parts are manufactured at a   constant supply rate usually they're manufactured 
at a constant supply rate so me selling a   reselling a used pc is not only beating out the 
retailers where you're keeping the retailers   prices in check with used pc resales but you're 
also taking away from that demand for new parts   which essentially will bring the prices down 
however on the flip side since i am buying   used pc parts off the market i can be raising the 
prices of those so that's why i've always said in   the past that the used market's a great thing 
because it does work well with the new parts   and it keeps both in a great balance for the tech 
enthusiast or even someone who just wants to get   into the land of pc gaming hope that answers that 
question i'll catch you guys in another tech video   very soon if you stayed this far and you're 
enjoying that tech yes city content be sure   to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll 
catch you in the next one peace out for now bye wow bye
