it's a nice beautiful morning here on the sunny gold coast and it's approaching the end of the month for march 2021 and that can only mean one thing that is a used pc parts hunt of the month however yesterday it wasn't the same story it was a rainy day and actually it's been raining really heavily where i'm at lately to the point where it's been flooding a lot around the gold coast, so if you're around this area and you're okay and safe then that's a great thing hope you even stand safe but we got behind here yesterday and the rainy deals i just went out and picked up a stormy deal where it seems like whenever i go out in the rain i manage to get the best deals and they're not just like really good deals they're extremely good deals and this one here was a server deal from someone that worked at a server place and they said brian like do you want to come and pick up all this stuff and i said sure like what do you got and they said look it's untested but we'll do it for you a really good price and so we ended up getting in total 16 pcs now i have left uh seven of them upstairs so we had hp we had three of those and they were the second uh sorry third gen hp's and then four second gen hp's now those ones are left upstairs because i'm pretty much just going to take the cpus and the ram out of them because they don't they have a thing called secure boot and it's generally locked on the second and third gen hp's they're a real big pain if you want to recase but all these right here especially these lenovos and these even these 4th gen hps they're re-caseable because they will support newer graphics cards and we even got a first-gen pro lion thrown in and all this was for a total of 650 aussie dollars so we got nine pcs here that we can recase in the case of the pro line we'll actually just reuse the case and then we got seven pcs that we can pick the parts of part four so 16 pcs 650 aussie dollars i'm super happy with this deal it's ridiculously good but speaking of deals we have to get gpus that is still the most important thing to see it being the most important thing for quite some time in this current environment however my strategy going in is that i've been sitting on the low end here and i'm really enjoying it i'm finding there's not a whole lot of competition i guess there's not a whole lot of profit down here but i really do enjoy the low end it's just a lot of fun to get the most for your dollar and i guess that's the tried and true method of tech yes city today's video is brought to you by scd keys delivering you that retail single and use the license key for only 12 bucks after you use the coupon code bftyc description below pulling up the first deal on gumtree and actually the only deal on gumtree is for a gtx 960 turbo 4 gigabyte now they're asking 120 put in an offer of 80. the thing is though it's actually quite far down south now this is one thing if you've got a good network wherever you are make sure you make friends if there's other people selling pcs in your area and or you're you're all into like the used pc parts scene try to make friends with those people because you can do each other favors like for instance one of my mates is down south like he's driving past that area so i'm just going to give him a call and see if he can pick this up on the way back to the gold coast for me and so that'll save me like 200 kilometers of driving and since it's down south it's not as good the roads don't become as good as they are up here sort of thing so it takes roughly three hours basically for me to get this scrap scout so hopefully my friend can come through with the pickup but moving on out of facebook marketplace we actually found quite a lot of deals here and we'll talk about some of the other stuff later because i'm seeing a lot of ram as well and cpus and cases and and all this other stuff where people are trying to capitalize on the fact that graphs car prices are higher and some people think that everything's higher as well because the graphics card prices are higher and it's just not happening as we'll talk about in a minute but in terms of gpus on a facebook marketplace we managed to sniff out a gtx 670 for 50 bucks and they are like they dropped it from 65 they're asking 50 so i said sure i'll just go pick that up asking price because it's a decent price they're not asking too much and i was like that's fair so i'll go get that i also put down an offer of 60 on a 7970 and also a gtx 1050 an oem version popped up for 70 dollars and i put down asking on that because that's just going to get snapped up so quickly being a 1050 at 70 aussies so also i'll put all the usd pricing up on the screen for you guys if you're over in america or anywhere internationally where you can compare it to the usd rate and now with the gtx 1050 they've already gotten back to me said they would accept the 70 so i'm just waiting on them to send me the address and pick up time and i'll go snag that and then next up we've got a gtx 950 a zeus strix for 80 i put down an offer of 70 and they accepted they also said you're that guy on youtube that hunts a used pc parts i'm like that's me dude so let's meet up and do this so they said sure thing and then moving forward we've got some feelers out there that are still up in the air one of those being a gtx 1050 with no bracket on it they're asking 150 i put in an offer of 100 see if they get back to us 10 50 ti but the problem with this is that if you don't have that i o shield it can make it really weird when you if you're selling a pc you don't want to sell it with zip ties on the graphics card zip tied to the pc case i've only ever done that once and it's been on the pc i've given away so and it's not a great thing like you don't want your gravis card out of middle or nowhere just falling off so all those deals out of the way we're gonna go hop in the tech yes mobile go up to brisbane because that's where these two graphics card deals are but we're going to see les on the way and then hopefully also some more people get back to us while we're up seeing les so let's go cop ourselves some deals also one more thing about this month before i started this parts hunt i also picked up 20 cases of rgb msi tempered glass cases for 49 aussie dollars each so i got a heap of them in and also picked up 30 power supplies uh 20 of those being 450 watt 10 of those being 650 watt and now we got the power supplies for 45 aussie each and then 650 watts for a 55 each so basically when it comes to other pc parts out there we're talking cpus ram ssds stuff like that i'm not seeing those prices increase and actually i'm seeing the opposite i'm seeing them decrease and we've got a sad story about some of the retailers i've been speaking to recently which involves graphics cards directly and this one's like a harsh reality but we'll talk about that a little bit towards the end of this part-time well let's go hit them bargains so we just finished up at lez's place and we've got some good news and bad news and the good news is we picked up five pcs four of those being the z 200 workstations we've got second gen and third gen so one second gen for 60 three third gens for 70 and we've also picked up five monitors and also a pavilion with the red paint job on the front so this thing's looking really good i got this for 100 but it did have an ssd in it so it's a little bit more plus i want to do a video with this if you guys want to see what a pavilion can do in 2021 then let us know in the comments but we also picked up a budget power supply for 10 bucks and let's throw in four free monitor stands and i love this because i get a lot of monitors over time with no stands i usually either get them for free or really cheap so free plus free equals amazing now for the bad news and this is a relation to the gtx 1050 the guy messaged me just now and he's saying that he's already sold it and the guys basically completely dogged me but that does happen from time to time so whatever however to counteract this bad news we've now got one more piece of good news and that is i found two gtx 750s they want sixty dollars for the pair these would look like they're two gigabytes and they're low profile so i messaged them i said look are these things working can i come get them i'm just around the corner and they said sure and i'll pay asking price for 60 bucks and i think if i can get this it's a pretty fair price for two 750s considering what we're going through with gpus but i'm also waiting on the gtx 950 and the 7970 guy to get back to me still so let's go cop these 750s and hopefully in that time the uh those guys get back to us and we got more gpus who do you want to call uh i'd have to think about it is that our new number mobile no who do you want to call nobody who do you want to call i don't want to call anyone who do you want to call stop all right so we just picked up the gtx 750s we got two of them and 60 bucks for the pair that's pretty good deal considering this whole climate except one of them had a low profile bracket and the other has a standard atx bracket now it's not really a problem but if i want to use them in atx cases then i can only use one of them but the good thing about the low profile bracket is i can put it in a oem system an sff pc small form factor and you pretty much got the cheapest gaming pc available in 2021 it'll still give out pretty good performance but from here on in the gtx 950 guy he hasn't messaged me back and the 7970 guy he messaged me back we've got some bad news and that is like he's like literally like an hour up north from where i am so if i go get this deal it's really going to make things late and i've got to get to the gtx 670 guy who's on the gold coast and i did promise him that i would get there before 7 p.m so we're in a bit of a predicament where i'm waiting for the 950 guy and if he doesn't message me soon uh message me at all then we're gonna have to skip that as well so there's potentially our two gpu deals up in the air three gpu deals in brisbane up in the air sorry but i'm really having trouble recognizing that can we try again but this time using the keypad on your phone please enter the postcode now using the keypad on your phone sorry i didn't get that i'm having trouble finding a store for you let me put you through to someone who can help welcome to pizza hut our customer service team are all on call but shouldn't be long so please call and we'll be right with you so you probably tell that it's not my day for voice activation where it can't recognize the aussie bogan's voice but that's not a problem we'll just rock up to the pizza joint on the way home after we get all these deals so we've just picked up that gtx 670 and i have been looking for a few more deals on the road here and i've found a three potential deals but one of them they already got back to me on the gtx 770. i offered them 70 bucks and they came back and said that's way too low they've got to make it higher they're looking for a hundred firm and i just said at 100 bucks it's like it's not worth it so i just told them i'd pass and the thing about that is is like you gotta remember with these inflated prices one thing that's inflating with the parts as well is especially in the case of a gtx 770 is its age that's inflating let's not forget that so i do remember picking up one of these cards for around 80 in 2017 so 70 to 80 for this card seems about right even with the current climate but speaking of some better news we've got two more offers a 400 f where they want 150 aussie and i said look i'll come pick it up for 140 just shave 10 off and they said sure come and pick it up so we're gonna go get that right now and then also i put an offer for 20 bucks on two gtx 461 gigabytes they're selling the two of them in the same ad and i i mean they wanted 55 but it looked like it'd been sitting there for a long time and i'm like look i'll just flick you at 20. they said sure thing come get it so we've got more graphics cards and a good deal on that 10 400 f where that's i mean that's like 210 news so we're getting it at a 33 discount so we're deals deals deals let's do this and now we are back at the tech yes studio and we have picked up we ended up scoring a few extra deals and even though this gtx 460 i'm i know people are going to be like brian that is potato i mean for 10 aussie dollars like seven usd per card i can definitely have a bit of fun with that that's going to be awesome and the funny thing is about this was it's got this cyclone sticker on it this is the it's in japanese so whoever bought these two cards had actually originally purchased them in japan and brought them back to australia so they must have done it on holidays or something like that uh because the guy who i bought it off he wasn't a native uh japanese speaker and uh this right here is the i5 10 400 f it just came to us in a box and like well loose box and i like i said to the guy yeah does this work you sure it works he's like yeah and i've actually bought off him before so i know he's good for it he just said look there's something wrong with it just return it and he's happy to return it so cool with that then we got the gtx 670 50 bucks and we picked that one up and the guy actually said he had seen me before and he'd seen me on a part-time so that was cool to stop and have a chat and it's always good just to have a chat to people especially if their passion is pc gaming and building but with that aside we've got the tally for this month's parts hunt and i'll put it all up on the screen here for you where we've got the total here at 1470 aussie dollars and that's about 115 usd so quite a big one and i'm very happy with all the deals here i don't think any of the deals were even close to mediocre i think this was pretty solid in terms of what we got now gpus you can probably see a trend here i'm kind of picking up two gigabytes two gigabytes two gigabytes one gigabyte one gigabyte people just aren't mining with these gpus they're just not good to mine on but of course they can play games which is something that excites me because now we've got some cool potatoes coming if you thought we could put together a pc for under 100 bucks then that's exactly what i'm thinking we're going to do with some of these parts right here so stay tuned but let's move over to the chair now because we got some worrying stuff to talk about a little bit and here we are now at the finish line and i've gotten back a little bit earlier tonight so i went and picked up those final deals and we're now back and it's 9 30 p.m and i'm usually a lot more tired at this time but i don't know lately i've been uh getting the tech yes mojo back and you guys have been seeing that i don't know what it is i've got a i do have a thing that i think it is but i'm putting it to the test over the next couple of months and i gotta see so if it is then i'll share it otherwise in the meantime it could just be placebo anyhow favorite deal of the month even though i like the gpu pickups we got here i gotta say that first deal we've got with the server deals i love just getting a heap of untested stuff and just a lot of it and i think we just scored big time with 16 pcs for 650 aussie with a lot of them being 4th gen of course les is always consistent monitors pcs always need that stuff and if i put graphics cards in them i can always re-flip them but uh the gpu market i've got some really bad news going forward with that and this is directly from msi's distribution chains and that is that they're forcing customers and this has been going on i've been hearing stories of all about this but it wasn't until i got offered this deal where i could buy a graphics card say for instance an rtx 3070 but i then had to buy three power supplies with it and it ended up coming the 30 70 would come to around 1300 aussie dollars or something like that and then i got off at a 30 90 and that would have come to 3 000 aussie dollars because i would have had to have bought i think it was like five motherboards or something like that and i just said that's just like for me i just don't want to do that it's basically the retailers from this is what i'm hearing the sad case of this whole gpu demand and if you want to do gpu mining then have a think about this because retailers are actually starting to go out of business now i got a call from one of my friends who's a retailer and he said like dude we're out of gpus we can't get them they're too expensive and we can't sell pcs anymore so basically if the effects are going to start being felt from the cryptocurrency demand really putting a massive distortion on the usual way of doing things in the pc market so you're going to see retailers you're going to see so maybe even some of your favorite pc stores if they're local they might go out of business from this whole crypto um situation that's going on because this time around it's far worse than it was than 2017. i will tell you that but the worst thing about this is all the brunt in the distribution chain is getting put on the end retailer they're they're basically just passing the buck so we can't sell these motherboards or these monitors or power supplies like we usually would so we're just going to force the retailers to buy all this extra stuff that they don't need and that's where i got this case deal because people were just dumping cases they got them for about eighty five dollars a pop i think and they're dumping them for fifty dollars a pop and they have to buy say for instance the worst of it i heard was they had to buy 10 cases just to get an rtx 3080 which brought the cost of the 3080 to around 2 000 of course they then sell 10 cases get 500 back and they get the 30 80 for 15 hundred dollars and it's just a really this is in australian dollars so i definitely know that msi is doing this and also i've heard of zeus and gigabyte are doing this and this is through their distribution chains and they're forcing people essentially the retailers to take all the um rough end of the stick and so it kind of sucks to see that the retailers are copying all this hate when they're barely making any money and then they've got to dump all these products just to get a sale of a gaming pc for example on their books anyhow guys that wraps it up for march 2021's used pc parts hunt of the month if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then you know what to do hit that sub button ring that bell and also before i get on it here we got the question of the day which comes from tech yes uk love the name by the way great to see that you guys are repping that tech yes brand and they ask hey brian great video i do a lot of third and fourth gen stuff so really looking forward to the light windows 10 upload when's it due and it is due tomorrow make sure you stay tuned for that we're going to show you how to install the custom windows 10 first and if you want to make your own custom windows 10 then we'll include all the tools in that video say for instance the version that we made here at techy city if you guys want to take out even more features or add back some features in then this tutorial will teach you how to do that but in the end in terms of the performance we'll also have another video coming up after that showing the differences between our version and also the ghost specter version and also the default version so we're gonna have a three-way comparison it's also gonna be on potatoes and it's also gonna be on a high-end rig to see the differences hope you guys are staying tuned for that and with that aside do let us know your favorite deal as well and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
