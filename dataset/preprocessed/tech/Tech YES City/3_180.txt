if you've got a brand new pc with pre-installed junk or you've just built a custom pc or your pc might be running a little bit slower than usual then it may be time for a new custom windows 10 install whether you want an the box install or want to modify and create your own custom windows installer the first step is to download a fresh up-to-date windows iso disk image file this saves you time and bandwidth on downloading those large previous feature updates that you won't have to install anymore there are two options however for getting a windows iso here at tech yes city we've got a custom iso which we trim ourselves to get rid of the unnecessary windows apps and telemetry which actually helps boost fps through less ram and cpu usage we're planning on adding much more to it down the line but in the meantime i'll leave a link in the description below and the best thing about this install is since it's from the tech yes man you know you can trust it so straight away you can just go to google and search windows 10 iso and click on the link from www.microsoft.com don't click on any ww2 or ww3 links and when you're on the official microsoft website click on download media creation tool once that's downloaded open it accept the end user license agreement here is the first option you'll need a change swap it from upgrade this pc now to create installation media usb flash drive dvd or iso for another pc now when prompted with your windows install options you can most likely change the architecture to 64-bit because it's so common nowadays or if you aren't sure then you can always set it to both but that will of course result in actually a much larger installation disk file size which of course could set you back a few more dollars though for the majority of computers the recommended settings are going to be absolutely fine so i recommend just sticking with them the next step is just choosing where you want the iso to be downloaded to you can put it on the desktop or anywhere where you can find this iso file easily on the first folder of the c drive for example though while that's downloading you may need to think about activating your windows 10. if only i knew where to get a windows 10 installation key for oh today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered with 12 windows 10 pro key license these are the legitimate retail windows key licenses i've actually checked these out before called microsoft directly and they check out fine meaning once you've activated windows it's going to remain activated to that motherboard that you tied to forever now if you use the coupon code bf tyc on checkout you can get 30 off this windows 10 key price making it around 12. once you've got one of these keys all you have to then do is get that key from the website from scdkeys.com grab it and you can either do this two ways when you first install windows you can put this key in straight away and it'll activate windows you're done you're finished so to do this second method you just click on the start menu then go to the settings cog wheel and then when we're in settings we go to update and security and then we left click on activation and then we left click on change product key and then we can insert our new product key here and then click ok and it should activate i'll put the link in the description below if you guys want to get this let's get back to the video so now that your download of the iso is done you're going to want to get a bootable creatable program such as rufus i personally love using rufus it's straightforward it's free to use there's no costs involved it's like the one built into the media creation tool from microsoft but it has more options to tinker with and it is more reliable especially for custom installs so download the rufus application from rufus.ie insert the usb you want to make your windows installer on something to note is that the tool will need to delete everything on the drive in order to create the petitions needed to be marked as bootable but after the windows install is finished you can still add files to the usb like a normal drive this is handy for copying drivers chrome installer for example or whatever else you might need on a fresh install of windows so select the iso you just downloaded whether it's the tech yes city version or one that you've customized yourself and you may want to change the petition scheme too this is up to you it's optional gpt is newer and designed for non-csm uefi it has better data integrity and theoretically supports larger volumes which include raid arrays but if you're installing on older machines you will need an mbr scheme which works on both bios or uefi with csm enabled you are now ready to boot from your usb drive so put the usb in the computer you want to either install to or if you're using an older slower version reinstalled too it can even be the same computer you made the installer on turn off the computer and then turn the computer back on and immediately repeatedly start pressing the delete or f2 key until you see a menu come up just bear in mind if you're booting up a pc and it says memory configuration and it hasn't booted to boss yet you may need to keep pressing these keys until you get to a bios menu once you're in the menu called your bios if you have a button that says advanced settings then press that either way navigate to the exit tab and see if there is a boot override option if your usb shows up and your motherboard has this feature just press it and your computer will reboot to the usb installer if you don't have a boot override option however navigate to your boot tab or if you don't have a boot tab there will likely be a storage option it may also be under the advanced tab from there you need to change your usb to the highest priority priority one with your ssd second if you have one and your hard drives and other devices below that you may need to use your page up page down keys on the numpad your mouse or arrow keys depending on your model of bios once that's done navigate back to your exit tab and choose save or something along those lines of save and exit and if all that is done properly you should now see a windows loading icon with the little circle running around in circles followed by a purple screen if not then something hasn't worked try and get a friend to help or ask for some help from somewhere else once you're on the purple screen click next install now until you get an upgrade or a custom install click custom install if your drive already has windows on it you'll need to delete all the petitions for that drive so make sure you back up your data before you do this however this is an important point so before you install any windows on a drive with files already on it do make sure you backup important files you can see the drive number to make sure you're not deleting data from other drives too or if you're a skilled user you can press shift and f10 to open up command prompt and then use the disk part tool to clean and convert drives to either mbr or gpt manually once that's done click the drive and click next once the installer finishes copying it will tell you that you need to restart now if you're on an older machine with especially a non-uefi blast make sure you pull the usb stick out of the computer at this time and then after that let the computer restart and that's it some waiting some rebooting you'll get to custom call your pc whatever you want you can set a password in here even connect to the internet and download some updates if you want to but voila you've now installed windows and at this point in time i'd normally tell you guys to follow the optimization guides i've made over the years to disable as much telemetry and useless options as possible but if you want to make a custom install to save yourself time from doing these optimization guides or pretty much rip out all this useless bloatware and privacy and fringing modules from the roots we'll go back to where we downloaded the windows 10 iso and we'll go from there [Music] so these next steps we're going down are for advanced users and we've already gone down this route for you guys so if you want to download a version of windows 10 that has done pretty much cut out all the crap and it's just left with a nice beautiful gaming version of windows 10 then we'll put the link in the description below but if you want to understand the science behind it even just customize your own options within windows 10 then let's get on to it for this you'll need 7-zip to extract the file and get all the archives out from within on the msmg toolkit and make sure the name of the folder doesn't have any spaces next copy the windows iso to the dvd folder and extract it to the same folder using 7zip once that's done go back to the main msmg toolkit folder and open start.cmd and click yes to the administrator rights popup press the a key to accept the end user license agreement after all the folders are loaded press any key then press 1 to enter the source menu then after that press 7 to extract source from custom windows esd image select the additions you plan on installing for me i'm going to press 6 and then enter because i only use windows 10 pro keys and i want the installer to be more streamlined to reflect that you can press the asterisks to select all additions if you aren't sure and once that's done go to the main menu by pressing any key once you're there you can press 7 to enter the tools menu and then one to enter the whim manager from here you can press a to display all the additions you've got in the folder press b to rename an addition c to delete any additions you don't need like the education or end versions and press x when you're done go back to the source menu and press 1 to select source from dvd folder once that's done go back to the main menu if you have any specific drivers or language packs you need then press 2 to integrate them you will need to download the language packs from the msmg toolkit website now you can integrate any windows feature you want to be pre-installed the only ones i would recommend are directx 9x and visual c plus plus runtime but do not install net 3.5 now or it will give you problems and errors all these features you will need to download from the msmg toolkit website though the next step is an important one you'll need to install windows updates for your machine you will need to go to catalog.update.microsoft.com and search for two things first is servicing stack update windows 10. the important thing is here is that it's for x64 installs and not arm 64. the second update you need to search for is cumulative update windows 10. put those two files in the update slash windows 10 slash architecture folder and then press windows updates in the integrate menu that will take a while even on my 10900k it took a solid 15 minutes after that's done you can go to the remove option from the main menu and from there you can press remove windows components and then select windows components and then select whatever you don't need but in my case it's a matter of what little you do need for internet components i disabled adobe flash because it's been disabled in windows anyway but i left the browsers because certain features won't work without it for multimedia i left first login animation and snipping tool in privacy the only option i left on was pin sign in support but you may want face recognition location service and wi-fi network manager depending on your machine i turned off everything in the remoting menu in system i disabled everything except paint system restore backup and firewall for system apps i left content delivery manager file explorer windows store and xbox client because i like to play forza but if you don't play anything xbox or on the windows store you probably won't need these two so you can get rid of them in windows apps i left alarms and clocks calculator desktop app installer google vp9 photos screen sketch sticky notes windows store xbox console companion and xbox identity provider once you've gone through selecting what you want and don't want go back and press start removing windows components and when you've done that you now have the option of customizing your windows install but i found that this sometimes ended in windows install not booting so i wouldn't recommend it when that's done go to the main menu press apply and then press apply and save changes to source images and then press no to the do you want to clean up image folder as it can also cause issues when that is done you want to press 6 to get into the target menu and press 1 to make a dvd iso image choose a name for your usb and after that you can press enter and you can choose a name for your iso file cool done use rufus easy peasy and that is how you can make a custom windows 10 install with all the fat cut off and just the components you need now we've done this personally around the studio here and it's dropped the ram utilization down significantly to the point where we've got some not only differences in the windows utilization on potatoes for example if you've only got eight gigabytes of ram on a system this is going to make quite a big difference but also in terms of fps even on higher end machines you can extract that bit more by just cutting out all this crap that you don't need but also found loading some things was just a little bit faster and snappier but of course that could be my placebo kicking in but if you guys want the best in terms of windows 10 install then i'll put that link in the description below and also put all the links for the other stuff that we talked about in the description below but just to prove this to you guys we're going to have an upcoming video where we're comparing the tech yes version to the default windows full fat install then compare that to a highly requested ghost spectre install that's been making the rounds on the internet and we're going to talk about these three versions what all the differences are but if you want to see that video as soon as it drops here at techgear city then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell also if you enjoyed today's video be sure to hit that like button for us and let us know
