Today we're going to be building a budget 
gaming pc with a very weird twist and that is   this 1080 ti i picked this up for 600 aussie 
dollars on a recent deals hunt i'll put the   link to that video up here but someone 
messaged me and they wanted me to trade   this and four hundred dollars my way and a 1070 ti 
so i just said that seems like a good deal it's in   my favor and so whenever trades work out in your 
favor usually you take them up so out of the good   courtesy of my heart i've given this graphics card 
right here some tech yes ultra clean lovin and now   we're gonna go deliver the goods and of course 
after you do this kind of cleaning the thing runs   even better than brand new but let's go jump in 
the car and then we'll talk about what other parts   we're going to peace out for what's going 
to be the best price performance gaming pc   i've put together in 2021 hey bro are you tired 
of seeing this annoying activate windows message   then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you 
covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code   bftyc you can get activated today works for 
windows 11 pro 2. link's in description below so we ended up just hitting up this 1070 ti 
it was weird he had 350 cash then he put 50   in my bank account so that's the trade done 
there but also someone's messaged me now and   we're gonna go quickly pick up a pc for 400 
aussie sometimes when you're doing stuff on   the road so many different things come 
up and you're just like yeah let's roll we're now back with the 1070 ti and when i handed 
over the card they just messaged me about 20   minutes ago and said they were super happy with 
it they were absolutely loving it and they gave me   the 1070 ti which they've cleaned up and they've 
actually changed the thermal paste around so   i really won't have to give it any more cleaning 
but on that note we've effectively got this gravis   card for 200 aussie dollars a 1070 ti which in 
this market especially considering all those   miners are still buying gpus it's a very good deal 
and so the way that we did that was we had the   higher price card and we had the more desirable 
card at least for people who want to upgrade and   they're willing to trade their inferior card and 
pay more so this really makes it one of the better   deals that i've got on gpus but we'll talk about 
some of the other stars of the show here because   i'll put up the total tally of this build for you 
and how much it's going to set me back now the   next ripper deal that we've got here is a 600 watt 
power supply this is from fsp it's 80 plus and now   some people who build pcs and if they're giving 
you advice they might tell you to stay away from   used power supplies but over the course of years 
of building pcs i've never had a problem with a   used power supply that's passed the power supply 
tester considering i haven't gone crazy with the   uh demand on that power supply for instance don't 
get a 450 watt power supply and then go chuck a   1080 ti on it with an 8 core cpu and expect it 
to be an absolutely amazing experience so you've   always got to match your power supply to the 
goods so 600 watt power supply for a ryzen 5   1600 and a 1070 ti is going to be absolutely fine 
especially when it's giving out good readings   on this power supply tester now some of the other 
really good deals that makes this build is a 25   a320 motherboard we got this super cheap off 
the used market i've actually had it here in   the studio for a while however it didn't come with 
an io shield so that's the downside sometimes you   get a cheaper product there is a little bit of a 
negative there but we've also got the ryzen 5 1600   and we got that for 90 dollars in the parts hunt 
now we are adding in some drives the 120 gigabyte   ssds really cheap really good for that base drive 
then we're adding in a two terabyte drive to keep   the storage up and put all your games on then for 
the case we've got here a new part that is a tr   1100 three ring fans and also i can take out the 
power supply that's included and use that in an   office pc later on the line and then last of all 
we've got the ram which we also went new with some   kingston fury i picked this up off the new sale on 
ebay and it's got rgb as well as the motherboard   having some leds on it we're gonna have a little 
bit of bling since we are going with that ray   stealth cooler so we're gonna add on the bling 
as much as we can with getting some good deals on my own i'm doing what i'm doing i don't got a lot to 
prove and if i'm moving then i'm proving cause the whole room naked facing windows so   is oh and so after finishing playing call of duty 
warzone the first title we were getting over a   hundred fps at pretty much all the time at high 
settings at 1080p now the point one percent one   percent loads were very smooth that has to do with 
the ram mainly on ryzen cpus you definitely want   dual channel two sticks of memory and we've tuned 
it up to 3200 megahertz and that's really making   a difference and i've noticed no stuttering in 
this title just as apex legends which is now free   to play on steam i mean it's been free to play on 
steam for a while i think but i haven't played it   in a long time so i was playing the dude who drops 
the um the like the traps and stuff like that and   i was running around and i was uh getting a few 
frags however what i noticed with warzone and also   apex is that the players who play these games are 
pretty good like the average level of competition   is definitely going to be good at least on the 
servers that i'm playing on so you'll definitely   want a pc that doesn't stutter especially when 
it comes to those clutch team fights and that's   exactly what this pc was bringing it was bringing 
a smooth experience that anyone can get onto and   play games really well even though it only has 
the first generation ryzen i found this to be very   good value for money you couple that with the a320 
motherboard and you're going to get phenomenal   price performance and if you want to play a lot 
of these popular multiplayer titles then you've   also still got all those latest instruction sets 
on the ryzen 5 1600 avx2 and you can still upgrade   something like a 3600 later on down the line 
without having to change your motherboard if   you want a bit more performance on the cpu though 
in terms of power consumption we were using up   about 280 watts though most this power consumption 
will come from the graphics card and in this case   you're probably wondering well this has got the 
blower style cooler and they usually run pretty   hot and loud and this is how loud it's running at 
the moment we did set a custom fan profile with   msi afterburner and what this does is essentially 
raises the fan speeds above default where   at the default levels it was going into the 80 
degree region but after a custom fan profile   it does increase the noise a little bit but we 
still keep the temperatures in the mid 70s and   the race stealth was doing a fine job of keeping 
the cpu at around 70 degrees too and this cheap   case here even though it's budget we put that 12 
centimeter fan in we added that into the budget   and that we put that on the rear just to exhaust 
the hot air since it originally didn't have that   and surprisingly the whole build was quiet and 
still doing a decent job of keeping temperatures   quite low anyhow as it stands moving forward the 
prices of graphics cards is the hardest component   anyone i talk to right now getting gravis cards 
is still the most difficult part when it comes   to building a pc and in this case this might be 
another avenue you wish to explore where say for   instance you find a higher end gpu at a better 
price there's definitely someone out there that   may want to trade up and then you can get a really 
good deal like we did on this 1070 ti so that's   just some food for thought but when it comes to 
the other parts in the build everything else in   this build just like the gpu even though the gpu 
was bit of a luckier find was a really good price   so hope you guys enjoyed this one if you have any 
questions or comments be sure to ask below but as   it stands i really enjoyed putting this thing 
together and some of the best price performance   definitely 2021 that i've put together so far 
so with that aside we've got the question of the   day here which comes from tristan gray and they 
ask how did we get to the point where a budget   graphics card is 500 plus crazy to me honestly at 
this point after 20 years i may become a console   gamer so they're referring to the rx 6600 xt where 
we pretty much said what the pricing would be on   the streets and it is around 500 for this card 
and unfortunately when you look at the card itself   it's pretty much similar in terms of an rx 580 
or a gtx 1060 in the actual components not in the   performance the performance is a lot better than 
those two graphics cards in question but in terms   of the actual components and everything in terms 
of where it should cost it should be around a 250   card but the demand right now for gpus especially 
the newer ones that are much more efficient   they the crypto miners are still buying these 
things up and putting them on mining benches so   when you've got that element at play then it's 
always going to raise the prices artificially   higher and so you're going to see this continue 
on in the gpus as long as minings are relatively   profitable versus the price of power and 
electricity that people are paying you're going to   see this trend continue but there's also the other 
factor i've spoken about inflation as well this is   a big one that's definitely a more of a reactive 
thing that's coming into play with the 389 msrp   which we spoke about in our review but in terms of 
going forward graphics cards are definitely i feel   going to be higher priced than what they have 
been in the past due to that inflation element   it's just in terms of crypto miners stacking onto 
the demand and raising the prices what's the real   prices of these cards going to be we're only going 
to find out once the miners go away so until that   happens we won't actually know the true price 
that the market's going to set these cards at   though what you said about the console they're 
actually extremely good value for the money   right now in terms of what you're getting in 
those things not just in terms of the actual   specs but the gpu power going into all the new 
gen consoles is really impressive for the money   so i mean i don't blame people if they're pc 
gamers and they're switching over to console   it's perfectly valid right now it's actually 
extremely difficult especially for someone   buying parts off the internet to beat the value 
that the new consoles bring anyhow i hope that   answers that question and if you stayed this 
far and you're enjoying that content be sure   to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll 
catch you in the next one peace out for now bye you
