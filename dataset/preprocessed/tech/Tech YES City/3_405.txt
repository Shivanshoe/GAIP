imagine this you've bought your nice budget for core i7 3770 all-in-one PC you're gonna try and slap a graphics card in it and try and flip it and make some money but there's this weird error that's occurring when you try to boot it now it's going beep beep and then it's having a break and then it's gonna beep beep beep again when we check since it is an ace of eret on m-66 20g we check the user manual and it doesn't show any errors reporting or pertaining to this beep code however upon searching on Google which Google is going to be a great resource for finding out things that you need that other people have experienced especially in the case of them experiencing the exact same problem we found that this is actually an undocumented error with this particular motherboard in that the boot block has become corrupted and so what we have now is this system working where we've installed Windows just a basic install of Windows and we're going to try from here on in just flashing the BIOS but first off I want to show you exactly what the problem is because initially I took out 2 sticks of RAM and it booted up fine so I was like wow ok we've probably got one faulty stick of memory when in actual fact it's the motherboard itself so we're gonna show you the error and what to do to get around it and how to try and get your PC to boot if you come into a problem like this and then of course after that we're gonna show you the solution and that is to reflash the BIOS and in the case of an OEM we've really got a locked-down Windows Update flash so let's just dive into these problems have you built a PC recently only to be met with the windows needs activation message in the bottom right hand corner even whilst you're playing games well if you want to get rid of this message and you don't want to spend $200 plus on a key then today's video sponsor s CD Keys has you covered for as little as 15 bucks after using the coupon code TYC SK you can get yourself a single and user license that's the legitimate keys quickly and easily then you get the key click on change product key in Windows activation paste that okay and then click Next and you're good to go links in description below to get your key today me so what we found with this motherboard in particular it's just a matter of trial and error where we initially took out two of the RAM sticks after changing the CMOS battery and then it didn't boot it still gave us out an error message so what we found with this motherboard in particular it likes two sticks of memory in the blue slots so if I try and boot it with one stick of memory is gonna give us those same beep codes but for some bizarre reason if we reinsert two sticks of memory here in the same two blue slots we have a decent chance of it booting up so again we're just trying to salvage this motherboard here without trying trying to untangle a power supply wire on it and we hopefully should get a boot out of it this time nope that is another problem so this is just what it is with this the corrupted boot cycle we've just got a keep on going and seeing what we can do even trying things like taking out the power supply out the power cable out the back here just trying to reinsert that basically until we can get this thing to boot into Windows again so be able to do a BIOS flash and so luckily that way that was really weird cuz just putting the power cord out and in again actually got the error message up here that allowed us to boot again so very very bizarre problem actually haven't run into this specific problem before I mean I have seen it with gigabyte motherboards where you've had to initiate the backup BIOS which is flash the original boss because that's become corrupted but in this case here it's it's sort of it's just one of those weird things where I strange anyway let's get into windows and try and flash this thing and see if it fixes it [Music] so we can see now it is flashing the BIOS on this lovely little Verret on here but it was a initially it was a case of mistaken identity where we had this BIOS on the website said not for upgrades or something but anyway that BIOS probably doesn't work I mean a so do some weird things where I'm guessing you can only flash reflash the original BIOS on that motherboard itself so we'll see how this goes let's see if this works and then it solves our problems fingers crossed [Music] this is good news it looks like the reset for the first time has worked normally so this is hopefully fixed our problems we're just going to continue that's right we're just gonna hit continue would even need to go into the boss we're that confident that our PC is now working normally of course we're going to try and install the other two sticks of memory now and set this whole computer up and then maybe run a heaven benchmark I mean if I got a bit of free time and may even play a bit of fortnight on it who knows I should probably just call it something else exactly what is it [Music] so the UniGene have been benchmark and also fortnight checked out absolutely fine we've now installed the 16 gigabytes of RAM everything's booting fine everything has been alleviated though this problem really marks something that's going to worry me a little bit going forward and that is a phenomenon known as data degradation aka bit rot and in this case the bios boot block or that little chip that holds the BIOS firmware that obviously degraded over time where it's basically I researched up about it and the insulation on the chip itself isn't perfect so over time the electrical charges that hold the data lose their charge and so basically reflashing the bios essentially can give it another 10 years of life or so before it starts to become corrupted again and so it is a worry for not just BIOS boot blocks but other things like DVD drives or if you've got old game cartridges then sealing them in a perfect sealed environment is one thing to consider if you want to keep hold of that especially if you're like a collector or something like that though in relation to PCs like this reflashing your bios whether it's an OEM or if it's an older Zeus or MSI or gigabyte or asrock motherboard may help bring that PC back to fully working order where nothing essentially is faulty on the motherboard that rather over time that BIOS boot block which holds that firmware has just become corrupted though we solve today's problem quickly and easily one thing that does leave me scratching my head and I am quite concerned about and I don't have the answer for and I'd love it if you guys chimed in in the comments and if you knew a definitive answer that would be amazing and that is what about the firmware on the CPU as well as the USB controllers and the solder controllers are they susceptible to the same bit rot over time and what do we do to alleviate that if that becomes corrupt so that's one thing I'm left not knowing the answer to because it could cause problems in the future perhaps love reading your thoughts and opinions on this but we've essentially made this computer work like brand-new again it's absolutely fine and it was a weird problem which I have come into but not for this particular model precisely anyway with that aside if you enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button for us and we've got the question of the day which comes from Gary buck man and they asked do you think I could go higher than 4.5 gigahertz with a Corsair age 50 and they're referring to the Xeon X 56 75 which we did in this video put the link up here and essentially I found that these CPUs go from around 4.4 to 4.6 gigahertz even with a age 50 or even a better 240 all in one liquid cooler though if you are in really cold ambient environments I have heard people getting these stable - like 4.7 4.8 gigahertz with the right motherboard and power supply your mileage may vary I just think 4.5 gigahertz is usually a level that you can obtain on these CPUs with a pretty good cooler pretty good motherboard pretty good power supply day-in day-out and I live in pretty much hotter ambient conditions and that's the levels that I'm finding personally so you may be able to get a higher you've just got to test that for yourself and be the judge anyway hope that answers that question and I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying the content and you're not yet sub then you know what to do options are down there for that and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now [Music]
