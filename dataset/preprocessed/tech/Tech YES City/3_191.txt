[Music] so i just jumped in the Tech Yes mobile and i have road tripped over nine hours to see a custom pc builder designsbyIFR what's going on man and ever since i've seen his work i have been really wanting him to do or collab with him basically i'm not going to lie i've been wanting him to build me something custom bling bling and show worthy and then asrock last year they sent over the z490 act when they said brian it will only send you this board if you do something special with it and i said sure i can try i'm going to try and do something special with this and build my dream pc and i've just got the tech yes city logo i've been just for years i've been really wanting to have one of these flash pcs i've been saving up and finally we've got the chance to do that with today's build where i'm going to employ the services of designs by ifr and he is going to help us build a z490 aqua and we're going to get the bios update on this thing and we can then maybe in the future put 11 900k and you have to wait for that and see how that performs but we've got an rtx 3080 and corsair they sent over the rtx 3080 water block so we're able to do a custom water loop with a 3080 build here and this is just going to turn out we're thinking like a white and red theme and we're going to just document all the steps involved for you guys and then of course we'll give the build a dedicated showroom run once it's finished with overclocking gaming performance but this is going to be the journey of the new tech yes custom gaming pc by our man here designed by i'm face roll [Music] oh so here's the preliminary what we're doing right now is just planning out and mapping out how this build is going to look like so we put the cpu underneath the block here for the motherboard we've put the block on the rtx 38 and it's like this little rtx 3080 looks so cute now but in the background there corey is doing the logos where we're going to have two logos featured on the build here the tech yes city in red going across here and then the etching on the front glass is going to be a yes going down the front there and this build i've decided that i'm going to go mainly predominantly with a white and red theme build so the gpu loop is mostly going to have red going through it pastel red then the loop for the cpu will have white now i've got a little bit of a difficult way of doing things because we're going to have a 360 ml right at the front 240 at the back but corey's like what do you want to go with on this build corey's like what are you thinking here and i was like well i want to go a little bit kind of like i don't even know if it's one of those like symmetrical things or something because traditionally wanted the pipes to go up like that but i was like well how about we mix this one line in with this line and mix this other line in with this line so we're going to have a bit of a white and red themed contrast and then the red on the leds on the ram i just think that'll look so pop-a-loppin so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna start getting to work but we've got to first cut off the holes here so these tubes can run through and the top part of the build can start getting underway let's do this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so here we are now on day three of this build right here and we we talked about these i think we talked about these before the inverted pipes here which corey said look what do you want to do brian with this tubing and i'm like well instead of going straight up can we like do some fancy inverted bends where they come and the pipes then sort of go backwards because we're going to go like front back front back front back front and he was like yeah i can do that and he did it and corey's like just smashing through this build now to the point where we've now got this top plate on here and then we're gonna route all these different uh connections to each other and then that'll be the most hardest part of the build done and i know what you guys are thinking like let's get through this build so we can see all the water going through but the process in the journey sometimes is a lot more fun than the actual build itself so we're just going to keep on working on this now so we're going to try and complete this bit here and we'll update you guys on when the roof is going to start getting [Applause] filled [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Applause] and after over half a day later we're now with a little bit of an update on progress here we got the front glass with the etched tech yeah city logo on there as well as a chevron pattern that is going to look absolutely amazing i think once the rgb starts lighting up and shines through it and the front's going to look just as good as the center of the build and of course the top of the bill which looking at this it's really interesting because corey suggested that we go with this design and i mean i'm just like corey taking your leeway here taking your advice because he's the water cooling expert and i gotta say this thing is coming together so nicely where the top of the build now is also gonna be a separate showroom piece of its own because we're going to lift up we're actually in the process now of lifting up this top glass panel here about 16 millimeters because once we put these top tubes on here the glass won't sit flush anymore so we're in the progress of doing that we had to take the double sided tape off and that was really tedious because corsair used some extremely hard to take off double-sided tape where we had to use a heat gun and a scraper to get that off but now we're in the process of raising that and so once that's raised this top part of the build will also be another feature point and that also takes away from clutter and connecting all the tubes inside the build itself so it allows this to be more cleaner on its own so that's just looking absolutely mint so far but what we're going to do now is finish off this top panel where we actually got to re-spray it a little bit and then we're going to be connecting the inside of the build up and then hopefully we can get this thing filled up by tonight but we're also in the process of thinking of some names for this build i'm yet to come up with one yet but uh we'll think of something [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] i just felt the bin everywhere okay that's all people need to see they didn't see my face hit him so like and subscribe guys comment down below and uh yeah we'll see in the next one by the way brian has patreon so sign up for that as well and all that good stuff hey did somebody say menu dog okay what have we got oh well the build's gonna be in shot there we go okay well i'll just i'll just poke my head out here you can do this like if you put it on like can all right guys so we are now finished the synthetic sewer that's what i decided to call what do you think of the name mate it's so unique that's that's for sure [Laughter] we had a really good time building this thing uh even though a little bit uh corey built most of it um it was absolutely like it turned out exactly how i really wanted to turn out the red the white the pop the led lights are there the performance is going to be there we'll we will show you guys the whole build how it performs that'll be my next video corey's going to break down this whole build on his channel uh with his usual type of montage and going through everything he's done in order to get this build to look as good as it does but what do you think what's your personal thoughts on this build oh i could actually yeah i like how we did all the tubing otherwise pretty cool we haven't done one like that in quite a while and there was like a couple of unique bands like you know your special requests getting it over the reservoir and then back up so yeah let's give it a go eh so that's uh yeah when corey asked me how i wanted these bends to be i had this vision in my head symmetry math and that's that's what kind of came out it's like the uh it's it's like a sewer system except it's yeah it's not bad it's a good sewer system that's it so that's uh that's how it's all worked out and the plumbing's there and it's absolutely phenomenal this build was worth the drive the nine-hour drive down definitely worth it to get all this work done from corey it's been absolutely phenomenal guys so make sure you check him out on his channel designsbyfr where if you guys want to get into the world of water cooling he has all different sorts of things he does from custom painting to making panels up to making unique designs labels acrylic glass etching all that good stuff so it's absolutely mind-blowing to see how much like extra work goes into these builds besides just your regular connecting up the pipes and that's the thing a lot of people don't recognize some of the small details that go into it as well and that's like the just the build itself i'm pretty sure cory could do a custom water cooled build in a day just like just the the main works of this but all the extra little things going into it like you had to cut out the whole top here put the glass on the top and extend it rises we're even going to do some other finishing touches in this build still there's still a little bit to go inside that's going to make its way into the final cut we're doing that now but we're going to close this off because i will have to leave sydney unfortunately in a couple of days after return to the gold coast after a few more menu logs yeah look we've been uh we've been getting delivery like a g c um it has been good because yeah i'm not gonna lie that does save a lot of time so and then anyway but it's been an absolute pleasure to just build with corey and his work is some of the best if not the best i've seen when it comes to custom water cooling so i'm definitely going to be when i get into doing stuff like this where i make myself maybe a future build i try and do this and ask corey for hints along the way because some of the things he did man was just like you have to see it to believe it the way he works his work ethic is on point that's as much as you see the guys like yo hit the subscribe button guys hit the like button and all the all the sort of uh mates there you go mate they're behind the um behind the bogan there is a bit of a well actually a lot of um dedication and planned concise work and it really shows in his build so but anyway guys we'll be doing uh also i'll try to see gear seekers another youtuber while i'm down in uh down in sydney here and thank you so much corey for helping us out and i love just working with other youtubers it's so much fun to see how other people do stuff in the land of tech of course parts like this the rtx 3080 and uh yeah especially the rtx 3080 the the parts shortages on graphics cards and the crypto thing we like when as soon as i got this founders card in i had planned to do a custom waterloo this custom waterloo believe it or not has been in planning for like talking about for a beer i think since 2019 that's how long as soon as i met corey and we met in 2019 as soon as i met him and we had dinner and drinks i knew i needed to get we had to collab that was the plan so it's been that long through that we've finally been able to plan something and get something done so really stoked about this build i absolutely love the way it turned out and yeah there it is stay tuned for the next part series where we're going to be showcasing this thing and what it can really do and see how high i can overclock it as well in terms of fps what it can do so i'm hoping it can beat an rtx 3090 as well so i'm pretty sure it will do that so thanks so much corey and anything you want to say to the viewers before we get on out of here so guys uh make sure you leave a like make sure you're subscribed and we'll see you all in the next one peace out for now bye peace out for now bye [Music] you
