in episode one we started out with a
measly hundred aussie dollars episode two we turned that 100
we turned it into 520 aussie dollars then we've got some really good news now
here for episode three where we got that 520
and we built two complete gaming setups and we turned that into 1320 aussie
dollars now both the setups they sold for asking
price and they actually sold within two days very quickly it must
have been that call of duty warzone background on
the monitors because i had a friend who saw that and then he
uh did the same thing and sold his computer very fast using that
background so maybe it's all about the call of duty war zone at the moment
perhaps fortnite is no longer the big selling
point anyhow what we've got here on the desk is two
well they're not complete yet but these setups right here this one here in
particular was an absolute bargain uh the poor guy he messaged me directly
because he sold a pc to me in the past and now he
tried selling this pc and he sold it he said he tried selling
it on a forum and he got absolutely ridiculed for the cable management he
just couldn't deal with all the people just like you know giving
him flack and all that and i mean to be fair the cable
management yeah you know it's a it's a bit of a jungle sandwich but he
said to me look you're reliable uh would you give me 500 aussie dollars
for this setup and i just said sure like what's in it
and he just said i5 9600 kf 16 gigabytes of ddr4 and a gtx 1060 6gb as soon as i heard all that i was like yeah i'm coming to get this
thing but it looks like we've also got two
ssds in here a hard drive down right down there
and an nzxt case a water cooler rgb of course we're going to clean this thing
up right now but here's the other pc that we ended up
picking up and this one we got for 300 aussie
dollars so we still need to add a graphics card
into this equation which we've still got 26 dollars left
over from the previous episode plus three led fans and a bluetooth dongle
and we've got to add that on so we've technically now got a budget of
1346 aussie dollars so minus 800 now which gives us room to get a really good
graphics card and then put that in this system which
i'm thinking and then we can change it and put the 1060 in this one which is an
i7 4790 with 16 gigabytes of ram and also a 750
watt thermaltake power supply it's weird
though because it does have two one terabyte hard drives inside
plus apparently there's an ssd in there somewhere so both these systems need to
be cleaned up but whilst we're cleaning it up we're
going to look for some graphics cards on good old gamtran
facebook and see what we can find let's get into it and
then when we're waiting for the replies on the graphs cards
we can start giving these some tech yes lovin
if you want to cop yourself a legit windows 10 pro oem

instantly delivered and they've even got paypal links in description below
[Music] crazy
and i don't really do dancing baby i don't care [Music]
got me up all night so we've now cleaned this thing down at
least initially and there was just so many wires to pull
out there was so much dust i mean the two wipes that i
used were just flooded with dirt and thermal paste but
now we've got a important thing and that is if you're
putting together pcs do make sure that you're only using one
ecosystem of rgb especially if you've only got like a
mid-sized atx tower or smaller this case we've got two different
ecosystems here cooler master and then corsair and it just added so
many extra wires to the equation but the good thing about this is now is
we've pulled out these three one 40 mil fans
and we can use them for a later date perhaps even
sell them individually as three fans and a controller
but what we're going to do now is maybe i'm thinking we're going to
see what fans we've got from that previous pull out that we did in the
previous episode and then put them in i kind of do want
to use two of the same fans just basically one
outtake here one on outtake here and perhaps we might even have enough
to do intake as well but it's a weird situation i'm going to have
some deep thought but in the meantime there is some really
good news and that is we found an rx 5700 and we put down an offer of 450
aussie dollars on it and they've accepted they've they're
asking 500 but in this current climate again gpus just seem to be the rage
everybody wants them so we're going to go jump in the yes mobile
and go pick that thing up right now so we can
complete hopefully if we don't come into problems we can complete
both of these builds behind me tonight danger danger danger so i'm just about
to jump in the car and get going and the guy messages me
back and he says he wants to meet at a gas station
now general rule of thumb do not meet someone at a gas station
for a at least a tech product that's worth any sort of money
because you're just pretty much going to risk yourself getting hosed now what
happened here was that i messaged him back and said
hey dude just watch your address i'd be much more comfortable just picking it up
i'm able to get i've got wheels i can come pick it up from you
and he just said like no he keeps insisting that i meet him at the gas
station and so i just i just i'm gonna let that
deal slide because yeah it's that's how you get
hosed in the land of tech and i mean i don't want to be making my way back
down to a hundred bucks with this flip up challenge so anyhow
what else is cooking there's got to be something else cooking and
there are two things first of all i've got to jump in the car anyway because
i've got to go do a tech yes delivery for a
separate thing outside this video and the second thing is we've got some
offers down on rtx 2060s i put an offer down on 400
there was a 2060 super put an offer down to 500 and that's the max we can outlay
for a graphics card 500 the max any more than that we're going to pretty
much be cutting so close to that budget but we're hopeful that we can get maybe
that or even a 1660 super which i dropped in
an offer of 330 dollars so there's three graphics
cards that are still outstanding hopefully by the time we've done this
tech yes delivery get back here and start cleaning again
one of these gpu offers might have gotten back to us
[Music] mmm
[Music] so it's now the next morning and i
actually go to bed pretty early nowadays and wake up early
sort of like i heard that's the best um techies loving you can do for your body
if you do that sort of phase rather than going to bed late and waking up late
anyway this gravity right here this is gravis
card sorry rtx 2060. we got it for 400 aussie dollars
which is pretty good price i mean nowadays graphics cards on the used
market they just even if they're something like this they tend to go
pretty much close to what they're worth it's it's kind of a crazy
scenario right here where i'm at gravis guys are just going pretty much near
retail even if they're used so the fact that we're on a competition
when you keep the prices as low as possible
it's a good thing because we're coming under budget we've got two pcs to build
up now this one's almost finished right here
we just got to give it some more cleaning and then we're going to put
this rtx 2060 in it and this one right here is going to need
probably even more even more special love and care because
it's got a lot of dirt on it a lot of smudge marks
but let's get this one done first see if there's any problems
and then we'll get back to building up the second pc
[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so we've completed the first pc here and
this is one thing i'm going to say is that the blue and the red
you can even see it like reflecting off the keyboard that's something i'm going
to make a note of in the photos because i
just think it looks really cool but we've got the first pc here it's come up
really nicely we've got the uh we've pulled out a
whole eco still two ecosystems of rgb and fans we can use that for a later
date as well as controls and hubs and we've just cleaned up the whole
inside of this build it's now just looking in my opinion it's looking
really mint we've added a one dollar led strip
a red one there just to really show off the inside of the case as well as that
power supply shrouds covering all the cables down the bottom so
overall i'm just i'm digging what this is
looking like like even from above you can see that blue
led fans just shining through and it's really like i'm just liking how it's
contrasting with the red and then giving you purple on your
keyboard so one pc down we've got one more to go but
i've got to eat some breakfast quickly and i'm thinking with this one uh we'll
actually we'll finish the second one up and then we'll talk about what we're
going to do with pricing but this one right here we've got to
quickly install windows and then run all the stress tests on it while we're
building up the other one and getting it ready [Music] but this is another benefit too we've
pulled out a 60 gigabyte ssd because there's two ssds inside
and the one in there's a 240 at the moment with a one terabyte hard drive
we've also pulled out three 140 mil uh corsair
the controller hub as well as the cooler master ardb
fan too so we've got two different ecosystems now of higher end
rgb gear we can put in a higher end build in the future
as well as a smd for a budget build if we decide to take that route
and here we are now we've finished this pc this one took quite a bit of
cleaning and we had to rip the top off the case clean that fan
but overall we got four fans in here and the gtx 1060 and the i7 4790
so it's a pretty good combo 240 gigabyte ssd one terabyte hard drive
this should sell pretty well now we're running unigine heaven in the background
this is uh low settings as this will generally
stress out the cpu and gpu uh pretty good like in sort of some sort
of a balance now it's not a full-on stress test on both ends like you can go
furmark for the gpu of course you can go like cinebench r20
loop if you want to stress out cpu and the motherboard stuff like that but
i've never had a pc come back that's run this stress test for a few hours here at
the studio so that's a good sign because i know some
people out there like look heaven's not a proper stress test
but i just say to that you guys do what works for you i'm to do what works for
me and what we've got right here is a pc
that is indeed working for me so the last thing we're
going to do now is actually run over to this pc over here because there was a
problem that i've got to investigate it's not
actually a faulty problem so to speak but it actually does lead to
a very different tangent something that the guy when he
sold it to me he said he was getting scammed and if
if it does look like what i think it is then this poor guy who bought this pc
originally off the guy who shipped it to him
did get one of the biggest and most deceptive hosings ever
and we'll talk about that very soon but i'm going to just quickly investigate it
change over what i think needs to be changed over as
well as photo and b-roll i'll do some b-roll for you guys on both
these builds on that table over there and we'll also photo shoot them as well
so let's get that done you tech gee city
so this is as i thought this is a one terabyte hard drive
now this is pretty scary because the person who sold
me this pc said he had got hosed from a guy who
had posted him two pcs and this was the second one now
what this means i think this is the proof that the guy was just telling
every all the truth this here has been petitioned in raid mode to be a 450
gigabyte hard drive from an original one terabyte hard drive which means that
it originally was a semi faulty drive now you can only do this
on semi-faulty drives because a faulty drive won't even allow you to get
to the boot screen like if it's a proper faulty hard drive the pc won't even boot
properly it'll just pretty much time out this here is
probably got a bad cluster on it or whatever and now it's good that
someone's reusing that but i'm guessing they had sold that to the poor guy as a
one terabyte drive when they had clustered it down to a 450
gigabyte drive which means that they knew well they know quite a bit
about tech when and that's the scary thing
they weren't just like a dude who put together a banger pc
there was someone who knew what they were doing when they put
this pc together for this poor guy on the gold coast here
and they had hosed him like someone who was really knowledgeable in tech
had hosed down this poor dude and that's like that's the scariest thing because
if you've got the skills to do this then you've got the skills to
definitely have a legitimate it business fixing up people's pcs and whatnot you
don't need to scam someone the way that this poor
guy got scammed so anyway the really good news is we've got a one
terabyte drive an extra one that we pulled out of that system over there
and so we're gonna use this one in this build
so as fate would have it i guess sometimes that's just how
things go very weird way for things to go but
hey whatever let's uh let's finish off these pcs now and take some photos
and then we'll get to a conclusion and now those two pcs they came in they
got the full tech yes loving treatment from tip to
toe and now they are two beautiful pcs that are running
really nicely they're quiet they've got good performance they're
going to get good fps they've got ssds hard drives 16 gigabytes of ram in both
of them and of course you're probably wondering
how much am i going to put these up for sale for
and i'm thinking the gtx 1066 gigabyte i'm going to try and hopefully get
around a thousand aussie dollars for that
and then the rtx 2060 pc with the 9600 kf
i'm going to push for around 1350 aussie dollars for that
so if we get both those pc's sold we're going to go for
2 350 aussie dollars which is going to put us in a
really good spot all things considered that's if i can get
the money for both of those i think in the nzxt one that'll sell pretty quickly
because whenever i've put up an nzxt case with
led lights in it it just goes really quickly people love
the look of that case and if you do it right and you bling it
up in a particular way then it just goes like out the door
really quickly though going through this series one thing you'll probably notice
by now is that we're doing i'd say a lot more
cleaning than i'm used to doing especially on these two rigs today
i went to town on these things tip to toe and that's kind of what you got to
do if you want to make the best flips in my opinion
you're going to get the dirtiest stuff the stuff that most guys just don't they
don't want to get their hands dirty they want the easy pickups they want the
gtx 1070 that some guy pulled out of a dust free environment
me i'll grab the 1070 that's been in a smoking chamber
with dust everywhere i'll clean that thing up i don't really care
so that to me is representing what we're doing with this series and that we're
taking a lot of dirty stuff we're cleaning it up we're mixing and
matching parts and then we're making the most of what we've got
so the total here today is 1200 aussie dollars flat
we came in at pretty even prices with all these parts
we've still got 120 left from the previous flipping
but we've also got the 26 so we've still got 146 aussie dollars left over
and we've also got a three rgb fan kit with a controller for the corsair stuff
we've got a 60 gigabyte ssd a 450 gigabyte hard drive and
as well as that we've got a single i think we've got a spare slider cable
some spare screws and also a spare argb fan and controller from cooler master so
you can see here we're still already starting to build up the kitty a little
bit but i did put in a one dollar led strip
on uh the nzxt build so that leaves us with
145 dollars not 146. and also the last really good thing
about both these builds is that they both came with windows 10 pro
pre-activated to the boards so i didn't have to go out
and spend a little bit of extra money on keys for either of these
they're going out of episode three we're bringing the heat here this 100
is going very far it's turning into something real now
and we're only pretty much i mean next episode we can take a big gamble
and we can try and build a higher end pc or we can just juggle around this price
mark of getting 500 for systems and sort of
building up systems and trying to make money in that
category do let us know though if you guys have a request for the next series
what you want to see more of then i'll be happy to entertain that as
long as it's not going to send me broke i don't want to go back
i'm scared of going back down to that 100 level
but we saw here in the episode even today the discipline
the guy wants to meet me at the gas station i'm not going to do that
don't meet people at gas stations go pick up something from their house
or get stuff verified working before you buy it that's
and i you know i could have got hosed on that rx 5700 this video could have been
a completely different scenario could have been putting a graphics card in one
of the breaks just would have been down and out and i
would have had not even 100 bucks left to fix it so that's a possible scenario
so just be careful of what you do out there
when you're getting deals together anyhow with all that out of the way do
let us know in the comment section below if you've got any uh tips tricks or
spices of your own that you're doing at the moment or of
course what was your favorite part of today's video
love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the
day here which comes from passa e and they ask
now that the h410 boards are out do you guys recommend
pairing one of those with an intel i5 10 400 h310 was a very bad chipset is
the new h410 any better uh with i5s i think h410 even
h310 as we saw in today's video the nzxt case is pairing with the i5
9600 kf of course we're not going to get overclocking but
the h410s are just going to be like the h310s which are going to be very similar
on the amd side to the a320s they're basically just that budget board
that you pair with the maximum of on amd's side of ryzen 5 in my opinion
and then on intel side and i5 i wouldn't be putting an i7 on these boards but an
h410 i've already tried it with an i5 10 400
absolutely fine the performance is really good you're gonna get a good
gaming experience and the benefit of that is of course
you're gonna be saving a lot of money versus those more expensive
motherboards however on some h410s you may lose
m.2 support so do be careful of that the headers can be in different spots that
might not be too convenient for you but they are pretty decent i mean i
might do a video for you guys soon if you want to get on an h410 just get
some 3200 megahertz memory and then whack in a cl 14 sweet spot
overclock i find the 3200 mega cl16 stuff
does this cl 14 2666 profile absolutely fine and you really don't
lose a whole lot of performance as i've tested in the past here and with
that aside i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you
enjoyed this one and you stayed this far and you want to
see the content as soon as it drops here take your city and you know what to do
hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you on another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
