looks like we are ready to go better flip the phone on a diyendo that's a do not disturb oh okay we are live i think we're live anyway i won't know until um until the chat lets me know until you guys are like brian you're live make sure make sure the stream's working we've got a big one for you guys and i i have been letting you know in advance i've been scheduling the streams a little bit in advance posted up a tweet on twitter getting better at this stuff and i'm also filming on a different camera now so do let us know if the camera quality is pretty good because i switched from panasonic to um a canon so i used to film on canon like when i was shooting photography and stuff i used to have a canon camera so part of me wanted to go to canon and there's this whole argument you know the camera like you think the nvidia and amd and intel like fanboy arguments are crazy wait until you go to the camera world guys it gets pretty crazy you've got guys out in the wild and they're all like man you got a cannon you got to get sony you got to get panasonic and they're arguing for and against and i just like i look at it and i'm like you know which which one's going to which one's just going to hit record and give me a really good picture and from what i've researching the canon does the job so hopefully you guys will be enjoying this live stream ever more than you ever have in the past but let's uh let's take a look here and just join in chat as well don't don't uh don't be afraid to get a little bit rowdy in the chat but don't get too rowdy don't get too rowdy in the chat because i mean just just get excited i think that's the way to do it because we're gonna go over now to first of all the gpu prices now they're coming down a little bit like i saw this article out there on the news like this german website the prices are going up again it's like you know that that sort of all that fear mongering i'm just gonna tell you guys before we get into the gpu prices they're overpriced just wait it's that simple now i actually was looking at the m3 money supply in australia i don't know if i pulled okay so m3 money supply is important one to pull up because this is actually for me it's relieved a bit of stress um because there's a i think if we look at like prices of everything really it's all connected to money supply it is all connected so in australia they're not supplying the m2 money figures but they're giving us m3 which is aka broad money supply and so with broad money supply you can see if this is going up heaps then you've got to be worried see this trajectory here it's actually been flattening off which is pretty good news it means that we can and if this keeps up and it doesn't go crazy like this line here and it just keeps going berserk then we will see prices of gpus and they've already stabilized but we will see them go down as stimulus measures wear off so just hold the line hold the line if you're a gamer be strong be patient just grab an rx4 74 gigabyte you mean you get you get a little bit ripped off but you're not going to get exorbitantly ripped off and just wait that's the most uh logical solution so um pulling up figures at the moment we've got in australia these actually the rx 6700 xt my favorite my favorite you guys are going crazy in chat i'll just quickly we'll quickly look at chat quickly while we um while we we've got heaps of donation from joker near msrp cards by the end of fall thoughts uh like i'm predicting like okay i just think that that event is coming soon i'm calling it i'm calling it the great crypto rug pool i just think it's coming pretty soon i mean i i was i was hoping it would have already come but i think it will come pretty soon and i mean no one like no one in the news is talking about the uh debt suspension running out at the end of this month for the us debt that in itself could be a possible um catalyst for causing a worldwide crash i mean there's things like that that can cause issues so there's all these things that these possible catalysts out there that can have a broader effect and all of a sudden when the uh when the cell gang gets on with crypto you know how violent it can be i saw that i remember watching the bitcoin going from 80 000 aussie or 60 000 usd just down to like 40k people were just on twitter like they couldn't stop tweeting they're like guys what's going on someone please explain and all these memes coming out but then um but then it all got like then it all it sort of stabilized and then net then you had the drop below 30k on bitcoin and then you had all this other stuff and ethereum as well was just following suit but uh one thing i can tell you about the numbers is is that there's institutions are controlling the price right if we look at crypto prices institutions are controlling those prices so when that when they decide these institutions that are manipulating the price of crypto when they decide to sell off that's when you're going to get the mining profitability will drop and then that's when you'll see the gpu prices get cheaper so we've got here two uh pound donation from kirk i managed to get a gtx 1050 ti for 175 pound nah that's dad my man that wouldn't be a good deal like i've got to be honest with you in my if you could did you get a brand new with warranty because that's kind of what you would expect for that price so um usually in australia you can get a 1050 ti if you're on your game they're about 140 on the used market if you're if you're buying local here so a little bit expensive i'm going to be honest with you thanks for the donation any idea when the 30 50 desktop will come actually okay if you guys want to go straight to that news we'll get over with the gpu prices but i'll just quickly get this out of the way and then we'll talk about the 30 50 and also the 6600 xt but we've got here the uh 6700 rx 6700 mech this has gone down to 10 feet this is umar right there's a local site here so these rx 6700 xt's they're etching down they're coming down in price which is a really good thing because miners aren't targeting these cards nowhere near the likes that they're targeting other cards right they'd rather go for a 1660 ti or a 1660 super or um even go for a 6800 so this card right here i feel like this is the raw demand from gamers they're all in stock no one's buying them uh not many people are buying them and the prices are coming down from the last time we did live stream not not as much as they did from may like may to june the prices drop quite a bit but even if we go on ebay we're seeing a lot of cards getting passed in this one didn't sell at 699 this one here someone decided to go crazy on two of these cards 720 you know you've got one here for under 700 so i'm seeing a few cards going for 6700 in the us going for under 700 usd which is pretty good so the prices have etched down a little bit more from last month hopefully we can get them down even more but uh as it stands like if you you couldn't like you know especially if you wanted to buy a gpu in may and you waited until now you're at least you're not getting like totally ripped off now i'm not endorsing i'm i'm endorsing the fact just wait out just just play the weight game for now i feel like they're going to keep coming down it's just a waiting game hold the line gamers wait it out with a cheap graphics card but um i feel like another thing as well see nvidia and amd so we'll go over the 6600 xt the rumors are this is actually a good card right here the 6600 xt i'm liking what i'm seeing from the rumor mill it's rumored to come out early next month so this is this is like this is only a couple of weeks away you'll see the 6600 xd hit the shelves very soon uh it's expected to launch on july 30th uh not from i have been hearing different rumors august 11th uh hi i heard you're giving away and so rock and jump ninjas joined the chat he's asking how i heard you giving away an rtx 4090 for anyone who joins a chat with a tick next to their name oh yeah brother yeah and i heard you were giving away some diamonds as well uh to anyone that's hosting the chat giving away an rtx 4090 to the person with the tick next to their name do reply and let me know your answer my man so we got here the 6600 xt this is the good thing we're going to point straight away i don't know it's the thing i like i only read a few articles and get up to speed and then i apply my own thoughts so i don't know if other people have been talking about this right here but this is the most crucial thing right here is the 128-bit memory versus the 192 on the 6700 xt so look at that right there 100 and uh i had it up here before where the memory there it is there so it's on a different tab okay 192 bit memory bus right there versus 128 what this means is the mining performance of the 6600 xt is going to be lower than the 6700 xt which was already pretty low so you can expect this card to perform near the likes in terms of mining performance to that of an rx 580 or something if i did my math correctly so this means that this card is going to be pretty good for gamers miners aren't going to be targeting this thing which makes it um i guess you're going to get an even more realistic picture of how this card launches into the wild and who's buying it for what price at 349 usd i'm guessing that's the in australia's 500 aussie it's going to go a bit over msrp of course but it could be 650 aussie dollars now here's another thing too we'll get to the big screen oh we also got a donation from mouth thank you so much thoughts on the steam deck unfortunately not available in australia i will get onto the steam deck we've actually got an article here i will pull up the steam deck very soon i did have an article ready for you guys but we will talk about the gpu prices very quickly another thing is too i had my wisdom tooth pulled man like so i didn't make videos for a couple of days because i had my wisdom tooth pulled out like there was one that was like it was just digging into my other tooth and i had a hard time eating i just woke up one day started eating and i was like damn this hurts so i went to the dentist he's like yo look at this and he's like showing me my my wisdom tooth was digging into another tooth he's like do you want to get rid of this thing i'm like yeah let's just get rid of it so and then yeah like i was you know that was before so i i already in the first episode of ultra clean that was different work i had done so i had some hole in the bottom of my mouth this was like another so i've been to the dentist twice now and he's just been um having a go so hopefully if basically what i'm trying to say is if i'm speaking a little bit like i sound a little bit weird it's probably because i'm missing a tooth but anyway we've got here what okay what happened here we just pulled up the rtx 3050 ti specs okay so i was i was going to talk to you guys um about the what's going on with the gpu market quickly on the big screen we'll go go back to the big screen so basically i've got a contact in the industry who's getting cards in australia from uh distributors now so yeah will gpu prices go down further yes because i know they're coming down from the distributors here's the thing i already got in contact with distributors here and you can get gpu prices uh oh i hope that's not my battery though okay cool i've got a spare battery in case that runs out so we're all good to go now what's happening here is is that the prices from the distributors are coming down now from the gravis cars at least in australia so i can speak on behalf of australia the prices are coming down so what this means is is that the prices if the if the retailers paid higher price for the gpus beforehand then they're sitting on stock that they can't move because there's this new wave of cards that are coming in cheaper especially the lhr cards and so what that means is those lhr cards they're going to be um not for mine and mine isn't really going to want to pick them up but then the gamers aren't going to want to pay those existing prices the retailers have so the retailers themselves if they're overpaying for these cards they're in a bit of a messy situation so i can tell you that rtx 3060 ti's in australia i can source them for about 850 aussie dollars which is much cheaper if we go to an rtx 3060 ti for example on this website 1200 12.99 so you can see here that the obviously like for instance if we take umart they're sitting on you know a 450 dollar premium or something or five zero to make a hundred bucks you know you want to you want to make a hundred dollars a sale that's pretty like standard in these higher end products because they've got to warranty them they've got to go through all the process and guarantee them but i can get 360 ti's down for 850 aussie dollars so the prices are coming down now i can also get a 30 80 for much cheaper than these prices that they're showing here with say for instance a tough gaming two and a half thousand that went down the last stream that we did i'm pretty sure i checked this card and it was like two thousand six hundred and ninety nine also i saw a super chat there sorry i didn't want to miss you i know people like dude i super chat you man oh tech therapy how you doing man he just uh gave us a donate here a 1699 euro very very uh unique number there to jot in but he says i'm waiting for the rx 60 99 g well okay that's a lot of 69 there and not a gt rocket fuel edition pricing one gold bar nah dude one gold bar is going you know you know how much one gold bar is worth you know those bars in the movies that you see like they're doing all this like oh you know gold heist or whatever though one of those bars is like worth i think off the top of my head like six hundred thousand dollars just one of those gold bars gold's very expensive like i mean well is it expensive because i mean when we look at the money supply back when gold was cheap there was a lot less dollars floating around anyway grab scarf prices they are coming down from the distributors i will tell you that so that's an indication going forward that just hold the line if you're thinking about buying one and you're seeing retailers charge two and a half thousand dollars for an rtx 3080 i wouldn't buy it i'm holding the line well i'm actually i've already booked up some graphics cards uh for some new cards to come in at the 850 mark for a 30 60 ti and a 3080 at 7 1600 roughly so i'm i'm booking them up so they're coming in and i'll be i'll be shown videos you know because i'm going to get back into building some pcs uh especially where i'm at the moment this tax return time people get their taxes back they're gonna buy a gaming pc so there was that that's that was that rumor so we've got now the rtx 3050 ti you guys wanted us to talk about the rtx 3050 ti now i don't for instance the 6600 xt i can tell you guys that's pretty solid rumor like you look at the specs you people have already got models that are leaked out there the 3050 ti or an rtx 3050 i don't have any solid information on this at the moment based on what video cards it's got here it looks like it's performing like it looks like a very strong 50 ti series if this is the specs you're going to be getting i mean look isn't that like very similar cuda cores to the 3060 it just doesn't like something's not weighing up here like this looks too powerful for a 3050 ti so um i'd just be like i think we're gonna have to wait a little bit longer for the 3050 ti just based on the fact that i think nvidia just want to keep selling 30 60s for higher prices with the 12 gigabytes of vram so that's my opinion there i mean you should be able to see a 3050 ti but most people i would want i think most people are want to see another 1660 super and unfortunately like that's the thing right those kinds of cards amd and nvidia at the moment don't want to sell them and that's the truth like you can go around and say oh like this is the truth you can go around and say all right nvidia and amd just want to rip you off um not i mean in what amd and video want to do is they want to get more margins so they want to get they want to sell the higher end products and then get more profits and then start paying off shareholders so the lower end cards are getting a much tougher because if they're going to put out a 150 card like they used to with say a 1063 gigabyte it's a lot harder to fill that market at the moment with the inflation going on and that's one thing that like and i i spoke about this in the previous gpu prices video where the inflation is a dangerous thing and it's it you know it's showing in nvidia's margins and their underlying figures you're seeing that in their underlying figures we've got a super chat uh just stampede here coming in uh beautiful madeline uh one dollar thank you so much brother for the one dollar um ca uh twenty dollars i keep doing what you're doing very cool channel and then uh thanks thanks benjamin and and then we got a beautiful madeline i traded my 5700 xt to a crypto miner for a 6700 xt phantom gaming any ideas why they wanted my 5700 xt way more than use c700 i got ah it's just because of the hash rates i think the 5700 xt is also more efficient so that should answer that question so mine a miner's gonna make more money on a 5700 xt every day than they would on a 6700 xt so i mean you're the gamer right you're going to get a much better deal and if crypto crashes as well once the rug gets pulled out from underneath crypto you're in a much better position so i would have taken that deal as well that was a really good trade you did well uh so the 30 50 ti i mean looking at these stats right here uh just there's not a whole lot of concrete information on the 3050 or 350ti i mean they've released it on a laptop but i just think these numbers and what i've heard through the grapevine i haven't heard anything concrete yet but i think nvidia will have something but it's just not going to be the 150 200 card and if anything i think the only hope that we've got for a proper budget card like a 1063 gig or a 1066 gig or a 1660 super believe it or not is intel with the dg2 that is the one hope for gamers right now who want to build a decent rig i think intel may have a chance of locking that market down especially since it was raja kaduri who went over to intel and he was the one who did the whole rx 470 rx 570 push and i remember the rx 570 at the time people were like um people were talking about the rx 570 and rx 479 i was kind of like oh damn they don't have a competitor to nvidia at the high end at the time but when you look back at the rx 470 and 570 and those cards i really liked them they're one of amd's most popular cards ever the rx 470 net 480 and especially the 570 580 those things are still selling today and they're still a very popular card for gamers uh one of the go-to cards for just a very long time so i mean people like to say okay raja kaduri maybe didn't bring the heat to um to nvidia but he certainly brought the heat and the value to the gamers so him being at intel hopefully you can see that legacy that he did there and say okay well we can apply the same situation here get our brand name out and um and hopefully yeah that the market be beta testers like you know at the moment the world's just one big beta beta forum we're all beta testers and i can refer to other things when i talk about that so uh 1660 super prices are still ridiculous yeah i mean when i refer to the 1660 super i'm talking about before the miners before 2020 june before miners started picking them up um they were really good like i was picking up 1660 supers for like on sale for 300 aussie dollars or something now they're like 600 aussie dollars so they're doubled in price here uh they're a really good card for miners that's the problem like they got great efficiency they got good hash rates a lot of guys like to stack those cards so i talked um i talked to a few guys uh you know especially one guy locally here two guys actually one guy who sold me the pcs for the flip up challenge and then another guy who i know who used to resell gaming pcs they've both just gone all into mining um you know they're really they're good people so it's like um you know i can't really you can't really fault them so yeah so anyway sorry my new my new canon camera might be having a bit it might be getting too excited on this live stream so if there is some little sort of cutouts and stuff i do apologize it's my first time streaming on this camera but uh let's have a look on other news the steam deck this is the big one the steam deck gaben the gabe deck this is this is the big one i you know this one's a really controversial one like i'm because i'm gonna be taking kind of devil's advocate here i know a lot of people are fanboying this like the the steam deck and i i'm gonna fanboy elements of it so also we've got a two dollar donation from a monolith uh mondelich rtx 3070 plus 300 for 6800 xt is it a good deal uh yeah yeah because you kind of like i'd say yeah because you're kind of getting that next echelon of card like i mean it depends if it's a new zealand dollar so if it's new zealand dollars yeah you've got a good deal if it's us dollars you kind of you might have just got a little bit on the rough edge there uh but that's not bad like the 6800 xt is a more desirable card than the 3070. it's it's one of those higher end performing cards as opposed to 37 being that really showing its distance between the 3080 and the 6800 xt for example but let's get back to this the steam deck so we've got three different models here i think there's this big fancy um pull up the big fancy sales pitch here from steam themselves this is what they got they choose your steam deck you can have a choice here guys 64 gigabytes of that's just basic flash and then you've got 256 gigabytes and vme storage on this thing and then you got 512 gigabytes now all these reservations at least in australia they're they're gone uh and then people were flipping the reservations on ebay and it was just like one big hype factory all over again and uh yeah for me bursley like i'm gonna be honest like i wasn't like did you have you guys seen in any of my videos or any of my live streams here's the thing have you guys seen me begging for a pc portable console like the switch never so i i have never addressed this you know huge problem in my life apparently that i need a portable mini pc when i've already got a ps vita with an oled that was already brought in quite a while ago but one thing i will say is the specs are impressive from my standpoint and people like well it's just an apu i i think it's good that they're finally utilizing ddr5 memory uh sorry we got also a donation from mark dodd uh mate it's mental running my xeon 1680 at 4.8 gigahertz 5700 xt with 64 gigabytes of ram i was all for buying the latest and greatest then reality kick did yeah that's it just hold the line brother hold the line patience will pay off don't worry um don't get caught up in the hype again just talking about hype and getting caught up and i think people are getting caught up in the steam deck hype where i can guarantee you a lot of people are going to buy this thing and be like wow i got a steam deck wow i got a steam deck i got a steam deck and then they're just going to play it for like a day toss it aside jump back on their pc mouse and keyboard all that goodness that pc gaming is all about and then they're going to forget their steam deck ever existed so that's my personal take i'm not going to use a steam deck i'm not pre-ordering one i might test one do a video on it but i'm going to say the specs look pretty impressive here because 16 gigabytes of ddr5 memory the fact that they're already announcing something with next generation hardware that hasn't even been released and is going to alleviate the bottleneck on apus the bottleneck on apus was coming from the ddr4 memory so having that ddr5 memory in there somehow gaben really is on his game in terms of gaben's on his gabe and he's really just releasing something that's going to be utilizing the best out of our dna too so he's done a good job here four cause eight threads can be absolutely monstrous for a portable pc especially in a uh mobile you know uh zen two cores again it's gonna be great but yeah the ddr5 is gonna alleviate that and you could see some a lot more performance out of the apu than you've traditionally seen on an apu so a couple with a 720p it's roughly it's an 800p screen i mean technically likes just think 720p it's going to perform really nicely but mine now okay so there's the positives the hardware is looking good the performance is going to be solid uh we got danish kroner as well thank you johnny winter for the donation uh my friend is p-i-s-s-e-d he got a new 30 90 for the win on rma ah due to the amazon game crap yeah we'll get up to that soon uh isn't it an lhr version he got the an evga will not swap it for a normal any mines every time oh okay well he should be entitled to the i thought they weren't releasing the 3090s in lhr okay that's i i'm i'm because i i was on i heard it on strong authority that they weren't releasing them in lhr like that's yeah like everywhere everyone i spoke to was like the 3090s are not getting lhr that's really weird man okay uh yeah i mean your friend he's getting ex he's just like yo he's just a test pilot then i feel sorry for your friend man first of all he's got to wait in the rmaq and then his um he's got to wait in the rma queue to get his stuff [Laughter] and then he gets set like a beta product that i haven't heard of lhr on 3090. so man that poor dude so back to the steam deck before we get on to amazon and their their new uh hyped up game a 720p screen with no oled so this for me is the deal breaker i wanted to see an oled screen in this thing and look i don't have a switch and i know switch just did the oled thing i'm not really too impressed with nintendo either for just re-releasing their console with a uh with an oled screen i think that's really you know the market needed a bit more than just an oled screen but i do love oled if you guys have followed me i think oled especially on smaller devices like a smartphone i cannot have it without you know my smartphone i can't have it i need oled on my smartphone and i absolutely need oled so not having it would is a deal breaker for me on the new um i'd like to see that if they had an option to pay a bit more money save up a bit more running get the oled screen and it was really good i would have gone in on the steam deck but that's the deal breaker for me unfortunately because i've realized now it's like you get a car right you can have a really fast sports car but if the interior is horrible and and it's just an absolute bounce bucket and you're driving this thing as a daily man you're gonna get sick of it even though it's a fast car and it's got a great engine in it all the other stuff isn't lying lining up so the silver lining isn't there to seal the deal so kevin burnell five dollars cheers brother yeah cheers for tuning in so that's my that's my thoughts on the steam deck i'm not jumping in on the hype don't go yeah don't give your money away on steam for those people uh completely scalping it as well i think it's pathetic but speaking of hype we got to address this right now this this new world i like i bought this game i was going to do a budget pc for new world and um this game like it's good that amazon's making a game and making a pc game but when i got into it i was like it's an mmo so basically for those guys who don't know it's massive multiplayer online so you jump in you've got all these different quests and different skill sets different characters and i started playing it for about i think it was about an hour i jumped into it and the combat system i mean for a game that's coming out in 2021 at least in closed beta i thought the combat system was really like far behind you know well like for instance world of warcraft which was released back in 2004 i think the beta i think i was playing beta in 2004. the combat system was so much better on world of warcraft so i i'm critiquing the combat system straight away i don't like the combat system the graphics are okay i mean you don't want your graphics to be too powerful for a mmo otherwise people aren't going to be out a lot of people are going to be playing it just because you can't run it but anyway the game itself new world like this is just i think it's a it's a lot of hype at the moment i jumped into it and i personally just wasn't getting into it that much i think there's some good points about the game i think it's good that they got like um you can switch the weapons straight away like i had a hammer and a fire staff and i was switching to between my hammer and i was pushing the enemies back then i jumped out the fire staff quickly and i was you know scorching him like there's some good things about it but i think the game itself needs a lot of work like you know when you hit a button and you've got that action sort of thing it's sort of it i like the instantaneous action so anyhow we've got here now the problem so here it is the the 3090 for the win threes were a lot of them there was a lot of reports of people's cards um so this is actually got jay's two cents he did a video i actually quickly watched his video and he couldn't find his problem with it but he was saying evga are replacing the cards um and so there was there's this whole thing about this game just breaking gpus and i think the game is not nothing to get excited about so don't get too excited about this game but if you had a card and it failed especially a 3090 that's just like that's the card that shouldn't fail like if the 3060 ti failed i'd be like okay fair enough that's sort of like your mid-range card but if rtx 3090 is the card that you don't want to fail like you're paying a lot of money not only to get the best of the best but not to get inconvenienced so the fact that there was a problem there to begin with on a 30 90 does make me scratch my head uh so we got here a donation from a currency i have never seen before with that symbol that looks like some uh like naruto or something like is that naruto currency but thank you for the 30 naruto coins uh hi brian what are your thoughts about the rx 6600 series yeah we are we just we talked about that before so you can scroll back a little bit on the live stream brother thanks for the donation we already talked about that i think it's going to be um even like yeah i mean the three if it's 349 it's going to be okay and of course that's an msrp it's going to come in a little bit in this current market it's going to be launching into a overpriced market but at least my thoughts on it is that it's not going to be targeted by miners it's going to be even targeted less it's gonna be even uh yeah sharing guns that's it yeah so the guy donated 30 sharing guns thank you my man um it's gonna be targeted less by miners and that's that's the thing so it's gonna then the 6700 xt so if you're a gamer and you're looking for a not to like if you're a gamer and you really got to get a new card then the 6600 xt is going to be the best out of the rip-off prices so that's my thoughts there but uh naruto represent it's nis so people are correcting me on the currency thank you sharon guns yeah like he donated 30 of those brother thank you my man oh it's israel okay thank you someone's like go on ham in there so we'll get back come on cannon camera it's my first time streaming get back to business so he likes to cut in and out but um we got here so the 3090 let's talk about this right uh evga so the problem here is is that like you see a 3090 is going to juice a lot of power especially when it's maxed out now the 3090 the problem here is that when you've got 400 watts let's address this 400 watts just from the gpu getting dumped in a case you need extremely good airflow in that case and i think the problem here is that a lot of these gamers who had the cards fail may have just had a standard three fan setup that was on quiet mode and it wasn't pulling out the hot air fast enough so therefore the weak point on the 3090 became exposed the 3094 the win and maybe some other cards as well but mainly this 3090 for the win3 there was a weak point on it and it became exposed when the game was stressing the card that hard and people were playing because it's an mmo people are going to be playing it for quite a long time so mmo people are going to be playing for a long time and it's just going to stress the card that much and then kabuff the card just dies so that's uh that's all it is there's nothing there's a weak point on it i don't know and you won't know unless someone actually shows the burnt out pcb then you'll see exactly where the point was and what actually died so my thinking is it could be part of the gpu that's gone under but either way there should be protection circuits on those cards that prevent them from dying they should just hard shut off and not boot up for about 20 minutes or maybe even 10 minutes and the fans should just keep going ever so slowly to let them cool off but um yeah so anyway regardless there was a problem and evga are fixing it now which is the good thing and uh so that's uh they're on top of it at least you're getting looked after and so hope but you shouldn't be getting replaced with a product that you didn't buy like if you bought one from like if you bought a 3090 you should be getting a 39 not a 30 90 lhr so that's pretty crazy uh which water cooling companies rads and blocks are the best of the best no matter the cost i mean i've only used corsair and ek for custom water cooling so you'd have to ask like designs by ifr might be able to help you out corey he's uh he's doing he does all the the real good water cooling stuff so you have to ask him uh about that but you know corsair and ek i've got this build here which has got corsair water cooling on it it's pretty good it does the job hasn't missed a beat since i built it so we got here john john wave seven he donated uh myr7 is that malaysia ringgit i don't know uh 790 thank you for the donation behind the scenes yeah ah yeah okay yeah i will be doing a bts update as well on the patreon i will be updating that sorry it's been a while um yeah this year has been look i i you know even though on camera i'm all good and behind the scenes i'm all good i've just been like it's hard to say i've just been i've been doing a lot of research outside of tech so i've been doing i've been burying my head on mainly back getting refreshed on economics and finance so i've just been really like just digging my head in that and getting educated on it because i find that once you get educated on money supply and all that you start to realize like wow it's all correlated like it's all perfectly correlated well not perfectly but it's all um it's all correlated heavily you know like they talk about like for instance i'll give you guys an example on house prices in sydney they were like oh back in the 1960s a house was only uh 8 000 or something and it's like now they're 1.5 million and it's like well yeah if you look at the money supply it's gone up like 150 or 170 fold since the 1960s so a few times 170 by your 8 000 there's your one and a half million dollar house price so there you go like has a house prices gone up they've gone up with money supply now here's the key here's the scary thing have they become more unaffordable yeah they have because the wealth disparity has been growing ever since the 1960s in other words the rich are going getting richer the poor are getting poorer and so that was a trend that's been happening with money supply the money supplies remain constant the house prices are actually heavily correlated to the money supply and so what you're seeing is the house prices are actually pretty much normal and believe it or not if you correlate them to the money supply it's a scary thing yeah so that's the um that's the whole thing i was bearing my head and i'm like okay so now you realize a lot of people just spitting out the news really you know they don't know which way the economy is going to go but what i was saying at the start of the stream if we pull this up right here well i'll say in the start of stream if you guys are worried about hyperinflation then one thing you you sort of sit back and you don't have to worry about hyperinflation at least not for now because this is sort of starting to flatline a bit at least in australia now in new zealand they've also started dropping out the quantitative easing they're going to raise interest rates so there is some better news on the horizon if you work hard for your money and especially if you save your money and you buy things after saving for them uh this is much better news if you're one of those people if you just borrow money uh it might be bad news if interest rates go up especially if you're heavily in debt because if the interest rates go up then this could go down technically as well so anyway anyway we've got luke johnson here five dollars a five dollar donation thank you my man uh yes man i've been doing some economics research also you should post some vids on it it's so interesting makes me want to study it at uni uh yeah i would actually see that's the thing man i i'm gonna be honest with you i studied economics at uni economics and finance uh finance you know marketing as well and dude you you're better off just really getting into the deep of it yourself and learning things and uh you'll realize like do your own research and you'll get so much such a better education than university will ever teach you um and so some of the people like some of the guys from the 70s already knew how the system worked uh milton friedman um really really good read up uh it's best to yeah you've got to read both sides though read the keys in economics read the milton friedman side austrian economics read both sides get versed in them both and know what governments are doing at which times because they seem to sort of like throughout history they'll sometimes change their tunes on different stances especially in australia if you look at the early 1990s they actually money supply stayed flat they weren't printing essentially there wasn't any new money being printed into into the economy and so you can look at which times and like the different times going on but we could very well be entering if we look at these numbers right here a very flat period and so that could be you know if money velocity picks up you could get inflation from that as well so there's all these various uh factors that you just can't predict and so the longer though the longer we stay locked down especially in australia the longer you know international travel is not a thing the longer the printers aren't rolling like this as long as broad money stabilizes you won't see heavy inflation which for me is like it's a bit of a sigh of relief you know i wouldn't fear anything more than just heavy inflation i don't know what it would do because i don't have any experience living through a hyper or a high inflation environment guys from venezuela they come in the comments even if there's a guy in venezuela right now he'll come in the comment comment section he'll tell you inflation's horrible guys in argentina will tell you it's horrible so you don't want inflation uh thomas uh ass alas ass laxan thanks for the donation sorry i butchered your name uh norwegian kroner he's got 50 knock how much water flow do you need when buying cast water cooling pump uh i just know when you're doing a build you should just go for the iconic d5 that's all i remember so you just go for a good pump always get a good pump never cheap out on your pump that's one thing i'll say don't don't go for a real cheap uh pump on a water cooling but i've had a pump fail i had some crappy thermaltake pump in my um it was in this build right here this build's now butchered and changed i had a i had the bamp in this build right here and it failed so what happened then was i had to replace the whole thing it was just a nightmare so you do if you're going for a water cooling pump do get a good one and uh some guys maybe in the chat will say look get this water cooling pump it's the new metal so maybe there's a new meta but don't cheap out on a pump so but you guys let's go brian do you watch anime uh not like i watched the last one i watched was castlevania on netflix i i thought that was really cool uh that was the last one i haven't got really into it you guys have made a few recommendations uh one day i'm excited for the new bleach i've got to watch the titans one as well so i do watch it here and there i i don't get into a lot of like there's a lot of anime out there i don't really get into it but um there's the attack of the titans i gotta watch that one because i really want to see that one uh so uh hijack yes uh what would you expect the price of the 3060 to be around november time look i think the the 30 60 especially especially if it's an lhr i'm predicting by november it could be pretty cheap like it could be around that msrp you know 600 aussie dollars for a 30-60 around november maybe 400 u.s around november i mean they're already coming down so the 360 ti will it come down in price yeah definitely there's already lhrs um 360 ti is out there i think so i think you're already seeing the 3060 ti's lhr versions coming out so this is really good news right you're seeing i'll put this put this up on the screen for you guys you're seeing the 30 60 oh sorry i've got to plug the sponsors quickly too sorry to bombard you guys if you want to get cheap windows 11 10 key then just type in links in description grab yourself put that smooth coupon bf bftyc in there and you'll get yourself cop that discount 14. for windows 10 pro works on windows 11 single end user license and then we've got the microphone that we're using for these live streams this is the wave 3 the elgato this is the usb condenser microphone it's gone up a little bit in price i was liking it when it was around 130 it's gone up 20 bucks but for good reason i mean this thing is just an absolute beast of a microphone if you just want to do just voice work like we're doing right here awesome mic but uh yeah so the 30 60 ti they've got the lhr version i forget so lhr that means the prices will come down to this thing just hold the line i mean there might be some clueless miners that are buying these things up um yeah there might be some clueless miners buying the 3060g like oh man i heard the 360ti was really good and then they go buy it and they don't realize that it's the lhr and they're like yo why am i not making much money here so that's what can happen with that uh do you think the 3080 uh non-lhr cards will go up in value later on no so this is a big arc okay let's talk about this this actually question uh brings up something that i wanted to talk about on the stream right now and that was to do with the last topic of the day sorry this stream is like gone all different tangents actually we've got two more topics that i had on the topic list we actually had a lot of topics there's a lot to talk about man in one month there's been a heap to talk about there's intel coming out with their new big little we had here the rtx 4090 leaks and the rdna links we'll pull this up on the big screen for you guys 7 900 xt it's rumored down we're getting some more specs here rumored to have uh work group processes this is what they're calling their stream processes now work group processes maybe they if anything if they're changing a name like that it just means that they've got to appeal to uh businesses more so maybe their business income is hurting on the graphics card department so you know usually if something's happening you've got to react and do something about it so what better of an innovation than to just call it work group processes but anyway we've got here um a gpu with 15 360 stream processors from amd if that's you know if this is what's coming out this is going to be absolutely massive now not only is it going to be massive in terms of performance power consumption is going to be through the roof on this thing too so forget your 3090s failing in new world this thing will probably like you've got to have really good cooling for this thing it might even have a water cooler on it but this is going to compete with nvidia's 40 90. so here it is here 40 90 leaks again we're going to see a massive leap here tsmc five nanometer five nanometer and the performance is meant to have uh again this one's meant to have massive amount of cuda cores eighteen thousand four hundred thirty two cuda cores that's absolutely insane the amount of cuticles they're whacking on this thing up from the 30 90s 10 000. so this thing could perform very well and you've got suddenly this now this is where it comes back to the gpu prices and this is where i'm going to give a warning to the miners sorry we just got a donation here too from eagle snook thanks for the 10 euro hello from portugal from the middle i thank you from being an inspiration for hunting for used parts and turning them into gaming pieces to too bad it's now on hold as i cannot afford uh find affordable gpus yeah gpus is a tough one man if you want to get gpus you just got to be quick dude you got to be very quick i know when i see one on marketplace if i get a good deal on a gpu it's like within 30 minutes i just message the guy i if it's a good price i'm just like hey man i'll come pick it up now he's like yeah sure and so you don't even don't even bother sort of trying to snipe the price you just quickly pick it up so i've had a few of them the best one was the gtx 980 and the titan x that i recently got both those pcs um actually the titan xpc already sold that really good sale uh the 30 sorry the 980 someone's coming to pick that up so it's pretty good times man pretty good times so yeah it's a good time to be flipping pcs in australia because it's tax returns so it's tax return season so you're gonna have a few pcs ready but in terms of gpu hunting man you just gotta keep on your game with that i just have a set time if you're looking at averages and doing hustling one thing i haven't talked about i can give you guys a little bit of a tip is that if you're going to be hunting gravis cards notice what times they usually come up so you'll probably find on a sunday in the the morning in the afternoon and a saturday morning and afternoon i know there's more competition but that's when someone's going to list the card and even on a monday i found some good deals on monday so monday is actually one of my favorite deal hunting days because sometimes the um someone's staying home and they just list their stuff on the monday and there's not much competition so hopefully that answers that i we got here uh my question to you is what is the difference between uefi and csm mode so compatibility support module is just your it's supporting devices that aren't supported into the uefi so you have this especially if you have a graphics card that doesn't have a uefi bios on it you turn on csm with your video pci express csm compatibility and then you can boot off that so you generally if all your stuff so generally you want csm turned off believe it or not if all your components can work without csm you should have it turned off so it's just compatibility support module and that literally is the answer with csm it's um it's a module that's meant to help all the hardware just boot up properly and initiate piledriver a five dollar donation aussie thank you hi b it's frustrating to think amd and nvidia can block miners using gaming gpus yet they choose to ruin the gaming market for months and years yeah thanks for the donation dude that's yeah we'll continue on with this topic with these new gpus because this is important right because suddenly we've got these massive gangs from nvidia and amd and now if we look at history amd and nvidia they kind of don't want to give us these gains right man 100 percent gains is huge if this comes out and this is we'll go on a big screen here if these numbers are to be believed and we're going to get these massive massive increases in performance from amd and intel i'm sorry amd and we'll get on intel soon that's the last topic amd in a video if these numbers are to be believed why would they give us such huge increases right they've never really done it in the past it doesn't make any sense like for them to give us a huge generational leap over the last one which was already huge over the 2000 series if i was to like okay we're going down a little bit every time you have to go down a little bit of a different tangent here just hear my thinking this right here is already the answer to all those cards that will come on the market in the future whether it's rtx 3000 cards from miners lhr cards you you know all that an easy way to get rid of a mess is to innovate and offer a lot more so that's one way you clean up a mess right out with the old in with the new exactly what happened when lcd screens came out over crts back when i don't know about you guys but lcd screens when they hit the market and they were actually affordable initially when they hit the market they were really expensive but when they became affordable you you just couldn't sell a crt no one wanted them you had a crt up for sale you were just sitting on this thing no one wanted to buy it and so i just call it the crt effect because that's what's happening right now i like i see this news as nvidia and amd are like man we're gonna have a bit of a problem here how do we clean this mess up let's just give the gamers much better performance for the same price and then that'll be you know every all these all these cars that we sold in the past massive amounts of them they're all irrelevant in terms of even if people are selling them at cheaper prices the newer ones are going to offer much better price performance compared to what those miners paid so if you're a miner you may be a little bit nervous reading these next generation leaks and these next generation performances because from what i've seen with a lot of the leaks they are pretty accurate they're not like they don't mess around we've also got a 21 21 99 euro donation from paul kelly here thanks so much for the donation dude hey brian uh not a paul from not an apple fan this is my personal uh youtube okay thanks brother have a beer on me dude i hear they are pretty expensive in aussie land thanks all you do for price performance oh cheers man so not an apple fan uh he's a really cool dude just uh i mean i think dude i think with your channel man you swear a lot it's really cool i appreciate it but on youtube you've got to like if you want to get more views on youtube i think you've got to like the filtering thing i think that would be because your content you talk about good topics and you talk you raise these good issues that i like i'm like yeah this guy raises good points but i think your views would be getting hit because youtube i remember back when i used to swear on youtube they really hated cursing and so they just they nailed my channel man back in the past that just absolutely hammered my channel uh for swearing but other than that man yeah you're not like when you come down to australia when we meet up in the future we'll have a beer man and that'll be on me with your 21.99 euro so technically it's a you're paying for your own beer in the future and i if it's inflation man you're actually getting a good deal right now so you wait yeah if i do that right sorry it's getting a bit late so i don't know if i did that in the right order you're paying me the 21.99 euro now b is expensive now yeah it's going to be more expensive in the future so i'll have to buy you a more expensive euro beer in the future so yeah you're making a good investment right now that's like that's some chess economics right there so we got here more sharing guns from uh muad dim a3ds um 30 sharing guns hey again as a proud tech yes citizen i have a suggestion for an idea for a video how about a linux powered budget gaming pc maybe even with steam os i can make that happen man thanks for the donation i will make that happen that's actually a pretty refreshing good idea i want to make that happen now thanks for giving me the idea man i'll make that happen that's that's so cool uh nori ss 9.99 and good morning from the key west florida usa how is grandpa linus your dad uh yeah dude i'm minus the sun now yeah i hope all is well uh do you think gpu prices will go back up soon so i can continue to scalp them oh man i think people like as the stimuluses wear off and as people realize and even like even the guys at those central banks even the guys at the federal reserve banks they'll realize printing money isn't this magical solution that you can keep hammering as that happens as that happens you're gonna see people who run dry and once they run dry and once also the inflation caused by that printing money um makes the non-discretionaries less desirable you're going to see gpu prices will fall and so um scalping is going to be a tougher game once people run out of money so fiat currency once they run out of it man it's going to be a tougher game so anyway 1650 desktop or a 1650 ti laptop which one is better uh i would go for a 1650ti laptop uh if you guys didn't know i made a recent i made a recent um i think i didn't even know if i talked about it i i did a trade uh i trade one the pc i got for 300 and i fixed it up and changed the motherboard i actually swapped that for a ryzen 5 4 600 h laptop with a 1650 in it 16 gig of ram 500 gigabyte ssd 2 terabyte hard drive and i thought i was absolutely winning uh this guy came around picked up my gtx 970 rig with uh with the cpu had the um i5 6500 and a board i had like it's a z170 board so yeah i thought i came out really the guy just like man i want to get a desktop he was so desperate for a desktop and i was like okay yeah i had this mad laptop so i think laptops are actually pretty well priced especially on the used market right now a lot of people aren't focusing on them you can actually get a pretty good deal on a used laptop right now just of course make sure it's not a heavily used laptop and i do have reservations about laptops i personally am not a laptop guy and the main reason i'm not a laptop guy is because um main reason i'm not a laptop guys is because one thing goes wrong you've just got this massive paper paper weight on your desk now laptops are extremely tedious especially when they put the gpu on the motherboard and something happens to that motherboard or the gpu you got to replace the whole freaking thing so it can be really annoying uh hey brian have you used an e5 2697 v2 for a video 12 cores 24 threads ah yes dude zap are you the dude who donated that cpu uh no someone donated me a 26 99 v3 i think it's like 18 cores 36 threads on haswell and i i've got to make a bill i'm looking for a x 99 motherboard to dump that thing in last x-99 board i had was a little bit shaky so it still kind of worked um hello please hello you guys you guys are coming in on the chat uh all right so we'll get on we'll get back to chat soon we'll talk about the last topic here and this is one that kind of has taken me by surprise here and that is intel with their 12 900 quality sample right there's apparently a qs floating around on a 12 900k uh 1200k qs beats the ryzen 9 5950x so just when amd was starting to get comfortable with their lead over intel intel's like we got something in the tank we realized that being stagnant is not the way to go forward and you look at intel's margins their profit margins are dropping and that's not a good thing even though they got good revenue still coming in sales are pretty good the business is healthy the margins are dropping and when the margins are dropping it means you've got to innovate because as that margin as those margins go down you can hit a real bad spell and that means that people are wanting to pay more for the competitors product in other words the competitor has a better product than you so you get a better power than the competitor then you're making more margins and suddenly you're doing better so make no mistake until it's in their best interest now to beat amd it's not like they want to beat amd they have to beat amd and this is actually good news because in the end we win out again hail hail competition all hail competition uh someone in the chat's like and the fed yeah we need to bring back sound money definitely i'm all for sound money i want to bring back sound money that's what we all need sound money money that we know that we can do a job and work for and we know that our money is going to be able to buy us something we worked for will be able to buy us something in the future especially if we choose to save that money it'll be able to uh buy us something of equal value of the effort that we put in so anyway yeah you can get me started on economics again we can go down that route if you want to but at 12 900k qs i'm actually really looking forward to this this is probably the best news i've heard out of intel in a long time especially we've got a donation here as well five dollars from beautiful madeleine hey brian can you do a video on building a non-gaming pc on the cheap elderly folk keep asking me even 95 year old what's the best for uh best for bucky in new zealand yeah actually okay since you asked the question i'm going to talk a little bit behind the scenes we'll just leave intel on the backbone look intel have earned the right to be delayed in terms of talking about their stuff they have given us lackluster performance for years now in terms of office pcs really good uh i've been selling quite a few i've cleared out i'm actually out of office pcs believe it or not all the stuff i had like a backlog of office business i'm alright i'll start selling these things with a budget keyboard mouse um eight gigabytes of ram and eight gigabyte if you got an office pc i would not go for the four gigabytes of ram i'd go for the eight gigabytes of ram huge difference man i found like i was putting up uh office pcs with eight gigabytes of ram they were flying out the door no graphics card just like onboard hd graphics that's all people want but they want the eight gigabytes you say see the four gigabyte they're like i don't know man i got double here got doubled like some of the basic consumers anything i got double the performance here eight gigabytes of ram four gigabytes even though they probably perform the same like just opening a browser or something like that uh the eight gigabyte office pc is meta on the budget you'll make some you'll pick up some good profits so i'd be going for like your lenovos your hp's all that stuff that you can get for cheap um i'll be picking up a heap more of them so you probably see in this month's parts hunt i'll have a car full of just like cheap oem stuff because that's definitely an avenue that's opened up for me and it's like bro you're sharing your secret sauce this is what you come to take your city for i don't hide anything i don't there's no reason for me to hide anything you guys have put me on the pedestal and i appreciate that you guys have given me a uh a very like i enjoy doing youtube i love it you guys have put me here and so i'll tell you all my secrets i'll tell you all the matters i don't care let's get back to intel so this 1200k i'm actually really looking forward to this big little as well something new so they've got like eight little cores eight big cores and apparently with windows 11 if you've got this installed with windows 11 they've pretty much worked with microsoft to make windows 11 just that good so it brings out the best of the 12 900k so this is going to be good man amd will have to respond because these these rumors are looking real by the day and suddenly uh amd's in second spot and it's like what happened here and you could see all over again you could see another core 2 duo or duo i say duo so you can see another core 2 duo in the works if you guys don't remember if you haven't been in tech for that long the core 2 duo just shocked everyone it came out it was like whoa intel's on top whoa and then suddenly everyone's left scratching their heads they're like how did they do it and then they just took the ball and they ran from there and amd was like hey just wait for me guys wait for me and then it's like all the lights are turned off and the doors were closed and then finally amd and hibernation was like okay they survived the hibernation like bane from batman right so amd was bane from batman but then he didn't go on a destructive path after he got out he went and said i'm gonna save humanity anyway that was what amd did but then amd's sort of like well you know you still got those bane grass roots there uh you know 5600x versus the 3600 100 price difference let's not forget about that uh kevin burnell 5 office pcs hdd or ssd uh basically go get yourself a heap of 120 gigabyte ssds i cannot sell like for the life of me now i cannot sell a pc without an ssd anymore so i bought a heap like i bought a heap of 120 gigabyte ssds and the reason i got that is because i just put them in everything you know and they cost i think they cost me around 20 something dollars 20 aussie dollars a piece so even though they charge 35 at the shops if you get a bulk buy you can get really cheap so every office pc i sell yeah i'm down 20 bucks but if that person buys the office pc off me and it's really good they're like wow this is great man thanks they're going to tell their friends and then their friends are going to want to and then suddenly i'm booked out for office pcs because my competitor if he's only got 4 gigabytes of ram and a hard drive man i'll tell you what they're going to get his office pc home and he'd be like man like that that you might even see that office pc of four gigabytes of ram and a hard drive in it at the tip the next day it might be at the dump it might be in the dumpster as opposed to a tech yes office pc that's you know they're probably polishing it they're so proud of it so you know what goes around comes around so i always put in ssds in my pcs now i and there was a spurt during like last year when i had no ssds i was in a real pinch i did put a few sshd's in some of the pcs i won't go any lower than an sshd sshd still pretty good or a new hard drive and so something like if i'm using a used hard drive it is extremely slow used hard drives are extremely slow for a main boot drive they're fine for games but yeah you guys would chat let's see what's cracking with chat let's have a look oh man this is a long stream okay we're going into the night i i've been a bit of a night owl lately so if you guys are in australia like brian it's almost midnight i'm like yeah it's almost midnight i've been you know i stayed up last night i was watching this documentary on uh mcdonald's and the two dudes who made mcdonald's like this other dude came along and just pretty much stole it i was like wow one of the most famous food franchises in history some dude just came along and stole it well i didn't steal it i mean he paid him handsomely for it but yeah anyway we've got matt b uh aussie ten dollars thanks for the donation brother hoping for okay oh no it's my camera uh oh you guys are seeing this live we'll quickly read out the donation and then we'll ch we'll change the battery uh-oh uh hoping for gpu prices to drop soon nvidia dropping support for my 780 ti in october but on the plus side my four-year-old won't understand the power she has in her hands okay let me just change the battery over actually we had a good run out of that so i'm still waiting on um i'm still waiting on a what you call it uh camera come on alrighty guys we have a battery down we got a man down technical difficulty i'm waiting on my ac charger so hopefully that works yeah cool sweet went back we're back in business i'm waiting on my ac charger for like i got one of those ones you just plug in and it just powers the camera permanently but that's sort of still in the mail so until then if we do a live stream we're kind of like on um on battery time here but the thing is the the battery did pretty good like that was pretty impressive we got a massive stream out of that battery and that's the canon uh that's the new canon batteries it's still techies city come on man come on that wasn't a bad technical difficulty that was not a bad look a bad technical difficulty is when you you know your sound starts skipping and all that stuff i've made sure the audio game is always going to be on point here do not fear have no fear so we gotta we got you guys on chat like let's pull up you guys with chat now uh what's the point of living i look man the point of living is just to join in a tech yeah city live stream have a bit of fun and you guys can talk about your problems too so you just just go at it man uh point of living though i think is to evolve i think that's the thing right i think if we look at the point of living it's to conquer the universe i want one step at a time right you know so one step at a time would be me fixing my my my camera so next stream we'll figure it out we'll probably just do a bios update for the camera um but yeah the point the point of living would be to evolve that's just my point so you know that's why for me i've you know i've got a little brian brian jr i want to have more kids and pass the reign on to them he's like hey you gotta help society evolve pilot driver five dollar donation thanks uh which camera mic do you use brian so we got the elgato wave three and then for the canon we we did a big upgrade man uh recently we got the canon r6 so this is the what you're seeing here is the rf lens we've got the rf lens and the canon r6 and i've just been loving canon ever since i turned this thing on um we got the the canon so the yeah so that's my new camera and i'm loving it i mean it is sort of cutting out a little bit i've got to check out what that is i think it's probably the fact that it's outputting at 4k so i might output to 1080p on live streams just in case um and yeah yeah the point of living is having fun too of course yeah i mean you gotta yeah so you gotta evolve yeah involve the human race right so i think that's the point of limit man this is this is crazy man what a crazy question on a live stream but i'll go with it i'll roll i'll roll but i mean i think having fun is the necessity to evolve right i think evolution is like the main point that's the main game that's the main game but like having fun is necessary for you to evolve so uh point of living is whatever you are experiencing now part of the human condition okay this is pretty cool man we're going to some matrix yeah mate someone's talking about the matrix now matrix is an automation system an arrangement will direct die cooling damage a gpu fd littered uh if it's bad like if you've got little specs like if you direct if you direct die cool a gpu make sure that it is so clean there is nothing wrong with that make sure it is so clean because if there's a speck of like dirt in there you can crack the dye and stuff so be very careful with direct die cooling with mounting pressure and also what's on the um what's on the actual cooling itself so yeah anyway guys uh it's almost midnight so if you guys have any uh we can go off talking we could talk we get off talking about the uh what's the point of living but there i mean it's it's good it's it's you know point of living is good man glitch in the matrix yeah exactly the r6s and haven't haven't none of the matrix today is my rx7 worth a 30 90. yeah i think so i think the used car market's still going pretty strong so it should be worth it um we got here uh what you think about the steam deck i don't think you made a video about i said yeah i talked about in this live stream um the steam deck so my thoughts were like i think there's there's a heap of hype like and of course it's not coming out for a while so yes like there's so much hype in the tech scene right now new world i'd like i've talked about all the hype in this episode um for me the biggest thing that i was hyped about in the last year was 4k oled 120 hertz and i'm using 4k oled 120 biggest thing i've hyped because i i was living the hype and it was worth the hype and anyone who jumps over to 4k 120 hertz oled will know that it's just like it's worth the hype and that was the best thing i've had like mind you the monitors are huge i wish they'd release a monitor for gaming pcs that are smaller with the benefits of oled um but brian do you ever buy used gpus with artifacts ah generally man you stay away so that's a good question i would stay away from uh gpus with artifacts mainly because chances are like literally like i'd say about 95 yeah so 95 times out of 100 those artifact gpus are just goners some of the artifact gpus you can drop the speeds of the memory down a little bit as well as the core clocks and you've still got a workable gpu but i find most the time with artifacting gpus most of the time they're gone so anyway yeah so hello bro how's it going pretty good guys pretty good so uh so glad i woke up at 1am when i got the notification yeah beautiful madeline you're waking up at 1am that's pretty cool so yeah i'm glad to catch for a bit youtube notifications don't seem to work but the discord server saved the day thanks man keep up the good work uh we'd love to see more budget pc content yeah we got a got a heap more budget uh content coming for you guys so don't worry and um can you sell those artifacts at the tech yes city museum maybe i've got one up in the background there oh wait there is a gpu up in the there's actually two artifacting gpus up there there's the pcbs i use them for decorations so but don't pay good money like don't pay good money for a card that's artifacting i got sent a link the other day actually and i'll show you guys right here i think i i don't know if it's still for sale someone might have taken the bait but there was a gtx um a gtx 690 let me just pull because facebook is pretty sensitive i want to make sure i don't get anyone's names up there because you can get caught you can die you duck sing someone it's like no i'm not i'm just trying to show a deal so this one here has been up for a while now uh this one here has been up for gtx 690 for 50 right and i'm telling you now it is it's not that good like this this here at 50 bucks is is a car that's artifacting so i wouldn't buy this the guy's like oh it's got a problem with the blue screen it blew screens and i'm like yeah so what's happened is the guy has probably picked it up and put it in his computer and it doesn't even make it to windows so it just gives you a driver error so that means when it tries to install the driver it's gone so this card to me is worthless it's not even worth 50 bucks so i'd stay clear of this this one right here here's one that works for 200 but i wouldn't pay 200 for a 690. they're basically a useless card i'd rather 680 because yeah at least you're using less power in games especially modern games uh 5600x versus the 3700x for the next five years uh gaming with moderate so we've got a donation thanks for the donation that's hrk is that hong kong dollars might be um gaming with moderate editing in resolve or something simpler if overly complicated with 2060 or so next year which 3700x yeah it's going to be cheaper and resolve is going to support 8 core 16 threads so you're just going to be saving money and put that money towards your next build gaming gaming itself like a 5600x is good but so is the 3700x especially with your 2060 if you're on that setup for the next five years that's that setup 2060 is going to be fine with both those cpus so i'll just save you money my man go with the 3700x at least locally here they're cheaper like i picked up a 3700x for 250 as opposed to a 5600x which is 450 aussie dollars uh we got here from a five dollar donation from tommy pearson thank you so much uh i have an x99 with a 6950x that i just replaced with a 10 850 k and a z590 i am in the us if you want to message me i can show you pictures asrock gaming i7 motherboard oh you've got the x99 yeah sure i'd love to see them pictures we may we might have the x99 board okay let me know how much you want for that x99 board because locally here if i type in x99 if i type in x99 here i guarantee you i'll be met with some dude who wants to charge me yeah there's no x99 boards for sale there's one guy here selling the server but that's it what about good old game tree i made this i've made this way too big uh okay uh x99 motherboard let's see what we got okay someone has got a sale does he have an x99 board i would be doing this soup we're doing the parts aunt soon i shouldn't do this on a live stream 280 no i don't want to pay that for an x99 motherboard i don't want to pay i want to pay one flight i want to get one for like 150 bucks value you know but 200 is the max i'm willing to pay for an x 99 so i mean it's just 280 just like damn man i want to get one for like 150 aussies so yeah it's just it's not happening though because there's too much there's too much value like you know you can do so much with the x99 boards especially with those zeons right so you can do so much with them and the aliexpress c on boards the x99 boards is so cheap so uh we've got five dollars from cryptocheck uh what gpu do i need for a 4k mondo i have a gtx 1660 but i've not played any games on it yet oh 1080 ti would be the best for a 4k monitor that'd be my go my go-to like on a budget it was best price performance so you can still pick up a 1080i for a pretty good price so that would be my go my go-to my man that would be me so i got the titan x as well so you guys are asking about titan x so high tech yes love the support from bangladesh thank you thank you guys for all tuning in hi brian i've got a xeon x uh 5450 with a zeus g41 board i can't install the win10 on it do you have a hint for me uh yeah so on the older g41 boards some of those boards can be so problematic that you've got to do a rufus um so you gotta you gotta do a windows boot from rufus with the compatibility on because the windows 10 creation tool for a g41 board might not work so you've got to go to rufus they've actually got some options for this and you can make a bootable on rufus that will work on the g41 that's a little tip and trust me i was pulling my hair out took me a while to figure that one out but hopefully that helps you uh yeah so use rufus for the boot on the g41 and yeah you can turn that into a good office pc uh sorry i did did i miss a question before as well before the camera battery someone was like they got the 780 ti and the driver supports going out in october and just like my camera went out so the driver support is going out in october uh we got some more sharon i'm loving these sharing gun donations thanks ah thanks mod is that's that i don't know if i'm butchering the pronunciation get the gymnasium one what are we talking about i don't know we've gone from sharing guns to tunisium we're going from everything here we're just having a bit of a bit of a fun night here on the live streams uh take a city what's a good price for a 1080 um max 400 aussie i that's like the going rate generally i try to get like i try to get him for 350 aussie i i haven't been that successful albeit i haven't been that successful at all but 1080 ti 1080 they're good cards still uh sir can you bench the 30 90 6900 xt and call of duty warzone game i mean if if we've got a video coming up with those two cards i can feature it for you sure but in terms of me doing a dedicated video to 30 90 and 6900 xt they're both to me they're just not really like i mean if i was to get a 3090 or a 6900 xt and i had just all the money in the world i'd probably go for the 30 90 just for dlss uh 2.0 on some of the games like at 4k 120 hertz so even though the 6900xc is probably going to be a little bit cheaper but even then i'd get a 30 80 or or a 6800 xt because they're much better value so i just i haven't really been recommending the 3090 or 6900 xt so uh thank you by the way take your city i'm giving your two cents on the rx 570 and how it is good value at the moment yeah man yes it's one of my favorite cars rx 475 70 just stick to those stick to four gigabyte cards gtx 970 uh even like a gtx 980 if you can find it for a decent price uh these are solid cards man i can't go wrong with them uh g even a gtx 960 you find at a decent price these are cards that will just get you through um these crappy pricing uh and one thing for sure it's like one thing with gpu prices the stock it's common these cards are coming into stock right and so we're this situation now with a record high supply of graphics cards they just keep coming they don't stop and so they got to move them and so if they can't move them at the current prices then the price has to come down it's that simple uh so do i smell a windows 10 guide for g41 no marco i smell a um windows look i'm on windows 11 like i'm not like i switched over i switched like look at this beautiful windows 11 stuff right here the the only complaint i have for windows 11 right now there's only one big thing that bothers me with windows 11 and that is you cannot drag items you can't drag like say for instance you've got a picture and you're in photoshop you cannot drag the picture and then alt tab like in the taskbar and then drop it in like the the taskbar won't mouse over and open the program that is the biggest pet peeve i have with windows 11 right now it is really annoying me and i wish microsoft would fix that like asap because there is some like trick you can do with regedit on windows 11 to fix it make it like windows 10 the problem is it just blocks out your whole start menu your start menu doesn't work anymore so i was like oh damn so yeah microsoft please bring back the drag alt tab drop taskbar facility because it was it just works so well yes you can still press alt tab but it's just it's dumb anyway uh two dollars canadian two dollars olessio m thanks man what's your current rig so i am at the moment i'm using the uh 7980xe so that's what i mean i've still been using this cpu in the background so i got it like i got it ages ago it was an engineering sample quality sample um from intel and i've got the x299 from asrock and i've got 64 gigabytes of ram you need 64. i was even thinking like i probably need for 4k video adding 128 and i've got 380 ti in there and an elgato 4k capture card so that um th this rig right here the 7980xe still does everything that you know i've tried the 5950x i had my main editing rig as a 5950x and it was good to see that the new 5000 series was really good but in terms of me noticing a difference for my workflow in adobe premiere pro the 7980xe was just as good as the 11900k just as good as the 10900k i'd say even slightly better in certain situations because i overclock it and the 5950x was really good too but there wasn't like if i had like you know if if i was like oh do i need to change to a 5950x no like there's no it's not really going to save me like any time perceivable time so the 7980xe if you can find one cheap where you know they're really good cpu and i think they got flogged to death because people were just you know hating on intel at the time but like i'm from a guy who's used all this stuff and tested it strenuously i'd like the that 18 core that intel released it's a solid cpu especially if you overclock it for for 4k video editing it's one of the best you can get um and then in games of course gaming is like gaming like gaming is not my main priority but man 4k doesn't make a difference so anyway you guys coming in gpus when msrp when crypto rug pull that's it when crypto that's actually that's before we close out this stream well we'll just lastly we'll do a little crypto little crypto price check because i was like i saw the other day oh man look at this up and down like whoa look at this volatility wow oh man that rug pool could be coming ever closer man look at this imagine imagine like imagine having like a graphic imagine having a business where you're okay just picture this imagine having a business where you're selling uh bacon and eggs you're in the food business right and you've got a menu you get one day you're selling uh bacon eggs on toast it's 15 the next day you got to drop the price to 11 the next day it's 20 do you think like do you think for for an honest second here do you think that you would have a uh retainable customer base do you think these people would be wanting to keep coming back oh i can't wait to go back to the restaurant and uh possibly pay twice the the amount of money for my bacon and eggs that i did two weeks ago no right like it's a horrible situation so like this is um this right here like look at this volatility man it's like in in two days you're going from three thousand three hundred dollars to two thousand nine hundred back up again what what's next for this thing is it going to just fall off a cliff and so that's what i was saying be very careful with this thing because as quick as it goes up it can come down again so oh yeah please stop spamming the chat man we're trying to have a civilized conversation uh marco is going to have to go um yeah marco's going hard so a crypto has been going down to zero yeah zero dollars for 12 years now yeah i mean how many of you if you were if you had the four like this is the thing about no one talks about with crypto was uh where did you buy bitcoins in 2013 i mean some people lost all their money when mount gox went down you know some people lost it all man so at the same time it's been going up but it's also been a very tricky market you know you could have bought at the peak in 2018 at the start of the year and then lost like got margin called or whatever or lost a lot of money and came into tough times you got to sell down your crypto um i mean yeah crypto's crypto goes up and down but i mean i'm not too bullish on a lot of the crypto at the moment the only one i i seem to ethereum has got its uses but i think xrp is a lot more useful and then even the price of that is up and down like a yo-yo so um yeah in terms of me and crypto like i've made money off it in the past like had i just like i mean look had i just honestly this is the funny thing about crypto there's regrets right you know had i just stuck to zen cash and just like went all in on zen cash i would like be like a multi-millionaire that that would be like the craziest thing but who had the foresight to see that zen cash would go up to uh yeah like a hundred and fifty dollars like i mean look at this thing like who's got a crystal ball to see that this coin would would go up to like 150 dollars from from i think it was three like i sold mine around i think it was like 40 35 dollars i had some of them and i sold them but i sold a few of them back here but had i kept getting them and putting all my savings into this coin especially when i was like three dollars in dollar cost averaging uh yeah had i'd had the foresight to say yeah zen cash is just going to be like it man it's going to go up to 150 bucks um yeah i mean i wouldn't like i wouldn't need to work a day in my life that'd be pretty cool wouldn't it but i mean who has the crystal ball to fit to see that this this asset is going to go from five dollars to 150 and then back down to 50 to 48 or 50 again 44 wow so yeah that's volatility for you um we've got 4.99 donation uh do you think the substrate shortage will be as bad as a silicon shortage or will it just mean minor price increases for cpus i think there's going to be going forward as long as the stimulus as long as governments don't keep printing out money you're going to find a lot of these so-called shortages will just go away and that's all you're going to see once the once the easy money stops floating around and it's already showing signs of it like in australia they're not running they're not rolling up the printers like they were last year so once it shows us shows signs of slowing down and inflation kicks in then you won't see the shortage on cpus that you will see on the gpus and then mainly like if we never had crypto mining if we didn't have all this right here i guarantee you there would be no gpu shortage it's just all these miners were coming in and buying them all up and putting them on the bench and it started from i mean it started about september like the guys who got in from who i've spoke to they got in around september october that's when they're all getting in buying them all up and then they just rode that wave and they sold into it man i mean if you if you timed if you timed the crypto right is there anyone out there that timed it right they were like yeah man cryptos going high and then they saw this peak right here and they're like this is too much i'm selling is there any guys in the chat if you're out there you've done pretty well like props to you you've got some really good foresight but in terms of would you go all in on that i mean you can ask the countless other guys in the past i mean if you if you went all in on some of those uh dot-com bobble stocks in 2000 it might be a different story you might have lost the lot so any there's always risk to anything man always keep that in mind um yeah have you heard about uh china region floods nope haven't heard about that we can check it out right now man this live stream this is we're going to run out of a second our china region floods let's have a look top stories shanghai region braces for typhoon in after flooding in central china oh wow the city of zhengzhou reels after historic reigns man hats off to you guys i feel sorry for you i mean not hats off so that's the word this is why like live streaming you can make the you you meant to say one thing and you say the complete opposite it's like yeah rejoice no i didn't mean to say i mean i feel sorry for you guys this looks terrible um damn poor people man flooding is just yeah it comes out of nowhere like louise dude he's riding a bike why is that just funny he's riding a bicycle in the flood like wouldn't it be faster just to swim um i've never rode a bicycle in flood water so man i'm surprised there's not many people looting like usually like look at like the floods look pretty calm if he's riding a bike usually there'd just be people like yeah just going running around like looting everything so that's actually pretty like china man looks like things are pretty civil at least for a flood like a calm flood yeah she's just like yo i'm just going about my business just another flood so surf's up dude that's it you guys know what's up in the chat so flooding continues i mean yeah hasn't like 60 years so it's just one of those big events i mean in terms of uh is it going to affect uh supply of tech products who knows man it depends what the media wants to spin but whenever there's a profit to be made there's not really going to be shortages keep that in mind uh jb a five dollar donation long time fan thanks for your content thanks for the donation brother thanks for the donation um yeah so that's the china floods anyway guys we're gonna wind up this stream we're gonna wind it down a little bit thanks for tuning in and i hope you guys enjoyed we talked about pretty

of all time final question before i get on out of here favorite oh and we got a uh sorry i thought that was a five dollar management thought thanks bro favorite gpu of all time man it's hard to say that's that's a hard one like i was gonna say the cliche 8800 gt but i like honestly i've enjoyed newer gpus more that's a hard my favorite gpu man because there's a few good ones like i was gonna say like believe it or not i really liked before the mining boom the 1660 super was really good i really liked the 1660 super i like the 1070 as well 1070 ended up being pretty solid too yeah 1080 ti 1070 1660 super that was some of my favorite cards and the rx 470 4 gigabyte so rx 470 as well so there's my four cards like if i had to say the four cards of last 10 years that'd be probably my favorites so yeah they were they were just solid cards man they came in with good prices all these cards were just good prices it was good to be a tech enthusiast you had pub g everyone was playing pub g and

brother i'm a night owl as well here's five bucks is it true that the gtx 1080 bottlenecks and i7 4th gen uh yeah it all depends on your ddr3 memory man um if you've got really crap ddr4 memory in that i7 and you're playing at 1080p it can bottleneck it definitely so depends on your memory with the i7 4th gen you need some decent xmps tuned in there so don't forget that a lot of people like i see a lot of builds out there people just put in garbage memory 133 megahertz not even tune that ddr3 memory and they'll be like why is the 1080 not performing that well and it's like well yeah you've got to give that a bit more tend to love and care the older stuff to really get the most out of especially first and second gen stuff too anyway guys thanks so much love each and every one of you it's
