here in the background is a pc known as
darth jar jar well actually i'm going to be calling it now
scuffed jar jar because this build originally was a custom water
build that i did here on the channel over a year ago and
since then i haven't really used it much and you guys have critiqued us about why
haven't you used this pc what's going on it was a beautiful build
it had a dual xeon sr2 motherboard and it was just really
like represented tech yes city a lot and yeah i loved the build until after
using it for about 10 hours i came into this problem where the pump
was just making this really loud noise so in today's video we're going to go
through my experience and vlog about pulling this thing apart and
making it into a usable pc that i can use here at tech yes city and
also in the process talk about i guess the dangers of custom
water cooling so let's roll that intro and then get into
the vlog [Music] so this right here is darth jar jar my
custom water cooled build that was built over a year ago it's
actually been about a year and a half since its first inception and
it was an awesome build until this water pump
basically started making some really bad noise
and i'll let you guys take a quick listen to that so you can just hear it there just it's
this annoying noise and it just drives me nuts so like basically the
problem with this is too in order for me to replace this
pump because i'm told it's faulty in order
for me to replace it i've got to pull everything apart and put it back in
again and there's no guarantee that the next pump that i put in could
have some problems as well so this is i guess the dark side with darth
jar jar the dark side of water cooling so what
i'm going to do here today is i'm going to empty this loop out
and i'm going to start pulling this thing all apart because i do want a pc
as a secondary pc and i want it to kind of be like a
xeon system so i might be just changing it over and doing a quick fix today
with the hopes of maybe ordering in some custom parts again
to fix up this loop for a later day but first things first we're going to turn
this thing off empty out the loop which we've got a drain right here
and then we're going to start pulling it all apart [Music]
so so we've now pulled apart darth jar jar
in all its glory but this is the masterpiece
and the heart of the build the sr2 motherboard bigger than
uh eatx motherboards this was a special size in its own
so it required a special case to begin with or at least
the modding of a case to fit it properly however one thing about this motherboard
is it's probably honestly worth more um working condition and just
sitting on a shelf being a collector's item than me actually using it so
because it's so rare there's only a limited number of these made
and they actually do overclock uh xeons and two cpus like it's the last
generation of dual xeon overclocking or even i think two cpu
together overclocking which makes it such a special board
so we're going to sideline that and then get over to the case right now and talk
about what's going on over here
and how we're going to approach this build right now
so now here's what's left of the build at the moment
i've had to take the uh rat off the top right out the front i've taken the pump
out that all took a while because it was
just so i guess cluttered in there and there was so many
cables that i've had to pull out extra cables that i actually didn't need
and that was even with the sr2 to begin with because all those extra connections
on the sr2 are mainly for quad sli and since we're only using a single gpu
we actually didn't need all those extra wires so what i'm going
to do now is try and piece together the original mounts for
an atx board and add a rear exhaust fan and then try and get that mounted
and then see what i can do here to rebuild
scuffed jar jar but also there's all the water cooling parts i'm just i just put
them in a bucket so if there's any water still inside any
of those parts i guess they'll just come out overnight
and i mean i can use that stuff except the pump the pump's gone
i know that so some of the other parts i'm sure i could
utilize but i also need to go to the hardware store and get a special
allen key for the the block on the 980 ti
2 to remove that [Music] um
[Music] and now we've rebuilt darth jar jar with
a lot more room inside it's a bit spacious here now we've got a
140 mil exhaust fan we've got a 5700 xt
upgrade from the 980 ti we've changed the cables because i had this
cable set around here i've had it for like years it's blue and black cable set
matches the build perfectly and we've also just got scuffed like
wires hanging everywhere and i'm thinking to myself
man i could do some cable management or i could kind of like since the
whole thing like this whole thing is just banged up i mean
there's just panels like panels are misaligned
things don't fit properly even at the front bits are falling off it
so usb slots are missing up the top i'm just thinking like i might as well just
don't do cable management scuff this thing up a little bit
harder maybe just put some thermal paste here and just smudge it on
we'll just do that a little bit you know like just
just in name of like sort of just like death star 2 sort of thing like so there
we go we'll just smudge a bit of thermal paste on there
just to sort of like give it a a nice authentic look and so this is
what it's going to look like now and i guess we can boot this thing up
[Applause] [Music]
and finally we are back on a used zeon at tech yes city now
this one for me personally is a little more special
than the sr2 and you're going to think what the sr2 is dual xeons
and the reason why for me personally is because i pulled this motherboard in the
background here out of a dumpster and i bent the pins back and i got it
working again so i'll put the specs up on the screen for you guys but
this a setup like this can do everything that the latest and greatest setup can
do the 1680 v2 is nothing to laugh at when
you overclock it really good performance a 5700 xt really
good card in its own right the only thing you're really missing is
i guess rtx voice if you're streaming which
that is really powerful believe me it's a really good tool if you've got a lot
of background noise but of course the way to get around that is
to not have background noise and so you'll notice that the tai chi
the 5700 xt that we're using in idle mode and even when you're gaming
it's really quiet and that's the good thing about that
same with the h115i rgb platinum both really good parts even though
corsair and asrock are channel sponsors here
i'd be using both these components in any build any day of the week
though besides that we've got cheap monitors here like i'm using a p191w
acer monitor i got this off les for 15 bucks and i've got
a 17-inch monitor which someone just gave me they said they don't even want
it anymore it's a dime like hey i'll make a use for that monitor though
in the next video we'll talk about streaming setups and how you can get
into it for cheap without having to go and buy a 500 motherboard because there
are some things to look out for like usb ports cutting out and stuff if
you're overloading them especially on cheap motherboards so we'll talk about
all that in the next video let's get on to water cooling and the
dangers of it and also i guess the big negatives first
of all is the cost that's a no-brainer right like you're looking
at the costs of a custom water cooled build
all the parts they're usually from niche manufacturers
and when you've got niche manufacturers making these parts
they're not going to be able to source the materials with economies of scale
and so what this means is that say for instance you've got corsair selling
10 000 all-in-one liquid coolers versus say a manufacturer making
a water pump reservoir combo say for instance they're using the same pump
since corsair is selling so much more of them they're going to be ordering a lot
more so they're going to be getting a discount
versus the niche manufacturer so that in itself
is going to raise costs alone when it comes to custom water cooling parts then
of course there's making the custom parts whether
it's a water block or whatnot because they have to custom design those
water blocks for the latest and greatest graphics cards
that stuff costs money so generally when you want to make a custom water cooled
build you're going to be looking at a lot more
money to be outlaid and then as we saw with this build today
if something goes wrong you're gonna have to spend so much more
time to get that build to work properly and so that was
the thing that frustrated me the most today was i
outlaid all this cash for darth jar jar spent heaps of time with ethan from tag
mods making this thing and then i was just met with after 10 hours of use like
literally after i did the video on the performance and
overclocking i was met with a pump that just started making this weird
eerie sound and so maybe it's got to do with the pump not being able to supply
water to a 480 mil and a 240 mil rat in the same
loop who knows but the bottom line is i would have had to have gone out buy a
new pump and still pull this whole build apart
because the pump was the last thing i could get to so it was
just designed in that way and i guess when it was designed we never thought
the pump would go especially so quickly so i would have had to pull it all apart
like i did put a new pump and refill it and then of
course i run new risks coming in whether there could be a leak or
something like that and i might have to do this 12 months later
so having a custom water cooled build is a cool thing in that it looks great it's
going to look so much better than a lot of pre-built pcs
but there's so much more that goes into it so
i will be having another custom build with the
z490 aqua coming on i'm going to be collabing with another youtuber
we're going to make a custom build for you guys but
when it comes down to i'm not a big fan of custom water cool builds especially
if you're going to use it as your main computer
and especially if you've got to do work on it just consider that
if something goes wrong there could be a lot of down time
and if you can't afford that downtime especially if you're working with it
and it's making you money as your job then i would
caution very lightly with going with custom watercool builds
so for me now i've got another set up i got this set up here
i've got my main rig so if something goes wrong between one of the rigs i can
still get videos edited i can still do work
so basically for me personally going forward with custom water cooled builds
i'm going to tread very lightly of course
but on top of that i'm going to make sure any build that i do
it's got a easy to access pump and reservoir which i can change
out so if something goes wrong i can just maybe empty the loop and then
just change that part without having to do too much extra
work and so that's something i've learned
personally from this build and everything involved
another thing i've learned too is that definitely when i get
another pump for this build because i got recommended this pump for darth jar
jar so i had no idea but in the next build i do i'm going to go
and make sure that i get like the best pump reservoir you can get
whether it's 400 or 500 because if you're going to do this stuff
i'd recommend just getting the best stuff because you're ready
if you're going with a custom water cooled build your your price performance
is already out the window at this stage you're just going for the
aesthetics and i guess the extra cooling performance
which you are going to get but your price performance is just out the window
and you definitely want to get something that's going to last and work properly
or at least i'd hope you would and so that's something i've learned
personally out of darth jar jar and so going forward
i'm really going to make a note to get the best stuff if i do a custom water
cool build in the future anyhow guys i hope you enjoyed this
video if you did be sure to hit that like button for us
also let us know what you think of the new setup i want to do more
news videos and stuff like that and just quick
sort of off the cuff videos where i can get you guys news
and um important news and especially tutorials and stuff like that done
a lot easier than i otherwise would recording off a dslr through a memory
card and then editing in adobe premiere pro so
hopefully this setup is nice the microphone sounds good this will be my
first time hearing it back but also do let us know in the comment
section below what's your personal experience or opinions on
custom water cooling setups do you like going that route or do you like going
say with the all-in-ones or do you like going with air cooling on that note as
well have you delved into used custom water cooling something that
i've never done something that i kind of probably want
to stay away from especially after seeing this water pump and how it
went bad and pretty much i don't think it's going
to be easy to replace i think you just got to get a new one
though do let us know love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just
like this question of the day here which comes from
heclanet and they asked did you say amd motherboard or intel
i mean because the prices look like intel this is in the uh
previous video we did on the b550 uh asrock
phantom gaming itx motherboard this motherboard is coming at 200 us and
you you'll notice with b550 the prices are
higher than they're used to being and that's because they've got the pcie 4
they've got all the the chipset costs more essentially with b450 but another
thing i've noticed too is that this time around a lot of the
b550s are able to run those 16 core chips
and so for me it feels like there's this prerequisite with b550
where the manufacturers have to put in all this extra componentry and that's
raising the cost so i would like to see amd perhaps make
a b530 or some type of new motherboard where
it's targeted towards four cores and eight cores and people who just want to
maybe overclock a six core or something like that
and so you don't have to go out and spend all this extra money
on a b550 versus i mean versus a b530 that would have say
pca4 on board it has all the new features and its upgrade ability
is there for the next generation chips because at the moment b450 is the
value king same with a320 if you don't mind not overclocking
and you get a decent one of course and you're just coupling with a four or six
core but in terms of them making a new
refresh of b450 i think the potential is definitely there
to do that and maybe even add pcie 4.0 in
with something like a b530 motherboard lineup
i think that'd be cool but until then yes the motherboards are going to be
overpriced because at least what i've tested with b550 is they're all running
16 cores anyhow to answer the question directly
yes i did say amd motherboard in that video
hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're
enjoying that content you want to see the moment it drops
be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
