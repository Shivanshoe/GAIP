today we are going to be building a 350 gaming pc that will play all titles at 1080p with smooth fps and the biggest star of today is the gtx 980 ti you can pick these up on the used market for under 200 us dollars now the one that we got here we got it on a deal in tokyo for a hundred and fifty dollars roughly in a used pc parts hunt that we recently did and some of the other key components that we picked up here is the 4770k this is a great cpu even in today's modern standards four cores eight threads going to be perfectly fine for playing those games and then we've got 16 gigabytes of ddr3 memory a budget h81m motherboard a 500 watt power supply 500 gigabyte ssd of course with the case in the cooler which we got used as well so i'll throw up the total prices that we paid for these parts but i'll also throw up on the right hand side of your screen what you could expect to pay if you just bought these parts buy it now on the internet so you can see there the discrepancy between buying local deals and buying it straight off the internet and buy it now is roughly a hundred dollars difference but with that aside let's build this thing up see if we come into any problems with this configuration and if there are any problems we'll iron them out just like we did in the previous gaming budget pc that we did with the gtx 970 so let's forget this attack yes a party astarte are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2 links in description below [Music] you make me [Music] you make me [Music] make me feel [Music] and this gaming pc is now finished we are benchmarking it on the cpu side of things just to test stability we'll also run a benchmark on the graphics card which is pretty important just to gauge the temperatures and also gauge how much power consumption is being used however in the case of the cpu we've also gone an extra step here and we've under vaulted this 4770k you may be like well why would you under vault we want more performance and this has to do with the fact that we've used a very cheap motherboard it's a h81 and it's one of the cheaper h81 versions as well so out of the box this was going near 100 watts with the 4770k at 3.7 gigahertz and so what i realized in the bios is if we keep that 3.7 gigahertz locked in what we can then do is essentially drop the voltage that's going to the cpu and after doing this we've now got our power consumption down to 84 watts on the cpu so it's using less power giving out the exact same performance and of course we're going to have a cooler running cpu too but speaking of temperatures we don't need to delid this i7 4770k the temperatures are absolutely fine and the good thing is too is this scythe cooler that we got for it for seven dollars at the junk store this is running perfectly as well very quiet the whole build is just whisper quiet but of course with that aside let's boot up some games and see how this thing performs [Music] [Music] make me [Music] [Music] and after playing some games for a few hours and running some benchmarks i am extremely impressed with how this pc performed at 1080p the first benchmark we decided to do was battlefield 1 and here we had a range of high and low settings i tested it at both resolutions just to give you guys an idea of if say you want to play competitively and you don't mind turning the graphics settings down what fps you can expect to get as well as if the game is stuttering with the 1 and 0.1 percent lows and here it did a fine job at 1080p i was actually very impressed with how the gtx 980 ti performs not just the card itself which we might make a dedicated video for but also in relation to how it performs with the i7 4770k the next game we decided to test was of course the age-old favorite fortnite and the reason i mainly test this game is because when i sell the pc everyone always wants to know how fortnite performs but since i'm in japan at the moment i think the meta here is apex legends it is definitely for pc gaming at the moment i feel the most popular game in japan where everyone i talked to who asked me oh what you into i say i like pc gaming then they say oh you played apex legends and they call it apexu over here and so benchmarking that is equally as important as fortnite and here is where it did an absolutely fine job we're getting over 120 average fps in this game with a blend of high and low settings but going back to fortnite here is where the game ran a lot smoother at the low settings with the epic view distance i still find fortnite just hammers those especially 0.1 percent lows where it just seems to stutter randomly and i do think it's mounting to the level where i actually want to investigate this game with different hardware setups and see what the exact problem is and why it stutters but it does play a lot better at the low settings than it does at the high settings however that out of the way i decided to test a new benchmark called easy bench and this is essentially the unreal engine 5 and they're making a benchmark that you can test at different resolutions so 1080p 1440p or 4k or even ultra wide if you didn't wish to and what we found here was this pc was having a hard time doing this benchmark at 1080p we're scoring on average 20 fps but the funny thing about this benchmark is that it's going to be an indicator of future performance at least on the high end in terms of resolutions and what games are coming out in the future say for instance there's this latest and greatest game it uses unreal engine 5 and it's got all the graphics settings cranked up then you can expect to maybe on this setup get around 20 fps in that game however i'd like to see this benchmark maybe add some low medium and high settings and different settings just so you can gauge what the future capability of the gaming pc will be as i found this benchmark is definitely stressing the hardware as much as it can however you may have noticed also while we're benchmarking this pc the temperatures were really good and also when i was playing the noise was extremely good i've got this pc on in the background at the moment and it's just pretty much near whisper quiet and that just shows that even on a budget you can get decent looks out of a computer as well as decent performance in terms of not just the maximum fps but as well as keeping things low noise and good temperatures so in my opinion today's build was just one of my favorite that i've done in a long time we've got that minimalist look going on but at the same time it definitely brings more than minimal especially for that price point of 350 usd they're going into this build i was actually worried about the motherboard the h81 from gigabyte this was actually an oem that was assigned to a company here that makes gaming pcs called mouse computer at least when i checked hardware monitor and running the benchmarks it was saying mouse computer in the description of the motherboard so that was very interesting to see that gigabyte did oem some of their budget boards to these batik manufacturers here in japan but that aside i was worried that it would throttle the 4770k when it came to not just gaming but also especially the more heavier benchmarks on the cpu like cinebench and here i was pleasantly surprised especially after we undervolted it that it could handle the 4770k at 3.7 gigahertz all core and so in order to do that we undervolted the cpu 100 millivolts and that did the job we couldn't go any lower than that to test if maybe lower voltages would help the situation even more if it could handle it because that was the maximum on the motherboard and that's what it had to offer and i actually tried playing around with some different settings and it just pretty much bogged out we couldn't do a whole lot more in other words if you wanted to undervolt on this motherboard that was shown in the video today you pretty much only get there just by changing that one voltage setting and it's limited to minus 100 millivolt now in terms of the two eight gigabyte sticks of ddr3 memory there was actually no xmp profiles to lock in so i manually locked in 1600 megahertz cl 10 10 10 and then 30 on the timings which did work absolutely fine and i noticed especially when it came to apex legends one of the games that i used to test if a computer is really running smooth and stable since the engine itself is very well optimized for pc i found that there was no stuttering on the one percent and 0.1 lows which is what we want if we're playing pc games especially multiplayer games anyway with that aside hope you guys enjoyed today's budget 350 us gaming pc if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below do you think this pc is perfect for the money or would you change some things or have you built something recently for a similar price point if so what did you get for the dollar love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from alan d and they ask hey brian just wondering has the japanese second-hand market changed nowadays with regards to cultural aspects i remember a while ago that in japan second-hand items were seen as not desirable sometimes disposable even though in perfectly working order cheers so to answer that one directly in terms of my experience recently versus years ago basically over 10 years ago used products were definitely not desirable for especially japanese native japanese but a lot of foreigners i think have come to japan they don't mind so much buying used hardware especially if the price is right when i came here initially i had a field day it was like just a christmas shopping experience all over japan products that were labeled as junk essentially no claim no return were looking pretty good on the shelves and the price was just a fraction of that of new and so you could definitely get a really good bargain but nowadays i think the culture has changed a little bit in favor of picking up used stuff i don't think it's as frowned upon as it was back in the day and i think that's a good change for the better where instead of consuming all this new stuff you can recycle the used stuff get some more usage out of it but i feel like the bargains in the us here are definitely out of the tech scene itself where i feel like enthusiasts gaming pc tech parts have the biggest premium on them in terms of used versus other products for instance i recently got an at2035 a condenser microphone for like forty dollars and it had a six month warranty on it and this thing looked like it was in pristine condition i also got a used audio interface there was originally maybe two hundred dollars when it first came out got that for around thirty dollars so i think a lot of bargains in the used field are outside of the gaming tech space that's what i've been finding i think in the gaming tech space itself the prices are a bit elevated because i think there's just such a big demand especially when we see this apex legends boom going on in japan a lot of people want to build a gaming pc and so they don't mind saving a few bucks going used but in that way it does add to the demand and that increases the price of the used products in the gaming pc tech space anyway hope that answers that question sorry if it was a bit lengthy of an answer but i love talking about this stuff with you guys and with that aside if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you guys in another one very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
