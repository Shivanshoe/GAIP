oh my gosh is that a silicon-backed
monitor bro uh yes it is um is this still about
available is it still available is this still an airplane capable of playing a war zone with high
fps what's the fps gonna get on the cod this
weekend with the boys a couple of weeks ago here at tech yes
city we were flipping our way up with that $100 challenge and within that
video i did a couple of setups with call of
duty warzone backgrounds or wallpapers on the
monitors in the shots and there's a lot of reasons for doing
this but after i did that i noticed that a lot of people were
sending me messages and some people even calling me up just saying
that was like some of the funniest stuff i've seen and they were laughing at it
like the fact that it you know it does work and it works extremely well
so today we're going to explore the whole world
of the call of duty warzone wallpaper and the origins of it
what's the story with it and of course when you should be pulling off this
tactic if you want to help sell your gaming pc
let's go in with it with our little uh silicon
monitor here that we picked up i think there's about 15 aussie dollars i picked
this up for 22 inch monitor we've just got a free stand here we've
silicone that to the back of the monitor let's check out what we've got pop a lot
in here uh hey mate um yeah i'm actually in the market for a juicy
z490 motherboard if you're after a juicy z490 motherboard then the asrock z490
phantom gaming itx has you covered with thunderbolt 3
nahimic audio and addressable rgb on top of that
juicy vrm that can power even the likes of a 10 900k
links in description below to find out more now the art of the wallpaper with a
gaming pc setup when you go on a flip it dates
at least for me personally and people locally dates back to around 2017
with the release of pub g now you're probably thinking well wasn't it
fortnite and no actually fortnite came after pub
g in terms of its popularity and selling
gaming pcs it was originally pubg that made this big splash on the pc that
started to get people over from console which compared to a pc
can be a lot more simple which is a big appeal of it however
pubg bringing people over to pc also brought with it when you're trying to
sell a pc all these questions and it came with the
can this play pub g and it was just that was the
main question can it play pubg or what fps does it get on pub g and
then you're left with okay what settings what resolution
and pretty much a lot of the times people
just want to get the cheapest thing possible
and hope that it can play pubg and so when we had a wallpaper
with that game on it in with a pc and a mouse and keyboard since they were
coming over from console it helped not only sell the whole pc but
it pretty much made a statement of this pc can play pubg and so i found it
just saved a lot of time when it came to
answering questions and of course you're making a few more bucks
when you're flipping these gaming setups as opposed to a gaming pc
but of course after that came fortnite and this was
the massive boom where people just wanted to play on pc in general
and i mean even though the game was released on console it just had a lot of
people that wanted to play on mouse and keyboard because i guess
a lot of the pro players were all mouse and keyboard especially the pro
streamers and so that brought with it a heap of
people wanting to buy gaming pc so that was another trend that came
through where it's starting to i guess fall off i get
well it's fallen off a lot since when fortnight was in its boom
period but now it's coming in with a war zone and the
reason it's coming in with warzone is actually two-fold of course war zones
a lot newer than both pubg and fortnite but also
warzone requires quite a more powerful pc than both of
these two previous games before and i find you're going to at least
want to get something around a gtx 770 and even a first gen i7 to get decent
fps as opposed to pub g and a fortnight you
could get away with an i5 and in the case of fortnite you could
even get away with an i3 and still get playable like fps
as well as fx 6300s and stuff like that i mean the good thing about warzone
however is back on that note of fx cpus they do play a lot better on this
game so that's one good thing that's going for war zone is it's
optimized for multi-cores a lot better however one of the most important things
with this setup sort of display and having the wallpaper
there is that you've also of course got a monitor and keyboard and mouse
that can in ways detract away from the case and
this is i guess one of those things where if you're on a budget especially
people always want rgb it doesn't matter what
price point it is in general i know a few you guys are going to be out there
and say well i don't like rgb at all i like to keep the lights off but in
general when it comes to selling a pc rgb and leds they sell pcs and this is
just the thing so if you come into a situation where
you've got a budget pc you've picked the whole thing up for 100 bucks you've
slapped a graphics card in there but it doesn't look that good you can
add a one dollar led strip but a lot of the times that doesn't satisfy
people enough so if you've got a keyboard mouse and a monitor suddenly
with a flashy uh wallpaper of the game they want to play
it suddenly detracts away from that i guess you'd say not so
desirable gaming pc tower itself and so this is
another big reason for having those extra
peripherals in the photo is that it makes the setup
more i guess ascetically pleasing in the main photo itself and of course
people want more generally so there's another
generalization so i'm making quite a few generalizations
in today's video but generalizations they're going to save you a lot of time
especially if they're backed by experience which i guess in ways is
backed by unverified statistics which you know
upstairs is what you correlate all the time and so when i give advice a lot of
the times on the channel here i'm just speaking from experience which
does in ways have those unverified statistics and i mean you
guys can believe them or not but over time you start to see that the yes
man starts to always give you guys that healthy advice
to make sure that you're living a better life the last point we're going to touch
on with the setups themselves i'm going to
give you guys an example is that you're adding value ultimately
when you do this so you see me on part times i'm picking up these monitors
for maybe 30 40 recently they have gone up in price for some reason monitors
actually locally where i am they're being sold
out quite quickly so the prices are going up
you're adding a lot of value when you compare that to what people are going to
pay at a even a budget retailer that sells a lot
of pc parts regularly like say in australia
we've got umart in america you guys have amazon and micro center
but when we look at those stores they're giving some of the best value on new
parts but when we go to the regular retailers
the guys that are just i guess jacking up the prices more your
value on your setup starts to that thirty forty dollar monitor you got
starts to add almost a hundred dollars value on your setup sometimes and then
if you get a keyboard a mouse especially if you picked up one with rgb in it
you've got it for a really good price you can then add that into the setup and
suddenly people think they're getting sometimes two hundred
dollars extra value so now with that wallpaper you're doing
three things if you're doing it right that is you're selling a mediocre
looking tower better you're adding value and you're
saving time with questions and you're getting straight to the point
so tech your citizens that right there is the art of the call of duty wallpaper
and right here is our finished masterpiece we've got the call of duty
warzone backdrop on the monitor which really
just takes the focus on this game right here and the fact
that your pc can play this game so you will be saving
time as well as getting more attention with your pc because put it this way as
we said before there's commodities when it comes to selling a gaming pc
you've got it instant it's ready to go it's all ready to play that game but
when you've got that backdrop there that's like wow i can be just getting
this pc right now and playing call of duty warzone with
the boys and that is what you are selling now admittedly this case
actually surprised me it looked a lot better than i thought
i think this pc on its own could sell itself
without the monitor keyboard and mouse and even if you want to go as far to add
a little bit more led bling in the photo just hit the num lock the
caps lock key even the scroll lock key to turn those leds on at the top of the
keyboard just to make it look a little bit more bling worthy and here
it all is now with the call of duty warzone wallpaper and i guess
the picture does sometimes speak a thousand words
so what came to me as a joke i thought i'd turn it into a video
and just help you guys especially if you are trying to flip some pcs and getting
into it and a lot of people have been messaging
me lately especially in the last month uh just shown appreciation because i
guess they're getting into the whole world of pc building
and it's a lot of fun when you can build and try all these different hardware
configurations and not lose money and that's i guess
why i started out all those years doing it
because it could fuel that passion i noticed when i started building a new
computer i had this urge to build another one and
just try some different hardware out but the problem was when you bought all
these new parts off the shelf it was very hard to resell that stuff
without losing money so fast forward now during 2020 and
i guess it's now become this whole different league where
we've gone through the used flipping cycle and now it's just an ever-changing
beast but in terms of going forward what we
spoke about here is if you can get that monitor
for twenty thirty 30 and a cheap keyboard and mouse and throw it in
you can not only add value to the setup but you can take the shift away
from a cheaper pc case that is a lot of the times especially if you're on a
budget it's not worth it both in time and money
to go out and get that case and then change all the hardware over
because you're going to have to add that cost to the build to get back the money
you spent on the case and i mean jokes and giggles aside there
is that massive trend that's been coming through for a few years now
and that is people are changing from console to pc and when they do that
they a lot of the times jump off their tv
and they want to get a monitor and also a keyboard and mouse so having that
set up there as an option is always a good thing and as i said earlier
those two setups that i had in the second episode of the pc flip up
challenge they sold like almost instantly i was
actually shocked at how quick those two setups sold
and we made good profit on them as opposed to the
two pc builds i've done recently i've sold one of them and i've got another
sale lined up for the next one but that has taken a lot longer to sell
and i'm guessing that's mainly because a lot of people selling pcs at the moment
are just selling the pc so you've got a lot of competition there
in that space as opposed to a setup there's not a whole lot of people
selling setups at the moment so i'm going to
probably put a setup up for sale and see how it goes
anyhow all that aside i hope you guys enjoyed this one if you did then be sure
to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comment section
below what's your experience with the wallpapers are you rocking a
fortnight wallpaper are you rocking a call of duty wallpaper or are you
rocking a four guys wallpaper or a valerant raw paper i see they're
probably the four most common i did see someone
rocking a flight simulator wallpaper though i mean i'm not
too sure how the flight sim is going to sort of change the mainstream sure
microsoft flight simulator is selling really well on the market in terms of
people playing it and adopting it but i kind of don't see how people are
going to say oh i'm going to play flight simulator this weekend with the
boys as opposed to war zone which is a huge thing at the
moment where people want to play with their mates on the weekend
and they don't have a gaming pc or the gaming pc they had is just too slow
to play the latest cod anyhow we got the question of the day here which comes
from sergio ortiz and they ask why does everyone default to 3080
it's going to be called a 2180 seeing as 21 is all in the marketing so far so
2180 2170 etc and the 21 thing i mean
that would make sense if nvidia hasn't stopped
production completely of the 2000 series because of stock production the 2000
series i would only see them introducing the
2180 and all that stuff if they were continuing to sell the 2000
series because the numbering scheme wouldn't be that
big of a jump and it would be still allow people to
say okay the numbers aren't too much different
i can go and get an rtx 2000 card still and it's still going to be good
so them stopping the rtx 2000 series basically in my mind
means that they're going to be calling the rtx 3000 series because it's a big
leap in the numbering scheme and nvidia are
very smart they want to sell graphics cards and i feel like rtx 3000
would sell a lot better than 21 in that particular naming scheme so
at the end of the day i always analyze things as
they're a business they're a publicly traded company so they're going to do
best for what makes them money not just for them as a company but also for the
shareholders so basically answer that question i think it will definitely be
the 3000 series though i could be wrong hope that answers that question and if
you guys have stayed this far then be sure to hit that sub button and
ring that bell and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye [Music]
