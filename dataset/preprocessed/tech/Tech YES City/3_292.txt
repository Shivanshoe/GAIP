the used market for gaming pcs right now
can only simply be described as one thing
and that is a roller coaster and today we're going to talk about
what you can do on this roller coaster to make sure that your
back proverbially doesn't get thrown out or your neck doesn't get uncomfortable
why you are on this roller coaster because right now i'm getting a lot of
messages from people who are basically saying the same thing
as me and that is pcs are moving extremely slow in fact
some of the pcs are moving so slow to the point where
we've never been in a market that we're currently in right now
because here's the funny thing about the used market and that is i've only really
been in the used market since 2015 and since
2015 to this very point in time we've only
really seen an upswing in the market for used gaming
pcs however i believe from here on in we may
be going into a downswing and that's of course why i mentioned the
roller coaster at the start because there is going to be your times when
it's going to have really good demand but you're going to see this roller
coaster that's generally heading in the direction
that's going downwards so put on those used price performance capes
not the buying kind the selling kind because we're going to jump into the
tech yes mobile and do a tech yes delivery on a low end
banger and this is actually an important thing
because it's going to tie in very well in today's video
[Music] and we just finished that sweet tech yes
delivery and one thing we're going to touch on
straight away is there's a lot of guys out there
trying to sell what i call the sweet spot mid-range gaming pc at least in
australia and these usually go for a thousand to 1500 aussie dollars which in
the us would be like 700 to 1200 usd and the thing is when
you're trying to constantly sell pcs in this price range
there's a lot of other guys trying to sell pcs in this price range so there's
a lot of competition but the most important thing is too as we spoke about
in the past the higher the price range you go the
less potential customers you're going to have
so naturally the more competition there is in any field
the harder it is it's going to be essentially in this case to flip the
gaming pc but another thing is too because we're at that higher price range
and we've said this in the past the higher the price you go
the more people make a conscious buying decision so they're going to think a lot
more about it and they're going to be looking for the
best value on the market and that's another thing that's going to tie in
as to why your pc might not be selling right now and that's because
rtx 3000 we know this is a thing but it's such a big thing to the point where
a lot of people are now dumping their mid-range pcs
in anticipation of building a whole new gaming pc
once rtx 3000 is out so now back to that thing we call the roller coaster and
you're probably thinking bryan everything is upside down right now
and you wouldn't be mistaken and i think you guys in the us call it a jet coaster
that is right on the way down the bottom it doesn't get any worse right now than
it is in the pc gaming market but you're probably wondering what can
you do in this situation surely there's an answer well let's get
back to the tech yes studio and talk about the answer
[Music] and of course we had to make a little
pit stop on the way home where we've got 10 ace of fourth gen
uh systems five hard drives and five monitors we got that for 420 aussie
dollars in total absolute score but that relates back to
what we're going to talk about right now and that is the deals oh wow wow and now we've just landed
back at the studio and that deal is going to really relate
to what we're going to talk about next here and that is the actual current
climate of the market you're in so straight away if you were sitting on
a pc before the rtx announcement and now after the rtx
announcement you just got no interest in that gaming pc then you
may have to cut your losses and you're probably thinking well i've
slashed my prices already and that's the best thing you can do in order to
create more value on your build so it's the best reaction it's the natural
reaction i actually did this with one of my
builds just after rtx 3000 was announced and so it's a good strategy in order to
create more value and that is just slash the price of your build
and of course when you do that you are creating
a new market price for that particular pc whether it's got
a gtx 1060 or a gtx 1070 unit you're basically lowering the prices of
builds on the gaming pc so people who might be interested in
another gaming pc are naturally now going to focus their attention on your
gaming pc so with that it does become more of a buyer's market
however we've got to add into that other problem as we spoke about before
and that is a lot of people are dumping their pcs
on the market and a lot of these pcs i'm finding
are around the thousand aussie dollar range at this point in time so if you're
currently a seller in this market space of a thousand
aussie dollars to say 1500 you're suddenly going to find yourself
meeting so much more competition so now you're thinking well what do i do
and for me personally my current gut reaction
and this is where i'm going to say gut reaction because i haven't gone
through this kind of market before in relation to flipping gaming pcs
my gut reaction is to just simply slash prices at the moment
and clear what i've got and then move on in into a new market because what i'm
seeing is although the gaming pcs are going for
lower prices the whole used market itself
is going to become cheaper and that is what people are prepared to pay
from the actual suppliers or people like les for example
those prices are going to go down two in tandem with the new norm
on the gaming pc prices so basically as it stands
you've got rtx 3000 announcements bringing down prices
you've also got a heap of people dumping their gaming pcs
bringing down prices but there's another factor that's just been announced as
well when i saw this i literally like i really had to stop
and just open my eyes because it was a seriously
big announcement and that was the xbox series x at least in australia they
announced this thing for 750 aussie dollars
in the us 500 usd and i think in the uk it's got a really good price tag too
at these prices from what i gather you're getting a 3700x
processor you're getting a one terabyte nvme you're getting a new rdna gpu
that hasn't even been released yet with much more power than the 5700 xt
and you're also getting power supply motherboard 16 gigabytes of gddr6
so this thing is going to be very powerful when it comes to playing games
and if the pricing of this new series x and i believe they bring out the series
s2 which is less powerful but it's also a lot
cheaper if these specs and power is anything to go by in a new norm
of competition from microsoft you can best be assured that also
their games are going to be cheap too which from what i see they're using
their xbox game pass that's really going to be bringing a lot
of competition which is going to flow in naturally to use
gaming pc market as well as the new gaming pc market so
what i see with the new consoles is actually a
lot of strong competition to the point where i didn't think the xbox series x
would be priced this cheap so there are now so many factors that are
moving against the used gaming pc market to the point where
prices will come down from what i'm seeing
and so with that you do not want to be stuck on old stock
and if you are stuck on old stock and you have the fear of losing money
do not think of it as losing money just think of it as an expensive lesson
and you're probably sitting there thinking brian that's easy for you to
say but trust me i say this i've lost money
in the past and it's hurt but the only way to think of it and come
out of it in a positive way is to look at it of hey that lesson just
cost me x amount of money and i'm not going to make that same
mistake again in this case i really i haven't lost any money on my gaming pcs
i've had to just break even above one of them and that's because i've got that
low profit high turnover philosophy where i'm not
sitting on stock for too long anyhow going forward there
are going to be catalysts for and against
gaming pc prices one of those being rtx 3000 stock
this is going to be that dip that could come up very quickly
if these cards are out of stock and people want to play gaming pcs
as well as a possibility of covered flaring up again that could present some
milestones in the road but the last thing i'm going to touch on right now is
that for me personally i enjoy all this and the reason being is because for me
it ultimately is a hobby in that you see and in particular i'm going to pay
attention to the real dirty used bangers that come in here and i
pick them up for real cheap but they're filthy this for me is
a passion i absolutely love getting the real filthy pcs
cleaning them up and making something out of them generally a lot of the time
they don't have any rgb or anything like that
but i've noticed this big shift in the market especially with gaming pcs where
guys would just go out and they'll overpay
for parts then they'll get all these fancy rgb fans rgb case
and then try and sell these pcs and make their cut
and a lot of the times i mean if they're not enjoying it
ultimately if you're not enjoying it and now you're losing money or you're just
breaking even then you've got to say is this worth
your time so for me even if i break even on a lot of these
used builds even if i did i'm enjoying myself i'm
having a great time and a lot of times i'm filming it and coming into problems
diagnosing it and a lot of times you guys are chiming
in on the comments and we're just having a dandy
good old fun time around here so basically if you're slashing your prices
and you can't sell your pc and things are getting frustrating just
take a step back and say to yourself are you enjoying
this are you doing it for the right reasons
or are you just doing it purely to make a quick buck
and i think if you're doing it just for a quick buck then you're in the wrong
market but if you're doing it for both and that's the main thing then you
should be able to get through this bad time in this dip in the roller coaster
and you'll come out ahead in the future it's all about balance riding the ball
feeling the flow that's what it's all about just like this
question of the day here which comes from teemo yeah no
they ask i am just thinking how much 1660s and 1660 tis will be worth
are they the new rx 570s so this question in my opinion really depends on
what nvidia is going to bring out with say an rtx 3050 or if they're going
to bring out another gtx card that is in maybe in the 3000 line or
something like that they bring out a really good value card
on this lower level then that will definitely be a catalyst
for people to then sell their old 1660s and upgrade but
also another thing to think of with the new rx-570 is that the rx 570s
especially 1060s and 1070s in that crypto boom
they sold so many of those cards and they ramped up production to levels
that we'd never seen before with graphics cards
and then after that boom went bust all those cards just flooded the market so
there's so many of those cards out there even to this date so i don't think
naturally the 1660 super or the 1660 ti's
will be the new rx 570s but you'll definitely be able to pick up
these cards for cheap just the availability of these cards however on
the used market won't be anywhere near the 10 series
mid-range cards as well as those rx-5 70s and 470s
anyway hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and
you're enjoying that content and you enjoyed this video be sure to hit that
like button hit that sub button ring that bell and
also let us know in the comment section below
what is going on in the pc market where you are at the moment
love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and one more quick thing
before i get on out of here and that is you guys asking about founders edition
cards for rtx 3080 and 3090 down under in
australia i'm told i got an email from nvidia
today that for australians there will be one
retailer that's mwave they will be having a heap of founders
of cards available from the 17th
so make sure if you want to get one of these cards and you're down under and
you're serious about it go check out mwave and i recommend
getting on their mailing list because they're the only retail in
australia that i know they'll be getting some of these founders edition cards in
besides that i have been talking to a few retailers
in australia and they're telling me that people are coming into their stores and
they are just keep asking about rtx 3000
so and then to the likes where they've never seen
demand like this for a particular computer part
so if that's any indication to go by the demand will
definitely outpace the supply at least for the first couple of months so if you
are serious about getting one of these new
rtx cards especially the 3080 that looks like it's gonna be the hottest pick
out of the whole bunch then you will have to be quick anyway i'll catch you
guys very soon in another tech video peace out for now bye
