and here we are back at part two of august 2020's used pc part time of the month if you guys didn't watch part one already i'll put the link up here where we came into so many deals that i had to put this in the two-part series though starting off fresh into it with good old facebook marketplace here we've got potentially uh we've already got two deals that were scored we just got to go pick them up that is a 5500 xt for 230 aussie dollars this is the 8 gig version and when it comes to re-flipping pcs the vram is actually a pretty important factor so i like where this is coming in at and it's of course the newer 5500 xt which beats out the rx 580. then we've got a ryzen 5 2600 which is coming in at 185 is the offer we put down it's brand new so they've accepted that we're going to get that and it's around the same area which makes it a big plus and then we've got a gtx 1060 we put an offering of 200 well they're actually asking 200 they just got to get back to us so i think they've actually had this for a higher price but they've just decided to drop it to 200 flat which is a fair price for a 1066 gigabyte so we're gonna go with that and then we've got an r9 290 x which we've offered a hundred bucks down on so if we can score this that's actually a really good price for this caliber of gpu then there was an r9 390 which i've just asked about the vram because sometimes they have the eight gigabyte variants of these and if so we'll put down an offer so there's two deals already scored but there's three potentials up in the air but when we move over to good old game tree we've got a gtx 1070 where they've just put this up for 250 bucks and it's the katana version this is the single slot pcie slot version and i mean 250 for a gtx 1070 in this car and climate i put in pretty much asking price which i don't usually do but if the asking price is really good on its own and considering there's already like four other offers down on this card within 14 hours then i'm just going to offer asking price and they've got back to me already saying they'll accept it so we're gonna go pick that up i mean depending if the next up is a vega 56 which we put in an offer of 250 but then they got back to us and said that someone else already got it however they would have accepted that offer which is that does make me feel good at least i'm on the right track and then we've got next up at gtx 970 we put on an offer here of 110 and we're waiting for them to get back to us of course being a 970 they may have a hard time selling it and the last deal is an i3 4th gen system where they're asking 90 bucks i put down an offer of 75 but they also have a lot of other stuff to sell so hopefully we can break in with this deal and it might lead to a lot of other deals with that

coupon code in the description below easy let's get back to the video [Music] so we've just picked up the rx 5500 and you'll notice i'm at a different place right now and i'm actually at my sister's house because she lives like literally two minutes around the corner from where i picked this graphics card up from and i also right around the corner from this place too picked up the ryzen 5 2600 so it's just crazy coincidence that both these deals were right near my sister's joint now i'm just popping in for a quick feed then we're going to hit the highway again and on the way home i'm going to go and visit the dude who had the pcs for us yesterday and we're going to go check out what he's got because he reckons he's got a few more pcs and then on the way home there's also another deal that i've got to pick up too so this is going to kind of like be a couple of late night deals but the gtx 1070 guy i think that is a bit of a troll because uh apparently he's messaging other dudes as well saying like yeah come and pick it up come and pick it up and he's telling me come and pick it up as well so kind of a little bit fishy on that one um might want to just tread lightly if you see if it's generally if it's too good to be true right it always is that's the rule of thumb but other than that i did have it something came to me now this is mid parts hunt you guys said the audio from the phone wasn't half bad when i watched it back i was actually surprised too it wasn't half bad and the video was okay bit potato but voice always comes over video and this was the thing alright the vram thing it got me thinking how ingenious some of this stuff is these graphics card companies pull off right so this guy sold me the rx 5500 and he's like oh man like you know it's got eight gigabytes of vram i'm like yeah bro i know like that's basically as a pc flipper i'm buying it because it's got that eight gigabytes of vram but the rx 5500 is not a bad buy at 230 dollars but then i said to him what did you upgrade to he said oh 2080 ti i mean i made a joke to him about the vram but you went from 8 gigabytes of vram to 11 gigabytes of vram and he was like uh yeah and then i'm like well dude that's like 400 of the cost for only like 30 percent more vram but um didn't really click and didn't really register but and this got me thinking back to the upcoming rtx 3000 launch and how important vram sku marketing is for these companies right if we look at the 10 series that was like a perfect and i mean perfect separation of vram they had the 11 gigabytes on the 1080 ti 1080 1070 eight gigabytes go down to six and then three for the guy who wanted the competitive nvidia price performance at the time versus the amd card then they had the 1050 ti 4 gigabytes 10 32 gigabytes so that's like perfect spread of vram but then you look at the rtx 2000 series and the vram was in ways sort of less for the same money right you're getting the 2080 for the same money roughly as the 1080 ti but that was only eight gigabytes of vram so it got me thinking like okay maybe this is the real reason why nvidia had to do something with rtx like it got me a little bit thinking like because i i don't know why am i going down this train of thought but sometimes you've got to always bring it back to the most common denominator and the most basic of basics and then it got me thinking that may be a big reason for rtx i mean call it a little bit weird but you guys said you like story time so there's a bit of story time but then we've got rtx 3000 now we've got the ray tracing we're also going to have a big jump in the i guess the amount of vram these cards will have so it's going to be really interesting to see the actual amount of vram they are putting on these cards 100 because i guarantee you it's going to be bigger than rtx 2000 series but then you've got the rtx selling point over the gtx cards that had actually quite high vram sizes on them of course i have parched my thirst with some exquisite beverages but still that helps you relax the brain and get more thoughts out anyway let's go here to feed and then we'll get back on the road and see what deals we've got cracker lacking or pop a lopping depends whichever way you want it [Music] um [Music] so we're now at the finish line finally it's actually the next morning cause i got home last night it was so late i was so tired because i did an extra stop that i didn't intend to do but when i got to the guy's place that i originally intended to drop into in episode one he ended up having a lot more stuff than i had bargained for i was just like yep i'm going to drive home it's going to just be a quick easy pop in pick up a pc maybe you might have another pc but nope he had five pcs and we'll get onto them soon because he also had a heap of monitors so we had five 22 inch monitors and one 20 inch and he said what do you pay for these and i said well 20 inches usually 20 for 20 and then 22 inches i pay 35 to 40 depending on how many i'm getting in what condition and so he had six 22 inch monitors and i ended up getting five of them and i had to leave one behind it's a true story i had to leave one behind because i ran out of money in my wallet i had no cash left so i could not get these parts because i'd really wanted to get the towers now there's five of these things the cases are pretty good they've all got windows 10 pro licenses installed but there was a problem with a few of them like this is the weirdest thing because this situation i'm going to tell you guys you probably won't even believe it but this guy he had a hearing aid and so unfortunately he couldn't hear the coil whine and you don't even have to turn the pc on to notes the power supply i've heard this noise before and i just said to him dude i will have to replace the power supplies in these machines that have these bad power supplies and he's like oh man that'll be fine i can't hear it it's not a problem and i'm like oh this is kind of it's just a weird situation because you cannot sell a pc with that kind of coil one it is going to drive you nuts after a while it's not just the noise it's also the fact that the power supply is not in good running condition so he was like i can't hear it it's fine i'm like well man like because you know you just don't want to really haggle too much so like i just said to him look can you give me a little discount because i'm buying all five so we ended up going uh with 420 on these five i3 systems now i'm gonna have to replace the power supplies in a couple of them but the good thing is they do come with hard drives so some of them will come with uh one terabyte hard drives and 500 gigabyte hard drives and they've also got ram installed now the one reason i wanted to get all these i3 systems is because i've got because if you guys remember i did a video on the i5 and i had a heap of i5s lying around second and third gen so i can go through all these systems and replace them with second and third gen i5s because that's a big reason i'm looking for all these i3 systems at the moment because i got i5s to burn hold up i'm not gonna literally burn these cpus that's not what's gonna happen i'm going to basically get the cpus and put them in and keep going through them until i have them no longer hence the slang for burn so that in itself just ended up being i think a really good deal besides the high-pitched wine then after i picked up that whole deal he threw in a couple of keyboards which was awesome i always love you know free keyboards mice i clean all that stuff up make it make it perfection but then on the way home after that i got a message and this guy was right around the corner from this other guy and he's just like dude i i've got a heap of stuff here you want to come and check it all out and at this stage i'm just like sure let's just do it i've already got a car full again for the second time and the second day in a row let's just top it all off so we had um a 2200 g and 16 gigabytes of ram four hard drives uh he won 120 bucks for that combo i said sure let's do that uh then we had graphics cards he ended up uh doing us a r7 360 for 30 bucks a gtx 1060 for six gigabyte for 150 aussie and then rx 460 we ended up just clearing off this whole box of stuff for 350 bucks and he said to me like do you want this fx cpu and motherboard and ram for nothing with some sodim and i was like yeah i'll take it i'll take a look at it if it doesn't work it doesn't work if it works it works so he gave me this combo here with the water cooler so i'm going to check that out later that'll be on the have to test it pile because if this stuff is like if they don't know if it works and it's untested i'll get onto it when i've got a heap of all that stuff in a pile so i can just run through it quickly that's of course the can yes fix it episode then we got up here the rx 5500 that was a really cool deal as well as the ryzen 5 2600 and now telling all that up for you guys we ended up doing part two with a grand total of 1388 aussie dollars we had 615 on the monitors and all those bangers then 230 on that gravis card 185 on the ryzen 5 2600 then 350 on the magical box of parts which was broken down into a lot of little separate deals but then it came to 350 in total so pretty much at this stage i am not looking at any other deals so the guys on gumtree and facebook if they haven't replied yet i'm not even gonna like i'm just done two car fulls of stuff i i'm just the cooldown the used parts hunting swoop cape that is on cooldown at the moment that needs to recharge and i mean you guys hitting that like button and dropping all them funny comments that's the reason i guess i go so hard at this stuff plus i i love it too i mean what more fun is there than someone who's like this pc is done it's finished it cannot game anymore and then you pick that thing up you do a bit of magic tech yes love into that thing you get the monitor you put the wallpaper on there you get the rgb keyboard the mouse bang you're swooping in and then perhaps that person is looking to upgrade their pc they're looking for another gaming pc on the market but then they see the magic that you've done man i wish we could get some of those reactions on camera that'd be gold anyhow guys with that aside i am going to go edit this video out and then i might have a day and a half off a weekend off this is a foreign concept for me i am not you i'm not used to having time off but that's what's going to happen this weekend and actually i'm going to make a cool behind-the-scenes patron vlog i'm going to meet up with some of the guys who are actually my competitors but they're my friends and this is kind of like i like the community that we're making here in southeast queensland i just don't try to be like this gtx 1070 guy who is from what people are telling me he is trolling because there's a few guys that have put offers down on this gravis card and he's listed it for 250 then he's gone and re-listed it also let us know in the comments section below what was your favorite deal of both part one and part two which was the king in this two-part series and also let us know have you come into coil wine on a power supply before and if so what was your recourse of action love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from jackson c and they ask why would anyone ever put the thermal paste on their thumb then press their thumb to the chip wtf brian jackson sometimes in life you just gotta take a step back grab a beer relax and just see the meaning behind it and basically the meaning behind that was was that there was all these thermal paste arguments like you got to spread it you've got to do the p method if you don't do the p method there's going to be micro air bubbles that me just stamping it on the thumb is like who cares as long as there is thermal paste between the chip and the heatsink and its decent quality thermal paste mixed in with a bit of a finger grease then it's gonna do a great job on cooling but that's the thing it doesn't matter if you spread it with your thumb it like people actually people who have studied the subject say that your thumb automatically makes a barrier with the thermal paste so even if you spread it with your thumb it's actually fine there's no real contamination of the thermal paste to begin with so there it is it's just like a hey you know maybe in the process you might have had a laugh too laughing that might be a foreign concept too though i'm out of here if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell to get this juicy tech content the moment it drops and i'm also going to go hit the treadmill now go get a bit of vitamin d on my back because apparently vitamin d from the sun absorbs best through your back and your chest this is what i'm told i don't know but i'll catch you guys another tech video very soon peace out for now [Music] bye [Music] one thing i've been meaning to do for a couple of months now is a long-term viewer real long-term viewer neil he sent over some xeons motherboard and ram and i said thanks heaps and then he just said

thanks neil thanks for watching and also i appreciate each and every one of you guys every month here at tech yes city so thank you guys all for tuning in hope you enjoy that content and i'll catch in
