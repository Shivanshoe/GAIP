welcome back tech yes citizens we are on the road because restrictions have lifted a little bit what that means also some suppliers are getting back to work so this is a really good thing because one of our suppliers who's not gonna be named is a secret supply this is the guy that supplies Liz we're gonna go see him and we're gonna stock up us to use goodies cuz I got a time scheduled in but it's pretty early in the morning hence why can't really record the studio we're gonna record on the road so let's just get there and see what deals we can muster up if you're after a 10th gen Intel overclockers at CPU and the z4 90 Taichi has you covered with active cooling on its 14 phase V RM and also PCI Express 4.0 Wi-Fi 6 and a built-in saber 921 8 DAC this has it all links in description below to find out more so we got back from the place where I picked all this stuff up and we're gonna go through it all now but straight away the person that I'm in contact with basically doesn't want to be named and they don't like dealing with the public and there's a few reasons for that the main reason being is they just like to offload whatever stuff they have on hand at the time and they don't want any questions they don't want people picking and choosing pots they just like look I've got all this stuff do you want to come and get it and I'm like yeah definitely so I was so hungry for even a pickup like this now this was everything in total was $400,000 so we'll start off over at the desk here where we've got to Z 370 more tile motherboards these are untested looks like I'll have to bend a couple of pins back but this one was the favorite because this was an X 79 board and it had two bent pin and I bent them back and the board works perfectly and I've tested it out updated the BIOS it's got a 16 atv2 that works with it so we've now got a new board for the 1680 v2 plus this right here this is what got thrown in with the mix was a 32 gigabyte kit of Ripjaws but this stuff here is very special for a one particular reason and that is that it's a quad kit and it's 21 33 megahertz cl9 so if you guys are looking for a comparison against the latest and greatest and what x79 has to offer this combo here is going to do it I can't wait to build a PC up with this because he's going to be so off the chain with tech yes loving applied now there's also an 8 gigabyte stick of course at Dominator platinum there was 2 1 terabyte hard drives so that was just there and then we're going over to these rigs here first of all this one is probably the filthiest it's an i5 4460 and with 4 gigabytes of RAM no drives a power spike case the case is ok once I clean all this up the case I'll keep this and maybe use it for like an office PC this one here is x58 for the win 3 so the motherboard alone in this is a good pickup these are very sought-after motherboards on the used market it's at least got an i7 in it because it's x58 this one here is the same deal another x58 board but this one included a 1000 watt HX powers play 16 gigabytes of RAM and of course we're that i7 but the case here I'm so devastated about this because this case is all in tatters it's all in pieces and is one of my favorite old-school cases I did a building this it's a Lindley I actually forgot the name of it but I've only ever had one of these come through in the past and when I sold it I was like damn actually that was a really cool build but I'll definitely keep the bare-bones on this one and do something funky with it still as opposed to this case right here maybe this one this especially this one is no drive bays the front panels off it just looks filthy so this one I'm guessing is an old fractal design case just by the looks of those the white and black scheme I know they used to do that back in the day but this one here has a i 5 2500 ka gigabytes of RAM and then right below that we've got another x58 so this 3 X 58 bundles here this adds 6 gigabytes of RAM in an i7 920 and then I got a 1,000 watt power player that was trucked in two and I double-checked that with the power supply meter and that is working absolutely fine so a lot of this stuff even though it's untested the guy get it off he I think he does at least boot it up and check it so your chances of it working properly are actually a lot higher than someone just not even testing it at all so this is that really good potato score that I needed in these times where I'm running low on stock and this is just like a savior for me but that aside we're still gonna find some graphics cards so let's go check out what we can maybe tee up for Demark it's a little bit late now but we'll put in some offers put in some feelers and see who gets back to us because we'll probably have to make a trip to get some graphics cards and maybe even order some things like power supplies and cases because we gotta restock but another reason why it went from day to night time is this right here this was a trade-in I got they traded it in they wanted around 400 Aussie dollars for it so I said sure thing it was a 2200 G 1050 GI a gigabytes of RAM and the thing is it came with a decent power supplied the motherboard looks ok and this was the bog and right here it had a 480 gigabyte nvme drive in it and I was like wow that's actually really good and then the case you've got for RGB fans I mean it is filthy you've got to clean it up it needs definitely need some tech yes loving but what I got to do with this is put in another 8 gigabytes of RAM put it in a risin 5 2600 extra 1 terabyte hard drive switch that SSD over for 120 gigabyte and they may put in something like a 1070 and then you get yourself a extremely capable gaming PC [Music] [Music] so it's now the morning and we are fresh we're ready to go good old game tree and Facebook marketplace to find some deals but before we did that we decided to I just pretty much pulled all the components out of those cases and I'm only gonna be keeping one of the cases and that's the office PC looking one because all the other cases is too far gone but on that note we've pulled off things like feet spare feet will come in handy if I find another land lead case they're gonna use these feet so I've got a spare feet for if potentially something comes up in the future I've also got a heap of screws that's one thing if you want an unlimited supply of screws then definitely buy some old use PC parts because you'll be pulling off so many screws that you won't need to worry about ever running out of screws again but nothing to is the last PC we pulled out here the x58 Zeus combo we not only got heap of fans which I love is that I have to buy fans too that we got an r9 270x and I was surprised usually the other pcs this was coming with was like a GTS 450 like absolutely garbage and on the note of the GTS 450 with that particular model in mind to me the cooler on that GPU is worth more than the actual GPU itself so I can maybe use that in the future if a fan fails on saying r9 270 something like this so I'll surprised I pulled out this r9 270x and I tested it it works absolutely fine temperatures are good but of course we'll give it some tackiest loving before we put it in the gaming PC but without aside we've got all these builds now sort of ready to go they're all pieced out for future builds I just got to give them all that special tech yes loving be seen total here when you just mix and match and you collect parts you've always got something for the occasion so straight away starting off with Facebook marketplace we found two monitors up for sale where they agreed that I could go and pick them up and even though they're just 19 inch monitors I am running so dry for monitors right now so I'll find anything I can and if it's a decent price I'll pick it up so hopefully that's looking like we can pick those up pretty soon but another thing is - on Facebook market plays I didn't find any graphics cards or anything decent for a decent price that our eyes didn't already find on gumtree - so we're gonna move over to the gum tree deals quickly and see what we've got potentially so go through gum tree top to bottom we have our first offer GTX 970 which I offered 150 Aussie dollars for and they've accepted so it's an MSI gaming X so it's a pretty good model within the 970 series itself now usually I don't pay this much for a 970 I don't recommend people pay this much either but again because of what's going on right now prices have gone up and it's just a different market altogether where yeah that's just how it goes the next potential deal we've got up here is the 7850 and I offered them 50 cash for it they came back with 60 I just said 50 is pretty fair I mean it is a 78 50 and of course if we get this for 50 bucks it'll be a decent deals and then next up we've got a 79 50 16 gigabytes of RAM and some other stuff all in this deal without asking for two hundred and fifteen dollars which I thought was a bit too much so I offered a hundred and twenty bucks because it looks like it's been sitting there they accepted they just said here's my number give me a call and come pick it up so we've got another deal we're gonna go get a little bit later then there was two 19-inch monitors they wanted 35 bucks for the pair I just said sure I will take that even though they look like they're a little bit outdated as long as they work okay then I'll be happy with that then another deal that sort of just fizzled out was to rx4 60s and initially they said 120 bucks I was asking is that for the both of them they said no that's for a single that would do us 200 for both and rx4 sixties of you guys don't know they're a lot different to an Rx for 70 it's almost like half the power pretty much so getting two of these with two I'd rather just go to I'll Express and even just wait for the GPUs to rock up where they're about a hundred of pop as well so that's a bit too much for a nice fall season so we're gonna let that one sit and then we've got a guy who was selling her he put different monitors but they never got back to us I just said look could you do us a discount if I bought all the monitors you have to sale never heard from him though but we'll keep you guys updated then there was a 660ti 480 I offered 60 they accepted so I'm just trying to get an address out of him right now then there was a gtx 770 off at 80 bucks they didn't haven't replied then lastly those are GTX 670 I offered safety bucks they haven't replied to so we just gotta wait for a few people to hopefully get back to us but on that note we've also got some deals and someone else messages on Facebook and said look I got 90 X 20 64 440 do you want it and I said sure I can use an RT x 2060 right now so I took up that deal to the yes-mo be brought to your area anyway [Music] that'll be about money [Music] okay go dude also yeah did you have any of those understand that is the 2016 not super does have an i-5 and it will it will after this deal right here we've got I five thirty four seventy and we got sixteen gigabytes of RAM and that's not now we just doing a little bit of a hey hey you Jen we go get his next location and then we've got a 7950 down there as well so that is 39:56 EQ bedroom 537 the best [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we just finished up at lasers place and the person with the GTX 970 ended up being like two minutes from lasers too so he went and quickly got the parts off layers in that GTX 970 and they showed me a video of it working so I was happy with that even though the 1:50 price tag yeah it's one of those things that happens but another thing too is let's had a heap of 19-inch monitors and we got them at 15 a pop so I picked up as many as I could he chucked in three free stands which is amazing cuz I've got these three other monitors at my place now that could use the silicon method to makes and monitors happen and we've got a heap of keyboards that he chucked into and these three pcs will get back to the studio and talk about them a little bit that one of them was a first gen server with 20 gigabytes of RAM a hard drive and a dual-core but we can switch that out to 1 X 56 50 make it a 6 quart 12 thread system pretty easy and then there was also a x4 Athlon 2 and he wanted 70 bucks for the whole system I said sure I'll take that and then lastly there was this I 5/4 gen with a r7 graphics card I don't know which r7 it's got so I took a gamble but we got that for 150 in total so let's get back and check these pcs out a little more in depth [Music] and now we are finally back at the tech yeah studio and we've got the 970 here that is sort of getting excluded saying with the RT X 2060 they're not potatoes in any way shape or form but we got ourselves an old school 7950 and 16 gigabytes of RAM and an i5 in it bro 3470 and this is this Athlon system right here so the four core wait now this is the fourth gen Haswell system we paid 150 with the r7 graphics card so this one beside it actually is more interesting to me this is a dual core Xeon but we're gonna change that over and we have 20 gigabytes of RAM Dell Precision to 3500 so I think with first gen the one thing you don't have to worry about as opposed to second and third gen especially on a lot of OEM systems is that it won't work with newer grabs cards I found every first gen rig I've booted up except for now actually yeah pretty much every first Chambord I booted up has worked with old and new graphics cards so that is one thing I'm hoping doesn't buck the trend with this 3500 but then we've got over here the median PC this one actually was pretty cool cuz the front lit up all blue so I was actually don't know what happened there there's some sort of something's just a little bit off with the front panel but this here has a just an FX full core in it so it'll be good for an entry level gaming PC like real sort of low-end and then the last thing we've got is 9 19 and 20-inch an assortment of monitors and I gotta say that the ones we got off flares they have these gloss screens and I personally especially when it comes to gaming in a dark room and whatnot the gloss screens are really good the colors just come through and they pop on these even though the 19 inch they do a great job of coupling in as we said before in previous videos with budget pcs because you also then get to run it at a long resolution which is easier on the budget graphics cards so I ended up in total getting some really good deals this month for potato hunter but one thing you may notice is that things are slowly now getting back to normal I think last month spot hum put the link to that up here we hit rock bottom it was just like so dry there was so many people that are hungry for pots but it seems like things are starting to flow now they're starting to free up a little bit and hopefully with that being said graphics cards do start to flow up as well because that is the biggest problem I'm having at the moment or at least I'm talking to people as well everyone's looking for graphics cards and they're getting hard to get even on the new market and on the use markets so that one's a little bit scary I've heard power supplies are starting to be sold out well actually not even heard I went on a few different retailer sites to checked out power supply prices and they're pretty much getting sold out all the power supplies up to like $100 I'm pretty much getting sold out very quickly so those two things seem like they're the hottest property right now in terms of what's in the new market getting sold out and what's going up in price and then the third thing would be cases I'm a little bit worried about those but apparently motherboards CPUs SSD and also ddr4 memory is not a problem so you have to worry too much about that if you're looking to build a new machine also hope that in video announces the 3000 series soon and maybe AMD starts announcing the rDNA 2 so we can at least get some new breath of fresh air into this current GPU situation and with all that out of the way do let us know in the comments section below what was your favorite deal in this episode of potato hunter it's definitely looking like this is the path I have to go down during these weird times and who knows when this will be alleviated but I do look forward to once things start getting back to normal continuing on with the series where I've turned a hundred dollars already into 520 bucks and then we're gonna continue that to see what kind of high end gaming PC we can come up with for you guys though before I get on out of here we also got the question of the day which comes from Chris vise Sarah and they asked kind of want to ask can't games be optimized for both high and low core counts because I think there are some games that run well still on really low end hardware that use like 16 threads basically when it comes to PC games is really only one answer and that is games are either poorly optimized or there really well optimized I think someone replied with the example of doom and doom is a perfect example of a game that's really well optimized I'd say one of the best if not the best optimized game on PC for instance we've got games that are poorly optimized take for instance assassin's creed that whole series is pretty much poorly optimized for CPUs so when you've got good optimized games they'll run on a number of different thread configurations where there'd be four core eight thread four core four thread or all the way up to 32 threads in some titles but on the other side of the fence we can have a game for instance another example would be Far Cry 5 that's very single thread dependent ie that is it's poorly optimized and if you've got a full core 4 thread of CPU it's got really high clock speeds it'll probably run the game better than say even like a a core 16 thread that has lower clock speeds anyhow I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you enjoyed this one - be sure to hit that like button for us and also if you're enjoying the content and you want to see at the moment of drops and just hit that sub button ring that Bell and I'll catch you in the next one peace out for now but [Music]
