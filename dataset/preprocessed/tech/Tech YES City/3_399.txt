right here on the table we have the nock shouid d14 this cooler is over 10 years old and the funny thing was as i pulled it out of a build that cost me fifty Aussie dollars and this cooler was so dirty in fact that I couldn't clean it with my usual tech yest lovin methods in fact I had to leave this in a bucket overnight in hot water with detergent and let all that dirt loosen up so I could then take it out which was a suggestion from you guys in the video where I pulled this cooler out initially which I'll put the link to up here though the good thing about this cooler was it had two working fans and on top of that it came in at virtually nothing since the other components in the build were worth more at least to me free flippin gaming PC's then this was so basically this used d14 coming in with a really cheap price tag is it going to perform say against the d15 even deep cools latest and greatest and a 280 millimeter Corsair liquid cooler on a 9900 kay well there's only one way to find out and that's to put this to the test even using its two old fans because we know for a fact that knocks your gear ages extremely well but I want to see in this video just how well it does indeed age but of course before we do that we are going to give this just a bit of multipurpose spray and make it look as brand-new as possible before we put it on that test bench [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and we've just finished mounting this d14 on a z3 90 motherboard and the 9900 KS and everything works absolutely fine the only little problem I came into was the inside memory stick since it is high profile memory this is the Dominator ddr4 Platinum stuff the inside stick is bending a little bit to the right so if you were going to go with an old D 14 on and you were build I'd probably recommend just getting some low profile memory since the memory slots on some motherboards may even be closer to the CPU but all that aside everything went smooth the mounting was fine the two fans that are included with this kit are actually only three pin but you can probably hear in the background noise they're making literally like virtually no noise at all they're really not noisy and it's finally time I guess to test out the performance of this whole setup [Music] and after stress testing this thing it was really surprising the results actually shocked me this cooler right here it's been made over ten years ago and it's so legacy that it still doesn't include those pwm fan coolers in fact this cooler is still sold on amazon for $80 but i believe they have updated the fans to the PWM versions there may be some other updates in there but I'm not exactly sure of the differences though one thing I'm sure of is the performance of how good this D 14 is still in 2020 and when I compare it to some of the other coolers I've put on this test bench it's beat them out like the ma 620 P that's a really good air cooler and that failed the 99 hundred KS stress test when I did them in the past and also course says liquid H 110 I pro the D 14 not only beat that out by one degree and I know it's only one degree but it's still a victory and it also beat it out in noise so these two fans here even though they're two 3-pin fans and they're running at full speed they're still only putting out roughly 41 to 42 decibels of noise which is a lot lower than other fans at their max speeds so not true it really even back in 2009 they had it going on in terms of not just build quality where we could see that this cooler here has lasted all that time I've cleaned it up and it's still working fine but also their fans that they've used are indeed really good quality so what I'm seeing is they're offering like a six year warranty on their D 14 they're selling now but from what I'm seeing in front of me here these coolers will last a lot longer than that six year period so kudos to Knox were for really getting things right in terms of performance build quality and even in this case the mounting support where it fits a ninety nine hundred K 10 years later so breaking things down this D 14 right here did phenomenally well now you may be thinking well it lost out to the D 15 it lost out even to the deep cools latest and greatest and the H 115 I RGB platinum now those three coolers they cost more than this cooler right here and there considerably newer so you would expect improvements to be had over time but one thing for certain is the 9900 K and also the 900 KS when they're at 5 gigahertz they're pretty much putting out the same temperatures these CPUs put out a lot of concentrated heat so you will need a really high-end cooler to keep this thing under wraps especially my ambient temperatures here which go from 27 to 28 degrees usually any time of the day and so I do keep the temperatures roughly at the same levels to give you guys apples to apples comparisons so what we saw here is if you guys see an old knock shoe or cooler you can pretty much be rest assured that that thing is going to work absolutely fine going into the future now actually I can't say the same about some of the other coolers I've come into in the past I'm not going to name any brand names but I've come into some old coolers in the past that have been rusted up way too much the fans have been ratalie whiny or simply flat-out don't work and I've just pretty much put them aside because I can't fix them this cooler here however does have a good long life left in it and it's already been running for a really long time and now when we look at the new graphs - when we look at the ma 620 P you may think oh well that cool have failed the tests but I've been using for instance the ma 620 P in my old x58 overclocking Z on comparisons that's a really good cooler in its own right that'll take a x50 675 for example up to four point five gigahertz in my ambient temperatures and so that already isn't a grade of its own that's better than most air coolest so the fact that this D 14 is still kicking it in 2020 and it's beating out the likes of an ma 620 P for example is really good news for you guys if you like use price performance and you can get some of these coolers for really cheap I'm all about that use price performance especially now going into the world conditions that we're going into you're gonna see a lot more bug and hunting here on the channel because it's one thing that I love doing but it's another thing as well when the new prices start going up on everything and then you've got to readjust and say hey what else can I do that I'm not doing in the used market anyway guys if you enjoyed today's video then you know what to do hit that like button for us also let us know in the comment section below what's your experience with old used coolers do you reuse them or in my case I actually really shy away from old liquid coolers that's one thing to be very careful of even though we're using a old NOx with d14 here be very careful if you're using old-school liquid all-in-ones which a lot of those coolers had a lot of problems with their pumps and they just gave out after a couple of years this cooler here you can visibly see when the fans aren't working properly or you can either hear it and so you can replace those parts easily and get back up and running though love reading those thoughts and opinions and speaking of thoughts and opinions we got the question of the day which comes from Peter G and they asked three minutes and 40 seconds did he use underwear too as a cloth so basically he's talking about this video I'll put the link up here where you know quite a few of my videos in the past I have used old underwear to clean PC paws down of course the underwear has been through the washing machine it is all clean there's no problems with it but that underwear has seen its life it's got a lot of used wear and tear on it's got holes in it so I can no longer wear it personally but I can reuse it and what better way than to use it with some tech yes loving and you guys that's about it for today if you've made it this far and you're enjoying the content you want to see at the moment of drops then you know what to do and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
