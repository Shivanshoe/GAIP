three hundred and sixty millimeter water
coolers these are touted as the flagship all-in-one coolers out there
, but me personally I prefer the 280 millimeter coolers and when I tested
this H115i RGB platinum I fell in love with this so much that I went and bought
another two for my AMD and Intel test systems and so I've now got three of
these in the studio where I like them over the 360 mil units quite a bit and
that's mainly because the 140 mm fans versus the 120s I feel like they've got
a better ratio there with the airflow versus the noise and that they pump more
air through and they do it so at a lower noise price you've only got two fans
running versus three and naturally three fans is going to produce more noise than
two and also on top of that I found the temperature differential between the 360
and the 280 wasn't much at all so straight up there's my thoughts on 360
versus 280 I currently up until this point in time
prefer the 280 before going into these tests but what we got here is course as
new h 150 i RGB Pro X T now they're using 3 120 millimeter ml fans but they
don't carry RGB on the fans themselves whereas the H 115 i RGB platinum for
instance has both RGB on the block and the fence this does have RGB on the
block and you can customize that with the IQ software though the most
important thing is is this cooler with a 10 900k both out of the box and
overclocked going to beat the h 115 I Audrey platinum the only way to find out
is to of course run those tests but I'm also gonna be including the Snowman
which you guys request every time I test coolers you guys ask in the comments
where's the snowman so we're putting in the dual fan snowman here a $20.00
cooler not so practical with a $1,000 setup on the 10 900 caner expensive z4
90 motherboard but we're also gonna be throwing in deep cools flagship as well
which is one of the best air coolers you can get out there on the market though
with that aside let the show begin [Music] and here we are with all the testing
done and this one came with a big twist and a big surprise and that is first of
all this snowman this $20 cooler from Aliexpress it handled the 10 900k and it
did so with decent temperatures 89 degrees this is the dual fan solution
and the noise on this thing was very well controlled as you guys probably
heard before be probably wondering why is the deep cool solution not doing as
well and that's got to do with my motherboard test setup it just simply
had a big chunky heatsink on the v RM I mean most z4 90 motherboards are going
to have big heat sinks on their V RMS so this is a problem with these massive air
coolers sometimes you just won't get them to fit properly and that's what I
believe was happening with this cooler I did test it out in two different
configurations two different ways it wouldn't mount the standard way where
you've got a horizontal and s flowing out the back of your case it could only
mount vertical but on an open air test bed it wasn't going to make that much of
a difference but it was still at the very end of it it was still lift up a
little bit and that was causing the temperatures to lose to that of even a
snowman and so that's the limitation of these big air coolers you sometimes just
can't get around that so do be careful of that and that's what I said in my
initial review of this big air cooler here so basically coming into it before
we even talked about the water coolers the Snowman gets the a okay basically
across all setups for being a value for money champion but going over now to the
water coolers this is where if you want to get that 5.2 giga that's overclock
you want to get those lower temperatures lower noise and you want the bling that
this thing's going to offer then this is where the H 115 I RGB platinum beat out
the H 150 i RGB Pro XT and it did it with a specially out of the box standard
thermal solution and noise it did so great there and then when we max the fan
speeds on the 5.2 Giga its overclocked it matched the temperature levels but it
did so with low and noise and this is where it comes down to bigger isn't
always better in this case the two 140 mm fans are doing a great job now
perhaps if we tried to go up to 350 Watts through these coolers the 360 mil
might start edging it out but as it stands the 280 milk Euler is cheaper
it's got more RGB on the included fans and it does a better job with noise and
temps for most people at least I don't imagine too many people taking a 10 900
K over 5.2 gigahertz for a daily driver though as for the air coolers they just
simply couldn't handle this 5.2 Giga it's overclocked and when I tried to do
that I was met with a blue screen on both ends so this brings out a pretty
clear-cut recommendation and that is the IQ h 150 IRB pro xt it's a decent cooler
it's a pretty good cooler it's gonna do everything you want to but the fact that
the h 115 i RGB platinum exists and i've already tested it and I've run it
extensively here the channel it's a better buy it's not only cheaper as we
just said before it also does everything else better and that's what my testing
here has led to that conclusion so in terms of the 360 mil rad if you want to
go out and get that and you want it for the bigger look and it's gonna maybe
match the front of your case perfectly if it supports a 360 mil rad then that's
cool that's an aesthetic thing but when it comes to actual better coolers in my
opinion this one gets the win over the H 150 i RGB Pro X T and what it comes down
to it all that's about it in terms of both these coolers verse one another
though I will say one thing the difference between the H 150 I Pro XT I
do like the block how they've used the black aesthetic on the ring on the outer
ring I think it looks better than the standard silver here that they've used
and so I would like to see them possibly update the Platinum version to have this
cool sleek black ring around the outer edge that does look really cool and I do
prefer that in terms of aesthetics but everything else I do prefer on the H 159
to be platinum though with that aside there's not really a whole lot more to
say if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button for
us let us know in the description below have you tried the Snowman yet have you
tried the H 115 i RGB platinum what are your thoughts on air cooling water
cooling I loved reading every single one of your comment
in that comment session there with that aside we got the question of the day
here which comes from a rocket Taurus and they asked please help me miss the
tech yes City I bought this cpu intel xeon
12:31 v3 but when I enable hyper threading in BIOS it only gives me two
cores four threads why is that my old CPU was i5 4440 I have updated my boss
to version 3 602 did I miss something from your videos so basically if you've
done that upgrade with the CPU you may wish to reset your bias completely and
you should see in the boss itself I should say the core counting thread
count and if it's telling you four cores eight threads then the problem exists in
your operating system where beforehand you may have done something to manually
limit the threads to four so you're gonna have to change that or maybe
possibly if you can't find that setting or change it back then I'll put a link
in the description below for you we can do that if nothing else works after that
then you might want to try just a new fresh install of Windows and that will
fix it for you hopefully that answers that question and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that
content then make sure to hit that subscribe button ring that bell and I'll
see you next time peace out for now bye [Music]
