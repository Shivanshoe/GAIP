today here at Tech yes City I'm going to
be reviewing the 3900 XT and also the 3800 XT for you guys and straight away
out of the bat AMD even in their own official notes are
saying that these CPUs haven't optimized seven nanometers versus the previous X
counterparts but another important factor here is at the 3800 and the 3900
xt chips don't include a race prism cooler which you usually get on the X
counterparts another thing too is that the 3600 XT does carry the Wraiths fire
cooler and so they're coming in at these same MSRP pricing as the original X
chips but what is different with these chips inherently what I've seen here is
the AMD and their notes they're saying around 200 megahertz higher and I found
this very true for the 3800 XT but not so much for the 3900 XT and now for
advertised speeds we've got here 3.8 gigahertz all core on the 3900 XT and
4.7 gigahertz single called boost and then on the 3800 XT we get 3.9 all core
4.7 single core then on these 3600 XT you get three point eight and four point
five now in terms of the architecture itself nothing has inherently changed
with the CC X clusters in CCD module basically with rising 3000 you've got
four cores per CC X cluster and then eight cores per CCD module maximum and
then 16 cores for a maximum on the m4 platform with the 39 50x and with that
we see nothing changes on the 3,800 XT having 2 CC x modules on a single CCD
giving you 8 core 16 threads and then move over to the 3900 XT we've got that
split across 4 CC x clusters over to C CDs for a total of 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 which
gives you 12 cores 24 threads now the CC x latency is pretty consistent across
the CPUs here with these 3300 X being the outlier on Rison 3000 chips since
that is a single CC X design there is no inter CC x latency on this particular
CPU which does make it the king of some situations in games on the AMD am 4
platform if you want to check out my overclocking video on that I'll put the
link up here though going back to the 38 and 39 hundred x t chips I'm going to be
comparing it against the current popular three thousands and
chips out there and telling you guys why I think the 3,800 XT may be worth a
purchase but perhaps not so much for the 3900 XT let's roll that intro and then
talk about the benchmarks [Music]
so getting straight into the benchmarks I'm only going to show the overclocked
numbers for the X versus the XT counterparts just to reduce the clutter
and basically this is going to pertain directly to the recommendation here and
so we're saying with 7-zip that we do squeeze out a bit more performance on
both these XT ships and when we overclock the 3800 XT it went up to a
whopping 4.6 gigahertz which to say the least is the highest overclock I have
seen here for a risin 3,000 chip at the studio even compared to that of the
3,300 X which went up to four point five seven five gigahertz this was 4.6
gigahertz stable I couldn't get any more out of it but it was still good to hit
that all core score the memory at a centre bench we can see here that the
3,800 xt follows in tandem with its overclocked differential versus the x
counterpart that the 3900 xt does get an extra hundred and twenty-five megahertz
so not as much as the 3800 xt gained over the X there and even though that I
could boot in at four point five five gigahertz it just presented the problem
of it would only max out four point four seven five gigahertz and this was the
most I could get out of it so the overclocks
basically when we look at it on the twelve core versus the eight core the a
core that we've got in here is overclocking very well and it's
overclocking better than the twelve core in comparison even though the out of the
box scores show a bigger difference on the 12 core the movie through Geekbench
5.1 we can see here that the 3900 xt and also the 3800 xt has some very
impressive single core boosts out of the box I was actually very impressed with
the 3,800 XT going up to around four point seven five gigahertz single core
and I did indeed validate this with Cinebench are twenty run around a single
core boost in that it seemed to fluctuate between four point six and
four point seven five on both the 3900 XT and 3,800 XT so they're pretty much
programmed with that same boost that you see but it's good to see that you're at
least getting that advertised four point seven gigahertz on the box coming out in
real effect where as opposed to the 3900 X when I initially reviewed that it
wasn't really going near that box score but
like a lot of updates later it is getting a bit more performance but it's
still not performing as good as the XT counterparts but I may be out of v-ray
we've got the multi-core scores here moving in sync with the previous three
benchmarks we showed here and then continued out of w prime two point one
we can see here that the multi thread overclock is winning out both on the 32
m and 102 for M scores which means that when we moving on with the gaming
benchmarks I will say that I do prefer manually overclocking these XT chips as
opposed to originally with a 3900 X and the 3700 X that I had for review and
then later I got a 3,800 X I just prefer putting them on out of the box settings
where they ran really well but I feel like there's a bit more to be gained out
of manually overclocking and we'll start with warzone here because this is
important to see that when you've got the precision boost out of the box or
just default settings when I put it into my motherboard boot it up and lock in 30
600 megahertz XMP profiles which is what we used here today CL 16 we can see that
the multi-core boost sort of doesn't know which level it wants to sit at on
the 3900 XT it's going between four point two five four point three
gigahertz and then on the 3,800 XT it's sort of bouncing between four point four
and four point five gigahertz needless to say it did score some impressive
numbers in warzone on both the 3,800 XT and 3900 X C there's virtually no
difference between overclocking and leaving it out of the box on this
particular game though it is important to note that 3,800 XT did beat that of
the 3900 XT mainly due to it having a higher or Core boost to begin with the
movement of fortnight we saw these CPUs trade blows but it's something that I'm
noticing is when you manually overclock the CPUs they do fare quite a bit better
than they would with a out-of-the-box precision boost
so perhaps precision boost can't read the game too well in this particular
manner and so manually over clogging and leaving a cause at a consistent speed
gives you consistently better fps and then the last title we've got up here
shadow of the Tomb Raider with SMA a turned on and the overclock on the 3,800
XT did score a big victory out of the 3100 XTS precision boost
the box the 3900 XT virtually scored the same with the overclock getting a slight
one FPS advantage but nothing to write home about
so summarizing those results and now giving you guys a recommendation I think
that the 3,800 XT is definitely worth consideration with it's very aggressive
precision boost overdrive which I will point out quickly the TDP figures where
we went up to a hundred and forty watts out of the box
AMD did stay in the reviewers guide they would prefer us to turn off the
precision boost but one thing I know is is that if motherboard manufacturers a
Zeus MSI gigabyte asrock if they're all selling these boards with that stuff
turned on by default and it works really well and I think it does work really
well then I'm gonna test it as such and so I saw the 3800 XT boosting system
really healthy levels out of the box healthier than that of a 3,800 X and
then beating that of the 3700 X so it was a really nice CPU for someone who
wants to go with AMD and get the best FPS possible in games keep in mind the
3300 X in certain situations may be slightly better but for what it's worth
I think this with its eight cores 16 threads we don't mind spending an extra
$100 or so over the 3700 X but also are bringing their own cooler to the table
and they don't mind losing out on the wraith prism so overall the value really
isn't there but you are getting that top-notch performance in games with the
3800 xt so I think if you want to go with enthusiasts overclocks for games
and even stream where you're using the GPU encoder then this CPU is going to
deliver just keep in mind it's not gonna be the best value for money that AMD is
offering the last up here we got the 3900 XT and I feel like this is not as
appealing as the 3800 XT and in fact I would recommend going buying a 3900 X
over a 3900 x10 the reason being was I didn't see as big as a performance
differential as I did on the 3800 XT but another big factor is the current
pricing of the 3900 X in Australia you can get this thing for 750 Aussie
dollars with the Wraith prism included and you can get it in a mirror
for around 420 USD which makes it hard to beat I'd imagine the 3900 xt is gonna
come out close to MSRP and not include that race prism and of course you're
only getting a bit more performance as opposed to 3,800 XT you'll be saving a
hundred bucks and getting better fps in most games so I feel like if you're
going with the twelve core 24 threat option you're doing so with value and
productivity in mind as opposed to the eight core where you're doing it with
more so the gaming focus in mind so the 3900 xt really wins out with that value
proposition and I mean lastly with that said the 3700 X is coming in at
currently 270 u.s. in a straight you can pick it up for low $500 e dollars making
that an exceptional value for money proposition so ultimately if you care
about value for money these two are not going to be it but I do feel like the
3,800 XT warrants itself as a good placeholder for someone who wants the
best overclocks on the AMD side and with that of course the best FPS from what
AMD has to offer though with all that out of the way do let us know in the
comments section below what you think of the results of these
two CPUs in today's review would you be interested in getting one or the other
or none of them love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just
like this question of the day here which comes from AD Nast and they asked take a
city you say prices are going to come down what sort of timeframe do you
foresee as I want to build a system that prices still seem very high question
mark where is the best place to buy new parts from online or if you know
anywhere in Adelaide to go to so to answer that question this is coming from
someone who's in Australia in Australia the best place to buy PC parts is
usually online there's a few good retailers like computer Alliance you
might pc k's gear m sy and em wav and they really give out some really good
deals there's also ebay with the 20% off sales in australia they offer some
phenomenal value for money so basically when i make these
predictions they're usually around three to six months that's when I feel the
prices will really come down and with that aside if you guys enjoyed this one
be sure to hit that like button also if you want to see more of the con
the moment it drops here be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and share
the video around if you liked it share it to your friends if they're thinking
about getting on AMD and they're getting the best FPS for their money and I'll
catch you guys in a nother tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
