we've got here a comparison between the rx 6800 the rtx 3070 and the rtx 3060 ti however before we get into today's video i understand you guys in the comments a lot of you guys are saying look brian these cards are sold out we can't get our hands on them but you guys as reviewers you're getting these cards you're flashing them around on youtube and we really want to get our hands on one so what i'm going to be doing is i'm going to be part of the solution i'm going to be giving away this rx 6800 to one of you guys in the audience and all you have to do to enter is drop a comment hit that like button and be subscribed and so how i'm going to draw it is on twitter where i'm going to select a random winner via a random number generator on the comments so which order you are in your comments you'll get a chance to enter however do not duplicate the comments because that will disqualify you the gaming benchmarks let's put up the graphs for you guys roll the numbers and the music and then we'll get back to this card right here [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so the rx 6800 is doing a really good job of performing in between an rtx 3070 at 500 and it's 6800 xt big brother at 650 though this card right here does carry 16 gigabytes of vram pretty much making it the cheapest 16 gigabytes of vram card out on the market at the moment however if you're thinking about buying one of these in a 6800 xt the 6800 xt does carry a bigger cooler weighing in roughly 120 grams more and also has a bigger depth but it does carry a true two slot cooler so if you need to mount it into a case for a mini itx for example that will only accept two slots or smaller then this card is going to fit as opposed to 6800 xt or bigger cards that won't fit you've also got the two eight pin connectors for power requirements at the back you've got two display port outs hdmi 2.1 for 4k 120 hertz and vrr support and then there's a usb type-c at the back now in terms of the aesthetics you've got the same fans as the 6800 xt with that silver black theme going on with the red ring around the side and a very solid back plate to boot though you're probably wondering at this stage what's with the 6800 who's it for it is sitting in a bit of a difficult spot in my opinion whereas performance isn't coming in that of a 6800 xt and what we're gonna do is pull up world of warcraft where i did benchmark this but i'm going to show you guys the live results here where we've got the 3060 ti the 3070 and then the 6800 this is on the max 10 settings at 4k which all these three cards are capable of giving a very smooth experience in this game even on max detail now this is with ray tracing off and i have taken a look at ray tracing on this game and it does tank performance a lot for what i feel is not that good of a visual improvement though you may notice that i've also included smart access memory which amd is offering on their 6800 at the moment as well as their 6800xt and their upcoming 6900 xt where all you have to do to enable this is go into your bios change two settings then you will be getting extra fps however one cool thing and also one not so cool thing about the 6800 is we'll get the cool thing out of the way and that is like literally and metaphorically too that is the under vaulting where we're able to undervolt this card very easily where i can pull up my settings here on the screen for you guys and it did a tremendous job and you're going to be saving like 60 watts and losing 1 fps and this in turn will keep the card cooler and the temperatures down and also the noise down as well however on the flip side of things if you want to overclock the 6800 to say try and get closer to 6800 xt performance you're going to be out of luck unfortunately where this is v bios limited in its 1025 millivolt where even out of the box the 6800 xt will have a higher milli voltage and essentially a higher clock speed so i couldn't really get much in terms of overclocks out of the 6800 unfortunately but that being said if you want to overclock it a little bit then you can get a bit more performance and the good thing about that is you won't be using up a whole lot more power either so conclusion time we're going to be summing up the 6800 because i feel like it's now in the same spot as the rtx 3070 where i feel like these two cards here are in that category where they're not offering as good value for money as the cards beside it and i'm talking about the 3060 ti against the 3070 where you can also overclock this and it does amazingly well for overclocking and then you've got the 6800xt on amd's side for that 70 dollars more it's going to give you more and i feel like if you're going for that high end play that extra 70 dollars on amd's site is very well justified and then if we move over to um the rtx 3070 side it's the same thing we've got the rtx 3080 which offers that different league of performance and then we've got the 30 60 ti which offers better value so i'm going to say like these two cards right here in my hand they're in difficult spots right now where i feel like yeah sure they're good cards in their own right and they're better than anything the previous generations have had to offer at this price point but i feel like they're being a little bit overshadowed by what's beside them on both sides of the fence the one thing i have noticed in particular with the 3070 versus the 3080 especially is that these are coming into stock so if you're desperate to get a gaming pc together for christmas or you just want to play games in the near future these cards and i'm going to stress this before i get on out of here both these cards are going to give you a phenomenal gaming experience but i guess when you come down to a tech enthusiast level there are those nitpicks which we spoke about just before so there's that if you're after a card these cards if they're in stock they're going to be good but they're not going to be the best buyers in my opinion they're going to be solid and they're not going to be the best buyers in terms of what's out there hope that has satisfied your gpu demands especially since someone can get their lucky hands on one of these and you don't even have to pay for it how lucky is that but do let us know in the comment section below what you think of the rx 6800 love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from concept soup and they ask maybe do a comparison 600 versus 600 where one has aesthetic focus the other performance then see how quickly each of them sells and this question i haven't seen a question like this in a while fantastic request for a video idea and in fact we did a video pretty similar to this where in the past i've done experiments selling pcs and that's when i caught on to the rgb craze a couple of years ago and that's when it sort of it was coming in then that now it's i feel i'm gonna do this test but i feel now it's gone to the critical realm where rgb is more important than actually what's inside the pc that's how bad it is now so this experiment that we're going to be doing i feel is going to show and it's going to unearth some very uh horrible truths if that's anything to go by but we'll wait for the video but thanks for the question and thanks for the idea too we'll get back onto that it definitely needs to be done i feel like people are now just buying pcs for rgb more than ever and i feel like the true tech enthusiasts who actually wouldn't build a pre-built anyway or wouldn't buy a pc they're going for price performance and they're also building it themselves so they're essentially not even a potential customer so in ways it kind of does make sense but we'll make the video we'll make it happen we'll see what comes about and also don't forget to bang that sub button if you haven't already on the way out ring that bell to get the content as soon as it drops here take our city and i will see you in the next one very soon peace out for now
