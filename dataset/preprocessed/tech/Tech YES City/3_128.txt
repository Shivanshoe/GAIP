Today we're going to be building a rugged gaming 
pc. Now Ii decided to do this after the postman   already decided to test out the build before it 
was even built by uh leaving a massive dent in   the side of the case and i thought to myself well 
with all this tough gaming going on with the zeus   i decided to put together a tough rugged pc but 
the purpose of this build was azus contacted me   and said brian do you want to build an all the 
zeus gaming pc and i said well at the moment   there's only a few pcs that i can see people if 
you're a gamer wanting to purchase and that would   be one involving either an rtx 3080 ti which i 
think is way too overpriced at the moment or an   rtx 3060 and these have the low hash rate limiters 
in them so crypto miners aren't exactly targeting   these uh gpus as much as they target other parts 
but then the rest of the components in the build   the power supply we're going with a 750 watt a 
zeus tough gaming power supply 32 gigabytes of   rgb ddr4 memory tough gaming z590 motherboard 
and an i5 11400f and a zeus tough gaming   atx case and it's also got these straps on it so 
you can carry it around brian the straps don't   actually do anything asus fooled you it's only for 
show mate but the best part about today's video is   building this pc a zeus are going to be doing a 
bundle with all the tough gaming parts and the   11400f before we get into today's build 
guide i want to say a couple of things   i was told the australian viewers of today's 
video we're going to get a competitive price   for this bundle we're going to build but at 
the moment they've just price matched the price   of all these parts on their own and the gpu 
especially is coming far above msrp still   so basically the bundle i'm building in today's 
video i'm actually not going to be recommending it   at its current price point but with my prediction 
that gpu prices are going to continue to come down   i would personally hold off and i'd like to 
see this bundle at least with a maximum price   tag of 2 000 aussie dollars or lower until 
then i cannot recommend it but of course   if you're building a new rtx 3000 series gaming pc 
you may find this guide quite helpful so let's get   into it and build a tough gaming pc which features 
the gt301 case 750 watt tough gaming power supply   z590 tough gaming plus motherboard 240 water 
cooler 11400f one terabyte ssd from crucial   32 gigabytes of ddr4 kingston hyperx rgb 
memory and the rtx 3060 v2 tough gaming   low hash rate gaming graphics card so let's 
get this build started and see how it turns out do   and there we have it for the azus tough gaming 
pc it's finished but there was a little bit of   trouble in paradise well actually kind of big 
since it took us a lot longer to build this pc   that i would have otherwise expected this was 
due mainly to the gt301 case and the 240 mil   cooler where technically although compatible in 
that we have ended up mounting the 240mm water   cooler at the front we did so at the expense of 
wasting a lot of time in the relocation with the   front rgb fence which used 12 volt versus the 5 
volt on the radiator fence and also did so with   very little clearance where we actually had to 
bend the case slightly to fit the rtx 3060 in   after we did this this was quite tedious and 
could have been easily avoided if there was more   clearance at the top of the case or instead which 
i think is more reasonable approach especially for   the 11400 f6 core would be to include a 120mm 
cooler in this bundle instead of a 240mm cooler   if this was the situation we could simply then 
mount the cooler the 120mm at the back of the   case and save a lot of time and hassle as well as 
money that once completed this pc is running very   quiet and since you guys have requested some tech 
yes storm spirit dota 2 plays it's time to test   that out with the fps numbers with a little bit of 
zip zap shock attack on the main map and on top of   that you guys only wanted me to benchmark in heavy 
team fights where i do agree with you that's the   most important time to have high fps so at 1080p 
we got an average during these team flights of   160 fps and at 4k it would get around 120 average 
fps where at 4k in particular the gpu was starting   to get maxed out and this was on max graphics 
settings by the way which i do prefer over lower   settings as this game is already quite old and 
on low settings it does look quite bad especially   versus higher settings though anything over 100 
fps is absolutely fine as long as they're a good   one and point one percent lows to match and since 
dota 2 works off a server tick rate aka an update   rate of 30 frames per second it's fine to have 
all these fps numbers that we've showed in today's   video go on to a more demanding title cyberpunk 
2077. here they have greatly reshuffled the   settings and details those settings give compared 
to launch when i originally played this game i'll   say medium preset used to be the meta that is the 
best graphical detail versus the fps experienced   now however it is about that high settings preset 
where the difference between medium and high is   now quite noticeable though the fbs drop isn't 
here at 1080p we benchmarked low settings where we   got over 120 average fps medium at 90 high at 79 
and ultra 67. though what about dlss at 1080p i'd   prefer the native image over dlss at low settings 
for example versus dlss quality at high settings   the 4k dlss especially on the balanced and quality 
profiles does an amazing job of reproducing a high   quality image and giving more fps versus native 
though with ray tracing it does work quite well   with cyberpunk so if you'd want to use this i'd 
recommend using the medium preset with an rtx 3060   and you can still get 60 fps at 1080p though 1440p 
and especially 4k with ray tracing on fps will   start the tank so i'd recommend turning it off at 
higher resolutions and perhaps just using dlss at   both 1440p and 4k so ultimately cyberpunk itself 
seems to have been better optimized to work with   lower end hardware though a lot of graphical 
settings have been shifted around to account   for this giving out a worser image for the same 
settings that were previously implemented in the   game at launch though the final thing with today's 
build that i wanted to talk about is of course the   temperatures and noise with that tempered glass 
side panel on both the cpu and gpu were staying   under 60 degrees celsius in a 23 degree ambient 
environment during cyberpunk which is quite   intensive on both the cpu and gpu and as for noise 
i'm talking right beside this build right here and   this is as loud as it gets so basically a very 
quiet build though one final thing i will say is   the straps on the front of the gt301 they don't do 
anything other than just for decoration i'd like   to see these straps be used for carrying the case 
like the helios where they serve a function other   than just looks which would make it a great tough 
gaming pc for land since it is quite compact while   fitting full-sized hardware and also a bonus the 
postman did this one for us he already dropped the   build on its side testing the durability and it 
still survived that of course he dropped it on the   metal side if he dropped it on the tempered glass 
side it would have been a nightmare so never drop   a pc on the tempered glass also before i get on 
out of here i'm sorry about the bundles pricing i   tried my best and when initially agreeing to this 
video i thought naively there would be quite a big   discount because it is a full bundle deal though 
that wasn't to be the case but hopefully you guys   enjoyed the build guide and the testing regardless 
and that price should be coming down anyway but at   its current price i am simply not recommending it 
though with that aside we got the question of the   day here which comes from a centauro and they 
ask or you know just play on native resolution   and they're referring to our dota 2 fsr versus 
default resolution video i'll put the link up   here and i completely agree if you can play at 
native resolution and lower the settings versus   higher settings with fsr on i would choose the 
former especially on dota 2. i feel at lower   resolutions in particular fsr still has some 
ways to go hope that answers that question and   if you've stayed this far then be sure to 
hit that like button hit that sub and ring   the bell and i'll catch you guys in another 
tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
