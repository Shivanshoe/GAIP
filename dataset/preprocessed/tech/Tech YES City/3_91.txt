it is nearing the end of October 2021 and that can only mean one thing and that is a used pc parts hunt where I’ve already looked at a heap of different listings and it looks like this month gpus are going pretty high here where i am locally a lot of people are sitting on high prices but last month we did clean up a heap of different graphics cards and so I’m still sitting on a few of those so I’m not too desperate but that said i have put in some offers on some graphics cards mainly a gtx 760 offered them 60 AUD we'll see if they take that there's also an rtx 3060 ti which I put an offer down as well as an RX 6600 but there's also a lot of other deals that i've put money down on mainly some older i7 i5 motherboard combos and there's also a b450 motherboard that i put in an offer of 40 aussie dollars and they accepted so we're gonna go pick that up now and that's right near our favorite used pc seller and that is les so we're gonna go check out what he's got while we're up that way and then hopefully by the time we pick up this motherboard and some other parts some of these other people get back to us and we've got some good news but who knows what deals we will find this month so strap on in get used pc parts hunting capes on and let's go are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message and if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2 links in description below [Music] so we've just finished picking up a heap of different deals on the road i got the b450 motherboard that was 40 dollars it also came with wi-fi included which is always a bonus especially on a budget then we picked up a power supply i got a thousand watt xaomin power supply now this thing is a little bit old didn't come unfortunately with the extra cables but it has so many cables with it already on the get-go and i got this for 35 aussie dollars so for me that's a no-brainer since it'll be able to power a high-powered build quite easily then of course les a staple he had heaps of stuff this time like hard drives i got i7 cpus monitors uh dell optiplexes so that was the main thing he had this month and also some other cool extra goodies so we'll take a look at all that stuff when we get back to the studio but i'm now just on the road i'm kind of waiting for a few more deals to come back and it's a little bit ironic that a lot of the gum tree ads i didn't put out many feelers on gumtree or many offers on gumtree but a lot of that came back to me with accepting the deals so i'm picking up one more deal later tonight which is a motherboard and cpu combo but also another person messaged me back on gumtree just working out a time now and then when we went over to facebook marketplace i put on probably about double the amount of offers that i did on gumtree but literally like no one's got back to me on on facebook so i have though i am in the process of also working to get an rtx 3060 ti where i put down an offer of a thousand aussie dollars now i know it's expensive in this market but i do need one for a build and they are going for around 1200 retail so of course saving 200 on uh something that you kind of need for a build to do for someone is always a plus even though it's it's it's the max i would pay for a 360 ti put it this way i wouldn't pay any more for one of these cards and it's only because i've teed up a gaming pc to sell that i need this usually i'd be paying max i want to pay like 850 or 900 aussie max but of course the market is still pretty bad for gpus but that doesn't deter us we are going to keep on looking for those deals so let's continue on the road [Music] so we've just docked back now into the tech yes studio for a quick pit stop so i've unloaded all these pc parts and i just couldn't believe the deal that we got off les so far 1200 aussie dollars and this was just packed full of i7s i got ram i got 16 hard drives half of those one terabyte half of those two terabyte and also got five dell optiplexes as well as three monitors and les even chucked in this thunderbolt extension hub as well which has display port hdmi five extra usb ports so i was actually been looking for one of those for a while and they actually are a little bit expensive so for him to chuck that in as a present that was really good but also managed to get two 380 watt power supplies so power supplies like these will do gtx 1050 ti builds absolutely fine but i was actually really impressed with every single item in the cart this month as opposed to some months i'll just pick up some stuff that les wants to sell and usually if you're buying bulk off people you'll take some of the bad stuff as well just to keep them happy because they're giving you really good prices on stuff because one thing i've noticed with all the bulk purchases i do off different sellers that sell in bulk usually you would want to take all their stuff that way it keeps them happy and even if you're just getting some stuff that you really don't want it's a good thing to keep that relationship up because ultimately the good is definitely going to outweigh the bad but this month around everything was just really good i can use everything in this kitty and we've got that total for 1200 aussie dollars for quite a lot of stuff so really happy with that hole of course that b450 motherboard that's a bargain at 40 aussie dollars especially with the wi-fi thrown in and then that powers by a thousand watt even though it's a little bit old old is gold especially when it comes to good pc parts like this power supply however the hustle doesn't just stop there from here in i'm going to quickly have dinner even though it's a late dinner 8 p.m and then i'm gonna jump back in the tech yes mobile and go get two graphics cards so we're gonna pick up that rtx 3060 ti for a thousand aussie and then we've also teed up a gt 1030 for 50 aussie dollars so let's get in my belly and then we'll go get some deals [Music] [Music] so we just picked up the 3060 ti and got that for a thou and i checked the box of course the guy even had the receipt so making sure i don't get hosed because i've heard of a few people messaging me where they've picked up gravis cards in the box and then when they got home they found out it was a different graphics card like for instance they bought like a 2080 and then in the box was like a gtx like 560 or something so try not to be that guy if you're on the road but we just got to quickly now pick up this gt 1030 and then get back we'll see where the deals are at [Music] and that right there is the final deal of the night the gt 1030 but i actually see quite a few gt 1030s come up for sale so people probably buy the cards and then realize hey maybe like 30 fps at high settings isn't enough and i don't want to play at low settings so i got to get a better graphics card but a gt 1030 will play those easy free-to-play titles so it does have its purpose especially considering the price [Music] so we just got back to the studio with the final two deals of the night and i'm a little bit spent it is 10 30 it is getting a little bit late so i'm gonna rest and recoup recharge the tech yes energy and then in the morning i'm gonna see if anyone's replied but i'll also do another scan it is now a fresh beautiful actually not so beautiful outside it's still kind of overcast yesterday was pretty crazy it was storming and lightning and raining and all that stuff but it doesn't matter what time of the day it is or what the weather's like i'm always looking for a deal so we pulled up this morning two potential deals and one's a ryzen 3 3100 with a mini itx motherboard they're asking 250 i put an offer of 200 aussie dollars so hopefully they get back to us with that and then there's also a gtx 1650 super they're asking 280 we put in an offer of 250. so they're the only two deals that i've come across that i'd potentially buy hopefully those get back to us with some success but in the meantime i will actually close off the parts hunt here because i've got so much stuff that i've got to do from here on in there's uh z690 ddr5 and the new cpus i've got to test all that stuff and of course i want to compare it to the used stuff as well get an idea of what value z690 is bringing if it is bringing value at all so or if it's just going to be one of those platforms that's going to be just a you know trophy child for intel to say hey we're back on top again or what not so i'm gonna do all that testing it's gonna take a lot of time so i look forward to giving you guys the data on that however we did score pretty well yesterday i mean i got five separate deals uh we got the lez mass stack we've got two graphics cards we got uh two other deals it wasn't as big as other months but it's still i felt like we got a lot of quality deals here of course do let us know in the description below what was your favorite deal of the month for me personally i'm going with the les big stash here i think the 1200 for all this stuff that i got was a really good deal considering i liked every single item that was in that big stack as opposed to what we were talking about before sometimes you can get some bad stuff that you're kind of just sitting on or you gotta sell it in an office pc combo it's not really the exciting gaming stuff though i usually never really admit to bad deals i'd say the rtx 3060 ti is one of the worst deals i've got but as we said earlier i've already teed up that sale they've actually put down a deposit for a set amount on a rig that i've quoted them at and of course if i can get the stuff cheaper and especially in this case since it is pretty much brand new with the original receipt then i can save that money and turn it into a bit of profit so that's always the way i like to do things always finding the value even if something is overvalued and over market price if you can still beat the competition then you are doing a service so with that said i hope you guys enjoyed october's used pc parts hunt of the month if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what deals have you been picking up love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and with that aside we've also got the question of the day and this comes from our tomfo abdul aziz and they asked did you try to install windows 7 and then upgrade to windows 10 with the 8 cores activated so they're referring to our video that we recently published with a problem what a bizarre problem where we had a faulty 1700x ryzen cpu and in order to get windows installed i had to halve the core count and the thread count and that essentially turned the cpu into a ryzen 5 i think it's 1500x and i mean at the end of the day we didn't try the windows 7 and then upgrade because even if it installed windows 7 on less cores and threads activated we would have come into that crash sooner or later the cpu was faulty and we managed to fix it by halving the call and thread count in the bios so whatever the person who came around and needed help fixing it does with it they use it for personal use that's all cool but i mean if they want to sell that pc on then i hope they're very transparent about it because that was just a bizarre problem the cpu was out of warranty and so essentially you've got a cpu that's just half functional but at least at the end of the day it's still functional i mean it would still play games absolutely fine i'm pretty sure but uh yeah in terms of trying to get it fixed and trying to get around a faulty core i mean another workaround might be a different bios that perhaps targets a different two cores to deactivate so you've got a six score 12 thread instead of a four quarter thread but that's probably the best case scenario but at the end of the day i was glad i was able to salvage something for that person who came around because they were on a budget they were quite young and i do feel sorry for them they didn't have a whole lot of money so it was good that we got that to work in the end anyhow guys i do have a message back from the ryzen cpu motherboard combo and they said i can pick that up later in the day so that's looking pretty good hopefully we can get that gpu as well i will update in the comment section below what unfolds this month also if you want any sort of particular testing done on z690 anything you're looking forward to do drop a comment in the comment section below i'm just going to be going through initially all the different standard stuff the productivity benchmarks the games but that'll be doing some other cool stuff with this platform because it is pretty cool that we got ddr5 finally hitting the markets that'll be coming out soon anyhow guys i'll catch you in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub ring that bell peace out for now bye we are going to ask [Music] you
