What is better than a single xeon well your answer would probably be two Xeons, and well of course you would be right i mean it's always better to have more xeons, but in today's video we're going to take a look at the value proposition of going with a setup like this and that is in this case we've got two x 56 72 xeons now these come in at around ten dollars and they're a four core eight thread variant of the very popular first generation westmere xeons now in the past i've covered things like the x-5670 the x-5650 which is six core 12 thread and they're overclockable and they represent great value if you can find an overclocking motherboard however in today's video we're going to look at a dual socketed motherboard where they can accept two of these xeons and you can put them together and get eight core 16 threads and at the face value 8 core 16 threads for 20 does sound like fantastic value but we do have to keep in mind that this is first generation and the lack of avx and avx-2 instruction sets plus in a lot of cases the lack of usb 3 and certain other features does make this less appealing especially in 2021. also considering its sheer age there is a lot to talk about if you want to go down this route and you guys have been requesting that i take a look at the dual first gen xeons for quite a while so let's get into it see what numbers we can pull in games and then we'll talk about the value proposition right here today's video is sponsored by cyberghost vbn they're a world leading virtual private network provider with over 36 million users i use cyberghostvpn to hide my ip address and encrypt my connection especially if i'm out on a public wi-fi network but it's not just that cyberghostvpn is an expert of unblocking geo-restricted content on

when you get a dual xeon system like this put together is you're probably going to want to tune the system as best can be tuned but this is where the problem happens with motherboards like the server grade motherboards in this case we're using a super micro motherboard and you're really limited to not only an older kind of bios where it's not even uefi but you've got the only option here is really to overclock the memory in this case we put it on 1333 megahertz which is we're using ddr3 ecc registered memory and that's one of the big benefits of using these older systems though is that you can use cheaper memory that wouldn't work on consumer grade boards say for instance a h61 motherboard just won't support ddr3 ecc registered memory but we're locking this 1333 megahertz speed as well as dropping the qpi frequency down here to 4.8 and the reason we're doing that is to take some of the heat off that northbridge heatsink if we're running this higher then you can overheat this chipset because we're running two higher clocked xeons because most of these server grade motherboards were only designed to run a lower clocked xeon and in turn that would put less strain on the heatsink itself though after we've done those two things we can now get over to windows and finally run some benchmarks now going on into the gaming numbers with our gtx 980 where we recently did the ryzen 1 3100 build with a gtx 980 as well and in fortnite we do lose out a bit of fps here to the ryzen 33100 and that's only four cores eight threads so this is more limited to the single threaded side in fortnight believe it or not and this is causing us to lose a bit of fps though it's nothing to be ashamed about getting over a hundred fps and this is on competitive settings with the epic view distance and low settings so this plays really well on this pc still it's just of course you will be losing a bit of fps if you're not going with a newer cpu with better single thread performance or of course you're not overclocking the cpu in this case we can't however let's move over now to cs go where the fps here was surprisingly a lot better than it was in fortnite where in the previous video when we did the ryzen 3 3100 we actually tested the same map and we used the same settings and we're getting very similar fps on this dual xeon x 5672 setup so that is some good news scoring over 150 average fps though one thing i will note is that the one percent and point one percent lows especially on this pc in particular they aren't that accurate in that as soon as we hit the f5 key to start benchmarking in pretty much any title that we tested here today the uh one percent and pointless lows drop really low but after that the one percent lows do tend to pick up a little bit and it is relatively at least in csgo and fortnight for what it's worth a smooth experience now moving over now to call of duty cold war black ops this is playing this game at 1080p 100 render resolution and it's on a blend of low and medium settings the game itself this time around configured the settings automatically and when i started playing it on these settings it actually gave us around 70 fps i mean changing some graphic settings around and lowering them down you might be able to get a bit more fps squeeze a little bit more out of this thing but for what it's worth i was really impressed with the visual quality for what we're getting on this game at 1080p and of course it was very playable on these cpus the eight core 16 threads but what we can see is at least in the three titles so far and actually the next tile is just going to be just as bad that the 16 threads isn't being perfectly utilized i believe we were utilizing that a bit better then we could get some higher fps though onto cyberpunk this game scoring around 40 average fps just like it did on the ryzen 3 3100 setup this is pretty much gpu bound cyberpunk being one of the worst games in terms of its graphics demand and that it's just so hungry for the gpu power in this case the gtx 980 can deliver it at 1080p low settings but if that is something that you want to just step outside and do some jumping jacks to then by all means please go do some jumping jacks but 40 fps it's a little bit under i do like to get 60 fps or more if i can even if i'm changing the settings to not so desirable graphic fidelity at low but in this case we've already pretty much lowered the settings as low as they can go so good old cyberpunk still running pretty poorly even on mediocre rigs like we're not even going into that potato level and this thing still can't put out the fps so now just finished up our cinebench benchmark here in r23 and the dual xeon scored 5618 points this will make for surprisingly a decent 1080p video editing rig especially since we do have 24 gigabytes of ram installed in this pc though after running that cinebench score you're probably wondering like what's the go here that looked pretty good especially for the price and yes it is pretty good for that price but one thing to keep in mind is that we've had to install a fan here over that heatsink which is pretty much because we're running two cpus right now this heatsink does get very hot and because it's a server kind of build we do want to make sure we've got this fan cooling that heatsink because if we don't we actually it can actually overheat and turn the system off and that's not good especially while you're gaming or doing productivity tasks you don't want this to happen i believe this is the reason why a lot of people do sand i've actually this is the third x58 server motherboard people have sent in to me here where one of them i had to wash and two others i guess people just tried using them and they just didn't work properly for them in this case we've got this working where it's working properly with a fan directly flowing air over the northbridge heatsink right here which is sort of right under the gravis guard so in a difficult location but you can get the job done and you will get some very good performance as we're seeing here with the cinebench score now in terms of power consumption that is a bit of a minus on a setup like this where i'll show you guys the idle power consumption numbers as well as the power consumption numbers while we're running cinebench and also while we're gaming in call of duty so now coming back to the talking head what we can see with those results is that yes this thing can still play games in 2021 and in fact if you find something like this on a local deals hunt or you find a server motherboard for very cheap and no one wants to use that thing anymore like for instance i got a server rack given to me in the parts on and i utilize that to get some very good price performance if you can get something like that where it's a local deal or someone just sells it off for a ridiculously low price then of course you can get some amazing price performance never look past the used market for getting a good deal but what we're going to look at right now is of course the market rates online which is a very important part and the two zeons themselves by themselves ten dollars i think that's always going to be a good option for someone especially who just wants to play say cs go fortnight a bit of league of legends but when we look at the two of these in the fact that we've got to put them on an expensive motherboard where the prices that i checked for these motherboards are around a hundred dollars each so if we've got the hundred dollar motherboard then we've got the two coolers that we're gonna put on top which are twenty dollars each then we've got the two cpus this now brings us to around 140 usd and honestly at this price i would recommend some other choices and that's either going with first generation ryzen or of course going with one of my very popular favorites right now and that is the x99 xeons off aliexpress my favorite being the 2678 v3 that's a 12 core 24 thread that will set you back a little bit more dollars in the grand scheme of things but if we look at the 8 core for example you can pick these up very cheap and get a motherboard as well as ram and fit that out for pretty much the same price as this and that will give you eight core 16 threads and not only that you'll have avx and avx2 instruction sets on top of that and since using the northbridge configuration on these chipsets they then had higher multipliers on the cpus even in idle and of course 45 and 32 nanometer chips aren't as efficient as their smaller brethren though the final obstacles as i would call it with a setup like this is that you do need two cpu coolers so you will be spending extra money on coolers and also you might need an eatx case which could set you back more money and of course the fact that you've got to remove more heat from the case than you traditionally otherwise would so you might need more case fans and of course a bigger power supply because you're now going to feed two cpus power as opposed to one so in this case we did get away with using a 650 watt power supply it was absolutely fine but say for instance we wanted to step it up to two 6 core 12 threaded xeons to make 12 cause 24 threads in total then i'd suggest going with an even bigger power supply especially if we're using a more power hungry gpu like a 980 ti for example though when all the dust is settled and the sun is shining down brightly on these first generation xeons it doesn't take away from the fact that these things can still play games and if you do pick them up cheap enough and you do have a bit of time on your hands and you do have some of the parts lying around to fix yourself up a system and you just want to play games then something like this will definitely be able to entertain you even in 2021 but one more thing not to forget and i'll say it again like we said in the gaming benchmarks is if you do go with a setup with two cpus in this case especially if it's first generation do put a fan over that chipset heatsink because it did in this case overheat without that fan and i have used the setup like this in the past and it has overheated without the fan as well so would definitely recommend getting that fan over there but other than that i'm pretty happy with this pc it's not loud at all and it does get up and boogie still i think that's the most important thing anyways with that aside if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button and let us know in the comments section below what you think of going with two zeons like this do you share the same thoughts as me do you think it's just not an option at all even if you pick it up cheap enough love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from tamiya zevadov and they ask you're going to win against whole country governments like russia they bought 60 million dollars of gpus from from nvidia last week and many other countries so to answer this one it's tricky right it comes off the back of the video we did where we spoke about the rtx 3060 and the implementation of what nvidia is doing with the algorithms to essentially nerf or drop the hashing rates of the rtx 3060 to make it less desirable for cryptocurrency miners now russia buying up 60 million dollars worth of gpus in a week i mean that's what a lot of corporations are doing they're just buying up all these graphics cards and making money and that's what cryptocurrencies introduced it's introduced this new wave of demand because people want to make profit and of course the rtx 30 series especially the 3060 ti being the most desirable in terms of power efficiency versus profit they're going to be wanting to buy them up so we've got this extra demand coming in one thing i know is that the hashing rate and the profitability of a 30 60 at its current price point versus a 30 60 ti is a lot less desirable for miners but when we look at the difference in gaming numbers it's a lot less than that difference in cryptocurrency hashing rates so that's definitely going to help gamers in that sense and lastly one thing to say about this whole situation a lot of people are criticizing nvidia now for doing this and look i know like don't get me wrong i'm the first guy that will tell you and i've been telling people this for years these are corporations they don't care about you but one thing i will say is they do care about your business and business from gamers is continual as opposed to cryptocurrency miners which isn't nvidia knows that so they're going to want to try to take care of the gamers before the cryptocurrency minus and so i feel like what they've done with this 360 drop in hashing rates is actually a good thing though at the end of the day it's a very touchy subject and the fact that people are getting very emotional about it and they're getting heated up in the comments means that is there a lot of frustration around this subject and i feel like there's the cryptocurrency thing in general is not it just it's one of those things that's not solving anything in the world at all it's just creating more problems than it's fixing that's what i feel like cryptocurrency is doing and of course the most important thing is i feel like cryptocurrency and especially the speculation going into it is definitely a band-aid from all the governments going crazy on the printer on the printer and of course i feel like it's a band-aid for the real problem and that's the government's just printing out money like rates that they've never done before so all this mayhem that we're seeing i feel like there's a better solution at the core and i feel like you've got to fix the core problem rather than try to band-aid it good question of the day thanks for that one anyway guys if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content i'm going to be getting it back on to xeons and use parts hunts and more positive stuff because this whole crypto situation when i talk about it it does just bring me down it's nothing to be positive about i think anyway if you stayed this far and joined that techies content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
