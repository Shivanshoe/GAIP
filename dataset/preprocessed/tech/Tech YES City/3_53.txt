today tech yes citizens marks a very special day and that's because it is the first used pc parts hunt of 2022 so i am in need as always for some good prices on used graphics cards and what we're gonna be looking at today is pretty much everything low end to high end i need it all and i've actually already inquired about quite a few gpus for instance i've put down a 600 aussie dollar offer on an rx 6600 and i'll put the usd pricing up on the screen for you guys as well so you can see how much i'm max bidding for some of these gpus then there's also two gtx 1060s one of those being a three gigabyte and they've actually gotten back to us already where they said they'll agree on 200 aussie dollars so we're gonna go pick that up there's also rx 584 gigabytes and i do say that in a plural way because the person in the listing has literally said there is a hundred of these he has available he's asking 200 i messaged him twice i guess he's getting bombarded with messages because it's the first time i've sort of seen a mass sale of gpus at a decent price even at asking price this is pretty solid so if you're not ready or even if you are ready put on those used price performance pc parts hunting capes and let's go jump in the tech yes mobile and score some deals right after this sponsor spot today's video is sponsored by gigabyte in their powerful range of nvidia geforce rtx 30 series laptops if you're tired of trying to find a desktop graphics card at a decent price then perhaps an aorus gaming laptop is more for you with the refresh rates as high as 300 hertz a choice of screen sizes from 15 to 17 inch and a choice of geforce rtx gpus ranging from the rtx 3060 all the way up to the blazingly fast rtx 30 80 16 gigabyte armed with these specs these laptops are sure to give you a smooth gaming experience though if you want something more suited for creativity then there is also the aero lineup featuring a smaller form factor and a 4k oled screen click the links in the description below to find out more so we've ended up now picking up the first deal and this is a gtx 1066 gigabyte and we've landed this for 250 aussie dollars now the first person that i messaged about the 1063 gigabyte i did ask them for their address they did accept and they just didn't get back to me so the person when i messaged them about the 1066 giveaway they did get back to us and we've just picked this one up right now and we are up in brisbane which is a favorite of the used pc parts and there is a person up here called les so what we're going to do right now is we're going to go pay less a visit since we are about 15 minutes out from where he is but of course hoping that he's got some good deals this month for us but back to gravis cards as well we have been looking for a few more graphics cards on the market mainly a 1080 ti which i think i might be able to score a 1080 ti for 650 dollars so i'm waiting for someone to get back to me there is also a gtx 1050 ti that has come up on the road where they're asking 150 i put in an offer of 120 because it's kind of funny when you're on the road and you sort of do searches for pc parts up in different areas different deals come up it's kind of weird but i kind of really like it anyway so it's good to see that the deals are coming up when the yes man be hitting the road so let's keep it going [Music] so we just finished up at les's place and it's actually kind of some sad news and that is less actually slowing down and he said to me he's not really buying any more desktop pcs he might still delve in laptops but this was kind of word that was coming since about halfway last year les said he was looking to retire i just didn't think he would ever retire so i always sort of joked behind the scenes i'm like man once you're in the game of pc hustle and you ain't ever quitting but it looks like he actually is starting to quit and it's kind of sad but if you guys didn't know if you haven't watched previous parts hunts les is actually someone that i always go to every month because he usually has some pretty good deals but speaking of the deals that we did get off him this month four 22-inch hd monitors they're samsung and hp is telling me how the samsung monitors are the best and i should pay more for them so i was like you know what cool i need monitors anyway so i got four of these for 160 aussie dollars and he threw in a stand as well because i've got monitors without stands that i've picked up in the past for about 10 aussie of pop so you just grab the stands and you just custom mount them and you've got yourself a monitor and then he had some hard drives as well and we picked up two one terabytes as well as three two terabytes in totally did us 140 aussie dollars for the five drives so it's not the best deals but at the same time i always appreciate what les does for us he always throws in extra cables and this time around he ended up throwing in like a heap of free mice and keyboards which when i get all that stuff bundled in it always saves me money if i'm putting together pc gaming setups for example because i don't have to go down somewhere like office works always trying to add value on and les does add a lot of value on but this month around we just didn't get any pcs from him which is kind of surprising because he's always got some oem or some dell optiplex or something lying around but uh with that with that aside we do now have another graphics card to go pick up this one's come up in brisbane and it is a gtx 1050 ti now they're asking 150 aussie dollars we managed to knock them down to 120 and they've accepted so we're going to jump on this one quickly because the 10 50 ti 120 that's not bad at all so let's go get that and then we'll see what other deals have been accepted [Music] and we now just scored the gtx 1050 ti this one was a little bit weird though because when i met the person they were kind of nervous and a little bit like just you know the weird kind of shaking handshake and a little bit sweaty and so i'm kind of like okay is this guy trying to hose me so i actually asked him because i was at their place and i'm just because i'm up in brisbane and again i'm about an hour drive away from my home i just want to make sure the card works so i actually just said to him look can you actually just show me this up and working before i buy it and so they actually did take it into their room and put it in their computer and showed it up and running for me so i was actually grateful for that because usually when someone's like no i mean some people just be nervous about selling something in general and i understand that but at the same time there's also people who are trying to hose people down and they'll get nervous for that reason and so you don't want to be on the wrong side of the deal if the part doesn't indeed work so that is now two gravis cards that we've picked up this month on the parts hunt what we're going to do right now is i'm actually going to pull over somewhere because the 1080 ti and also the 1063 gigabyte they both haven't gotten back to us yet and so while i wait for those deals to hopefully come back since they are around this area i am going to look just for some other parts and hopefully something else comes up while we're on the road because we kind of also got to make up now for not getting as many deals off less [Music] maybe [Applause] [Music] so we're now back in the tech yes mobile this one we had to drive pretty far for and it is a gtx 1080 ti seahawk edition so it's actually got the water block and stuff on it but since we got it for 650 that's not bad at all but also while i was there of course the obligatory asking the question of do you have anything else and then they said they did and they had an x99 motherboard a 6850 and also 32 gigabytes of ram we scored that for 250 so this has been a pretty good score so far this month but what we're gonna do now is we've actually found another listing that's come up for sale and this is for an x79 motherboard with a i7 38 20 and 16 gigabytes of ddr3 memory and i don't know what it is about x79 motherboards lately but seriously like in the last year every x79 motherboard i pick up always has an i7 3820 in it but anyway we've ended up the good news is we've ended up negotiating this for 110 aussie dollars which the x79 bought alone it's kind of worth that so chucking in 16 gigabytes of ram a cooler and a cpu that's not bad going so we're gonna go pick up that deal right now so let's get moving and also guys just let us know what you think of your favorite deal so far i mean i think this is pretty cool but i i don't know if i'm gonna have to try and custom water cool it or if i should just try and find another custom cooler for [Music] [Music] [Music] so on the way home i did a quick scan and i found an i7 4770k with an azure saver tooth motherboard and a water cooler and 16 gigabytes of ram and two fans now they were asking 150 bucks but they did say in the ad it wasn't working properly and i asked them so i just started talking to them a little bit on the messages and said what's wrong with it and they said it makes it to windows but then the system will just crash freeze and drop out and i thought to myself well that's probably not the motherboard or the cpu and so it could be either one of two things i'm thinking straight away maybe the ram or the water coolers busted and the cpu overheats and that throttles which is pretty dangerous because you can actually damage a cpu if you've got a broken water cooler so do be very careful of that but anyway we went picked it up took the gamble i did offer them however 110 dollars and they did accept so i'm guessing no one was really putting any offers down 110 bucks for an azus sabretooth motherboard i think these are some of the best motherboards you can get 16 gig of ram maybe one of sticks is broken and a 4770k not too shabby so we're gonna put that on the tab for this month and let's get home and sort of unpack all this stuff and then work out a game plan finally for tomorrow and we are now waking up to a glorious table of used pc parts and we've got these three graphics cards and here's the uh 1080 ti with the water block and still got a bit of coolant in it so i'm going to actually wait for you guys i really want to hear your feedback should i maybe try and make something custom with that or perhaps put on this morpheus cooler i'm actually really curious about this morpheus cooler because i've never tried one before i think if i spray paint these fans black it'll look really sleek on this gpu right here but we've also got the gtx 1050 ti also the gtx 1066 gigabyte then we're just going to quickly test these gpus besides the 1052 i've already seen that up and running to make sure that they work and then we've got the x99 board here which but i don't know what to do with this x99 board because i think nowadays with x99 literally the most expensive thing is the motherboard people were chasing the cheap xeons especially the 18 core xeon for example and they really only work on the higher end boards that have the better vrm so something like this is actually probably worth more instead of putting it into a gaming pc it's probably worth more just selling the motherboard individually in the cpu and then keeping say perhaps the ram so really good pickups on that end and then we've got this motherboard right here i do want to quickly test this out but it looks like this one will definitely work considering how clean it looks and i don't know which was my favorite score the x79 setup or the x 99 setup like i was going to say well the graphics cards probably people liking the graphics cards because the prices are still pretty high but x79 and x99 they're very special around here at tech city and then we've got this last deal here i'm actually going to fire this up i'm really curious too to see if this works because i didn't even realize because it was dark last night but there's one stick of memory in here i actually think it's not 16 gigabytes of ram as advertised it's actually 12 gigabytes of ram but again if the motherboard and the 4770k end up working i'll be very happy with that because they're the two most important things out of this deal right here [Music] do [Music] and we've just finished testing out all this hardware and it looks like it is all working absolutely fine with the water block stuff though we couldn't leave that on too long as there's no active cooling and so that will overheat quickly however we did confirm the 1080 ti was installed in device manager absolutely fine and the x99 motherboard with the 32 gigabytes of ram that booted to the bios absolutely fine however with the z87 sabretooth it did initially start boot cycling and i was a little bit worried because that could mean the motherboard was faulty but then i took out one of the sticks of memory and it was booting fine so it looks like we've just got a faulty four gigabyte stick of memory with this whole kit which is kind of the best case outcome for this deal and we're now fast forwarding to night time at nearly 9 00 p.m and you're probably like brian what took you so long to find some deals i actually had to do some solar panel quote for our house and uh i ended up saving between the first and second best quote thousand bucks so look around for the best deals it doesn't matter if it's tech products but anything really always got to find them best deals but speaking of deals we've got a gtx 1080 ti which i threw down 700 aussie dollar offer on and they got back to me and they said they'd take 740 and this is where one of those things where i'm just not going to take it because my maximum for a 1080 ti right now is 700 aussie dollars and that's that thing we've been speaking about in the parts hunt that tech yes discipline that's the limit i'm not going over it and that's all there is to that deal the next one we looked at was a 1060 three gigabyte another one came up put down a 200 offer then they came back to me and they said someone else was going to pick it up so it seems like these 1063 gigabyte deals i'm just missing out on this month but then we have an rtx 2060 which they're asking 650 aussie dollars for and i put down an offer of 550 and then they came back at 600 and i just came back to him i said sorry 550 is my maximum then they said that's okay come and get it so we're going to jump in the tech yes mobile right now and pick up that rtx 2060 but i also managed to score a ryzen 5 1600 a b350 motherboard and 16 gigabytes of ram for 250 aussie dollars so that's going to be a whole combo with the wraith stealth cooler so it's not too shabby not the best deal but of course not the worst and i can usually use that in a gaming pc say with a 1080 ti or something like that and then make a bit of profit on that flip but we're going to be getting that next tuesday as the person is actually out of state right now so they said when they've got it all ready they'll send me a message so unfortunately we're not gonna be able to pick that up tonight but we have organized that from searching from the deals before and then the last deal that i've messaged on was a h370 motherboard for 50 aussie dollars and they also had a logitech g910 keyboard and a logitech mouse that they're doing for 50 as well now that logitech keyboard definitely at least locally here they go for like minimum 180 and even though it's used i'm sure i could clean that thing up make it look like brand new so why don't you hear back from them hopefully they get back to us by the time we pick up this rtx 2060 but who knows if not we're going to pick up the part and then we'll talk about the market in general starting 2022. [Music] and we're now back at the tech yeah studio with the final deal and this is the rtx 2060 my maximum i'm prepared to pay is 550 aussie and the funny thing is when i picked up three of these rtx 2060s in another parts on last year i managed to sell all those and gaming pcs really quickly so it's actually a very good graphics card in the market for selling gaming pcs if you want to re-flip and so that now leaves the total for this month a little over 2 300 aussie dollars i guess that's somewhere in the range of 1600 usd for all these deals we ended up getting four graphics cards three motherboard cpu and ram combos four monitors and also five hard drives and of course a morpheus cooler so i'm pretty happy with the deals that we picked up this month but of course you guys are probably wanting to know a bit of an outlook what's the used market like right now seeing just as a general trend and i do talk to a lot of people locally as well is that any pc here in australia under a thousand aussie dollars is moving pretty quick so if you get those budget gravity cards like a gtx 1060 which is wilds kind of desperately looking for those this month since they were a decent price they will go into a gaming pc and you'll be able to flip that really easy now another thing is too is the rtx 3050s i thought they would sell out pretty quick at msrp and the ones at msrp in australia there was only actually one of them that was the azus single fan model that came in at 4 29 and i went to check on that i forgot to check on it right as it dropped but as the price dropped for that i think that sold out within two minutes so the demand for the 30 50 at msrp is ridiculously strong and the funny thing is the rx 6500xt in australia still on the shelves people just aren't buying that so that should show you something about the market i don't know where you guys are on the world i can really only give you uh data relative to the australian market but i'm guessing it's probably the same thing all over the world but the reason why the rtx 3050s would be selling out over the 6500 xt is not just that performance difference it comes down a lot of this comes down to as well pc resellers too so pc resellers will be buying those nvidia cards if they can get them for close to msrp and then flipping them and gaming pcs and they're probably not wanting to take the risk with the 6500 xt i mean i haven't tried selling a 6500 xt gaming pc i might try and try and gauge the market but i know for a fact you get a 30 50 for 429 aussie dollars you'll be able to flip that in an 1100 aussie pc and get rid of it pretty quickly but if you got a 6500 xt what could you get for that would it be 700 aussie dollars and so that difference in a gaming pc and the resale value the nvidia cards just have so much resale value in a gaming pc i'm finding if you've got a ryzen cpu or an i7 or something like that it doesn't make too much of a difference but a lot of people here in australia they want to buy a pc with an nvidia graphics card in it and so i'm one of those people that instead of complaining about the situation i just go with the flow and roll with the punches and you guys if you've followed me long enough you'll know that's my model of tech city roll with the punches and so in my review of the rtx 3050 i thought this thing would sell out pretty quick and it has sold out really quick at those msrp prices but another thing is too i'll give you guys a hint if you are in australia the 3050 eagle the one that i reviewed that hasn't dropped yet in terms of being in stock at retailers so do keep an eye out for that one if you're looking for one that's close to msrp because i'm told that will be dropping in the next few days and i'm guessing when that does that will go out very quickly as well so that's where the market is right now if you're paying 429 dollars for a 30 50 it's better than a 1070 uses less power has the dlss etc that's better than a 1070 on the used market for 400 aussie dollars the funny thing is i did see two's 1070s also come up this month that i didn't report on because i didn't even get a chance to get them there was one for 350 that got snapped up sold up there was another one for 400 that got snapped up as well really quickly so again in the current market the 30 50 where i am locally around msrp is actually a decent deal but what about going forward in this current market if you guys want some decent advice then all i can say is it still all lies on the graphics card cpus motherboards ram all that other stuff you can get it for really good prices both new and used but the gpus are still the main focus and so what i'm finding is gpu prices definitely have come down this month versus last month but in terms of going forward i can only really give you guys an outlook for the next month and what i'm seeing is the federal reserve that's america's central bank they've dropped their quantitative easing aka the funny money they've dropped that down to 60 billion a month and then they're going to be dropping that down to 30 billion a month from next month and so what that means is basically if this trend follows that means there's going to be less easy money in the economy and so as long as this trend continues crypto will continue to drop and then that will mean cheaper graphics cards because the miners won't be snapping up new cards and also they may even be selling their graphics cards on the market like we saw with that rx 580 seller even though he never got back to us but in terms of finance and economics you guys been loving that stuff i'll keep talking about it because i feel like it's relating more than ever to tech and the price of tech products so stay tuned and i'll detail a lot more on the upcoming live stream so if you want to see the live stream as soon as it drops and you want to join in on the chat make sure you stay subbed ring the bell too you'll get the notification when the live stream drops in the next few days i am pretty all over the place in terms of time schedules so i will try to announce it on social media when i'm doing a live stream and uh because i love talking with you guys it's so much fun when we do live streams but with that aside we do have the question of the day which comes from tim hill and they ask hi brian uh any chance when you put up the benchmarks that you can include some of the cards that are above what you're reviewing really helps when deciding whether to get something like a 30 50 or a 30 60 instead thanks and i would have loved to have included a 6600 and a 3060 in that review i just ran out of time and i didn't have a whole lot of time with the 30 50. i only had a couple of days and the third and then the 6500 xt i had to order that one in and then include that in the benchmarks and so i was cut for time to get that on embargo date but if you guys do want to see more tests like that then definitely do let us know and i will include that in some upcoming tests i do plan to test the 3050 and also the 6500 xt on pci gen 3 and gen 2 to see how much performance they lose because i feel like these two budget cards are very relevant for people wanting to put together say an x79 rig or a 2600k or something like that and they just want to know okay if i get a real budget motherboard combo is this going to upset the performance if i've only got pci gen 2 versus 3 etc so i will be doing those tests for you guys very soon but also at the same time i got the cards in there in that review that i thought were very relevant for the current market and where the price point of the 3050 was coming in at because it's coming in at the 429 aussie dollars or 250 usd that price point if you can get it for that price it's really going to upset the market with these use 1070s and all these other use 10 66 gigabytes that are definitely going for much higher prices than they should be in the current market so i really wanted to give people a feel of how the 3050 performed versus a lot of those budget cards that are currently overpriced on the used market especially ebay but on that note of ebay man ebay prices are always a lot higher than local deals and i'm just picking up a decent deals here i am paying more than i would ideally like to especially on things like rtx 2016 and 1080 ti but i've set my maximum threshold based on what i can resell it for and kind of make a risk-free profit so that's how i calculate everything and the discipline is always there brothers but i hope you
