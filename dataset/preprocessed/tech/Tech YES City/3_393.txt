[Music] right here behind me we have a monitor from viewsonic this is the XG 270 qg and in this particular monitor they're using the LG 27-inch nano IPS panel now straight away before we start this video I'm gonna say this monitor right here and even yesterday's monitor that we took a look at and reviewed these are not really value for money plays by any sense and in fact my recommendation for a value for money higher-end monitor still stands with the Audi monitor I took a look at last year nothing is phenomenal value for money where if you were to convert it to USD pricing that thing was like 200 USD this thing behind me is 600 USD or in Australia it's around 1200 Aussie dollars so by any means it is not a cheap monitor but what you are getting is the latest and greatest panel in this particular case viewsonic have made it so it goes up to a hundred and sixty-five Hertz fire an overclock setting in the OSD though the most important things to me with any gaming monitor are two things input lag and response times if the manufacturer doesn't get these right then I don't recommend their monitors however the good news here with the viewsonic XG 270 qg is that it does have really good response times for an IPS panel and more on that now we'll go into depth with this because they've got three different settings they've got the old tro the high and then the standard or off setting and on the ultra setting this was really weird because we got four to five milliseconds response time and basically when we set it to high we then still got around four to five milliseconds I didn't really notice much of a difference between these two settings and they both provided a bit more overshoot or at least noticeable overshoot versus the standard setting which came in at roughly 5 milliseconds response time so you weren't gaining really anything in faster response times by turning on the to overdrive settings and in fact I thought you were getting a worse of picture to the point where I don't really see monitors come through here we're turning on overdrive is at a detriment but on this monitor in particular I would leave the overdrive setting off now as for the response times these are really good for an IPS panel especially one like this well we'll talk about the colors a little bit later but one thing I'm gonna point out or take straight away is this one milli second riding on the box they're saying 1 milliseconds response times this kind of stuff needs to go it's not a 1 milli second true response time on this panel as we saw with the testing here you're looking at 4 milliseconds of bests so I'd like to see them update the box just to reflect that just say 4 milliseconds this meaning of response times viewsonic have also included on this monitor ultra-low motion blur and in this case they're using a technology called black frame insertion the thousand FPS camera that we're using to analyze this does see it as a red frame and that's basically when the backlight of the monitor turns off in this case I analyzed it at roughly 5 milliseconds off time two point five milliseconds on time so you will roughly lose two-thirds of your brightness on this monitor in order to put this on and honestly this setting was I guess if you really want to put this on you can but you're going to be losing the refresh rate so you can only enable this with a hundred and twenty Hertz or lower and the problem here is is that again you're losing 25% of your maximum refresh rate on this monitor which I don't recommend and of course you're losing brightness through which in this case the brightness on this monitor wasn't that great to begin with it's around 360 CCD max and the white uniformity was pretty decent around 10% variance so that's normal on pretty much gaming monitors and then for the backlight bleed it was very good on this monitor though it does depend on the panel you get and I would recommend checking out your panel for any dead pixels or backlight bleed as soon as you get it keep in mind this is a review sample so I'm sure they do pick the best samples before they send them out to us though pulling up an orange background showed that there's no visible cross hatching at even 165 Hertz and I'd call the coating on this a semi-gloss coating more towards the matte side of things where I thought it was a little bit more matte than the Bank you that we took a look at yesterday and now we're looking at input lag on this particular panel it's pretty much some of the best I've seen and we look at the minimum time that we got here total system input delay so basically when I measure input lag I measure it from the click of a button to the time it takes to appear on the screen and we got here the lowest time 8 milliseconds the worst time 20 milliseconds averaging out at fourteen point six milliseconds total system input lag which I'd have to then calculate the monitor itself the input lag on this model will be between zero and ten milliseconds which is the best you can get though now going through the color accuracy of this monitor they do have an sRGB mode which is what we tested it with and the color accuracy out of the box was pretty off and it was also off in terms of contrast ratios so if you're buying this for the video editing you would definitely want to calibrate it before you did that and this is where I'm gonna critique this monitor a little bit because they've included I guess the shades sides here that block out light and that's more of a feature dedicated towards someone video editing or focusing on color accuracy but the fact that they don't have the color accuracy out of the box but they've added on these extras here kind of defeats the purpose and adds to the cost of the monitor they've also included a mouse bungee and also a keyboard cable bungee underneath or I guess it's just the left and right hand sides that was a nice addition as well as the headphone stand but the headphone stand on the side will be blocked out if you decide to put on the shades on the left hand side of the monitor so there were two confusing points of this monitor just like the ultra low motion blur setting though moving on to the stand and the build quality itself it's got a four-way adjustable so that's tilt horizontal and vertical swivel and also hide adjustment so very good stand that they've included and if you take it off you can also vase a mount this as well it's capable of doing that and then the bezel itself measures about 10 mil outside the picture you've got quick access buttons on the back as well as having a d-pad and you can quickly save and change your custom function keys which work really well in practice they've also got a six way color adjustable setting in the monitor itself so you can really get out different colors the way you want the black equalizer is a standard black equalizer I noticed it does give more of a gamma boost effect on this particular panel than other panels I've tested in the past there's also RGB on the left and right hand side underneath the monitor and then on the rear of the monitor too you can change this to different settings I just left it on color cycle aka the rainbow setting though this does add to the power consumption of this monitor where if you overclock it in the setting on the OSD and max brightness you're then using over 60 watts from the wall which is some of the highest I've seen in terms of power consumption on a 27-inch monitor so if you do overclock this monitor and you are coming into some problems you may wish to turn down the brightness setting I didn't come into any problems here but in the past I have come in two monitors we're turning the brightness down to say for instance from 100 to 80 has fixed it from turning off if it was overheating all the adapters just getting simply too hot the last thing to talk about before we move to a comparison is the Nvidia g-sync sticker slapped on the bottom left hand side of this monitor that means it has a native g-sync module included this ranges from 32 165 Hertz frame-by-frame adaptive framerate but what it does below that is it does what's called low framerate compensation so if you dip below 30 it will still pretty much cut the frames out to match the actual monitor refresh rate whether it be one frame for two or more refreshes and with all that out of the way it's time to talk about the XG 270 qg and give you guys a straight conclusion basically it is a monitor that hits all the marks in terms of what you would want for a high-end panel great colors and in fact I'd say the Reds really pop really well for a white LED backlit monitor in fact I compared this to my CCFL monitor upstairs and the Reds are good they're not as good as a CCFL backlit panel but they are really nice they're better than most white LED backlit monitors you'll find out there so whatever they've done on this monitor they've done a really good job of making the Reds come out more than I'm used to though comparing this to say yesterday's monitor the bank you which uses the inner locks IPS panel where as opposed to this one uses LG's nano IPS panel the response times are better on this monitor the colors in my opinion are better the input lag is just as good as the bank you in other words it's the best you can get for a gaming monitor at the moment though the price tag is substantially up there for this particular monitor 600 USD or 1200 ozzie dollars it is a big ask and you've got to know that you want the and you wanted that badly though for me personally I really did enjoy my time spent on this monitor and also kudos to the guy in the comment session who I shot down in the helicopter that was a that was a really cool play I really enjoyed that when I was testing this monitor with fortnight though all jokes aside we've got here a panel that is a premium option and if you've got the spare cash or if PC gaming is your absolute passion and you want one of the best monitors out there and you know you want this then it definitely is an option that will make you happy but that being said it's not a value for money play and I will restate that just like I restated in the intro at $1,200 dollars 600 USD you've really got to know that you've got the spare cash and you really want this monitor because it does have a premium and I do critique viewsonic for adding in these flappy sides and not getting the color profiles right for video editors and that's adding to the costs as well as the ultra-low motion blur that they added in I'd like to see them take away that stuff that didn't make any sense to me and reduce the cost of this monitor they've also included quickly interlude speakers on this monitor that sound like you know they put many men in the back ear monitor and they're just bashing tin so like I said in the bank you video yesterday they put in some really good speakers in that monitor so I'd like to see monitor companies include really good speakers or just not include them at all where I don't see myself using these speakers whatsoever it also needs a really good monitor but it's expensive and with that aside I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what you think of the viewsonic XG 270 QG love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of thoughts and opinions we've got the question of the day which comes from David Marin askew I mean I probably butchered that sorry about that but they asked I really want to buy a gaming PC but it's very expensive I'm 15 should I sell my ps3 and ps4 on which I have over 80 games and definitely you should be selling those ps3 and ps4 games and getting on PC it's the place to be but seriously pcs got amazing free-to-play games and there's a lot of games that go on sale that you just don't get those sales on the console so please switch over as soon as possible and with all that aside I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you've made it this far and you're enjoying the content you're not yet subbed and you know what to do and I'll see you next time peace out for now BAE [Music]
