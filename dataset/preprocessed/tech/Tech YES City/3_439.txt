it's been almost a good decade since Corsair have released an air cooler to the masses and the last air cooler they released was the a 50 and that had good performance it had a good price point though Corsair decided to go down the water cooling route until now and fast forward to 2020 sea yes Corsair have launched the a 500 and this is a massive 1.5 kilogram cooler with two 120 millimeter magnetic levitating fans on board which spin up to 2400 rpm though the biggest thing that's surprising me so far about this cooler is the fact that there's no RGB I mean Corsair is this some funny way of trolling us in the new decade I mean every time I think of Corsair I think RGB and I also think they've got the best ecosystem that controls RGB but that's not to worry because the most impressive thing about this cooler in particular compared to other coolers around this price point and this thing will be about a hundred USD and in Australia is gonna be about a hundred and forty AUD and I think they're shipping it on January 13th that what sets this aside against the D 15 and also the assassin 3 is quite simply the ace of installation it's got the ability to literally install this thing in a couple of minutes whether you're either on Intel or you're on AMD and you've also got an included screw driver which has the Corsair logo and you can just pop the top off and you don't have to remove any fans screw it down with two screws and you're good to go another thing too is if you've got RAM that's very tall then you can quite simply lift up the fan on either side depending on how you want to configure it and there's no more problems with Ram installation as opposed to the D 15 or deep cool solution you may come into some problems either mounting memory or mounting it into the top slot where the PCIe bracket might be too close to that said cooler especially if it's got a backplate so this thing compared to those models does have that ease of installation it is very straightforward and everything is well thought out that without aside we'll move on to the results now the most important part of any cooling comparison and we've testing here with a ninety nine hundred KS at 25 degrees C and B environments and what we can see here is I've ran two different tests and that's default speeds and also a hundred percent and for some reason the a500 decided to pretty much run a hundred percent on both tests so what you're going to see here is it's pretty much going to score similar in both these graphs but for what it's worth it was coming very close to the D 15 and also the assassin 3 from deep cool the H 115 IRG B platinum this thing was doing a bit better in both these tests and we're gonna stop this video right here and quickly interlude we're in the previous video I had some people saying air coolers beating water coolers and I've checked around a lot of different results out there and when I do see air coolers beating water coolers I've noticed in those graphs and I'm not gonna point out anyone in particular I've just noticed that those people have been using older water coolers they haven't been using sort of like the best of om water cooling because basically what I'm trying to say is the best water cooling is going to be more expensive but it should be better than the best air cooling mediocre water cooling however the best air cooling will most likely beat a mediocre water cooler go back to the results with the a500 although it was doing impressive on the temperatures the noise was getting pretty loud with this 9900 KS and now make no mistake about it this CPU puts out a lot of hate at five gigahertz but only around 180 watts direct power drill so all these air coolers in the graphs here today I'm pretty much getting stressed near their maximum potential so basically the 120 millimeter fans they're doing a great job of keeping up with the 140 millimeter fans used in all the other solutions here today but they are coming at a cost of higher noise so if you were getting the a 500 you had the option of pretty much coupling it with a CPU that uses lower power consumption say for instance 3700 X or an 8700 K and you would get lower noise as a result because the 900km it just pretty much runs out of control it's a hot running CPU that does use a lot of power so coupling them within a 500 it will work fine it's just it's going to make more noise than coupling it with other CPUs that use less power and don't run as hot anywhere results aside we're going to quickly go over the cooler itself it's got four of the biggest heat pipes I have ever seen in my life not only do they perform really well but they look really awesome too the thing about the fans is - you've also got the ability to take the mounts off and change them over to RGB fans if you wish to so there is flexibility in that regard you can also take off and put on the top cover with ease if you want to leave that off it will be slight detriment to performance as the air flow will then be disrupted in this particular a 500 cooler the speaking of support it comes in the flavor of LGA 1150 X LGA 2011 and also a m4 but there isn't support for t r4 or STR 40 X and that's AMD's X 399 or their latest TRX 40 motherboards and the last thing you get included with this cooler before wrapping up this review is courses own x TM 50 thermal paste which already comes pre applied to the cooler for what course si is maximized efficiency covering pretty much all dies out there whether it's an AM for CPU or an Intel CPU we found in the test here today changing the thermal paste made absolutely no difference so Corsair are doing a really good job of pre applying that thermal paste out of the box and with all that out of the way the a500 is it worthy of your money or not that is the big question I'm going to throw in my opinions right now and coming in at 100 USD and 140 AUD this thing is really well designed and the performance is really good and the best thing that differs this versus the D 15 for example or the assassin three would simply be its ease of use and installation and so it does have its drawbacks where it's gonna have higher noise as we saw here today with something like a 9900 KS but it's also got the benefit of just having ease of installation and you just take this thing out of the box it'll only take you a few minutes to set up and even after that you can then change over the fans in terms of their orientation or you can raise and lower them to fit your ram with ease and the best thing is you don't have to take off the fans when installing it could you just take off that cover quickly screw it down and you're good to go which makes it really good for beginners who want to get a really high performance air cooler and not have any frustrations when it comes to installing deep cool solution and also the d15 they both have a lot more hassles than this thing right here sort of the a500 from Corsair gets a recommendation from me though last I'm going to talk about air cooling versus water cooling because in all my rigs here I use water cooling and they're generally corsair water coolers I do like their RGB Platinum Series it's got the bling it's got the performance but of course it does carry the higher price tag and that's one risk as well that you've got to remember with water coolers something I don't talk about a whole lot is they do carry risk where if the pump breaks down or it leaks you could destroy other components in your build as well as the fact that you could damage your CPU if the thermal tripping on that CPU doesn't switch off in time before damage is done to the CPU the only problem with air coolers generally over time is that the fan may fail and you're usually going to have an indication that the fans failing in the form of you'll physically see that it's slowing down and especially since we've got two fans you'll see that one of them is performing a little bit worse than the other and it may be making some really off noise so in that case you can just replace the fan and you're pretty much good to go again and with all that out of the way if you guys enjoy today's video then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comments section below what do you think of course as new a 500 behemoths air cooler I'm really surprised that they're not putting RGB on this thing that's to me that was like a shock to the system that I love reading your thoughts and opinions and speaking of those opinions we've got the question of the day from asdasd and they asked do blue light really make you feel worse in any way and the answer this is it depends on how your expose to the blue light for instance the reason I started studying years ago blue light in death was because I was living and I just for some reason I decided to get this low light blue light in my sleeping room and when I had it on the weeks that followed off of that were really bad I noticed my vision was getting bit blurry especially in the mornings I even got to the stage where I had black spots in the middle of my vision and I knew something was seriously wrong then and then I took that light out and I started researching and yeah you definitely want your eyes to see detail through either green or red and not blue and I was gonna say if you don't believe me you can go do the test that I did but disclaimer it's your health and I wouldn't recommend it yeah those days were a lot of waking up for me personally and yes blue light is bad for you if you are seeing detail through that spectrum of light blue lights intended to produce melatonin or at least trigger the part of your body that produces melatonin and if that aside I'll catch you guys in and another tech video very soon peace out for now and also if you stayed this bar and you're enjoying the tech content as well as the random questions of the day and the
