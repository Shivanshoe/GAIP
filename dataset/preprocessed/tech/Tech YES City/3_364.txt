lately something has been going on and that is when I'm looking for new cases or power suppliers and even graphics cards I can't find anything for sale at least at reasonable prices and this is one thing wherever you are in the world you might be having a similar problem whether you're buying a PC or you're selling one so in today's video we have an option for you an effective option aka a metal and that is if you find an old case like this which has no panels on it but you might be lucky to still have the power switch on it or your motherboard has a power switch on board then you can do what is called an open-air gaming PC now the most interesting thing about this concept is that I've already put it to the test I've already sold an open-air gaming PC before the one I'm going to build up here today and it worked extremely well since there's not a whole lot of gaming pcs out there and the ones that usually are available at the moment compare nowhere near the value for money you were getting over three months ago this here is an option worth considering where of course you're gonna find a case like this that's been thrown out and it's going to generally cost zero dollars first buying a new case which could cost $100 plus and we're going to be saving money too because we're using use price performance so let's quickly see what we've got here on the desk apply some techies loving and see what we can come up with [Music] used used used used used used used new that's right the RGB cooler going on this whole bill which is going to actually be the centerpiece of this building we'll find out later is the only new product in today's build so I'll put the tally of how much this whole thing cost to put together but what we've got right here is a system with 16 gigabytes of ddr3 memory we've got an i7 3770 on a p65 m azuz Pro now I did have to update the BIOS on this motherboard which was quick and easy since it generally won't support these 37 70s which are Ivy Bridge CPUs and this one originally only supported Sandy Bridge but when you update the BIOS it will support the later third gen chips now this bounce play here completely overdone HX 1,000 watt it's actually a really good power supply back in the day and still is a really good power supply to this date we've also got a white exhaust fan which is gonna add a little bit of extra spice to the build then we've got a GTX 970 now I picked this up recently for a hundred and fifty Aussie dollars and even though it's a bit above asking price of what I'm used to getting them for it still is in these weird times still a decent Buy and then of course we've got a one terabyte hard drive since the prices and availability of 123 bite SSDs at the moment have gone through the roof we're just gonna skip the SSD altogether now the i7 3770 you may be wondering is this thing gonna be good enough it's actually gonna pair very well with the GTX 970 at least from what I think though this here is gonna be the star of the show I picked this up for 15 Ozzie dollars but you probably see right here that this case still has a lot of dirt and grime in it so there's only one thing we can do from here in with this case and that is give it some tech yes lovin and that is when we clean this thing from tip to toe and bring it up looking better then brand new [Music] so we've just finished cleaning up the open air case and there was one thing I've never seen before when our cleaning pcs and that's like the ability to make charcoal so this this has it this can do it guys [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and now here is the final product this is the open-air gaming pcs straight away like my voice the noise this thing has actually got some really low noise components in it all surprised because those CPU coolers can't get a little bit noisy but this one seems to be doing just fine now speaking of that CPU cooler when we installed it just here we did have a little problem with the clip and you can even see this just now the left-hand Ram stick is still ever so slightly bent right so to install this we had to take that Ram stick out put the cooler on and then put the RAM stick back in or should I say RAM it in and then at the front here we're actually using a reset switch because that's the only switch on board and the motherboard doesn't have any onboard power reset switches itself now in the past I have used the reset switch instead of the power switch because it's been faulty and so it's perfectly fine to do this and of course the power switch is the most important switch other than any motherboard connectors that you will need to get your system working though besides that cable management was a breeze mainly because this is a semi modular power supply so we just removed all the clutter and of course since we didn't have any panels in the way and it is a pretty spacious case putting this thing together was super easy another thing is true most of these big like thousand watt power supplies won't fit in standard ATX cases so in this particular case right here is absolutely fine mainly because it's open air gaming but speaking of open air gaming we're just installing Windows now then we're gonna start running some benchmarks and see what we can get out of this whole setup [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and we finished up now tuning this PC testing it and benchmarking it and I am thoroughly impressed with what we've got here on the table I was surprised actually also by this $15 cooler which gave us temperatures while gaming in warzone under 70 degrees most of the time and same with the GPU that went under 70 degrees most the time and we did overclock that just a little bit now in warzone itself we got around about a hundred average fps and the 17.1% lows were phenomenal this was a really smooth experience keep in mind we did set it up medium settings because I think if you go with high settings with four gigabytes of vram in this game you might come into some troubles especially with stuttering and whatnot but for what it's worth the picture looked really good at 1080p then you may have noticed what the b-roll we did test out the original doom but there is a whole massive modding community behind it and it was actually funny because someone who came and picked up a PC of us wanted to run this test with everything maxed out to see if it would run smoothly and so I learnt how to I use that game and stress test it where we were getting only a hundred and ten FPS on a game that old to get 110 FPS is not that impressive in 2020 so essentially what we did with this game was we double the resolution scale maxed all these settings and the GPU was getting quite stressed and we could even run the og doom in Vulcan which was surprising so that's a really cool test if you guys want me to maybe look at rate racing with the og doom that would be another cool video in itself though here's the scary thing about this PC right here I've already sold this someone's already coming to pick it up later tonight where I'm at so that's just how much demand there is for a gaming PC right now and what this solution can give you is another possibility another way to not overpay for a gaming PC right now if you're in the market to get something that can play games smoothly and you can pick up all the used parts you may wish to just consider going with an open-air case as we saw here the temperatures are absolutely fine the noise will also be absolutely fine considering you get a power supply graphics card CPU cooler and also exhaust fan that don't really make a whole lot of noise to begin with so that's always one of the most important things with building a gaming PC make sure your components are good from the get-go so ultimately something like this is definitely an option to consider where you care about price performance and the funny thing is I picked up pretty much all these components recently during these weird conditions so that's one thing to keep in mind just go look through some good deals and also if you are willing to compromise on in my opinion some of the things that don't matter a whole lot then you can get even better price performance now of course there are some negatives to an open air case that is just by looking at it you've got no panels so if you've got animals or you've got things or something that can drop stuff in the case or spill liquids or anything like that then you definitely may wish to get some side panels for your open air gaming testbed but still the fact that we've got a case that was otherwise would have got chucked in the bin and we've reutilized that and made something out of it really just brings me back to the old tech yes City and that is what it's all about here at Tech yes City just getting that raw price performance for the dollar I even did a build a few months ago if you're in a remote area of the world where we just built a PC on a box and that worked out extremely well - I'll put the link to that video up there but if you guys enjoyed this video then be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comment section below what you think of an open-air gaming PC do you think it's a new metal or don't you like it love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from jquan deluxe and they asked which lipstick brand works best as thermal paste and they're ultimately referring to the video that we did previously where I kind of just I don't know what happened with the color correction there I am my monitor is flat so essentially I edit with a flat monitor but I watched it on my friend smartphone and yeah it did look like I had some lipstick on and that's just that's just what happens with YouTube sometimes but in terms of what brand works best I don't know I think maybe Maybelline would work well but I put it to the test for you guys and without a slide if you're enjoying this content and you stayed this fine you want to see it the moment it drops then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
