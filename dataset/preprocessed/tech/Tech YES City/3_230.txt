as you would have it there is graphics cards on the high end being launched everywhere in the last half of 2020 now whether you can buy one of these cards is still up for debate where the rtx 3080 is still in hot demand and from my sources, if you wanted to go buy one of these off the shelf you could be expecting uh sometime until february (2021) until they're readily available where the pre-orders are through the roof and the 6800 xt i'm hearing has the same dilemma. Now we've got the RX 6900 xt here coming in with an MSRP of 999 usd so it is 350 more than the 6800xt and it has the same vram configuration 16 gigabytes versus 16 gigabytes at the back of the card you've got hdmi 2.1 two display out usbc and you've still got the same cooler with the same weight and the same fan sizes however what do the benchmarks state do they state that this card is going to give you 350 worth more of performance let's roll those numbers for you guys and then get back to the table here [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and as the amd 6900xts and the rtx 3090s would have it these premium gpus aren't giving you that value for money at all now in the case of the rtx 3090 i said in that review that was just for someone who has too much money and they wanted the best performance on the nvidia camp this right here with the 6900 xt i feel is pretty much the same argument except it's even worse in the state that you don't get anything more over the 6800 xt except more stream processors and that's one thing for me personally that i was like okay where is the value differentiation here between the 6800 x10 and 6900 xt because more stream processors especially when we looked at the 4k numbers we were still being limited uh so much by the gddr6 and that was showing where the 6800xt was actually catching up to the 6900 xt at that 4k resolution so i really think the value proposition here on this card just isn't there where i stated before these amd cards were released i was iron off the 6800 xt and now after today's review i'm still lying off the 6800 xt as being the king of their three cards it simply offers that value in that high-end segment and it's the same thing for the 3080 on nvidia's side of the camp where you are getting a very solid card capable of 4k true 120 hertz gaming however that's it i do see the appeal of cards like the 6900xt and of course the 3090. there's people out there who earn good money so some people have cash to burn and they're like look brian i want the best and i like amd i want the best from amd and what they've got to offer and that's where this card is giving out the best numbers on the amd side of the camp and it beats the 3090 in a lot of titles at 1080p and 1440p however the 4k does see the 3090 win overall where that's got of course the gddr6x so they are trading blows and it is good to see and as i said in the 6800xt and the 6800 review it is good to see amd competing on the high end again with nvidia and the good thing about this card is we'll go over the power consumption numbers here where if you want to undervolt this card you're going to get some big power efficiency gains where we went down nearly 100 watts and in turn this is going to decrease the temperatures and the noise levels of your card now in terms of overclocking we were limited by the v bios here and in the radeon software i was limited at the out of the box millivoltage setting i couldn't go any higher and so my overclocks were pretty limited where i'll pull up a graph of the overclocking numbers here just to show that it really in my opinion isn't really worth overclocking especially since it did crash out even though i'm showing this number up here when i was running tom clancy's the division two the whole system just shut off and so that's one thing about this card right here is that you do want to keep it under control and the best thing for the 3080s the 3090s the 6800 xt the 6900xt in my opinion is a healthy undervolt especially if you're like me and you're living in hotter ambient climates than a lot of other people where i'm at the moment it's 27 degrees in here perfectly comfortable with it but some people might not like that but and the card might not like it either but it's a good thing if you undervolt then you can account for that and of course help out the environment in the process brian get back to the video stop talking about the environment okay i hear you loud and clear let's pull up the fan noises the fan speeds and the temperatures where i've dealt or adjusted these for you guys and we see here that temperatures and the noise levels are coming in pretty similar to that of the 6800 xt and if you're gaming for long periods of time and you don't like too much noise like me i'd suggest leaving to out-of-the-box settings or manually overclocking it to 60 though the smart access memory we finally got around to testing this properly where we did test it in the 6800 review but i wanted to go a little bit more in depth where i did it on shadow of the tomb raider and to lock this setting in all you have to do is get the bios that supports smart access memory and then change to settings it's essentially the pci rebar size feature and you enable that with above 4g decoding and you're now got smart access memory enabled by default now when we jumped into shadow of the tomb raider we did see a slight increase at 1440p 4k we virtually saw no increase at all however moving over to world of warcraft which is a game that amd states that there's some big gains to be had here in the fps they were stating on their website 11 when i tested this we were pretty much calling 4k even max settings on this game we were struggling to really notice a difference here where the game was already pretty much capped at 200 fps of course raids raids and mass players all around a map might change this but one thing i did notice when playing with smart access memory on was that we did see more stuttering and it was noticeable so even though the results here that i'm showing you guys with the smart access memory turned on shows an increase in performance i feel like if you're going to use this in multiplayer games especially if you're playing for money and you're in clutch plays then this could be a feature that you may wish to disable just for this point in time especially when we come back to it in a few months and see if it's been perfected because i was noticing some stuttering at this point in time and so when i notice stuttering i generally don't recommend putting on those settings so with smart access memory feel free to turn it on but do tread lightly as we did have another issue with it and that was when we turned the computer on after turning it off and just double checking some numbers we were met with the cpu zero zero error code and so the only way we got our system working again was to hard bios flash with by our flashback the x570 motherboard phantom gaming x that we were using here so your mileage may vary with smart access memory again we'll come back to it in a few months when it's polished but moving on with some really good news and that is if you're a oled gamer there is now 10 bit support in the latest driver and that's a full rgb spectrum too and with all those numbers out of the way 6900 xt should you buy it and my opinion is if you like value for money and there's a reason why there's all these cards on the table here on nvidia's side we've got the 3060 ti and the rtx 3080 they're my two picks i thought they were the best that nvidia's got to offer in 2020 and then we've got the 6800 xt from amd that's their shining star these are my three picks for graphics cards in 2020 that's so far been released i think these cards offer good value for money they're going to give you a great gaming experience and you can do so much with them if you're a gamer 4k gaming option you've got the choice there 6800 xt and also the rtx 3080 they're both phenomenal cards for 4k gaming 360 ti i'd love to see amd provide an answer to that 400 price point rx 5800 if you can afford the extra over the 360 ti then it's going to give you the extra but again it's 70 cheaper than the 6800 xt so if you've got that money i'd suggest going with the jump to the 6800 xt and getting that extra performance where i feel like it's well justified in this price category so there it is with the 6900 xt if you were to release this a year ago it would have been the best thing out there on the market but time is everything in this world and what we've seen here is these three guys right here up the front they're winning the race against these two guys and also the 30 90 which i didn't even put on the table because it's 1500 usd so you got a thousand usd if you want the baller option from amd but it's not the value play but before closing out i will state one thing about the 6900 xt and that is those modern warfare numbers this was really kicking it hard at 1080p and 1440p so if you're a competitive gamer but you want to max the settings in these games maybe it might give you an advantage or doesn't give you an advantage i don't know i'm not a pro at modern warfare this was giving that upper echelon of performance at those two resolutions 4k the 3090 was beating it but 1440p and 1080p was giving some very hard numbers in that title so if you guys are into modern warfare playing competitively this is going to give that real big boost in that title and i hope you guys enjoyed today's review if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comment section below what you think of the 6900xt and if you have any questions about today's review drop a comment down below and i'll get back to you as soon as i can and with that aside we've got the question of the day here which comes from jedi slayer and they ask question how much is your electric bill and my electric bill is about 400 aussie every three months we do use up a lot of electricity here in the studio especially we've got three rigs running uh doing benchmarks we've got a benchmark rig editing rig another rig so there is a lot of testing going on the one thing about australia is our power is pretty expensive here we're paying over 20 cents a kilowatt hour which isn't cheap but i do have solar power to counteract that i guess this whole tech stuff and we got all the lighting too we got 60 watt led light we got more lights it all adds up and now i'm using two oleds as well to edit videos on so there's that uh talking about power and mining the 6900xt just like the 6800 and the 6800xt they're not value for money mining plays so that's some good news for the gaming community out there and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now [Music] [Music]
