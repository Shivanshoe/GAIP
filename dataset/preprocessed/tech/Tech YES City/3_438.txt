here on the desk we've got a PC that has come back to the tech yes to do two years later so the person who bought this it was an X 56 75 system I believe now they're saying that it turns on but it doesn't give out a signal to the monitor anymore and that basically could be a number of issues starting from the GPU could be a gravis car that's just had enough or it could be just a faulty stick of memory or even simply yet it could just be something simple as reseeding the memory or resetting the CMOS so today we're going to go through some of these steps and see what is wrong with this computer the first things first they said that they thought it was the power supply and basically I'm doubting it is the power supply because we're using AV 750 from Coolermaster this is I believe a goal greater powers play it's got more than enough power and it's actually a very high quality power supply so basically if a power supply is giving out power to a computer usually most of the time that's not going to be the problem I mean sometimes if a power supply doesn't have enough juice in that see for instance you're using a real crap power supply it's only like a 200 watt and you've got say for instance an Rx 580 or selling a higher power then sometimes that can be the issue and it won't even display a signal so it doesn't have enough power you can however in extremely rare circumstances I've only actually ever had this happen once in the history of the channel have a power supply that still works but it is faulty but usually in this case or at least in the experience that I had with this faulty power supply it still gave out a signal so the fact that this isn't giving out a signal and we're using a really good power supply makes me doubt that it actually is the power play so with that aside let's try and boot this thing up and see what is wrong with it [Music] [Music] [Music] so we've now booted up the PC after resetting the CMOS where we just take the battery out when the powers completely off make sure there's no power still on the motherboard and then putting that battery back in after about 30 seconds and then booting it up and what we see now is that the computer is booting up absolutely fine the twelve gigabytes of ddr3 memory is being recognized too so we don't even have to reseat the memory because there's essentially nothing wrong with this PC except this right here and you may notice that that fan is not spinning at all and that essentially still has the LED light working which means this power going to the fan still it's just the blade is not spinning properly and what we can actually do right now is move the blade and we can hear there is a noise so it appears like the fan is either got a bad bearing in it something's gone and that may cause it to stop working of course mechanically it could just be a fail fan as well and then it just no longer works and what this could have done essentially is made the CPU overheat and then that could have caused the system not to boot properly in that it wouldn't switch back on and they thought oh my god my system is no longer working properly something's wrong so what we're gonna do now is replace this failed fan where it's actually funny because the middle fan still works absolutely fine and you can hear that and that's breathing air through the cooler but we're going to replace this front fan and it'll say give it a clean up and then see if there's any more problems with this PC [Music] and that's alright Gilani's this a PCB gas on some talk yes lovin [Music] so now booted up the computer everything appears to be running fine except the computer is extremely sluggish and that I'm gonna guess now before we go into anything that is that there's two factors involved first off there's no SSD in this computer and two years ago SSDs when I sold this SSDs was still pretty expensive so adding that into a budget build would have increased costs but the second thing is I'm going to guarantee you that this hard drive in this system is practically full and we'll talk about what that does to make a computer extremely sluggish so that is we've got to open up the actual folder first and see how long it takes to open up and just to check that it's full [Music] what we've got right here is a one terabyte hard drive similar to what's in the system at the moment and now it's only got about three percent free storage left in that there's twenty eight gigabytes available off the one terabyte and now basically with a hard drive and even an SSD for that matter you generally want to have around at least ten percent of that storage drive free especially if it is the operating system drive aka C Drive and the reason for this is simply Windows 10 and Windows 7 for that matter they use virtual memory and also have temporary files and so if there's no free space what it then does is it fights to find partially free blocks and so Windows uses that free memory especially after the RAM is utilized on a system however if there's not enough free space available it then struggles to find these free sectors and it starts juggling around the disk looking for partially empty storage and so this creates a very difficult problem especially on a hard drive which is slower by nature than an SSD so one thing we can try on this hard drive is to defragment the hard drive now you generally don't want to do this on an SSD however on a hard drive what can happen especially since these storages go to one terabyte and larger usually is that what Windows will do is especially as the drive fills up is a little fragment files over each of the different sectors and so the more files that are stored and also fragmented it then size to start bouncing around trying to find especially for instance the system reserve files which then adds another layer on top which makes the whole system is just really sluggish so what we're gonna do right now is most likely deep fragment the drive if that doesn't help whatsoever then we're going to install an SSD because I don't want to start deleting files on someone else's drive especially if they've got important information so I'd rather just add an SSD on top and then they can format the computer afterwards the way they like [Music] and now we're back after the defrag this actually took a couple of hours believe it or not and what we're gonna do now is take off the desktop icons yeah just view right-click view take them away and we're gonna restart the PC just to see if it has improved these snappiness at all so if it has then I can just say to the person look basically what we need to do is we need to clear up some space on your hard drive but I'm still going to heavily suggest putting an SSD in this thing just to at least when I'm fixing this thing I'm now have my sanity in check [Music] yeah it it needs an SSD [Music] [Music] [Music] so we've just finished installing the SSD and this is just one of those night and day differences this thing feels like it's gone from a 2005 or earlier millennia PC to now a PC that is modern day 2020 though one thing we're doing right now is we are testing out CPU and GPU temperatures just to see if I need to update and change the thermal paste and it's looking with the CPU that's absolutely fine we're we're averaging out around 55 degrees on the cores with a maximum going into the 60s and this is in like a 30 degree ambient environment here so it is really hot though the GPU is creeping up towards 80 degrees so it looks like we're gonna have to change the thermal paste on the GPU but not the CPU and you probably thing where you should just change them both but speaking of wastes if you guys don't want to waste any more money than you have to on a Windows 10 per single end-user license then today's video sponsor SCD Keys has you covered for as little as 13 USD using the coupon code TYC sk with the link below you can snag

that in click change product key activate and you're now good to go with no watermark in the bottom right-hand corner of your screen no longer [Music] and with all that out of the way we've now got a PC that's running like brand-new that I get to return to the person and I'm pretty sure they're going to be pretty stoked because the performance is still really good as we saw that heaven benchmark though the GPU temperatures we got roughly a three degree drop so the ambience are pretty hot and there's a GTX 780 OC Edition so it's gonna run hot by Nature though everything else aside the SSD made a huge difference to this PC even though initially their problems were just a simple reset of the CMOS battery there was some other problems to go through after this problem that I experienced a lot with people buying pcs and the most common issue by far is on the back of the motherboard people plugging their monitor and via the motherboard display outs versus the GPU I get this question literally like one in every two or three builds so I'm gonna be like oh my god I got this PC home and there's no signal I'll be like I'll just show them a picture and I'll just say make sure it's plugged off the bottom slots not the top slots and then I get a reply later thank you so much it's working now and that's the most common problem by far even though the problem we saw here is actually probably the second most common problem I do get where the PC doesn't boot up and it just needs a simple reset or of course on top of that one thing I didn't say earlier is reseeding the memory that's actually one thing that does work quite a lot as well and racing in the memory can also not only make the computer work fine again but it can also bring back memory that is missing so say for instance someone will say oh like I have 16 gigabytes of RAM when I bought the PC but now it's only showing 8 gigabytes of RAM simply resetting the memory a lot of the times will fix this problem of course you can have faulty parts and that will come up as well and the good thing was the owner of this build has taken good care of it and you can see that when I was cleaning it out that everything was relatively clean before I even gave it just quick tech yes loving but one thing to note was that fan inside that was dead as well one of the fans so it is important today I guess maybe every few months just even just take a quick look and make sure your systems running properly and that means just checking the fans as well because even though this fan here died another common problem is fans can actually sort of semi die in that they slow down and they're not working at their full capacity and I have seen this quite a bit on graphics cards as well where you'll see one of the fans spinning full ball and the other fan will just spin like it half the capacity so but I thought by taking this PC through the paces here today I'd show you guys that a lot of the times it's actually a lot more simpler to fix up a PC and get it running to a hundred percent then it is with the other ultimatum where you have faulty parts and you've got to replace things and trust me when I say this the motherboard if you have a faulty motherboard that one's a big pains you're gonna pull everything out and then change the motherboard over and put everything back together it actually takes longer than building a new PC but do let us know in the comment section below what are some of the problems you guys come into when you're dealing with pcs are your problems usually as simple as mine or are they more complex love reading those thoughts and opinions as always but speaking of thoughts and opinions we've got the question of the day which comes from the being Divi 2000 and they asked why not vacuum instead of blower so he's referring to wanna use a vacuum cleaner instead of using the blower that we used even in today's video I have only ever used it to clean my tech with no issues blowers only make a mess of it basically the blower at least the data vac that we've been using for quite a while here is a really good tool I prefer it over vacuum cleaners any day of the week and the reason being is just has so much more power when it comes to just getting dust out of difficult places if I used a vacuum cleaner or tape me a lot longer and I just wouldn't clean out anywhere near the amount of dust that I'm getting out with the data vac especially when it comes to things like power supplies and really getting in there and getting out all the nitty gritty so the data vac although it is pretty expensive and honestly I wouldn't recommend it if you've only just got one PC because you return on investments going to be terrible though if you are that guy in town that everybody goes to or if you're building a lot of PC's overtime then the data VAX definitely gonna pay itself off pretty quickly not only just saving your time but getting a product really clean really quickly so hopefully that answers your question be divi and if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button for us and also if you stayed this far and you're enjoying the content and
