the rx 6500 xt has been launched and it is going down as one of if not the worst gpu launch in history and it's ironic that it comes at a time where intel amd and nvidia are entering into a whole new economic environment that they have never seen in pc gaming before and so with that i believe the potential for these companies to make mistakes is huge as evidenced with what amd have done with the 6500 xt however in hindsight amd will really have to take a step back after this launch and perhaps look from the likes of an auto manufacturer like toyota to see how to conduct business going forward so let's discuss all things rx 6500 xt right after this sponsor spot are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2. links in description below welcome back to tech yes city and let's start off with the problem and that is the rx 6500 xt's price point and i'm going to point out the price point because here is where in australia this card is coming in at msrp and it's been in stock for a few days now i have not seen this on a graphics card in over a year that's been launched and then we've got in america this card is in stock even though the retailers are jacking up the price a bit it seems versus the msrp however you can be rest assured that the longer these cards sit on the shelves for the sooner they'll come down in price so we've got a card that not only has been received by the press poorly and even then the press at least in australia there was only one sample uh seated to the press in australia so i've actually bought one of these to include it in the upcoming rtx 3050 review but i'll be doing a separate review a little bit later on this card but most importantly it has been received by the consumer as being exceptionally poor value for money even at its current shelf price now one thing i will get out of the way is this card is in my opinion absolute proof that crypto miners have been buying up the majority of graphics cards where this card is just simply not even going to mine ethereum and it can mine these alt coins which are actually crashing and giving out such little profitability that it's not worth miners to buy this card even at these current prices and so that then leaves the brunt of this card and its price to the gamer and the gamers as we said before really aren't taking too much of a liking to this gpu though looking at the card simply the biggest problem here is the price amd have launched this card at 200 usd with four gigabytes of vram in 2022. and look i'll be the first to admit inflation is a problem however how companies delve into that inflationary environment and what they do for the consumer is ultimately going to spell the biggest winners and losers especially in tech in years to come and amd will definitely take a step back after this launch and realize what went wrong and so as we've said in the past there is a thing known as the misery index and so that is the sum of inflation plus unemployment and the higher the true values of these go together the more miserable the average member of that society will become and this has been proven especially during a previous period the 1970s and now in the 1970s there was a high inflationary environment and it was marked as the decade of stagflation where finally they were able to bring things under control however here's where the problem starts for amd and also intel and nvidia if they want to follow amd's footsteps and that is the problem is these companies like amd and video and intel have not been making products for pc gamers during a high inflationary environment in other words they don't know how to weather the storm and i'm pretty sure 99.9 of human beings on the earth do not know how to weather this storm and that is what a company should do in this inflationary environment since amd and nvidia and intel do not have experience with selling pc gaming parts during this period however as we said in the intro there is one company that has gone through this even though it's in a different sector and they have emerged a victor not only during the 1970s but they also emerged victorious now even to this date and that is toy odor and they are the number one manufacturer globally for car sales and they're simple they've built up brand loyalty and a good reputation for instance if i'm looking for good value in a car that is not going to break down i'm just going to go out and buy a toyota and the reason being is because from my past experience i've never had a toyota that's broken down in fact the thing just keeps going even when i don't service the car so that's left a really good imprint on me as well as the fact that i paid pretty good market rate for that car compared to what else was available on the market and on top of that i'm also going to recommend to my friends go buy a toyota if you want a reliable car that's good value and so circling back to the rx 6500 xt we're going to focus on one of those points that we talked about before value and in my opinion it's value that creates the second point that we talked about brand loyalty and so here's where we're looking at the value of this card 200 us dollars four gigabytes of vram worse performance than previous cards that they've released at the same price point but not only on top of that they're also giving you less features not even including a video encoder so you can't record your gameplay and on top of all that only having 4x4 pcie 4.0 lanes meaning if you put it on a pci 3.0 slot or even a 2.0 slot from some of those good used bargains like x58 you'll be met with even poorer performance making this card an absolute slouch so even factoring in inflation i think this card wouldn't have been so poorly perceived if it came in at say 150 us dollars and in fact with amd they should have done the opposite and here is why they should have done the opposite they should have brought this card out at around i believe 140 possibly even 130 usd and you may be thinking why is this well it gets back to that brand loyalty so at 200 us dollars amd has clearly gone the opposite direction and said look we want to get the highest profit margins on the gravis cards whether it's the low end or the high end and so they've really let that profit-taking mentality sink to the low end of the market which should never really be a focus of the low end the low end should be to build brand loyalty for a company and here's where amd i believe has not only failed but catastrophically failed hard so now if we couple in that much higher price that is much poorer value and combine it with the higher misery index that is people are much more miserable right now at this point in time than they were the previous gpu launches we've got combined together a recipe for disaster and that is exactly what we're seeing with the pr department and amd at this point in time they're dealing with a nightmare coupled on with the fact that they are flip-flopping now and they're deleting posts off their website and then years later they're launching a graphics card with four gigabytes for the gamers it is just ultimately not a good look for brand loyalty if anything you should be doing the same as you've always done that is possibly a hundred and fifty dollar price point gpu usd but i think you should have done the opposite and so that is where in these times you can give the fair value that you've always given with the graphics cards and that'll keep business as usual or you can go the opposite direction and offer the consumer better value for money therefore linking together better brand loyalty and in turn just like toyota's showing that will pay off in the long run so economically hopefully this makes sense of the situation that amd's in at the moment and going forward they are going to be forced by the customer that's you and me to definitely bring down prices and offer better value as events like these will not only be a wake-up call for the consumer but ultimately a wake-up call for amd in that they can't get away with this kind of behavior and as i've said here for years at tech yes city do not give these companies your blind loyalty always judge them on the product they're giving you at a certain price if toyota was to release a product on the market there was terrible value then that would tarnish their brand loyalty and they know that so it's very important for these companies to get the price point right especially given the economic environment which right now is bad but i think it's going to getting worse so the companies that want to survive will have to offer the best value anyway guys hope that explains the problem that amd's facing right now and you can best be assured that prices will be getting better if this is the kind of events that companies like amd will try to pull on the consumer and it's not going to get any better for them they are going to have to rethink what they're going to do i've just simply offered them some advice on what to do because again as toyota's showing when you take care of the consumer you're taking care of yourself anyway guys i hope you enjoyed today's video at what went wrong at amd the gpu and marketing division hopefully they take a step back and learn from this as it's really not good press for them to be getting these kinds of reviews but ultimately the consumer at the end of the day will always decide with their wallets now unfortunately previously with gravis cards part of that consumer base has been crypto miners but as the price of ethereum goes down and also the difficulty goes up especially with the introduction of asic miners and also the potential for ethereum to move to proof of stake a lot of miners are getting nervous and they're probably not going to be buying as many gpus as previous and there may even be a lot of miners starting to preemptively sell their graphics cards so i do expect graphics cards to come down in the near future if you want to know more about this i made a dedicated video talking about all the other factors involved i'll put the link up here for you guys and with that aside we've got the question of the day and this comes from penny pancakes and they ask are you going to give it some tech yes love and crackalackin and this is in relation to me putting up a post on the community tab talking about me not getting a sample and also purchasing an rx 6500 xt just to give you guys a review but more importantly give the numbers for the 6500 xt in relation to the upcoming rtx 3050 where i think nvidia are a lot more confident in their product than amd is with the 6500 xt launch but to answer that question directly it doesn't matter what pc part it is you can bet your bottom dollar then i'm going to be giving that part some tech yes lovin crack-a-lackin and i hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you've stayed this far and you want to see that tech yes content as soon as it drops then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell also if you want to get some behind the scenes access where i do some vlogs just talking about things that i'm doing personally in the market last month we did talk about a lot of economic indicators in some of these vlogs as to why i think the gpu prices were going to drop i'll put a link down in the description below for you guys and with that aside i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] we are going to ask [Music]
