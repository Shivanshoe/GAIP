if you are looking to build a gaming pc anywhere in the world and you want some really good price performance then this pc right here sitting on a box may be the best option for you so today we're going to show you how you can build this thing and see what fps it can get in cyberpunk 2077 and also fortnite. i got some good news and bad news and that is with this build right here i actually ordered an atx case but the seller pretty much duped me in that they gave me the tracking number for the case and they sent it to someone else so you do have to be  aware of this, I guess potential scam going on and so therefore today's video we're going to be again building this all the aliexpress gaming pc on a box now one thing about the graphics cards they have gone up in price pretty much all over the world graphics cards for some reason especially under that 300 price point they're all in relatively high demand however we can see that the four gigabyte versions of the rx 580 for example and rx 570 aren't too bad in terms of price point and that's because the cryptocurrency ethereum miners don't want this card so in today's build we're going to go with a colorful a320 motherboard now i've tested this out and it actually represents decent value especially for being shipped worldwide then we're going to go with a 480GB ssd from king fast for memory we've got 16GB of gloway and then for the cpu we're using none other than the ryzen 5 2600 also some other important things is the cpu cooler is the dark flash this thing's going to bring a bit of bling as well as give a down draft towards the motherboard to hopefully keep the vrm a little bit cooler since we are using the six core 12 thread on an a320 then the last piece of the puzzle is the warrior ak-600 from igo this is a 600 watt power supply with a bit rgb bling on it and then we're going to see if this thing can play cyberpunk 2077 on a budget let's do this [Music] [Applause] [Music] and our build on the power supply box is now finished and you may notice there's two unique things about this build this time around that is where using a power connector switch and reset switch and leds off an old build that we pulled apart and we're also utilizing the front panel usb and we've also got front panel hd audio so this build is already swagged up and it is looking mint it's actually pretty quiet too and it's got a bit of bling to go with it so all those people saying you need a case we're going to find out if you really do need a case when we do some benchmarks on this thing very soon but what we're doing right now is setting up windows 10 and just installing that with our usb installer and that's installing on the ssd here which is 480 gigabytes plenty enough for installing a cyberpunk and fortnite and even modern warfare if you want to go with that route because this pc should be able to play it though there's another thing too and that is we've got to tune this thing up before we start playing games especially the memory here where we want to get the xmp profiles locked in and we also want to make sure that the temperatures of the gpu and the cpu are absolutely fine and there's nothing crashing before we get into the games and here we are now just stress testing the cpu out on this motherboard making sure nothing's wrong and we've also thrown in the system memory which is our ddr4 which we've clocked to 3200 megahertz via the colorful blaster's auto profile which is working extremely well on this ryzen 5 2600 now temperatures are good noise is pretty good i'm really up close to it and this is also in 27 degrees ambient temperatures i kind of just want to put this have this spinning on here there we go 27 degrees and the gpu is running at a reasonably cool 67 degrees in this 27 degree ambient environment and another thing is too is i'm guessing that the aliexpress sellers of these graphics cards do change the thermal paste because i'm noticing uh if the thermal paste hasn't been changed on these gravis cards then the temperatures will get a little bit hotter than usual so not bad at all it's time for cyberpunk [Music] so and the pc aside we've got the numbers right here with cyberpunk 2077 and i'm guessing it's the bad news in that it's 40 fps but it's playable and the picture looks pretty decent now this was at low settings at 1080p and we had to put the fidelity fx setting to 80. now i found that this was for me personally a balance between at least enjoying this game anything lower than 40 fps and i'd seriously start to struggle especially on a fast action-paced game like this where most of the time it's first person then when you're driving you can change it to third person but you're moving really fast regardless so you do want in my opinion try to get around 60 fps so the problem is when we did drop it to 60 fps we started getting a undesirable picture in my opinion so the 40 fps is doable on this setup but i think if you're going for more fps you're going to lose a lot of picture quality where we then dropped it down to the lowest settings possible 720p at 50 render scale and it still just gave out around 60 fps so it seems like the sometimes there's this there's some kind of cap in this game that's making the gpu in that the thing is the thing is the gpus at 100 even when we're doing this so there's some kind of cap in this game that's limiting it at around 60 fps depending on your gpu now i'm guessing the rx 580 for example rx 570 and say for instance gtx 1060s and gpus like these they are going to be very popular so a lot of people are going to be scratching their head going okay i can just play cyberpunk so i guess there's that news in that some of the good news is that you can still play cyberpunk 2077 it's just not going to be the best experience but we got up here next up fortnite and so fortnite was a really good experience on one particular set of settings and that was when we turned it on to the competitive settings or at least the low with 100 render scale we're getting around 200 fps very good experience on this pc and that was on dx12 now there was a performance mode alpha and that was just not working properly at all and there was also dx11 and they just were giving out more stuttering than i would personally prefer especially in a game like a fortnight which is very competitive so this pc does really well on fortnite at competitive settings and dx12 so i was really happy with that and the power consumed from the wall was about 250 watts so it's not consuming a whole lot of power and it's actually pretty quiet i'm standing beside this thing right now doing this video and the noise should be pretty good because it's not really annoying whatsoever and that's the same noise while i'm playing games so it's very impressive what this build can put out especially for the money now it's coming under 500 and that's because i think it would be a little bit cheaper usually but rx 580s and rx 570s have gone up on the used market and so it does do a decent job especially in the price performance category and with that said the whole build total here came to 475 ship worldwide if you don't have access to any really old computers where you can pull out the power switches and stuff like that then i'll put a link in the description below for the power switch too and some other extras you may want to consider for instance you might want to get a windows 10 key a pro license one of the channel sponsors here at cd keys they do retail keys for very cheap i'll put the links all this stuff that you're seeing here in the description below and the good thing is it does come with a guarantee so if you get it just like my case where i said in the intro i didn't get the case if you have that happen to you on aliexpress you can then put in a dispute and get refunded so there is some good merits to a build like this and that there is kind of some warranty there as opposed to me recently on the used market i have been hosed a little bit and it has been getting worse going into the covert economic conditions the games aside this thing actually represents decent value for money coming out of 2020 where the prices of graphics cards have gone up and now one thing we did do with this build is it did come in at 475 dollars shipped worldwide but that's with an rx 570 so i found the prices of rx 580 since when i bought this gpu on aliexpress till now they have gone up quite substantially the rx 570 is still a pretty good buy at 130 usd and for some reason used gpus have just gone up in price their availability's gone down and the reason for that is i just don't think there's any new cards coming out from nvidia or amd on this price point of 200 and under that's bringing that competition they're still selling rx 580s brand new on the shelf for example and that's passing even years later so i'd like to see both these companies make one of these new cards they could sort of re-inject life into the gpu market where the rest of the build the ram the 16 gigabytes of ram the cooler the ryzen 5 2600 the motherboard and also the 480 gigabyte ssd and the power supply they all represent really good value for their prices especially considering that is shipped globally so there was nothing really to critique here the noise levels the temperatures even the efficiency of this power supply all checked out whereas consuming about 250 watts in both cyberpunk and fortnite so it was doing a good job of not using up a whole lot of power and usually an easy way to tell if a power supply is terrible is you can test between two different power supplies the same scenario and one will be using a lot more power than the other and that power supply is not as efficient and that's generally because they've used cheaper components in it though a few more things we did do to get this build running smoothly was that we did use the colorful uh motherboards built-in memory profiles which do work a treat in this case they brought that 2666 megahertz memory up to 3200 megahertz on the ryzen 5 2600 another thing we did do is we did add in a power switch which they're about a dollar and we did add in some usb ports which we pulled from a used build if you don't have these components i'll put all the links for all the stuff in the description below and i'll also put a windows 10 pro key license in there too where we had to activate this motherboard with windows 10 pro on a retail key and so i'll put all those links for the description below for you guys and with that said it will come in under 500 and considering the current climate of this price point and what you're getting this is actually not too bad of a deal and one thing i will say is if you want to get a case do be very careful on a budget there's a lot of bad cases out there the open-air testbed here it was doing the job under 70 degrees on both cpu and gpu in games pretty much all the time and i was really liking what came out of the build and the good thing with aliexpress is i found that you do get some kind of warranty in that in the case of that case that i didn't receive i put in a dispute and i got my money back so aliexpress does take care of the buyer in that respect so if you get something test it out straight away if it doesn't work then you will get a warranty unlike the used market at the moment where i am locally i've been hearing all sorts of stories and i've actually experienced some of these stories myself buying some used parts recently and getting proverbially hosed and it hasn't been fun that's when you buy a used pot and it just doesn't work the person said it worked and it's pretty much you've lost your money anyhow guys with that build out of the way hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comments section below if you would change anything on this build and if so what would it be love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from idahn 1979 and they ask have you tried the so-called fixed config files on reddit for cyberpunk to work better on pc and i actually haven't i haven't checked them out scratch that we actually did some testing on the 30 series and we found that there was no difference with the memory pool config changes that is going around on reddit now it might work for some people but it wasn't working for hero for us at a studio here where it has to do with i think a three gig vram limit in place which came from the console config file and made its way onto pc um then there was also a 1.5 gigabyte a system ram uh issue as well apparently these config files came into pc and they're causing performance dips what we noticed though with the uh rx 580 in this case was it was being utilized at 100 and we saw that with the gpu utilization figures on our rig that we used in the testing on the aliexpress build in today's video but as for the rtx 3090 we manually set that in the config to use all 24 gigs but it just ignored it and it was still using seven gigabytes at super ultra wide resolution and then for the system memory we set that to 64 gigabytes and it was only using 12 gigabytes so it seems like the game is just ignoring this config file anyhow and with that we didn't notice any difference in fps before and after though people are reporting it's making a difference for them so i'll put the link in the description below for that config change and of course if you're going to do this do make a backup of your config file so if you come into problems it's going to be easy to get back to what you were playing on before back to you past brian and that's the unfortunate news there's going to be no config files that really can get around it and if they do get around it they're probably gonna have a lot of bugs unfortunately so i hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now [Music]
