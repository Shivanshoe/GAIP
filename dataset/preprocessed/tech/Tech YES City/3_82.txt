if you're in the market for a high-end graphics card is an rtx 3070 ti or a 6700 xt going to cut it for you or do you want to save a little bit of money and perhaps look at something like a used gtx 1080 ti well in today's comparison we're gonna be pitting these three graphics cards all head-to-head to head and we're going to be doing this at 1080p and 1440p so let's get this showdown on the road [Music] welcome back to tech yes city and first of all getting straight into the results we'll be pulling up new world a game release from none other than amazon this is known as aka the gpu killer and here i decided to test at high settings at 1080p we were seeing that the 3070 ti was scoring a victory over both the 6700 xt and 1080 ti but it wasn't a massive difference but what i'm seeing with the 1080 ti is it can still play ball in the same league as these two newer graphics cards despite it being released quite some time ago now stepping things up to 1440p did see the 3070 ti pull a bit ahead of both the 6700 xt and also 1080 ti if we were to scale the percentage differences accordingly from the 1080p numbers which means that the 370ti does do a bit better as you go higher in the resolution however it's ironic that it's got the least amount of vram out of these three cards in the comparison having eight gigabytes versus the 6700 xt 12 gigabytes versus the 1080 ti 11 gigabytes however on to the next title we've got borderlands 3 i decided to test at ultra settings and at 1080p we saw the rtx 3070 ti coming over 130 average fps and then over to the 6700 xt 114 average fps then the 1080 ti just falling shy of that 100 average fps number but i will note that i did decide to test this game in dx11 for the nvidia cards and dx12 for the amd card where the nvidia cards gave out better fps numbers in dx11 and the amd card gave out better numbers in dx12 versus dx11 though when testing this game on average i thought dx11 did give better 1 and 0.1 percent lows in other words there was less amount of stutter when i was running the benchmarks on dx11 the next title we've got here for you guys is redemption 2 and at 1080p with max settings dialed in we got over 100 fps on the 370 ti versus 87 and then also 64 on the 1080 ti so the 1080i did fall behind a little bit in this title compared to the newer cards and then stepping up to 1440p we also saw a similar trend but then moving on to ark survival evolved we had here at 1080p the 6700 xt actually coming in at max settings pretty much smack bang spot on with the 3070 ti so almost neck and neck and then moving up to 1440p actually saw the 37ti have a bit of a boost over the 6700 xt and then the 1080 ti was actually scoring similar numbers at 1080p and also at 1440p it was coming in just a little bit shy of that 6700 xt then moving on to metro exodus here is where i put it on ultra settings but i did turn off the tessellation and put on the shader to 1x and we saw here actually the 6700 xt put up a good fight against the 3070 ti at 1080p and also 1440p with unfortunately the 1080 ti falling a little bit shy of the other two cards however pulling up fire strike extreme which gives you a point scoring system as opposed to fps we had here on the 1080 ti 13 776 points versus 17 025 on the rx 6700 xt versus 18 162. so all in all the two newer cards do have a bit more raw performance underneath the hood but the gtx 1080 ti even to this date performs extremely well and one thing i really like about this graphics card is you can pick it up on the used market for nearly half the price of both the 3070 ti and the 6700 xt when i checked the stock at least on newegg i'm looking at the usd pricing the 6700 xt is currently coming around a thousand dollars the 3070 ti is coming around 1100 so they're coming in a similar overpriced number versus that 1080 ti and if you're into picking up local deals like i am i picked up one of these cards recently for 600 aussie dollars and the one in today's comparison i picked it up for 700 aussie dollars so that's a gtx 1080 ti auras edition however the final point i'm going to touch on here with the three cards in regards to performance is i wouldn't bother overclocking any of them and actually i would encourage if you guys got any three of these cards to undervolt these cards where after under vaulting i saw a serious drop in power consumption on all three models with the most dramatic being that of the 3070 ti going from over 308 watts while we're doing the borderlands 3 benchmark dropping down to 196 watts and the 6700 xt i managed to drop that down from 190 all the way down to 107 and then the 1080 ti went from 250 watts down to 190 watts and the performance numbers i'll throw them up before and after we did the under vaulting so you're not losing a whole lot of performance but you are gaining a whole lot of power savings but the good thing about this is if you like taking care of your hardware like i do and especially if you want to resell these products in the future then they are going to be in a lot better condition in the future because they're going to be running at cooler temperatures and using less power so speaking of cooler temperatures here's where we'll take a closer look at the zotac rtx 3070 ti amp holo edition they did send this model in for review and they wanted me to take a look at it and so when i do this i do take a look at temperatures and the best fan speeds for the given out of the box settings and here's where on auto the fan speeds will go up to around 74 this is in a 23 degree ambient environment and manually setting this to 60 percent did see our temperatures go all the way up to 77 degrees and the noise was much better at 34 decibels versus 44 decibels on the auto settings going up to 80 manual fan speeds saw the noise start to become unbearable and then 100 just became completely unbearable at over 50 decibels scoring 59 degrees however versus 63 versus that 67 but here is the kicker where if we undervolt the card we can drop that power consumption down but also drop those temperatures down and then our 60 fan speeds not only sound really quiet but they do a great job of keeping the card in the 60 degree region so in terms of weight and dimensions this is actually quite a thick and long card so i'll pull those numbers up on the screen for you guys you've also got a vented back plate that does feature an rgb logo and then you've got the mirror rgb finish on the side which you can control with the software with a variety of different effects on the back you've got the standard rtx 3000 series hdmi 2.1 one of those and also three display ports however with these new rtx 3000 series cards i would like to see companies like zotac include an additional hdmi 2.1 though with all that out of the way it's now time for a conclusion on the 3070 ti here from zotac and basically the gravis card prices are extremely high still due to mining profitability on crypto i'm not going to show the crypto numbers in this video because people just keep going out and buying cards for crypto mining and that's seriously making the prices for the average gamer unbearable and that's what these card prices are at the moment they're just unbearable at their current market conditions however that said if this card does ever come close to that 599 dollar price tag at msrp or in australia it was touted to be around a thousand aussie dollars then it would be a decent buy and this model here is certainly no slouch out of the box however it does get a little bit noisy but if you're willing to undervolt then you will get some massive benefits in terms of noise and temperatures and longevity but also the rgb and the aesthetics of the card is really nice from the get-go so overall zotac have done a pretty good job on this model but ultimately i feel like this market is just simply pricing out a lot of gamers and so me personally i've been looking at the used market a whole lot more than i ever have lately and i've actually been picking up some pretty good deals hence why i've included the gtx 1080 ti in today's comparison because if you can pick it up for a really good price then it's definitely going to make for a great placeholder until one of these cards does become more affordable however that said if you are extremely impatient and you just want to get one of these cards now then this model will do quite a good job you've also got decent ray tracing performance and dlss 2.0 which does do a really good job in particular titles anyhow guys i hope you enjoyed today's three-way comparison with these graphics cards if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what do you think of the current graphics card market are you like me and you're just picking up a lot of different deals on everything but gpus and you're just sort of waiting for those prices to come down but i think it's actually not a bad idea to build up a pc minus the gpu right now because the prices on everything but gpus is actually pretty good love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day from d neon and they asked quick question on the power supply tester is it safe for a power supply to return 80 milliseconds on the power good delay while still checking green on all rails so to answer this question straight up if it's scoring around 80 on the power good it's either one of those really weak models that i personally wouldn't run on a computer in any of the pcs that i build here or it's pretty much close to dropping out for me personally when something scores around under 200 on the power good it's usually something that's not worth using because i believe sooner or later and usually sooner you will have problems with that power supply hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in another one very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
