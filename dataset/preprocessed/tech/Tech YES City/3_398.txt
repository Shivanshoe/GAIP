only you rip and tear our tilt is done [Music] [Music] the new gym eternal has just launched and you're wondering what do you do well I'll tell you what you do you grab a good old PC off a good old gantry for a hundred and seventy five Aussie dollars you get yourself a GTX 970 for a hundred and twenty Ozzie dolls you grab yourself an SSD and you got yourself a whole build for under $300 that is an absolute bargain but of course we had to cut out or should I say in this case tech yes love and with a hammer that hard drive cage out of there and then we were able to fit that hard drive up the top with some double-sided tape and then put the SSD just below it and we could fit that long GTX 970 in there now the recommended specs they state that you need a gtx 970 or better which in this case is absolutely perfect though for the recommended cpu they're saying i7 6700 k so we've got a nice 74770 here and I'm hoping we'll get some really good FPS but before we do check this game out and see how good it is on this budget PC right here we have to give it a little bit of tech yes loving and that is where we clean it up and we make it look brandnew so who's ready I'll tell you who's ready they're at Andre [Music] [Music] now whenever we come into a used om system here at Tech es city we have to implore safe hygienic practices and that means changing over the thermal paste on this CPU right here [Music] and the final touches include some bang job cable management and some tech yes loving with multi-purpose strike [Music] so we're now installing doom eternal and while we wait for that to complete there is a couple of touch-ups that we can do to this build still the first thing we can do is add an exhaust fan in and then the second thing we'll actually second and third thing is we're gonna open a program called inspector since this is an older i7 we then disable those meltdown inspector updates and that makes our CPU perform just that much better in games and then right beside that we've got MSI Afterburner we're gonna quickly overclock this GPU right here which in this case this thing does respond really well to overclocking [Music] [Music] to be present and I just started playing doom eternal and here we are at nighttime and I lost track of time so this game was really exciting I played the first level all the way through and even on the medium difficulty setting I came into some pots that were pretty difficult so I think they've got the difficulty just right with this game as opposed to games I've played in the past which was just a walk in the park this one actually requires a bit of skill to get through now there was a few little things that came into I couldn't play anyone on the multiplayer yet because I'm guessing it's like only other people who have got pre access and no one was on trying to join a server at the time I was on unfortunately I would have loved to have played some multiplayer but apparently they've got two demons versus one Slayer and the multiplayer is unique in that aspect so I'm looking forward to trying that out and seeing how it differs from the single-player campaign which has got its own pretty cool story which is set on earth this time around so the doom storyline continues but that being said we've got the FPS figures here which is on the Vulcan API by default and without gtx970 we were getting some really smooth frame rates we had low settings here 108 fps and then the 17.1% lowest was 76 and 75 dropping it down to medium settings then source get 97 average FPS this is a 1080p by the way and then the 1% points and lows were fine just like they were on high which I thought looked the best as well as giving us out the best performance per graphic settings where we actually couldn't set it on Ultra or nightmare after that because the vram limit of 4 gigabytes on this card was it was trying to demand more than that so if you want to try and get it on nightmare you're going to need a 6 gigabyte card like a gtx 1060 at this resolution or an RX 588 gigabyte to be able to enjoy this at 1080p ultra nightmare and now the funny thing about this game was we had the CPU utilization just hovering around most the time 30 to 40% and the temperatures on the CPU were absolutely fine even with this budget cooler on this budget motherboard so this wasn't a problem even with the am NOT overclocked on this board which we unfortunately can't do we still had really smooth frame rates and the GPU was being utilized pretty much a hundred percent at all times so I D that's the guys who make doom they do a fantastic job of optimizing this title for PC as we can see here with this budget PC we're getting smooth frame rates and it looks absolutely gorgeous the game plays really good but another thing I'll add on top of that this game is really GPU demanding so we saw those CPU utilization figures on a forty seven seventy which is now quite a few years old and it's only four cores eight threads we still were maxing out this GTX 970 when it was overclocked so even with this CPU I'm guessing you could get something like a 5,700 XT and it would be a perfect combo for maxing out the 47 70 and the 5700 XT of course in this title in other titles if you play it on PC the 5700 XT would probably want a better CPU then the 47 70 but of course since its doom and it's well optimized it's going to give you a really good experience even if you're on a potato just make sure you probably got something better than a potato for your graphics card however and with all that out of the way this right here I've got in the background rather you can see it on the chair the ace of Verret on m6 I picked this up for an absolute bargain where I got a one terabyte hard drive included 16 gigabytes of RAM 47 70 and that was 175 Aussie dollars and it included a 500 watt gold rated power supply which even overclocked the GTX 970 now I did a previous video where the GTX 970 is one of my favorite picks on the used market for graphics cards at the moment and these two combinations together just gave us some ridiculously good price performance and we didn't come into really any hassles while putting this build together besides getting out our own hammer which I did get a bit of inspiration from this video game and I thought it was the boss fight when I was trying to get that hard drive cage out but besides that the PC was relatively hassle-free to get going overclocking was easy if you're using the tech yes 2 minute method and then the game itself presented no problems it didn't crash at all and it's ready to go even on some old-school specs like we had in today's video so this game is good to go if you're thinking about playing it on PC and also I want to give a big thanks to Bethesda for including me in the pre-release review phase and allowing me to give you guys an awesome video for today so if you enjoyed this one then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comments section below are you gonna be checking out doom and do you like what you've seen so far love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of thoughts and opinions we've got the question of the day which comes from zip top gumming they asked why haven't you tested the game ax 400 is it a really good budget cooler and the game ax 400 that's a CPU cooler I have tried it in the past the problem is it's not really available anywhere locally at least for a decent price and since I've checked out the Snowman which is on Aliexpress that thing is coming in with some of the best price performance if you need a budget CPU cooler to either keep your CPU temps cooler than they'd be on a stock cooler or if you want to do a bit of overclocking but if you guys want to see that cooler versus the Snowman then I can round up some more budget CPU coolers and test them here on the channel hope that answers that question and I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content then you know what to do and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now [Music] [Applause] [Music]
