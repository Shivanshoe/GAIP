on the desk behind me is two monitors from Oris one being their fi 27 q and then the other being the fi 27 cute - P and you're probably wondering straight away before we get into this review what are the differences between the P and the non P well essentially they use the same inno locks 27-inch 1440p 165 Hertz IPS panel though when it comes to the differences it's mainly to do with a couple of features and we'll get those out of the way with because everything else on the monitor is pretty much identical besides these features and the first one which makes a difference I feel is their new black equalizer 2.0 and so essentially what this will do is if you turn it on you've got three different levels and then you can brighten up all the darker shadows whilst leaving the lighter shades Laurent so this is really good if you are playing games where you're looking in and your enemies are constantly camping in dark spots and you want to be able to see them without blowing out the image and so the P has this advantage where as opposed to the non P the normal version that's got this black equalizer which essentially is just a gamma booster you can do this on pretty much any monitor on your desktop in settings if your monitor doesn't have this settings so I do like what they've done on the P with the black equalizer 2.0 setting though the next difference comes with the active noise cancellation 2.0 so if you're gaming with your friends this will block out background noises so your friends can hear you better whilst you're gaming and the next difference is that one supports DisplayPort 1.2 plus HDR and the other sports DisplayPort 1.4 + HDR so that allows the P model to carry over a hundred and sixty-five Hertz at 10-bit color depth whilst also having HDR enabled if you try to do this on the non P model what will happen is you won't be able to lock in 165 Hertz anymore and you'll only be able to lock in 120 Hertz though that said the HDR setting on this monitor isn't too important I feel since it only really has a maximum of 4 CCD brightness so I measured 394 on one panel 390 on the other that was at max brightness so again if you are looking for true HDR content you're most likely going to want a brighter monitor going into the thousand CCD brightness that's usually when you start to notice a big difference however that aside moving on with this monitor two of the most important features we've got here input lag and also response times which any game are getting a panel like this and putting enough investment and money into it will want these figures to be good and so what we message here in cs:go was that the monitor had really good input lag I'd say it averaged out to around 14 milliseconds across all the tests I did and it didn't matter if you had the overdrive set to the picture quality balance or speed settings it gave out pretty similar input lag across all three different settings and the fourth setting which we're going to talk about as well and that's the aim stabilizer which essentially is what they call black frame insertion the first time I saw this was on the Audi monitor that I reviewed a few months ago and essentially what it looks like to a thousand FPS camera is a red frame being inserted and this happens with this monitor in three milliseconds intervals so we'll basically have the brightness but that being said it's going to try and drop down the perceived motion blur in the process even though the response times will remain the same inherent to the monitor though under the response times I feel if you're serious about buying this monitoring and gaming you're going to want to leave it on in my opinion the speed setting where we saw response times averaging out to around four to five milliseconds this was the best-case scenario so I will quickly interlude and say that one millisecond advertising on the box that really needs to go this is what it truly is it's a four to five millisecond response time monitor on the best scenario then that makes the whole transition of the frame sometimes taking up to ten or eleven milliseconds so the most you'll incur with this setting is our two different frames on the screen at the same time the one do the balance setting here we saw six milliseconds greater gray that was the average peak time and then the fade off time it would take around roughly sometimes 13 milliseconds on average for the frame to completely transition out and then we're moving on to the worst setting I feel which is the picture quality setting and here we saw a response time of roughly 7 milliseconds and the worst fade times here were around 15 to 16 milliseconds to the point where you could see three different images on the same frame so I don't recommend having this on whatsoever for the Auris 27 Q or the QP where in this case they're pretty much the same panel they gave out the same input lag and they also gave out the same response times though with the aim stabilizer setting aka black frame insertion do you want to leave this on or off I'd say the choice is yours if you get a monitor with this setting play around with it see if you don't mind the brightness drop but another good thing is that this setting will work with free sync enabled or juicing so both these panels behind me depending on your GPU have the option to enable free sync or G sync and going from 48 to 165 Hertz support however since both these panels here have IPS they got great viewing angles they got 10 bit support you're probably going to want to know how they would double down for creation or video or photo editing and here we're looking at the white uniformity first it's pretty good not the best I've seen but certainly not the worst the risk of getting backlight bleed generally depends from monitor to monitor but both these panels here exhibited no noticeable backlight bleed that I could see though I will say out of the box the P does come with deeper blacks basically from the user custom settings so they don't come with the same standard profile out of the box but moving on now to the color balances here with the srgb profile when I tested this for editing accuracy with the eye color display profile which measures the color accuracy of these monitors they were both a little bit off in their srgb mode it wouldn't be too bad but if you were doing some serious grading you definitely want to get both these monitors color braided because pretty much everything in the line there was a little bit off out of the box now both these panels feature a semi-gloss matte coating and when I pulled up an orange back ground there was no visible cross-hatching on either panel so they're using pretty much the same everything in that regard moving through the build quality and stand you can see here it's a pretty thin bezel one of the thinnest I've seen but also on that note they're using a steel frame on the base and also the backplate where you can connect it up pretty quickly and you've also got height tilt and swivel adjustment there as well as RGB on the back in five different zones which you can control if you install the aura software or you can control it from the monitors OSD itself now transitioning into the OSD it's controlled from underneath the monitor you press it once it'll turn the monitor on and off and it features a d-pad with customizable hot King as well which out of the box you can quickly change things like the volume as well as the black equalizer and picture profiles or the input a speaking of DisplayPort connectivity you get two hdmi ends as well as one DisplayPort in with the P model featuring that 1.4 as opposed to the non P which features the 1.2 there though speaking of the OSD it's one of the better implementations I've seen with a lot of extra features thrown in you can do things like add in a custom crosshair as well as do things like make a countdown and count up timer and add in your own on-screen display where you can hook that up to your computer and show things like your CPU temperature though another good feature about this is the ability to display your refresh rate in real time that's the actual free sync or g-sync display and you can report that in real time fps and then lastly in that menu you've got the options to change the aspect ratios if you prefer a smaller picture and you've got the ability to add in picture by picture or picture in picture so now it's time to conclude and critique the Auris f-i 27 q + - p models and they're coming in with the price point of 520 USD for the non P and then 600 USD for the P model in Australia it's gonna cost 830 Ozzy or 965 Aussie for that - P model so basically for extra money you are getting that black equalizer 2.0 which does work really well and you are getting that 10 bit 165 Hertz support over the DisplayPort 1.4 though is that premium worth it to you so if you're not going to be using that feature as well as not going to be playing at 10 bit then the extra money is simply wasted though if you feel like you could utilize them then of course that premium will be justified there with both these panels even though the input lag is really good some of the best numbers I've seen here I thought the response times could use some improvement 5 milliseconds on the best overdrive setting does leave a little bit more to be desired especially if you're gaming at a hundred and sixty-five Hertz however that being said auras have done a great job on everything from the build quality to the OSD to the feature set and even adding in things like RGB to make sure that if you buy this you're going to have a really good experience it's also a flat base panel there's no curvature so I hear a lot of you guys like that aspect when it comes to gaming monitors you don't like some of the curve stuff coming into the gaming scene as well as the fact that this monitor can support vase mounting it is going to be a solid choice overall though whether that price point for the feature set and also the gaming experience that you're going to get is worth it to you then I'd suggest watching everything in this review and then making an informed decision and without a sight do let us know in the comment section below what you think of these monitors in today's review are you digging them or is there something else that you would go for personally love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and we've got the thoughts and opinions from the question of the day which comes from a name that's in Korean so I can't read this but they are so pretty good question that is anyone know if the X 5650 and X 50 680 get the same clock is there any difference and I guess he's talking about overclocking in both to the same gigahertz frequencies will they give any performance differences and the answer to that is no if you clock the same CPU but with different base clocks out of the box to the same overclock frequencies they're going to give you the same performance though the biggest difference if you have them at the same clock levels is that one could be a better bin than the other in that it clocks to the same low at low voltages hence giving out low temperatures and also using slightly less power anyway guys I'll catch you in another tech video very soon don't forget to hit that like button and also if you stayed this fine you're not yet subbed in you're enjoying the tech videos around tech yeah City then the sub button and also if you ring the bell it's down there to get the video as the moment they drop and I'll catch you in another one very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
