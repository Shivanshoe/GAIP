2019 was definitely the year of AMD for CPUs where they came in with their competitive pricing as well as the IPC increases and just those extra cores and threads which Intel didn't have an answer to until now and we fast forward to May 2020 and we've got 24 new CPUs coming out on the desktop from Intel which today we're going to discuss these and also the new features coming in with z4 90 chipsets which is a new socket LGA 1200 so let's roll that intro and then get into the details as well as my favorite pics on these line up the CPUs for you guys [Music] so starting off from the bottom we have the i3 lineup here now you will notice that there is no K and there is no F variant which means you're not going to see an overclockable fork or a threaded CPU this time around however the one thing I did just allude to there was eight threads and this time around Intel on that I three line up is introducing hyper-threading which does open the door to much more competition and much better value for money especially if you want a couple one of these CPUs we say in our TX 2060 super or maybe at 5600 XT you're really going to notice no difference between going one of these budget CPUs and a higher-end CPU so in other words you can save a lot of money by going with either the i3 or AMD's upcoming solution the rise in 330 130 300 X which I believe is AMD sort of beating Intel to the chase here on the budget and with them releasing their own full core 8 threaded solution to sort of appease this budget market now one thing we're gonna see here with is a 310 100 it's my favorite pick out of these 5 CPUs they're offering we've got here one hundred and twenty two dollars suggested retail price on the Intel website now they do say something about a thousand units on this pricing however that being said I have noticed in the past that this pricing on this website does come pretty close to what you can expect at least on American and Australian retail shelves especially in Australia when we adjust it to the Triple P pricing terms this time around with a 10100 the maximum turbo frequency is four point three gigahertz we can definitely expect an all-court turbo above four gigahertz on all causal threads which means that this I've three ATA's price point is definitely looking like it's similar to an i7 7700 but that CPU years ago was released for a much higher price tag than this ever was so the fact that this is their entry-level CPU and it's coming around a previous flagship Intel pricing and performance is definitely something that none of the budget builders gonna like but also people who are enthusiasts of competition are going to love now one thing you'll notice here with the i3 and the i-5 and lineup is that they've got Turbo Boost 2.0 and there so don't support the thermal velocity boost which we'll talk a little bit about later now it's for the a three and a five they've only got official support for 2666 ddr4 memory but I'm assuming this is for dual sided sticks in dual channel which will stress the IMC the most if you're putting in two sticks as say thirty two hundred megahertz memory and dual channel should work easily on all the SKUs here but it is important to know that the i7 + i9 chips look like they are getting a bend IMC where that's 29 33 megahertz and there are some other things to look out for which we'll talk about later but let's move over to the i-5 lineup where they've got in total nine different SKUs coming out here with also them introducing an F and a case Q amongst the 10600 lineup at the 10 400 F is easily standing out to me along this line up as being one of the kings and not just the whole lineup of Intel's 10th gen C be used but also in the CPU that's probably gonna bring the most competition I feel too Zen to with coming in just over $150 you're getting 6 cores 12 threads and again it looks like it will clock to all cause over 4 gigahertz meaning that this is going to go head-to-head with the risin 5 3,600 which was my favorite CPU out of the third gen stack just bringing really good value for money well actually the Rosen 530 500 X was my favorite for gamers but AMD did stop selling that or allowing it to be sold on the likes of all expressed but essentially at this price point you're getting an i7 8700 by the looks of it which was the CPUs only released a few years ago for a much higher price tag so hooray for competition and let's move out of the i7 lineup where they were introducing 5 different SKUs here my favorite being the 10700 F this is previously equivalent to the i9 series which of course was their most up-to-date CPU lineup so the fact that you're getting 8 cores 16 threads similarly I $9.99 hundred for under 300 bucks they've got the CPU listed with 298 dollars is definitely looking like it's a decent solution if you need extra cores and threads but when we compare that to the 10 400 F for example we are seeing a price increase here of nearly double for anything getting 33% more calls and threads so you do start to see even according to Intel zone spec sheet and line up here that the value does start to drop off heavily after the i-5 line up there the one thing that does confuse me a little bit about the 10 700 F is that it does have a 65 watt TDP there so how the maximum call boosts on all cores is going to work still remains to be seen I will be checking that out for you guys but also the i3 and the i-5 having less calls and less threads do sport that same 65 watt TDP but now on to the granddaddy of performances there I 9 lineup which is now sporting 10 cores and 20 threads still not enough to go anywhere near the 39 50x for example but definitely a great addition for someone that I would label as the power gamer they love gaming with the highest frame rates possible they still want to do things like multitask and then edit videos on the side or do whatever they do that needs those extra cores and threads and this one coming in with a maximum boost here of 5.3 gigahertz on the 10 900 K F and K and then the 10 900 sporting a maximum boost of 5.2 gigahertz guaranteed is something that we have to talk about because intel on this lineup are introducing what they call turbo boost 3.0 which essentially gets the best two cores of these 10 cores and then boost them up to essentially 5.2 and 5.3 gigas now make no mistake about it this is gonna be the cream of the crop in terms of bidding not just on the integrated memory controller side of things but also on the clock speeds and how high they go now one thing about the 10900 eff is just like the i7 i'm a little bit confused with this 65 watt TDP i believe in practice if you wanna get the most performance out of this thing you're definitely gonna have to go well above 65 watt TDP where the 10900 care for example has a TDP of 125 watts and that seems about right on a z4 90 motherboard though what we're looking at here is a new technology called thermal velocity boost which is looking like it's very similar to precision boost to imprecision boost overdrive to that released on Zen to where essentially if you've got a really good cooling solution good motherboard it will then Auto overclock the CPU a little bit more because it sees that the temperatures are lower and they're able to go a little bit higher now another thing about the CPU is they're using their stim again so essentially it's gonna be soft soldered on but this time around they are sending out the guy a bit more which Intel also claims is going to keep the temperatures down more so than it did on their knife gen and previous CPUs so now it's time to talk about competition budget and which cpu should you be looking out for and my two favorite picks going into this is going to be the i3 10100 and also the 10 400 F on the i5 lineup I think they're gonna offer phenomenal price performance as well as being able to be coupled with a budget h4 10 motherboard which in this time around they're going with an LGA 1200 socket and there's gonna be four new lineup of motherboards that being h4 10 B 460 h4 17 also z4 90 which we do have a few z4 90 boards here at the studio already but I don't have any CPUs to test them with so there will be a heap of reviews coming out on new hardware this month both from AMD and from Intel so stay tuned for that and with the motherboards and the feature set this time around you can expect up to 40 PC a 3.0 lanes and there is no native Thunderbolt 3 as well as no native PC a four on board the motherboards this time around however one thing to note is that the motherboards can add that in via external chips take for instance as rocks velocity here z 490 that's gonna have 16 lanes of PCI 4.0 available whereas the other three motherboards they have here don't have PCI 4.0 so it's gonna be interesting to see what some of the multiple manufacturers are doing with their boards though in terms of looks and features and also price point do let us know in the comment section below what you'd like to see come out of the motherboard manufacturers this time around so make no mistake the LGA 1200 you will need a new socket and you will need a new motherboard to use these 10th gen CPUs and they won't work on any previous motherboards because it's a different socket though some other things to talk about with this CPU is that they're using the UHD 630 graphics which is really underpowered they've been using this actually for a couple of years now so if you're looking for a better onboard graphics solution with these CPUs it's really not going to hit the mark hence why I'm actually more curious on the F CPUs this time around which don't feature that onboard portion and of course you're not paying for that in terms of the K tax that's looking like it's around fifty to sixty dollars depending on the CPU you go for and in terms of the F license depending on which lineup you're in you can expect to pay around ten to twenty dollars less on a F CPU versus a normal CPU and with all those 10th gen details out of the way it's finally just time to talk about competition in general and how in 2020 it's definitely heating up to be a very good market and time to buy a CPU especially if you're a gamer where this time around I'm gonna say for instance if you're buying an i3 or nine five while you're buying a rising three rising five it's not going to make that much of a difference you're literally going to be coming down to a few dollars and then the differences in games is my prediction is that it's going to be very minimal so if you go with an i3 10100 or you go with a risin three 3100 you haven't made a bad choice on either play in that you're gonna be getting very good performance for the dollar same with the rise of five and high five we're gonna move up to say 16 cores versus tankles that's going to become a different argument for what you want to get as an individual so what it's worth it's finally looking like Intel is responding on the mainstream desktop market and that just means it's consumers of course we win in the end and with all that out of the way do let us know in the comment section below what's gonna be your favorite CPU coming out of tenth gen and how do you think it's gonna stack up against Xen - and also AMD's upcoming Xen 3 because from what I know already is that we're not going to see an IPC improvement on these 10 desktop components from Intel however many of these side of things we will see a yet again another IPC increase but do drop a comment down below and speaking of comments we got the question of they're here which comes from Rinna and Donna salvo and they asked us any x99 card works with ddr3 the e5 26:20 v3 works with ddr3 memories and is referring to the budget six core 12 throws took a look at in a video up here and this particular CPU won't support ddr3 when it comes to the v3 x99 Zeon's you've got to look out for the ones that do so civically support ddr3 and they're usually the ones that aren't listed on Intel's website so this is CPUs like the 26 78-53 for example that essentially the same as the 26 atv-3 but they had that ddr3 registered memory support on board because they'll made for a partner like HP which specifically requested it and it was never released on retail shelves until now now that they're getting sold off on the use market and they're becoming available and speaking of the market I'll make an update video in terms of what's going on with PC parts at the moment I've been hearing all kinds of different stories and I hope that
