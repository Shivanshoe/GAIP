what is cracker lacking tech yes citizens and today we've got a special for you i'm actually at the place right now filming i've asked if i could just film this segment for the intro where we've got 18 untested graphics cards and now look i can tell that a lot of them are potato like graphics cards but i like delving with potatoes i love testing out and building budget pcs and we've got 18 cards here that are untested the person had them in their closet sitting there for years now they've got to go overseas and so they're clearing out everything and they just said to me look i don't know how many of these graphics cards work i don't know how many don't work i just said well for 50 aussie dollars which is maybe 30 something usd i'm going to take the gamble and see how many of these work last time we did a video like this you guys absolutely loved it so we're going to get our untested gpu swag on today but you may have also noticed that in general not just potato gpus but high-end graphics cards are coming down in price big time so we're going to talk about that a little bit later but we've also while i'm here i asked them do you have any other stuff and they just said yes i've actually got quite a few things where they've got a gtx 1660 ti that we've scored for 200 aussie dollars we also got two i7s a 4790 and also 3770 and they said i could have those for fifty dollars so we're picking up extra deals while we're here always always got to ask if someone has the extra pc components when you're trying to get a deal because you could just end up getting more deals and more deals now let's take a look at what we're getting in this package here today and then get back to the tech yes studio and start a little bit of a late night hustle [Music] [Applause] are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor fcd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2 links in description below so we're now back at the tech yes studio we actually ended up getting a lot more in this deal than i bargained for so uh we got the gravis cards the 18 graphics cards the 1660 ti and they ended up saying look i've got this ryzen uh wraith prism do you want this with the bracket and i said on how much and they just chuck it in for us and i was like wow that's awesome they also had some untested hard drives as well and they just chucked them in as well for 300 aussie dollars for this whole total so so far we are looking really good but what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to bed on a good note and because it's pretty late and so i know if some of this stuff or if a lot of this stuff's faulty i'm not gonna be able to sleep so i'm on a good note i'm gonna get a good rest then we're gonna get into this in the morning and there's also if i start up like if i start cleaning up gravis cards late at night i don't want to wake up my neighbors so let's just crash out and we'll see you guys in the morning [Applause] [Music] so far the one card that we don't really care about is the only card working so far and we've already tested six cards before it so this is just not looking good so far [Music] so right now i've just had to jump in my car go for a little drive clear my head we had three cards that ended up working so far out of those 18 cards and they're the cards that we just really have no use for they're not going to play games like at least with some of those gtx 560s and stuff like that you can put them in a really low end gaming pc and make something like a cs go potato or a fortnight budget gaming pc but those three cards that are working they're literally just like office pc graphics cards and most the time you can just use your cpu if you've got an i5 2400 for example you can just use the onboard graphics for a gpu if you need so for an office pc so i just yeah i had to get outside go for a little drive clear my head otherwise those cards that weren't working they would have went off the balcony and you would have probably wherever you are in the world you would have heard me to you probably would have heard me cursing so what i do is just clear my head a little bit get back into it i'm going to clean up the graphics cards that weren't working that i want to work and i think there's about seven of them in total there's a few gtx 560s 560 ti's there's those 6970s i'm going to go back i'm just going to take the coolers off clean them and then come back into it see if we can get a quick signal out of any of them if not then we will add them to the pile we'll talk about uh what else is going on in the market but really untested you guys so far you guys looking at me and you're like it's just bad luck and yeah it is bad luck i mean you go for the sometimes you you get so lucky with used pc parts sometimes you can just get so unlucky this time around the untested thing i don't know i mean they did sell us a 1660 ti for very cheap so i would say that 50 covers like the how cheap we got the 1660 ti it covers those untested cards anyway but i really wanted this to work because i'm actually in desperate need of these real low end cards if you guys didn't know i love putting together really low end budget gaming pcs it's actually a lot of fun for me to make value on the real cheap low end budget sector and now after this before going into this i've really had no low end cards coming out of this it's looking so far like i'm going to have no low end graphics cards either [Music] [Music] now [Music] so [Music] but now it's time to finally test these graphs cards out and we did use a lot of chemicals so i did put a mask on and also here we've just found one of the coolest heat sinks for testing graphics cards out now so this is going to uh basically because it's got a flat base this means that we'll be able to just while we're seeing if the gravis cards work we can use this to absorb any of the heat [Music] [Music] so the first card tested here is the gtx 580 and that has now given out a signal so that's some really good news one for one in the retest after the tech yes loving [Music] and there we have it the power of tech yes lovin two for two this is the gtx 560. say it with me guys say with me the power of tech yes lovin favors all [Music] so this one here this gtx 560 is working but you may have noticed in the b-roll initially the signal was like all it's like kind of like motion blur in one angle and then i tried a different port and it didn't give out a signal and then after that i retried the original port and i was giving out a full signal so i'm going to be cleaning this port here a little bit more thoroughly and hopefully once we put the coolers back on these cards that are giving out signals they'll run benchmarks fine as well so that's three for three now after the check yes lovin i am absolutely loving this tech yes lovin [Music] it's another gtx 560 we've gone from the worst case scenario to now looking like it's the best case scenario so there it is that's four for four right now i am on a roll with these untested gravis cards [Music] we're now five for five and suddenly this was coming into it looking like it was the worst untested lot to coming out as possibly the best untested lot ever [Music] so now 7970 is working and giving out a signal which is really funny because it looks like in the corner here there's some damage on the pcie connector so it's kind of very strange to see that especially since it hasn't looked like the heatsink's been pulled off but i'm guessing a lot of these cards perhaps were sitting in perhaps a garage or getting weathered and it's looking like the most obvious thing was the cleaning out these connector ports here and obviously cleaning off all the debris off the cards is really just giving these cards a second life [Music] so now the second 7970 unfortunately this one i believe is actually just physically gone and the way we could tell was obviously there's no signal but also when we put the heat sink on that so we're not just using that to spare the gravis card so it doesn't get too hot while we're testing it we're also using it as an indicator to see if there's heat coming out of course and in this case there was just no heat coming out my finger this heatsink was just remaining cool and that's an indicator that the gpus got much more problems than just the perhaps a bit of debris and rust [Music] and now this old gt 9000 series car this is the same as the previous 7970 this one's just giving out no heat and there's no signal but i'm not too concerned with this one because even if it doesn't work it's really not that big of a deal [Music] and now our final card on the testing today is this quadro ke or q5000 and uh this one's just giving out like those previous two cars it didn't work it's giving out no heat when i was touching the heatsink so that just means this card is a goner as well okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] so foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign so now that i've put all new thermal paste on i've put the coolers back on the cards that worked i ended up testing out these cards running them through stress tests and there is some more bad news so it's like today is just a roller coaster complete roller coaster of untested emotions it's the easiest way to put it and we came back we had those cards working and then we put the coolers back on and unfortunately the gtx 580 ended up giving out some very bizarre behavior in fact when i turned it on it had all these exclamation marks and then we got to windows and it just as soon as you tried to install the drive we got a blue screen i then thought okay we'll try and downgrade the v bios we stepped it down to a evga bios in terms of lower clock speeds on memory and core clock and what this does is sometimes it can bring the car back to life if the card was just teetering on the edge in terms of not being able to work at the original speeds but if you underclock it kind of think of it like as a slight underclock and then it works again but unfortunately it gave out a bizarre behavior at the startup screen again this time it was kind of like some 1980s like dos game and then we got to windows and it started showing uh lines on the screen and that's usually indicative of vram having issues and so after that i was like all right one more attempt we'll just try gtx 580 1.5 gigabyte v bias that installed and then we got the exclamation marks again so it just wouldn't work no matter what i threw at this card i mean i might try just a reference bias later but i'm going to keep it around and also see if i can sort of relearn i did learn in the past like years ago how you i think you can make a custom v bios for the gtx 580 and then install it and then after that i think with the six series and seven series nvidia started locking out the v bios so i'm kind of going to keep that card around and then we had the 7970 and sorry the 6970 it was 7970 would be a lot better of a deal but it is a 6970 and that ended up just not wanting to install the drivers at all and i tried flashing it down to a 60 950 2 gigabyte and it was still giving out the same problem it just would not install the drivers and so that card's kind of getting sidelined too so these are kind of two cards where i'm seeing really bizarre behavior that i've actually really never come across i've come across the blue screen when trying to install the drivers have come across that but i've never come across an amd card that shows that the card's there it's saying in windows hd 6900 but then it's like okay we're not going to install the drives and we're not going to try and store the drivers so that's a first problem for me personally so those two cards ended up ultimately though can't put them in pcs can't put them in gaming pcs they're not fit for sale though after that we had four gtx 560s come back to life and they're all working and they're all passing the stress test but one of those will need new fans as the fans just aren't working at all on one of the models it's the rev 2. and the funny thing about this gtx 560 rev 2 is that it does have that inter sort of ihs that nvidia we're putting on the 500 series it does have that removed and has direct eye contact but that in this case since the fans aren't working it's just going to help heat it up faster so that one i'll have to uh maybe sideline that and then if i come into a dead graphics card with the same cooler in the past i can then just use those fans and then we'll have a working card and then we had the gts 450 and that ended up working fine so we got five cards out of 18 in total that i would be comfortable putting in real low end like we're talking sub 200 with a keyboard and mouse and all that stuff that i'd be comfortable flipping and so overall it's not the worst case scenario but i was kind of hoping i'd get that 580 working flawlessly as well as that 69.70 and we just didn't so that was kind of for me those were the two cards i really wanted to work well we had two of the 69 70s but one of them just flat out didn't work and so that was when you throw that into the mix if those cards ended up working we would have had a really good score i would have been over the moon but we ended up coming away with what i'd call maybe break even uh paying 50 aussie dollars for five sort of potatoes is okay and you're probably like well brian you got 18 cars there's a lot more cards there and so what we'll do is we'll break down out of the 18 cards what really happened and so initially we got four cards that just really aren't going to do anything when it comes to flipping three of those agp and then we had one of the cards was this radeon r5 i don't know if you guys remember but it was like this crossfire card and amd was like marketing and it's hey you can get this graphics card couple it up with your amd apu you get double the fps and the problem is is you also get double the stuttering and i don't think anyone tried this or really anyone recommended this back in the day because it was it was pretty bad i think i tried it once and it was just a horrible stuttery mess so that's sort of like that's not a card that i'm going to be using either so we're down to 14 cards out of 18. and then we had out of that we had four complete potatoes so that was a 7900 gs a sort of this uh business nvidia card which is way old this is just not going to play games and then we have these two other potatoes like a 4350 so that leaves us now down to 10 cards and out of those 10 cards we had three that were just completely gone with no heat coming out of the dies meaning that they're just there's no chance i'm getting them to work and that was the 6970 and also a it says on the code name 955 so if someone knows what this card is i think it's an nvidia card but i don't know the which card exactly it is uh i know it's a potato though because the heatsink is really small and it's not really going to do much but if someone knows what this card is then do let us know in the comments section below and then we also had the broken quadro which i would have liked to have worked i think that could play games if we got that to work but there's just again no heat coming out of the die it was just not going to work so now we're down to seven remaining cards and so out of those seven remaining cards the 580 and the 6970 aren't working properly at the moment and then we've got those five cards left over so this ended up being in total one adventure that's all i'm gonna say and untested for me it's always an adventure uh personally it's kind of break even i didn't really lose that bad i didn't win but i had the chances of winning and i think that's the most exciting things i know some people are going to be like brian you know you've wasted all that time testing and cleaning and i guess that's the whole fun of it and anyone who's a used tech enthusiast will know some of the best fun you can get in this industry is picking up that stuff really cheap and the person who's selling it thinks it doesn't work so they let it go for an absolute bargain then you get it back and you either clean it or just do something move some debris or something like that and then you get it working again and it's just a really good feeling it's it's one of the best feelings in used enthusiast tech and it's one of the reasons why i just love doing untested stuff as well as you know the the downside is kind of it sucks as well especially when you get completely hosed a hundred percent that's uh it's one you've got to look out for but today we came out okay so i'm kind of like coming out okay going yep had the experience and we got some cards to boot so not too bad but also from that deal we did get those i7 cpus i was told that they definitely work and then we got that 1660 ti for a really good price too and that works perfectly so in in total we came out with a really good deals i'm definitely gonna have to go through those hard drives as well see which ones work and which don't i'll be flying through those because i'm sure probably like half of them just judging by what was untested here today in the gravis cards i'm sure a lot of those will be not working properly some of them might work so that'll be interesting to go through those hard drives but you guys probably want to know with gpus what's going on right now and i'm seeing prices just come down and they're coming down really quick and in fact i'm going to make a dedicated video on it because i think people will want to know what to do going forward should i wait a little bit longer or should i buy now and that's the biggest thing people be waiting for and i think the best time to buy would be once all those crypto cards are flooding the market and i don't see them flooding the market just yet so i think prices will come down a little bit more but there's lots to talk about in the industry in terms of me also talking to retailers getting the word on the street and looking at other components in the industry because right now is a very weird time to be in a tech enthusiast but it is looking like it is coming finally back in favor of the gamer getting some decent prices i'll keep you guys updated in a more in-depth video tomorrow so if you want to see that one do stay tuned by hitting the sub button ringing that bell and also if you um was a behind the scenes member at christmas time i was telling you guys about some of those economic indicators that were happening and i was just selling a lot of my stuff at christmas i just had this sell out sale and i was very glad in hindsight that i did that because i definitely stock piled the tech yes coffers and that's allowed me now to have a bit of a buffer to get a heap of good deals going forward and trust me i say this i'm definitely waiting for the good deals to come and hopefully you guys are too so if you want to get that kind of behind the scenes access and for as little as a dollar a month you become a tech yes member and get access to those vlogs i'll be making one very shortly for you guys too talking about the recent uh economic announcements behind the scenes some things that happened there and also with that aside we do have the question of the day which comes from smiley face and they ask how would you start selling used pcs in how do you market yourself such as are you using facebook ebay etc it'd be great in your if you could share your insights on where and how to start mentally drained from an eight to five call center job and uh happy to help with this one since you know you are working hard and you got little time i know what it's like to have very little time in your hands and so getting into it i would start with marketplace as well as if you're in australia gumtree or maybe in america there's some other website that you guys can use over there it just depends where you live ultimately but find those apps that are direct people to people and there's real no middleman taking a cut out of the money ebay takes a cut they take like 15 percent and then people got to post it so generally with ebay the prices are going to be a lot higher for pretty much everything as opposed to local deals where it's a lot easier for people to sell their stuff and so you'll get really good deals searching locally as well as if you're selling gaming pcs you've got instant gratification there you've got this gaming pc is ready to go come pick it up so someone can copy it up right now they love that so for me personally i use marketplace a lot facebook marketplace is a really good place to sell gaming pieces in australia it's just overtaking gumtree by a complete long shot over the years gumtree was top dog and then sort of facebook marketplace just came out of nowhere and then that's just been writing ever since so me personally i just market my stuff on facebook i use facebook marketplace a lot if there's some rare parts that aren't going to gain a lot of traction locally but i know maybe someone in australia even worldwide want to get their hands on that ebay can be really good for that and sort of maximizing stuff for really rare items so hopefully that answers that question and with that aside i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon and uh that's pretty much it the untested gravis cards hope you guys enjoyed this journey and i'll catch you in the next one and until then peace out for now bye [Music] you
