welcome to pc ultra clean episode 3, where today 
we're going to be taking this absolutely filthy pc   and we're going to be turning it into what i 
would consider a brand new looking pc where if   along the way we come into any problems we're 
going to detail them and also fix them up. Now   this pc came in from a friend they actually 
said Bryan we saw the pc ultra clean series   and we want you to just give this pc some real 
tech yes ultra clean loving and i was like okay   well uh they said look we want to help you out 
for your services so my friend is a naturopath   so he actually is going to be giving me five tubs 
of cinnamon and honey so i can put that in my tea   so i'm very happy and also some other goodies and 
in return i'm going to be turning this thing in   and making it work again however i'm probably 
making this sound like it's easier said than done   this is the filthiest come through yet in 
the series there is gunk in the front of   the pc there's like this mixture of oil and 
dirt on the cpu fan it's almost like someone   was i i don't know my experience when someone 
smokes and they game in the same room and   there's a lot of dust in there it makes this real 
thick residue of dust it's nothing fun to clean   but we're going to be doing a three-phase step 
on this where we're going to be dusting it all   down first taking all the components out and 
then cleaning all the components individually   and also the case itself and then putting it all 
back together and then seeing what problems are   wrong now the person who did bring it in they 
said look brian the ssd we believe is faulty   so they've given us another ssd to change 
over but as you know with computer problems   what what seems like one problem may turn into 
a plethora of other problems and you also may   be wondering too you're like brian why are you 
sounding like you're excited to clean this pc   and that's because tech yes loving is one thing 
that i do so sit back wherever you are in the   world and enjoy the show hey bro are you tired 
of seeing this annoying activate windows message   then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you 
covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code   bftyc you can get activated today works for 
windows 11 pro 2. links in description below and we've pulled everything apart and what i've 
done is i've separated this into two piles this   one over here is going to be the alcohol 
wipes and wd-40 pile basically we're not   putting that in the ultrasonic cleaner then this 
pile over here we're going to be putting all this   through the ultrasonic cleaner and seeing 
just how it brings all this stuff up i mean   look at this gunk look at that fan i mean 
that's absolutely filthy so let's get on with it   i haven't even booted this thing up and checked 
the specs yet but it's got a gtx 1063 gigabyte   and for the cpu we are looking at oh man my 
finger ain't going to be able to get that off oh a nice 760 6700 finish him and now we're here with the first phase of all 
this cleaning done and that is the motherboard   the gpu the power supply and the big fans and 
also the front panel so we're going to go out   there now and do the second phase and that's 
where we're going to clean that case down and   all the other big components however you may have 
noticed this msi gpu is sporting a different fan   now and that's because when we're cleaning it the 
fins just broke off they were very brittle so i   i mean that can happen but it also has to 
do with the fact that my thumb did collide   with the fan while it was spinning but not to 
worry we do have another fan here that we've   sort of uh retro fitted on and hopefully it even 
does a better job than the original fan but we'll   find out if that's true or not when we do the 
temperature test let's go finish this rig off so so we're finally finished now cleaning that 
case and we're going to leave this here   out overnight because this case was just so much 
more dirtier than what i thought it would be like   here's all the uh cleaning cloths that we used to 
get all the dirt off just that inside of the case   so this thing was absolutely filthy and so what 
i did after i cleaned it all down was i gave it a   final coat just a massive coat of multi-purpose 
spray which i'm going to leave there overnight   to really just let it all sink in and then in the 
morning i'll give it a blow job with the with the   data vac and um then also we'll start putting this 
pc together finally and seeing how it turns out tonight so finally we've completed the build after all   that cleaning and tech yes 
loving its time to fire it up hey   and here we are now the next morning finish this 
pc i've booted it up into a game of apex legends   just to test the fps out and the fps is smooth on 
high settings we're getting around 70 fps at 1080p   then at low settings around about 100 fps so this 
pc is more than capable of playing games at 1080p   and the temperatures was the most surprising 
thing because i changed that fan over on the gpu   and i kind of got a feeling it's running better 
than stock now because the fan is really quiet   but the gpu won't go over 70 degrees so the 
most i saw in a stress test was 68 degrees   and to be honest that fan just crumbled to 
pieces and so perhaps over the years the   plastic just got really weak and then we washed 
it and that just pretty much was the straw that   broke the camel's back sort of thing but in terms 
of adding parts into the build there was nothing   we had to really change out except just a lot 
of cleaning and as we saw in yesterday's uh   finishing off of this case there was just so 
much dirt and grime that came off this thing   i'm guessing the person who had it originally 
never gave it a clean at all since when they built   it and since in this point in time so i'm grateful 
that we could bring this pc up to what it should   be when it was originally built and even then i 
think we've added some finishing touches like the   extra fan on the graphics card so i'm really happy 
with this piece of work if you guys enjoyed this   one then be sure to hit that like button for us 
also let us know in the comments section below   what you're thinking about this uh whole build 
right here would there be things that you'd do   differently or change i just think that we've just 
gone with the og let's clean it up and replace as   little as possible and get it working really well 
and that's exactly what we did here now a lot of   people are asking about the ultrasonic cleaner 
basically it's one that i get off aliexpress i   every time i guess i do this ultra clean series 
the ultra clean comes from the ultrasonic cleaner   that's why i call it that and so that thing just 
really really just goes to work on all the parts   that you chuck in that thing and i just use hot 
tap water and then i use the 70 degree setting and   i give it 15 minutes and i was really surprised 
because this time i decided really not to clean   anything before i put it in the ultrasonic cleaner 
i just wanted to see how it would go and what it   would do and it came out really like better than i 
expected it just basically cleaned the parts from   tip to toe without me even touching them so i put 
the uh especially those big 20 centimeter fence   i decided okay well we can wear we can weigh 
some alcohol wipes trying to clean them   or we can just see if the ultrasonic cleaner 
can go a step further and clean that stuff off   without even any intervention and that's exactly 
what it did if you guys are going to be doing a   lot of cleaning especially when it comes to pc 
parts then i can definitely swear by this thing   it's really just the way it brings up the stuff 
and then after we do that clean we get all the   water off and then we add in the multi-purpose 
and i definitely feel like this combo   cannot be beat in terms of the finished product 
that it brings up but also on top of that   i feel like it's really efficient in start to 
finish so here it is a pc that looked like it came   out of the dumpster to now looking like it's brand 
new and so when i present this pc back to rick   i'm pretty sure that's the person who's dropped 
it off they're going to be over the moon with   it i just know they are because yeah when they 
dropped it off i'm pretty sure they thought that   this was a bit too much of a task for 
good old tech yes but when i saw it i just   my eyes lit up there was a smile a certain aspect 
that i knew what it could be you could see that   potential anyway guys if you see potential in 
tech yeah city videos then you know what to do   hit that like button hit the sub and ring the bell 
and i've also got the question of the day here   which comes from sanjay chappelle and they ask 
looks like that motherboard was missing the   original metal cpu cooler backplate how did you 
deal with that so when i'm missing a backplate   on my motherboard my first instinct is to go 
through my i o shield bin which over the years   all the dead motherboards i've always kept the 
back plates from those motherboards and sometimes   they they're close enough to fit and you just 
jiggle around with them a little bit and you'll   get something that's similar or you might have 
a direct replacement so if you guys ever have a   faulty motherboard and it's just completely toast 
just keep some of the parts off that motherboard   including the i o shield because it might come 
in handy in the future anyhow hope that answers   that question and i'll catch you guys in the 
next tech video very soon peace out for now bye is
