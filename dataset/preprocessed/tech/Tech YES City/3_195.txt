it's currently a Tuesday night it's dark and stormy outside and while everyone's at home watching Netflix and chilling i'm going to be out hunting some used pc part-time since it's actually pretty surprising because right now i've went on facebook marketplace and uh gumtree good old gametree and i found a heap of parts on facebook marketplace so far actually we found two r9 280s three gigabytes we got them for 80 aussie dollars each we're gonna go pick them up right now we've also found an x370 motherboard put down a hundred aussie dollars and that one was pretty funny because they haggled back and forth like they're like 120 i'm like no max i'm gonna pay for this 100 bucks 110. i'm like got my hundred dollars here then they're like yep 100 okay okay cool come pick it up right now there is also a 1050 ti which we put in an offer of 100 they've accepted we're gonna go pick that up really soon as well then in terms of all these other parts i'll just put some of the listings up on the screen that we're throwing down offers on we've got 50 dollars for 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory that's aussie by the way too it'd be like 40 usd but with that aside let's go jump in the tech yes mobile and put them use price performance parts capes on and get some used pc parts ons for february 2021. are you looking for a motherboard looking for a motherboard looking for a motherboard if you are looking for a motherboard then the x570 phantom gaming velocitator from asrock is one of the best tell me with wi-fi 6 2.5 g land high quality on-board audio solution and a 14 phase power design this will power the latest ryzen 9 5950x and it has a great aesthetic and it won't set you back too much links in description below to find out more [Music] so we now just picked up three different graphics cards which is pretty cool because it does mean what i was saying back last month is kind of coming true like the four gigabyte and under vram cards are the ones to get miners aren't snapping these up and they're coming in at really good prices so i picked up an r9 283 gigabyte for 80 aussie like 60 usd around there that's pretty good value especially price performance then we got a 1050 ti for 100 aussie dollars and now we just picked up a gtx 670 and this is really weird the weirdest thing about it was that it was meant to be an r9 280 but when i went to pick up the card i was handing the guy over the eighty dollars and i was checking the card and it said the serial for 670 and i pulled him up on it i said dude this is a gtx 670 not an r9 280 and like honestly nowadays an i9 280 would be way more desirable than the 670 just because of the three gigabytes versus the two gigabyte vram buffer in that sense and that that extra one gigabyte will come in handy especially at 1080p so he was like yeah it is a 670 you're right you looked at it and he was apparently sold it as a 280 and put it in his girlfriend's computer and just she never noticed because she was just playing games so i guess that's the big thing right if if the card does the job then who really cares but he ended up selling me that to for 50 aussie dollars instead of 80 so i was like yep that's cool i'll put pick that up anyway that's still solid price performance and honestly the card looks like it's brand new like it looks like no one's really used this graphics card but but the funniest thing is right now where we are there's actually a power blackout in this whole area so it's like really dark and the people were waiting out the front when i when i went there i was like what's going on here and they're like oh it's a power block out and i was like oh okay that makes sense because like everyone's lights are out around here and the street lights are all out but anyway from here on in there's even more good news and that is we've got one more gpu to pick up and it's only 10 minutes around the corner and that's for 60 aussie dollars for an r9 270 so man what like yeah we're getting lucky already this is tuesday nights i'm going to make that my officially the new parts hunt of the month day because this is this is good [Music] [Music] and now we're at our final destination and this is the pizza hut and this is where we filmed the gas station video actually this is pretty pretty funny location if you guys haven't seen that one that's where we did uh did the video where you shouldn't be buying pc parts at the gas station that's just my opinion though but what we got here was the last deal this was the motherboard the gaming k7 the x370 motherboard now the reason i got this board especially if you're thinking oh my hundred dollars is probably too much for an x370 board but this is just one of those boards where they had those led lights on the ram slots and i really liked that look like when aureus came out with his design i don't know some people didn't like it i really was digging it like low key man i was loving them leds around the ram slot so i want to kind of do a build like that uh you know like a bling bling build so for a hundred aussie can't complain especially since it does support ryzen 3000 so hoping to pick up a cheap ryzen 3 000 gpu and by the way i'm also waiting wondering why i'm in the passenger seat i'm waiting for two large pizzas and it's two for one tuesday so you get a deal right you get two pizzas for the price of one i mean what's there not to love that's 15 aussies so that's like 12 you asked for two large pizzas man that's a deal right there always getting them deals down under and this was the gpu that we picked up after the other one and this was this time it was my bad i actually booked up an r9 270 for 60 dollars but the guy never got back to me and i didn't realize i also booked up and i just put out a heap of messages so when i do the part-time i put out so many different feelers and we got here at gtx 960 for 80 aussie dollars so we actually when it because what i did was on the message was i just put out the offers and i just say if you're interested just text me the address so he text me the address if they accept the offer and then um i was like oh he's like oh it's for the gpu so i thought it was the r9 270 because the guy was messaging me back there but this guy just messaged me directly to my phone but the gtx 960. so we ended up getting that and you guys are probably wondering with the upbeat tune in my voice probably one of them why are you so happy and it's actually a couple of reasons uh one we've got a heap of good deals in this crazy crypto environment especially on graphics cards the second is the nighttime hustle man on a random week night i'm going to be going down this route so much more because we got uh five different pickups in under three hours it's insane how cheap and how good it is to pick up parts on weeknights instead of weekends so i'm going to be doing this more often people message you back quicker you just get everything done much more efficient there's no traffic it's just such a breeze and another thing is too i love driving at night listening to beats while i'm just picking these deals up so let's go cop them pizzas though and get back to the techy studio and see what we're gonna get in day two and now we're back at the tech yes studio taking a quick look what we've got here we got 100 180 eighty and fifty so that leaves us with a tally of three hundred and ten aussie dollars so far but maybe when i do these part signs i'm gonna start them off at night time now from here on in and uh try and pick up deals like this and then the next day go see les or something like because as i said before just tonight was just an absolute amazing night especially i mean you guys probably thinking like some of you guys were thinking well some of these gpus are potatoes brian but i mean like for me it's a lot of fun like i can put together some really good price performance uh pcs with these gpus especially at these prices given the crypto environment right now speaking of that crypto environment i mean my fingers across for a crash and it's possibly looking like that prayer is starting to be answered so with that prayer starting to be answered we could see prices hopefully returning back to normal and things getting back to normal but on that note you guys have been requesting that i bring the bogan back they get old barrigan mate so tomorrow what we're going to do is we're going to make that call we're going to jump on good old game tree we're going to try and find a deal and bring back that request for you guys and of course we're just going to look for some news parts as soon as we wake up because this tally so far is actually it's been it's been good it's a breath of fresh air i didn't think i'd pick up four gpus in one night at good prices oh hey dane how you going mate good thanks how are you yeah not bad um i see you've got an ad up here on gamtree for uh some ddr4 memory yep yeah you got two eight like gigabyte stick kits or something yeah so there's the one that's uh 2400 megahertz and the other one's two six six six megahertz okay uh if i was to pick up the both of those kits uh what would be a price you could uh do us i've got one trailer that's just um offered me this morning 110 for that for both of them so if you match it or and it's just depending on who who gets there first because i've already been stuffed around a little bit with these ones so i'm not holding it's just whoever gets there all right mate well i'll be up there and i'll come and get 110 cash in your hand in a couple hours if that's all right yeah look i'm not um i'm not finished work until um let's see what am i add to do you reckon you could get um like how far away from you sorry how far away just after two yeah i could probably do that for you mate that wouldn't be a problem just uh just text us the address to this number and uh 2 p.m sounds about right all right that sounds good man okay cool mate all right like it might be a bit a bit of a time before i texture just because it just doesn't work yeah no all right getting stairs yeah yeah mate no worries all right too easy i'll um i'll let you know all right thanks mate all right see you later say bye bye a bit rusty with that bogan voice but that was definitely a pretty good score 110 for 32 gigabytes ddr4 uh let me know in the comments do you guys like the second version or the first bird i think the second version was more natural like people were like okay this guy's legit he's the legit bogan i think if that's yeah 2021 we need a bit of legit bogans we're bringing that back in terms of other deals on gumtree or gametree we didn't have much here i mean there was really like i'm looking through high and low and there's a lot of just garbage up there a lot of garbage and so i did put in an offer for a couple of power supplies there weren't any numbers i could call but at the same time i kind of uh anyway we're gonna go pick up some parts hopefully we'll go see les as well so we'll quickly go see les we'll go pick up this ram and then we'll see what we've got this month on the table because i have looked at other things as well there was like a ryzen 5 2600 but they wanted 180 for it i just said 160. kind of keen to stop at 160 because of course it is um two generations old now for being the six core 12 thread and that's the thing when you look at a 2600 and then you look at the price of say a 2678v3 you always got to keep that in the back of your head it's like okay well this one's this price this is this price i can just go with this and i'd be able to put together a better value for money rig with based on online prices so so let's get through day two of this beautiful used pc parts on [Music] and now we're back at the tech yes studio and the person didn't message us about the 32 gigabytes of ram until i literally just got home now but i'm going to paypal them the money they're happy with that they can post it over to us so that bogan call was at least all for something so we ended up getting that deal but we'll add that on that was 110 we got seven pcs here we ended up checking out less seeing what he had seven pcs we got a power supply here for a thousand watts we got that for thirty dollars as well let's check that and said it was working fine and then we got two gpus this one here we had one of these these have been popping up all over the place lately these r7 250 x's so that's got one of those for 15 then we got a 750 ti for 35 i don't know if this is the one gig or the two gig model i believe they i don't know if they i think they did release a one gig model just memory has to serve me better sometimes but hopefully this is the two gig model if it is we've got a little cool flipping graphics card on our hands which adds to the fact that we got six gpus this month so this is the thing i'm going to be talking about right now is like even though there's this whole crypto boom i'm starting to see that deals are coming up and it's just the deals that the crypto miners don't want and you can still get some really enjoyable frames i mean an r9 280 for example is going to be able to play fortnite and dota 2 and all that stuff absolutely fine and probably even play the latest call of duty cold war for instance fine as well so really loving what the budget markets bring into the table where it's not overpriced and i think that's the way we're going to be going here until all this crypto stuff just goes belly up well i hope it goes belly up but until that time we're not really going to be focusing too much on new parts because it's just a messed up market there and of course you've got that demand from gamers who want the latest and greatest stuff thrown on with the crypto miners as opposed to this stuff there's really only that market that just wants to play games and we're seeing the demand there and at least the pricing is absolutely awesome so we've got here uh three fourth gen i5 systems you did them for 210 in total where one of them had ram one of them had didn't boot okay and stuff like that but we'll be able to fix them up patch them all up and get them working these are similar we got another three i5 systems with the z200 series and then we had a z400 series which i immediately jumped at for 150 with 16 gigabytes of ram and the e5 16 20 xeon so that's four cores eight but i know it's at least four cause eight threads so similar to an i7 back in that era but even then we can then put a 6 core 12 threaded xeon in that and turbo charge that thing not to mention they do put pretty beefed up power supplies in the z 400 series so all that in total we hit up less for 8 ninety for seven monitors where the seven monitors was one i think i've negotiated 190 for 224 inches to 322 inches and two 19 inches and then we have these three graphics cards uh four graphics cards here we picked up last night for three ten um that leaves us to like twelve hundred and then we got the ram for a hundred and ten so that leaves us with thirteen hundred and ten aussie dollars for this month's score and we got a heap of different pc parts this month it's been absolutely amazing i hope you guys have enjoyed this parts hunt so far and what's going on with the market is in terms of flipping it's i'd say the market is at sort of like a slow season where it's not really moving that fast but at the same time it's starting to pick up a little bit where january i would easily say january was the worst month i didn't have really any sales coming through and then starting to pick up february is definitely starting to pick up and i think uh continuing on it will get a little bit better because again people are going to need pcs wherever they are in the world and um it depends where you are ultimately too with your local markets but things have been picking up for me personally so that's a good thing and uh keep going you just keep going you just keep rolling keep rolling with the punches you keep going forward brothers and that's what it's all about at tech yeah city and of course you keep picking up those deals and i mean always look at the price performance too don't forget about that but in the meantime do let us know in the comments section below what was your favorite deal of today and february 2021's use pc part time of the month as i love reading your thoughts and opinions as always but one thing i'm going to say before i get on out here nighttime hunting is so much better nighttime hunting is so much better than anything else like there's the traffic there's no traffic today when we're coming back from lesser's place massive traffic literally added over an hour on top of our times here just traveling today so if anything expect to see a little bit more of today's style of pc parts hunting in the future where i'm going to be out doing more night style nightlife with that synth wave music going and getting those beats going and doing a bit of a nighttime hustle and hopefully you guys have really enjoyed the ride i'm sort of getting a little bit happy again because this whole used scene is starting to get popping once again starting to pop off aka papa lopping just like this question of the day here which comes from amir bahar lagaran365 and they say thanks for the video just a question does studio drivers they're talking about the nvidia drivers in 2021 with rtx 3000 series and dlss 2.0 technology give better performance etc when compared to current g-force or not i don't see any video talked about those studio drives anymore after they're released one to two years ago so the studio drivers when they first came out they were mainly about getting those adobe performances and being more about stability nowadays for me it's very simple if i'm playing games and predominantly games on my nvidia card i'll be using the geforce drivers and then if i'm doing work on the nvidia card for instance using adobe premiere pro a lot i'll be using the studio drivers usually the geforce drivers come out before the studio drivers because they're just focused on getting the game optimizations out as soon as possible and the studio drives are more about stability in programs like adobe at least that's what i have been told and that's what i can see when i download either of the driver sets so hopefully that answers that question and with that aside if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you on the next one very soon peace out for now [Music] you
