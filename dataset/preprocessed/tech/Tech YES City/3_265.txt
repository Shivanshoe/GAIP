in a world of dust-filled auto-tuned underperforming pcs one yes man is here to save us all this is pc housecall the desktop workstation this is something that over the last few years for me personally has changed a lot and the main factor here is that my desktop workstations nowadays are always overclocked and that's simply because time is just so important to me or more specifically time efficiency where if i'm overclocking my systems and extracting extra performance that means i'm then saving time in my workflow and i've recently done this on the 3950x which is a 16 core 32 threaded amd processor and i've also done that with a 7980xe and that's an 18 core 36 thread processor and so recently i was talking to my good friend zai who is also a fellow youtuber under the banner of rocket jump ninja and he has an 18 core 36 threaded 10980xe which is pretty much the same cpu as the 7980xc that i had and he wants me to come over and work some tech yes magic to make this desktop or this workstation overclocked now something does need to be said before we get into this vlog today and that is that overclocking and work generally have never gone together but i think with the amount of quality gear out there for instance if you've got a very good power supply like a platinum rated power supply that has very low ripple suppression and say for instance you've got a very good motherboard with a very stable vrm then you'll be getting a lot cleaner power to your components and that will give you generally a lot of a bigger headroom to get more performance out of your gear same goes for your ddr4 memory and also in turn even your gpu but since we are working with a workstation and a lot of the times this is for a lot of people their livelihood you want to spend more money to get the quality gear so i feel like this is where those two things come together to make overclocking a viable option so what we're going to do now is jump in the tech yes mobile head to zai's place and then start seeing what his computer is currently running at and then apply the overclocks and also stress test them to make sure he is stable now the stability thing is a huge factor it's gonna be a big focus of today's video but in the end when you've got things set up right you will be saving a lot of time in your workflow so let's go give that pc some tech yes lovin [Music] and here we are going through a tuning of this pc right here x299 and it's an azus model now basically the different motherboard manufacturers may have some teething pains if you're overclocking and especially if you see a video like this where in today's video i'm tuning zei's pc on an azus motherboard there may be different settings within the actual bias itself that have different names or they appear different on say an asrock motherboard or an msi motherboard or a gigabyte motherboard and so what we did right here basically we did a bit of a fast track with his overclock and that's because of course i don't have days and days to spend at zai's house overclocking his machine for him i've got to do my own work however i have had a lot of experience with the 18 core itself the 10 980 xe or subsequently before that the 79 adxe and that likes to run at around 4.4 to 4.5 gigahertz i find that is the overclocked sweet spot of course there are people out there that will definitely get these things to 4.8 4.9 i've even heard people getting these to 5 gigahertz on all 18 cores however at these speeds once you go past 4.4 4.5 i find that the wattage and the power consumed just really starts to lose control so that extra 500 megahertz for example you are now using a lot more power and of course with that extra power comes the increased risk of instability and your pc potentially crashing while you're working so what we've set up here for zai is a 4.4 gigahertz overclock at 1.14 volt we ended up tuning this down to 1.14 volt with a load line calibration of level 6 and it seems to be working stable and we're running cinebench now the thing about cinebench r20 is it's one of the most strenuous tests you can run on your cpu and in fact it's so strenuous that even at this 4.4 gigahertz level we are getting power consumption at around 300 watts so it is juicing quite a lot of power and i feel like this is that when you guys see me in cooler reviews i'll talk about having a cooler that is 280 millimeters versus the 240 mil solutions and the reason for that is i just feel like they give you that bit of extra cooling on these high-end overclocks and high-end cpus like the 10980xe and of course if you're on the amd side if you're going to be using the 16 core and overclocking that those 280 mils just do that little bit extra in terms of giving you that a little bit more and they don't of course cost a whole lot more too so what zai has here is the 240 mil corsair h100i rgb platinum and so the temperatures are even at 4.4 gigahertz they are reaching 100 degrees now these cpus are okay to go up to 115 degrees but of course running your cpu at around 100 degrees i'm sure a lot of people don't feel comfortable with that but what we're going to do is we're going to take this thing now and get zaida go for a test drive in adobe premiere pro which is the main application that he does with his work and i want to see how this feels compared to how it felt before [Music] so after using that in adobe premiere pro how do you feel about your pc actually really good it was way smoother than before when i was editing 1080p before no problems then when i put the 4k footage in there it just really slowed down now though it seems like i'm just adding editing 1080p again so really really cool i have to use it more to really determine the performance but so far seems amazing so tech seven seems to be working well actually i was going to comment on the tech yes loving on this pc that it's only received a phase one from here on in we're going to give it two more phases of tech yes loving wow that's um i mean one phase was all it needed so i can't imagine what we're gonna get after phase two and three okay so i've just got to ask one more question are you and your pc ready for these next two phases me personally i can't handle it i like to keep things smooth but that thing's a beast see what you can do uh wait zai uh one more question uh has this changed your life changed my life i didn't have a life before this tech yes loving each phase sold separately get ready for phase two so one important thing to do on pcs in my opinion is to set the power states so that they are i guess essentially the pc is ready to go as soon as possible i mean we're talking you know sometimes nanoseconds and milliseconds and stuff like that but i always want to make sure my pc is snappy especially when i'm doing a lot of actions per minute so you'll notice here that it's the cpu is bouncing around from 4.4 gigahertz to 1200 megahertz or 1.2 gigahertz that's the lowest state that the x299 cpus will go to as this 1200 megahertz state here but this is essentially known as c1e or enhanced halt state where it immediately goes down to these levels to save power quickly if the cpu is not being utilized it's a very i love c1 in enhanced halt states i recommend everyone use them otherwise your cpu can potentially just be chewing up power all the time and so what in the bios i go to this setting and i actually disable the c states below that so c3 and c6 for example there may even if you're on a laptop you can i believe you can go as low as like c7 or c8 so they can get lower and lower in power consumption but of course when you get when it comes to work you want your cpu ready to go so going from c1 to c0 that's your normal state you want that to be quick and fast but at the same time you still want to utilize the power savings so the biggest difference is those two states going from c0 to c1 and that's what we want to take advantage of here we can see it just working in action and it's just magic when it is working so we've got our for instance when we're using up 300 watts on the cinebench r20 we're now using up around 70 watts while we're in this state so that's actually really good we've tuned this to a level where on idle this system is using up i guess ideal power consumption for what it is and another thing as we're doing in windows is we're going to go on to power settings in windows itself i like to leave my computer on high performance mode and i like to turn off all the additional settings like usb selective suspend all these settings that could potentially encumber you if you come into an app or a program that works in where it wants to utilize your usb all the time i don't know if you've been in premiere pro before and you've been using a usb mic and you're like hey why does this usb mic not work that can be because of usb selective suspend if you're a streamer i would recommend turning this setting off as well in the power options another thing is you can do is on high performance mode is disable the sleep so if you're going afk for a little bit of time you come back your cpu doesn't have to wake up again now of course the disadvantages to this is more power consumption but i guess if if this is your life and this is your workstation and this is what you do for a living you want to save time and i think that's the most important thing is how much is your time worth so for me it is worth quite a bit and time is very valuable so i like to make sure i'm saving this and if people recommend that i tune up their workstations i'm going to be applying the same philosophy and principles that i apply to my own workstation but another thing i will mention about zai in particular is he's using eight dimms uh with 128 gigabytes of memory now surprising this 10980xe has uh 3 600 megahertz on all these eight dimms on 128 gigabytes which means that the imc on this cpu is very strong so i think zai is uh he's lucky here to be able to run 3600 megahertz across eight dimms on this cpu so very good imc the memory works absolutely phenomenally well so that's going to give him a slight performance bump over just running four dimms too the final phase of tech yes loving is here we've installed unigine heaven and we're also running msi afterburner here and we've pulled up this right here this is the frequency curve to the voltage so what this will do is we can edit the curve here and make it so that this card runs at 1800 megahertz and this is the sweet spot that i found i copy-pasted this off i actually tested a lot of different frequencies too but i copy pasted this from another youtuber i'll put their link in the description below but this works extremely well where you just grab this curve right here and you hold down shift on your keyboard then you can just drag it down to 18 so you want to make sure this top point is up to it's around 800 i find 1812 megahertz is like where this card likes to go although i'm on this i'm not on my usual mouse so it's hard for me to get eight now i'm just gonna leave it at 814. so now with the voltages right here we're going to zoom into that and the good thing this is why another reason i like heaven i know a lot of people say oh why do you use unigine heaven there's much more strenuous benchmarks out there the reason i use heaven is back to that time saving it's super quick to load up you can max the settings on 8 speed msaa you can put it on ultra quality and you're still going to be using you can see the power there it's they're still juicing the card to near 100 on the graphics card so this is a really good benchmark for quickly overclocking and finding and homing in on your where your gpu should be if you're overclocking or in this case under vaulting so unigine heaven is great in that regard you can just do stuff on the fly live changes and it's going to work extremely well but back to this right here so we've dragged our curve down we can see the original line right here and we've dragged that down to 1800 megahertz now the easiest way to do this and because i don't again because i'm over at zai's house i don't have time to really check his pc from 24 7. so i'm going to bump it above what i would usually bump it you can get this down to around 800 mega 800 millivolt 806 but i'm going to give it a little bit more just to be on the safe side right so we're going to go with maybe 840 or 837 and we're going to drag that all the way up to 800 and 1814 megahertz and we're going back to this little tick right here in msi afterburner we're going to go back to this tick after we've done that and just left click that and if we look here that's going to now bring our maximum curve to 1800 megahertz and we're going to be running at 800 millivolts or just a little bit over so the beauty of this now is if we look at this power consumption right here we can see automatically the green bar has just gone down so much that is your difference between these two profiles and we can even see i believe the temperatures have even dropped substantially as well so that's the benefit of undervolting now the fps is not going to drop anywhere near the amount that these two settings have dropped your temperatures and your power consumption so there's the magic of under vaulting with the rtx 3000 series so if you do this on the 3 30 80 and also the 30 you're going to be seeing some really good results now of course i've upped it over what i'd usually do that because i don't want to be coming back to zai's house and going yes change this change that i just want him to have a good experience from the get-go however that being said i'm going to tell zai look keep an eye out for any crashes or anything that wouldn't usually happen when you're using this pc beforehand and i'll tell you what voltages you can up which is mainly two voltages right we can up this right here or we can up the cpu core voltage in uh the bios itself we can maybe take that to 1.16 if it starts crashing or if the gpu starts crashing we can take that to 850 millivolt but he should be okay i've locked in what i feel is pretty good settings here zaya should be good to go with his pc and uh zai how are you feeling about this i'm uh feeling good right feeling good so he's feeling good but the most important thing is is the pc feeling good i don't know brian don't [Music] know [Music] so and now we're at conclusion time after i'd say about two hours maybe three because i wanted to take zai at he's at where the rock jump ninja studio here and i wanted to take him through all the settings and what i'm doing so part of overclocking and changing these settings is understanding what we're doing in the process and that's an important thing so if something wrong happens you can then trace back the steps you've taken and make things stable again because what we saw there beforehand was the initial reaction of before and after and that was what i was hoping for this it works a lot better reaction and so going forward we've given him this snappy system that just is so responsive and that's part of i do this to all my systems by the way like benchmarking systems get the same treatment everything main rigs benchmark systems because i always believe in getting the best performance out of what you've got and that applies to used and new products and they don't get treated differently at all another thing i did on zeiss pc is also disable the spectre and meltdown updates which i'm personally not a believer of and that in turn i believe helps up the performance just that little bit more so there are things you can do on your pc to get the most out of them and this is important especially if you're gaming as well because zai is going to be tasting better fps whilst is gaming too and this is one of those funny things because i was thinking about making a dedicated video towards this where people are playing video games and they're asking me these questions of and i especially when i hear someone else's bought a pc from someone else and they ask me for troubleshooting they say my cpu is getting utilized at say 50 or 60 percent and my gpu is the same it's only getting utilized at 50 or 60 percent what's going wrong why is it bottlenecking essentially and this in turn has to do with some of these settings where if you don't have the pc set up right or i guess some of the settings in the bios itself don't play nicely with windows 10 that can cause your cpu not to run at its full state while you're gaming and that can cause potential issues with fps and so i've seen this before on both amd and intel systems it's not it's not really specific to one platform and so that's why you'll see me go in and just manually set those c states and also turn off on intel side things like the secondary speed step technology where i've seen that affect your gaming fps before and on amd's side they've got other settings in the bios for power control too so these are important things that i like to have my system just set up in that state of stop and go and that's it it's only got two states as we've seen with c0c1 stop and go and that's it other than that i'm not interested in any other settings in terms of my pc running i like to keep things simple and when i do keep things simple the results are amazing and they have been for me personally for years and i'm finding this now with workstations overclocking workstations it's an even better experience in that i'm saving a lot of time and i want to share these tips with my friends and family and you guys out there in the audience to help your workflow get better in the process too so hopefully this video is just showing you besides some of the jokes and a bit of fun with having the process hopefully it showed you how you can look at the different settings in your bios and also see how they can affect and especially in this case overclocking too how that can help you save time anyhow guys with all that out of the way with all that said and done if you guys are overclocking your systems and it's a workstation too then let us know in the comment section below if you've got any additional tips or tricks of your own or of course if there's anything else you need help with or clarification on drop a comment in the comment section below everyone around tech yes city is those beautiful open minds and we love sharing that information well at least hope we would like to just like this question of the day here which comes from rocket jump ninja one second ago and they asked would you ever roll your audience i don't think i ever would [Music] [Music] guys there's a first for everything when i saw this comment yesterday i just couldn't resist they'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
