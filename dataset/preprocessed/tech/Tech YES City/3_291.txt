the rtx 3000 series is among us and this is the rtx 3080 that i have in my hands it's the founders edition and today's video you're probably thinking what's the title and the thumbnail about brian because i'm expecting a review well this is going to tie in perfectly with my review which i'm going to be live streaming very soon so if you're new around here make sure you hit that sub button and ring that bell and also if you want to help me out on the algorithm be sure to hit that like button for us but basically the rtx 3080 you are getting so much gpu for that 700 price point or if you're in australia 1139 aussie dollars now one interesting thing about these graphics cards is that they have hdmi 2.1 native port and support on board and unexpectedly i'm calling these cards the 4k revolution in my review and the reason being is because lg have supported 4k 120 hertz on their oled displays since 2019 in the form of the b9 and the c9 models and also other models too but these are the value choices and then this year they've got the bx and the cx models which also support 4k 120 hertz however since the graphics cards that are previously out didn't support hdmi 2.1 then you actually couldn't enable 120 hertz 4k however this graphics card i took it over to my brother's house he has a lg 65 inch c9 tv now the first thing we had to do was update the firmware on his tv because before that it was only 4k 60 hertz the second thing i needed was a hdmi 2.1 cable it's very important to get a proper cable that will support this otherwise your screen will just go black because the cable can't support the throughput rates or basically the transmission rates in order to support 4k 120 hertz so now you've got your computer ready you've got your firmware updated your cable hooked up from your graphics card to your monitor or your tv in this case and all you have to do is go to the nvidia control panel and select 120 hertz and you are now gaming in 4k oled and getting really good response time so here's where the second part of the 4k revolution comes into play because these tvs are not just tvs they double down as gaming monitors so well and there's a few reasons behind this the first being the response times on these monitors are absolutely incredible when i opened up my 1000 fps camera we can see here that the response times are lower than one millisecond and this pretty much beats out all the current technology on the market including tn panels and also va and ips but another thing too however when you are gaming you want low input lag and in this case i tested out the numbers with the 1000 fps camera also to have about 5 to 10 milliseconds in input lag this input lag is quite simply phenomenal for 4k gaming where i'm used to testing input lag numbers at 1080p but since the throughput is so much heavier on the gpu and also the cable on the tv you can expect a little bit more input lag because of that however five to ten milliseconds is very good considering you are now gaming and this is the most important part with oled which the backlighting is so good for your eyes giving you better reds and greens because it emits light through those spectrums where most of those monitors that you get in your house have cheap blue leds at the core and your eyes don't see detail through blue light these are facts another fact is the rtx 3080 is the real deal if you guys have been waiting out for one of these then you definitely got my approval here at tech yes city but keep in mind 1080p gaming you're not going to see much of a difference even 1440p gaming you're not going to see as big as a difference as you will see at 4k where you're now not held back as much by your cpu and other constraints in your system and the gpu can be left to do all the work that it can do however i'm sure there's going to be the question out there where someone says this is nothing new there's already the 4k 120 hertz oled from alienware however the problem with that tv is that at least in australia this thing costs 7 000 aussie dollars i mean come on even jeff bezos would have a hard time coughing up that money for a 4k 55 inch tv though with the lg oleds coming in at a third of the price with pretty much the same specs possibly even better input lag and response times because i haven't tested the alienware monitor it just makes it such a better buy for your money and so there it is with the rtx 3080 and its capabilities of hdmi 2.1 now this is only one of the augmented benefits of the rtx 3080 and of course the 3000 series but basically at 700 bucks this thing is offering phenomenal 4k value for a gpu and of course to get that experience on those 4k monitors you're going to want the best gpu possible and besides the rtx 3090 this card right here is going to mark the best for 4k gaming and coming in at 700 bucks that price tag really isn't a half bad ask for what it's going to give you now another thing in today's video i've only shown two of the models out of the whole series of lineups i can't vouch for other models but the models i had here was the rtx 3080 founders and also the azus tough gaming both of these had the hdmi 2.1s and they worked fine with the lg c9 so i can confirm that this combination will give you 4k oled 120 hertz now one important thing is this is only for the 3000 series older series graphics cards like rtx 2000 and also amd counterpart cards at this point in time don't have native hdmi 2.1 so they won't give you support for the 4k 120 hertz over hdmi cables because they don't have that native hdmi 2.1 built in and since the lg tvs only have hdmi 2.1 in at least the 2019 and 2020 models you will need one of these 3 000 cards or of course future upcoming graphics card models to be able to get this combo that you're seeing in today's video though the tvs now the good thing is about these tvs is they aren't actually that expensive for what they are i believe in the us you can get them for as low as 1400 usd in australia you can pick them up on sale at the moment on ebay for 2 400 aussie delivered and coupled with the gpu and everything else sure it's going to be more expensive than the used price performance systems you're seeing here on the channel but at the same time it's going to give you a whole different experience of pc gaming and honestly this is why i'm calling it the 4k revolution however this isn't without teething issues since the drivers and also the tv module themselves probably aren't used to this just yet i did have some problems with the g-sync compatibility when i tried to boot up cs go for example it just went to a black screen and then said no signal so i'm sure things like this will get updates in the drivers and also the firmware on the tv themselves from lg though in the process you can game at 4k 120hz and you'll have a what i simply call a breathtaking experience though another thing is too you can get 10 bit hdr support out of these tvs and also within windows itself which makes your gaming experience even that much better anyway guys i hope this video has helped you out in making some decisions especially in the world of pc gaming if it did be sure to toss us that like and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon and also check out my review which is coming very soon too peace out for now bye [Music]
