what's new since 1909 well actually
quite a lot we now have electric cars we've got the internet
we've got tv commercial jetliners oh you mean windows 1909 to windows 2004
well in today's video we're going to see what microsoft has added
in its feature update and if the features are worth updating for
but i will say the revamp of the mouse cursor settings
especially if you're a gamer or have a mouse without minor dpi adjustments
this can help out a lot so this new feature alone with 20 increments of
sensitivity adjustment versus the original 11
in itself is worth updating windows 2004 for though let's get into the rest of
these changes hey dude i love paying 200 dollars for a windows
10 pro license said no one today's video sponsor
scd keys has you covered with a cheap windows 10 pro oem single and user
license using the tyc coupon code you can get this for as little as 13 usd
links in description below so first off if you want to check to see
if you can update to windows 2004 then you will need to be on either
update 1903 or 1909 first and if it's still not there and
available after that then microsoft apparently isn't rolling
it out to your computer yet as they don't feel comfortable doing so
that is it could bug out or it is a known issue with your current cpu
motherboard and or graphics card configuration for
instance on my 7980xe main rig that i'm using at the moment it simply doesn't
have the option to update to 2004. though besides the mouse cursor another
feature that they've rolled out that is pretty good is the reset this pc now
includes a cloud download option which if selected will reset windows from the
current version you have updated to rather than the
original build that the install was done on say for
instance if you use the usb stick that's installed 1903 and you select the
cloud option it'll now update to windows 2004 if you've
previously updated this os to windows 2004 this can save you a lot
of hassle and time and personally it's a welcome addition
to the list of features you can also now enable passwordless
sign-in from microsoft accounts on your windows 10 device
by going to settings accounts sign in options and selecting
on under make your devices passwordless enabling passwordless sign-in will
switch all microsoft accounts on your windows 10 device to modern
authentication with windows hello face fingerprint or
pin but for me personally i do this on computers already that i sell
and on benchmark rigs for example i just have the pc
offline first when i install windows and then from there i just install windows
with no password but this will definitely make
things better for say computers that are in the household that multiple people
use and they're sick of typing in passwords
all the time there's also the pin sign in option for safe mode which
previously was just your password and it's now supported on all major browsers
including chrome and firefox but what about opera
previously windows defender is now renamed to microsoft defender
and has system management mode which it will scan
and check your registry and io that's input output so basically it's becoming
more intense in the way it checks and protects your system
which is a good thing for some especially if you are very blase
about how you use your computer application guard for microsoft office
will also be rolled out in this update soon though it's not available as
i currently am doing this video and as for your start menu you can now
search using the start menu itself without having to open up a browser how
well this feature works for you is well up to you i personally really like it if
you want to search for some quick info for instance currency rates
if i want to convert the aussie dollar to usd on the fly
i can quickly do that now in the start search menu and it does a really good
job there's also been a major update to the
prediction of spelling and on top of that the algorithm used for indexing
which if it detects high disk usage which is great if you can't afford an
ssd for example it will minimize the system indexing and
free up system resources this can of course in particular help
laptops and low potato pcs so another welcome
addition with 2004 windows update windows also allows you now to rename
your virtual workspaces or virtual desktop and cortana has had
an overhaul where apparently it has much better performance and has a new
speech mode on top of that though you will have to sign into your microsoft
account so if you're like me and you don't use a
microsoft account on a lot of your computers
then this won't even be there to begin with the home group option has now been
removed from the give access and performance tabs
and there's also provide feedback tab when you right click on services
in task manager though speaking of task manager this has received an update in
its own which it now monitors your gpu
temperature and also displays the model number of
your ssd for example though the temperature readout didn't work on my
5600 xt and also the gpu scheduling update which
we'll talk about soon didn't work on the amd gpu either though
as for graphics we now have this hardware accelerated gpu scheduling
option allowing your gpu to manage its own memory better according to microsoft
which is supposed to drop latency even and improve graphics performance
though the results are currently mixed from what i'm seeing most are showing no
improvements at this point in time so if you guys want i can perhaps throw
in some old potato gpus when i test this feature out
and i've known microsoft for instance with game mode and stuff like that in
the past to have their features more tailored
towards helping out potato style computers rather than
the high-end stuff so just like the gpu temperature readout
this wasn't showing on my 5600 xt though apparently there is a registry hack
that you can manually put in if you want to get this to work though i don't
really recommend doing registry hacks especially
if you want to reverse some things in the future can cause issues
the directx 12 also now has an update for ray tracing with tier 1.1 from 1.0
which improves the efficiency of pipeline state
object additions includes the introduction of inline ray tracing and
improvements to ray tracing execution which has an adaptive algorithm to sense
the number of rays decided in proportion to the gpu execution timeline
honestly this all sounds to me like directx 12 is getting ready
for an upcoming launch of the xbox series x though some other interesting
improvements here also include texture streaming in other words prioritizing
what textures are loaded at what detail levels
stated in mips and on top of that there is texture space shading
which if a redundant space is deemed useless it simply won't draw at saving
resources there's also the new directx mesh shader
this has now been improved to reduce the steps to two instead of previously six
where the input assembler vertex shader and whole shader
now all compute from the amplification shader and tessellation domain shading
and geometry shading are now compressed into the mesh shader
this allows for more culling in these original six steps
according to microsoft and it allows for more detail at the same frame rates
so now going back to the optional features page here you can multi-select
read out additional information and browse via the latest actions button
everybody's favorite notepad and honestly i use notepad a lot so this
is a good addition for me it's got an update as well you can now
wrap around text find and replace things and you also have text
zooming line numbers and column numbers are also visible down the bottom by
default and there's also a star to show changes
are not yet saved and you can send feedback to
to microsoft within notepad itself there's also utf-8 encoding
and the ability to control shift in a new notepad window ctrl shift save as
dialog ctrl shift w to close the notepad window
there's also some bug changes that have been fixed and if you didn't know they
existed then that's good in the settings tab the
network status display has now been revamped to show more information about
your network connections showing how much data is being used
easier and what connections are now being connected to what
on the fly then windows has also improved wsl 2 linux networking
applications using localhost and windows sandbox has made bug fixes and more
control great for installing and testing
unverified apps for example and microsoft edge has had some
improvements as well bluetooth pairing has been sped up so
you don't need to go to notifications to finish pairing
microsoft have also introduced a thing called desktop analytics a cloud-based
service that requires an e3 or e5 license which i don't
personally own so i can't really tell you about this feature app volume and
device preferences has received an update it's now a little more usable
though i still much prefer the sound control panel personally
and you can now take off suggestions too in notifications and actions and if
you're into networking with cameras you've now got native support for that
too the magnifier though this has received
some updates with the keep mouse pointer settings option
offered and there's also now a reading option to change the way magnifier
behaves it also has support for dark themes and
has play selected text and caps lock or insert options available
disk cleanup can also apparently now backtrack
changes though i couldn't see this option available and there's been
improvements to foreign language ime namely korean japanese and chinese eye
control has also been updated you can now drag and drop pause
and it has more open source support and more support from things like joysticks
etc delivery of updates now gives you the
option to throttle based on absolute bandwidth
very handy feature for gamers in my opinion especially if you have
australian internet like i do you can throttle this setting so if
you're playing games and there's a windows update
that suddenly pops up in your face you won't have to worry about skipped frames
or anything like that because it won't be using up all your
bandwidth narrator itself has also received a plethora of improvements too
too many to list in this video to be honest
though you can now select from new options including donor now
increase pitch and say cap and now for the last of the updates which is
personally one of my favorite is now the narrator has the text cursor page
and this gets a cool aesthetic update which can help show the cursor easier
and you can now select from different colors and i'm really digging this one
i'm going to leave it on legit and so there it all is with the changes to
windows 2004 from 1909. if you guys enjoyed this
video then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment
section below have you had any troubles with this
update so far and are you enjoying these new
changes do let us know but i will say one thing
i mean it's still a little buggy i mean i'm trying to change my mouse settings
in the original menu and then i go back to the other menu and
it starts changing by itself so there will be some bugs
if you want to update to this newest update when it first
is released and this happened with 1909 and even 1903 before that
but overall i think some of the changes here are definitely a welcome addition
mainly for the mouse and the dx12 updates but with that out of the way if
you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that content and you
want to see the moment of drops then be sure to hit that sub button
ring that bell because we've got the windows 10 2004
optimization guide for gamers coming out very soon
can't wait to bring that one for you and i'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
