this right here is a kit lens and in my
opinion it completely sucks and i'm going to quickly show you why and you're probably wondering straight
away why is this picture so dark and that's because i haven't
changed any of the settings on my camera itself i've only changed the lens around
and there's a thing called an f-stop value and kit lenses are generally
notorious for having high values which essentially
doesn't allow as much light to come into your camera as a lower
f-stop prime and so let's change the settings
of our camera to adjust and make the same light come
in and see essentially how bad it looks compared to this lens right here now
i've had to quickly adjust the setting in my camera called the iso value
to accommodate for this higher f-stop value that doesn't allow as much light
to be let in so this lens right here we're going to
change back over it it's called a prime and then we'll quickly look at what
camera and lens setup you can get on a budget if you want to
get a good picture whether you're getting into video making on youtube
or if you're getting into streaming on a budget [Music] so hopefully what we saw with that
comparison was how important it is to get the right gear for the right job now
if you're a landscaper and you're out in the sun something like this kit lens is
going to do good i guess it's going to be a good
thing but a lot of us who want to shoot cameras especially on youtube
you're either focusing on something like 99 of the times
or the other one percent of the time you still want bokeh in the shot
so that's where a prime lens if you learn to shoot on a prime lens
you're going to experience better colors better bucket for less money
generally so with that aside let's go with some recommendations here if you
want to get some cheap streaming quality but still
get a really good picture quality similar to what you're getting here
you can go on ebay or other websites like maybe
go on your local sites whether it's craigslist or gumtree
or facebook marketplace and you can generally look for something like this
an eos 650d this is going to set you back maybe 200
like if you offer them 200 bucks you'll probably get one there's one on
uh buy it now for 275 bucks so these go around 200 to 250 dollars
usually that's what you can get them for and this will give you the option of
then getting either one of two lenses i'd recommend
if you're on a budget and that is the yongnuo
nifty 50 it's a f 1.8 so it's going to give you a very similar picture to what
you're seeing here on my camera or you can get the 35 mil
f2 if you want a bit more of a wider picture so if
you're in a very small space but you still want to get a good picture out i'd
probably recommend going with a 35 mil so basically for the money
you can get yourself for maybe 350 bucks you can get yourself something that's
going to give you really good filming quality if you're
starting out on a budget now if you're going to be streaming
you're going to want to get a microphone obviously
so this is a microphone that i'd recommend straight off the bat
for 68 you can get a usb microphone with a 16 millimeter diaphragm now i'm using
the corsair wave 3. that's because i'm sponsored by corsair
and they make a really nice microphone but it does cost an additional roughly
90 msrp than what you're seeing here and
you're not going to be getting over double the voice quality this is
pretty much going to give you 80 percent of what most microphones can
do after that you're going to be going into small
detail you're either going to get a deeper voice or you're going to be
getting all these other things that aren't going to affect someone just
talking into a microphone so if you're going to be doing that
something like this is going to serve you really well
for 68 bucks then if you want to get a cheap pair of headphones these are
the most renowned headphones in the market for value for money 29 bucks i've
got a set of these around my studio here they're called the kph 30is from coss
absolutely phenomenal value for money phenomenal sound quality they're
lightweight if you want to go out and do a workout
outside get some good audio these will do the job and they've also
got a built-in mic so if you don't want to be
sitting in a static position playing games if you're moving around a bit
you can just use these to game with your friends and they're still going to be
able to hear you absolutely fine so now we've essentially
just covered the most two important things to getting
any recording done and that is video quality and
audio quality they do say audio quality is slightly more important than video
quality but i'd say they both matter in the
grand scheme of things so you can get really good audio and
really good picture quality for literally under 500 bucks in 2020.
so the next piece of the puzzle you're going to need to connect your camera to
your computer is what's called a video capture input
so basically a lot of the time say for instance a graphics card
that's going to be outputting a vga signal
and this is going to essentially input one into your computer this is a budget
one for 25 bucks me personally i'm using the elgato cam
link 4k it's 120 bucks so it is a little bit more
expensive but it will give you better video quality
next up in the pipeline is your motherboard i don't know why this is in
japanese and the weirdest thing is i can actually read this too it's like urudora
usb dengen that means ultra usb power so this one is the b450 steel
legend and of course there's another one that i
do like and that is the b450 aorus elite now i'm looking at these two
motherboards because they represent good value
for money if you want to get into streaming or recording go grab yourself
one of these at ryzen 5 3600 and you got yourself really good
performance for gaming but also for recording videos and even streaming
and so i'm going to talk about these two motherboards it's important
instead of like i usually here at the channel recommend
uh going with a really cheap motherboard if you're just gaming but if you're
streaming there's a reason why you want to spend a little
bit more on your motherboard and that's so you can get
strong usb ports and this is most likely because you're going to be running
things like your cam link a usb microphone even a usb headset
and then you've got your mouse keyboard it might have rgb leds on it
even a stream deck if you want to spend a bit more on streaming
i'm just going to quickly take my usb headset off to make sure that these
usb ports aren't overloaded and now we're going on to the next best thing
you can do to get really good picture quality this
is something that's really underrated and that is lighting you have to have
good lighting you generally want a light coming off one angle of your
face and then you want a light over in sort
of at the other sort of degree hitting the back of your
head aka a hair light so you'll generally want two lights on your
face or your subject or whatever you're filming if you're filming a product
or a pair of headphones you generally want two lights
and then in the background there we've just got what's called a placement light
or a bit of a decoration for the set and of course we've got the computer in the
background that's got some rgb through the roof and that's
really sort of not just lighting up the scene giving it a bit of spice but
getting lighting it doesn't cost that much you can get these soft boxes i use
three of them in my studio and i've used them for years they're absolutely fine
and they only set you back around 49 bucks
if you're in australia you can get two of them for 104
aussie which would be around 75 us dollars or something like that so
you can get lighting for very cheap but it's very important to have
if you're filming at night or even if you're filming in the day
and you don't have sunlight coming in at all angles
to wherever you're filming now of course that being said if you are on a strict
budget and you can't afford lighting just make good use of sunlight it's
technically in my opinion some of the best filming and best photos can be
done in the sun so if you are out in the sun all day
do be careful i don't want you getting burnt because i want you to keep
watching my videos and we're on to the last bit and this is
monitors right if you're if you're streaming or you're gaming you
can get away with having your secondary monitor and third monitor as a
real cheap monitor a lot of the times like
this was a true story that i had came around here
someone came around they wanted to get a 240hz monitor
and i said yeah 240hz is great fluid really great gaming experience but then
they said i want to get three 240hz monitors to stream and i
said well are you going to use nvidia surround or something like that
that's where you've got all three monitors putting out
your game and he said no i'm gonna stream and i said what is he gonna
game on one and then have all your other stuff on the other two monitors he said
yes and i said you do not need three 240hz
monitors your stream does not need to be
monitored in 240 hertz so you can save a lot of money and i'll
show you guys right here you save a lot of money by picking up
some cheap 17-inch monitors for around 20 bucks you just get two of these
one to the left one to the right that is my preferred setup
if i'm streaming one to monitor my obs stream labs recording software the other
to use my main game or my main subject of
the video and then another monitor spare to do
whatever whether i'm talking to someone on skype or something like that
i've got that monitor as a spare for backup
and so even if you're in australia you can pick these up for 15 aussie dollars
on your local site this is a site called gumtree i love this site
and this one here is 15 aussie dollars that's like about 10
us dollars and you can get a vga to hdmi adapter with that
so that's going to save you a lot of money you find two of these that's 20
bucks and you got your two secondary monitors done
then you can go onto amazon buy your fancy 144 hertz monitor
or your 240hz monitor and you can be having fun
on a budget and now here we are at today's video
at the finish line and all i'm going to say is especially if you're streaming
this one's really important go into streaming software
go into your output and just make sure your encoder
is selected to your graphics card i've got a 5700
xt in my system at the moment and you can see here i'm using the
hardware that's the amd gpu to basically do all the hard work
when it comes to recording this video so that's how easy it is instead of
getting a really new beauty uh 1 000 cpu
you don't need to do that you don't need to go out and buy a 3950x
to stream minecraft or stream uh warcraft world of warcraft or stream
even call of duty war zone you can get away with the ryzen 5 3600
but basically just use the graphics card's dedicated encoder
to do all the hard work and take that off your cpu
and you'll be having happy days you'll be having a really smooth stream you'll
be getting still really good video quality i mean i'm
recording off the amd gpu encoder which is inferior than the
nvidia encoder with the rtx decoder and especially
and you guys i mean i don't know i'd love to see someone complain about the
video quality in today's video i think it's absolutely fine i've
watched it back i'm like damn it looks really nice
and bellissimo voila i i don't even know what that means i i
think i heard it somewhere so i think it's italian if it is uh let me
know in the comments i think i butchered it but
in today's video i wanted to show you guys that you can go out and build what
computer you want you can go out and get a gtx 1660 super
or a rx 5600 xt and a ryzen 5 3600 or i5 10 400
and they're going to be great choices if you're looking for good value for money
on the new market but some of these things that i'm
showing you here is just in turn if you want to get a streaming setup that looks
really good you can save money throughout the whole
process and still get something that looks just like someone who's spent
three times as much on their setup and in order to do that
it's really not that hard at all you get on this gear and if you are
serious about filming then you'll start to learn on your own
all the nooks and crannies and things that you like
and things that you don't like with your current gear because believe me the
stuff that i've recommended you here today
you are going to be able to get some really good picture and voice quality
out there for whoever wants to watch your videos
and now we've got the question of the day which comes from georges rapp and
they ask is an r5 that's a ryzen 5 1600 af
combined with the gtx 1660 super a great choice
if you want recommend something else that's an
absolutely fine combo at the moment ddr4 memory
is actually as i did a video on this i'll put the link up here it's actually
cheaper on the new market than ddr3 so ryzen 5 1600 af if you can pick it up
for that 85 dollar price tag and with the gtx 1660 super that's a
really good combo so there's no real need to recommend
something else i mean i do like the x99 xeon combo off
aliexpress but in the current climate depends where you
live you may be waiting a couple of months for that to rock up
to your door but other than that since i did recommend jumping on craigslist and
local sites like gumtree i would recommend if you don't mind
looking at the used market as well for some used bargains on older cpus
even ryzen first gen stuff and if you enjoyed this video then be
sure to hit that like button and if you've stayed this far too
and you want to keep watching the tech videos the moment they're released hit
that sub button and ring that bell and also of course if you're a hater
don't forget to hit that dislike button for us and i'll catch you on another
tech video very soon peace out for now bye
