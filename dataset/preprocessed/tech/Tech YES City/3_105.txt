through all of this year I have felt like that guy in Robocop, you know the guy that was walking around going UGHHGHHGHH and the main reason for that is because graphics card prices have been at all highs especially in relation to their msrps which their msrps have been inflated over the previous same series numbers of graphics cards in the past so we might have finally some good news coming to the market if you're a gamer and you're looking for a graphics card if you're a person that say has a lot of superannuation in America, I think they call that 401ks then this could be maybe a bit of bad news as well as if you're one of those guys who owns nothing but crypto this could also be some bad news and what exactly is this bad news well comes in the form of a company called evergrand in china which is starting to seriously let off some warning signs and cracks in the system but there's also some other potential news out there that from the u.s government themselves have not raised the debt ceiling and two of these things combined together could spell the start of the unwinding of the bubble which of course the price of crypto is heavily related to and in fact i've been talking out in the past about this whole bubble and what it's done so sit back in your chair grab yourself a hot green tea and i'll help explain why you should be at least very cautious of the upcoming months and if you're a gamer and you've got some savings you can be a bit happy and optimistic are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you

telling me you love finance mixed in with tech so this is going to be a bit of a first for me in talking about much greater problems or at least much greater cracks that are popping up in the economy and how it relates to a potential massive deleveraging of the system and once that deleveraging or if that deleveraging occurs i don't have a crystal ball and i you know admittedly in the past i thought the graphics card prices would have come down by now but i was wrong in that prediction and of course you can't predict when a bubble exactly will pop but i feel like this bubble is coming to a close and we'll take a look why this is they've got for starters a massive construction company in china that is under massive financial stress and the reason being is because they have 300 billion in debt and they're getting to the stage where they're unable to service that debt and basically if they can't make those repayments on that debt they will technically then go into default and then the banks in turn will now have essentially what's known as a bad loan on their asset sheet which is really bad and it can have the potential to cascade and be like a domino effect where things start unwinding across all different industries and now you may be sitting in your chair and thinking well brian it's just 300 billion the feds printed trillions of dollars and the whole system seems to be absolutely fine it's flush with cash and i'm going to point to a texas ratio graph here which basically points towards bad loans versus total liabilities and once those bad loans overpower the liabilities that the bank has or essentially the ability to get their repayments from those loans this essentially can spell a default from the bank itself and now we all know from 2008 or if you didn't know 2008 a massive bank known as lehman brothers collapsed and actually in a five-year period after 2008 there was about 400 plus banks that collapsed due to the pressures from that global financial crisis and when we take a bank like jp morgan they have currently 15 billion in bad loans and this is the biggest bank in america at this point in time so you could only imagine what 300 billion would do to even the biggest bank in america and when you look at the amount of sheer debt that even one construction company holds in china that has the potential to really cause some devastating effects in the market and you may be wondering why is this happening why are these companies like evergrand and there's actually a few more of them that are going through these lines why are they under this stress and this has to do with china the chinese government they've implemented from august 2020 last year what is known as a color code scheme where they've got lines or essentially strikes and if you don't meet these expectations or these codes you will not be able to borrow an increased amount of debt as opposed to what you already have in other words you cannot grow the company via debt any longer so you're then relying on repayments and asset growth itself to pay and fund the future companies operations which in this situation seems to be a very bad thing but going through these color codes we first of all got green so if your company essentially has a liability to asset ratio that is the all the total loans that they have is 70 or under to what the company has in solid assets then you are okay in that field the next prerequisite is what's known as a net gearing ratio this is essentially known as loans to shareholder equity so if this is less than 100 in other words the company has borrowed less money than the shareholders have in equity to the company and you're also still passing the line you're in that green color code and then the third prerequisite is a cash to short term debt ratio of more than one x so in other words if you don't have liquid cash to cover your short term debt that's usually considered 12 months or less repayable debt then you'll essentially cop yourself another strike and you won't be able to borrow money so in this case if we look at evergrand they are hitting all three of these red lines and so they can now no longer borrow any more debt on top of what they already have so we look at a chart of companies that fall into these three strikes at the moment there's evergrand sitting right up the top along with another company called greenland global and then if we look after that we've also got companies in the orange zone and then the yellow zone and are vastly approaching the red zone so in essence this whole system has been designed by the chinese government to try and take away from an asset bubble and bring back gdp that's gross domestic product to actually consuming and producing services where in the real estate market they've essentially created bubbles with companies like evergrand by over bidding massively over market rates just so they can secure land and then get up buildings and take people's deposits and then keep this whole train of debt and asset bubbles fueled but china's realized well in history if we look at bubbles they never end pretty so they're trying to take their own approach to de-leverage their whole system but that is the first problem that we've spoke about and basically when we look at this financial situation it has the potential to just like any other bubble start being a contagion of debt for even not just china you might be thinking well it's just chinese construction companies brian but little did you may realize that there's a lot of different companies internationally that are invested in these chinese construction companies and also other chinese assets and so if these assets start essentially going down drastically in value even people like australian citizens who have superannuation or in america people with 401ks that are invested in these index funds could feel a massive blow to their potential future retirement funds due to events like this though now we're moving on to the next catalyst that could spell potential danger for money markets and this is the us debt ceiling which in july 2019 so when donald trump was in parliament they had the debt ceiling of 22 trillion suspended for two years and in that time since now 2021 up until july 31st they have acquired a debt of now 28.5 trillion so they're coming over that debt ceiling in a massive way basically if i understand things correctly it comes down to two parties in america having to work together to pass the bill and that is the democrats and the republicans and from what i gather the republicans are quite annoyed with what is going on with america right now in terms of how the debt is being utilized and spent and so they refuse to pass this debt ceiling and raise it or suspend it any longer and so basically what this means is that the u.s government then cannot borrow any more money or basically issue any more bonds on the market and so they can't get any funding in place and so if that happens your basic public service could shut down completely and this ranges from things like police firemen to military and government employees and they could all be out of the job if this was to turn into the worst case scenario though the federal reserve themselves they do have apparently a catastrophe plan in place which they put into effect i think from as early as 2011 in case something like this was to happen so if the us government was too default for the first time in history then it would spell absolute catastrophe for markets and crypto being one of the most volatile markets especially if we look at some of these graphs if we look at the price of ethereum even in the last week it's gone from 5 000 aussie dollars all the way down to 4 300 aussie dollars so what happens in these situations is you've got volatile assets like cryptocurrency and for instance like small cap stocks that have high amounts of debt people who have equity in these types of vehicles they essentially do what is known as rush to the exit and if all these people are trying to rush to the exit at the same time then you're left with on the other side of the fence who is going to buy or close that transaction and that is why historically when you've seen prices crash they crash very fast just like what happened in may earlier this year with bitcoin and ethereum and other cryptocurrencies they crashed violently and they crashed quickly because a lot of people were running for the exits but there wasn't the buyers on the other side at those particular price points so now this all ties in with the final point that i'm going to make and this relates to tech products and graphics cards and that is the miners are buying up a lot of these graphics cards in fact i know someone locally here i buy graphics cards off him for gaming pcs but he told me recently there's a client he has that is buying 50 rtx 3090s and my eyes just like really took me back i'm like wow that's a lot of money is actually around 165 000 australian dollars just to buy these 50 gravis cards and so there's a lot of miners putting a lot of capital into cryptocurrency mining hoping that they will then hash those transactions and get their return on their money but as i've warned my friend at the computer store and also warned other people i would tread very lightly because if this thing does unwind then your profitability and your return on investment could even turn into a negative endeavor and this is the exact scenario that happened for a lot of people back in 2018 where crypto already experienced a massive deleveraging process so nothing's ever guaranteed never forget that and what happened in 2018 was something that i was actually quite familiar with and that was graphics cards became extremely cheap because there was this just like small cap stocks and risky assets there was this massive rush to the exit door to sell all the assets on the market before they came worth less money and so graphics card prices after the 2008 crypto crash became very cheap i mean i was picking up gtx 1070s sometimes for as cheap as 150 aussie dollars which would be around 100 usd which i was really surprised with how cheap sometimes things can get so never forget there's always a balance to things and right now there's been way too much borrowing in the markets in general and what this leads to is can be a catastrophic deleveraging process where those that are caught not getting to the exit in time are then left holding what is known as the bag and if you guys didn't know what's in the bag it's packed full of [ __ ] so with that aside i hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did i'm sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what do you think will happen i think the next few months are definitely going to be very interesting to see what unfolds all eyes are on these current central banks essentially what they do because they have more and more control than they've ever had in history on our financial system which finance has more and more of a control of our life and subsequently our lifestyles do that aside we've got the question of the day here which comes from eyes number 23 and they ask ha ha ha ha ha does your fans know what duries are and uh in the previous video we did we talked about the h170i cooler and how 420 was a magical number when it came to smoking but the cooler doesn't smoke and then there's a pack of duries on top of that cooler and basically what a pack of duries is just a pack of cigarettes i don't even know where the term comes from i mean i'm from a state known as queensland and so since we were kids we always knew uh cigarettes or smokes as duries or aka dozers which i believe actually originated from either brisbane or my hometown which is only an hour drive the gold coast so i don't know which city it was originated from but it was either one of those two can't tell you which one it was but anyway hopefully that answers that question for you and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to slap that sub button ring that bell catch you next time peace out for now [Music] you
