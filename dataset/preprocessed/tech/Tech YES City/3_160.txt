our friend over at greg salazar wait that's that's now his channel name and his name as well i thought you'd be back that's it it used to be science studio i always think of it science judy anyway he made a video recently talking about the 72 rtx 3060 ti's that came up on ebay and sold for over 80 000 for 72 of these cards in one listing and in that video i'll go put the link up here go check it out if you haven't seen it already greg makes a lot of great points that this is pretty much just above that line of ridiculous now especially if you're a gamer and you want to get your hands on one of these cards but there is one point in the video where we're going to advocate a little bit and we're going to talk a little bit more because greg said at one point in the video and i'll just roll that part for you pallets whatever these parts how is stuff like this allowed to happen he essentially doesn't know how an individual can be getting 72 of these graphics cards and then of course subsequently flipping them and making quite a big profit well today tech yes citizens we are going to do the most scientific of all explanations and that can only be done with paint shop and show you how this scalper was able to obtain 72 cards and why the little guy is getting shafted right after the sponsor spot hey look at least i'm not a miner do you feel like this when you see this well if so you can get rid of that windows activation message with today's video sponsor scd keys for as little as 12 usd after you use that coupon bftyc you can get activated today links in description below so how all this works is first of all we've got this person we're just going to call him john mcproffity because he's buying these cards for the sole purpose of profiting so here he is on the paint shop graph here and he's essentially got a business name and with that business name he is now able to then contact a distributor and make an account and so the distributors they honestly do not care who you are they care about one thing and that's moving product and making profit so the distributor doesn't care how many you're ordering usually i mean maybe there's some changes that are imposed by nvidia and also the board partners as of recent but in terms of what i've heard in the last few months at least in australia and i'll give you guys an example in australia where we've got companies called synx engram micro and dicker data these are essentially the middle men that you don't buy from if you're just a typical customer and you're walking into a store these middlemen will essentially talk to msi or zeus and avga and and other companies that make the graphics cards and then they will then distribute them to the retailer and now this retailer bit is funny because these people are not essentially retailers they're just people with businesses and they've signed up for the accounts with the distributors and so what they do is they'll put in a order for a massive amount of these graphics cards even if the price is higher than that over msrp say for instance with these evga rtx 3060 ti's they would have bought them in dozens hence the 72 so they would have bought one which had 12 in each of the boxes equaling 72 graphics cards and they might have got them for say 499 a hundred dollars over msrp but they did not care they knew the value of these cards at least on ebay and all the other places where scalpers are selling them they would have definitely known that they're worth more than the 500 at the distributor's end and maybe the distributor has a minimum order quantity as well it depends on that particular distributor and so now this person selling these cards has then ordered 72 graphics cards from distributor x and i don't know which distributor in the us that would be but say for instance in australia if you ordered these from synax they wouldn't have to impose a check on that particular person they just sell them and again as we said before they do not care who they're selling these graphics cards to but this is where you've got the problem in the system and that is you've got a retailer or in this case probably just an individual with a business name buying up the cards who otherwise would never buy them up because they know they can't make profit on them if they're just reselling them to the public from a retailer that people have never heard of before just an individual and so now he's taking advantage of a thing called arbitrage and this is when you buy from one market and sell to another and the difference between the bid and ask prices on the platforms in this case the distributor versus the end customer is worth essentially the time and resources spent to do that and so what we've got now is this person is now coming into the fold because they've identified this arbitrage opportunity and essentially what arbitrage is if you do it right it's free money and when we look at the end price listing of this we can easily see that it is nothing but free money he's got over eighty thousand dollars for something that he's probably purchased for a little over thirty thousand dollars from the distributor directly and that's actually a scary thing because that's fifty thousand dollars that is then taken off someone now this person is buying it for eighty thousand dollars i think they're paying a lot and they may not see those returns on their money this is what they call when you're trading stocks and stuff like that this person who bought these cards could end up being the proverbial bag holder but with that explanation aside we've now got john mcproffity he's coming into the equation and he's simply doing this for nothing more than to take profit he's not coming in this market to buy and then resell to a gamer and make a little bit of profit like a usual retailer does so with that explanation aside we're going to go back now to john mcprofity he is now an individual that has come into the equation of the whole buying and reselling graphics cards that otherwise wouldn't be there if this arbitrage opportunity didn't exist and so now we get down to the basic the raw problem here and that is how do we get rid of this arbitrage and that's a very tricky question that goes much deeper than that of cryptocurrency i feel this has to do with the easy credit and of course the asset bubbles that exist within cryptocurrency we've seen the price of ethereum rise to levels that we've never seen before and with that ethereum mining has become so profitable to the point where it justifies the potential customer in this case the person who bought these graphics cards for 80 000 the 72 lot for them to buy that thinking that they're going to get all their money back and return on investment and they may very well get all their money back if the easy credit keeps flowing through the system but sooner or later there is going to be a point where the cryptos just aren't offering the return on investment anymore and i believe that point is coming very soon and when that happens that is when the bubble pops and the loan repayments that come with this easy credit they have to be paid back regardless so when we look at this i believe this is what the disease is currently affecting gpu prices when we look at the miners and even john mcproffity they are only the symptoms that exist in the system if we want to fix this we have to fix the real problems and so the second part of this disease is the fact that banks and whether it's institutional banks or commercial banks they loan to people with what's called speculative loans these are loans that don't benefit society they don't help you produce new goods all they simply do is raise the prices of current assets and if anything what we're seeing is a testament to this exact disease and in fact it's doing the exact opposite to productivity and that is it's actually causing less productivity because a person who say couldn't borrow as much as a big institution or john mcproffity they now can't afford a graphics card that otherwise they could use for a business if they got a business loan to help their business and be more productive and back to the diagram we'll just call this poor little guy poor man mcsam he's got a video editing business he likes rtx studio but now he can't afford rtx studio then we've got the third person in the equation that is the regular little guy who saved up some money and he just wants to buy a gaming graphics card to play games on let's call him unfair mcflare because he's used to just living his life working hard saving his money and he's not used to the environment where people go out and borrow for speculative loans and push up the prices of things like gaming graphics cards anyhow guys that hopefully explains what is going on in this whole gpu supply and demand market right now then when we look at this ad this is a rare example of something that's being sold on ebay where usually a lot of these deals would be going under the table and you wouldn't even hear about them because the people or the so called retailers who originally bought these graphics cards they just bought them for themselves and they've been mining ever since but even then this big example that greg pulled up in his video is only one of many me quickly checking out uh listings above ten thousand dollars there are people who are paying twelve thousand dollars for six thirty sixty tis in a mining rig and the bizarre thing is i've heard of people paying like in australia here six thousand dollars for six rx five eighty eight gigs i mean that's a thousand dollars a card and i mean at these prices you're probably not going to get your return on investment and you're like brian you will if you hold on long enough i mean i'm pretty sure the card will degrade and fail before you get your return on your money with those current prices that you're paying and also the gpu manufacturers at least they're starting to roll out programs where if the cards are bought for mining they're no longer adhering to those warranties and i think some of these companies are only giving you like a three or even six month warranty which is actually kind of weird because i don't know how they'd prove this card was used for mining as opposed to it used for gaming maybe someone can answer that in the comments though the last thing that we're going to talk about is the comments that i get when i always talk about miners uh simply bringing up the prices of the graphics because when we look at even a graphics card listing like this for 72 cards that's one person or one entity taking away 72 gravis cards from potentially 72 gamers that could otherwise get their hands on these but now they can't and when we look at all the other trickle-down effects of people putting together five 10 card rigs this would outnumber the amount of gamers by quite a lot to the point where we now have this dilemma of massively high prices for the gravis cars at least the ones that are in demand for ethereum mining anyhow guys i hope you enjoyed today's video if there's anything you want to talk about in relation to this situation be sure to drop a comment in the comment section below and with that aside we've got the question of the day here which comes from jack de channel and they ask why why give me hope and they're talking about our recent video we did where i put out a theoretical situation that i believe will happen in the next coming months and that is i believe the crypto boom is coming to a peak and when it comes to a peak and we've already seen the mining profitability go down when we reach that peak we only go one way from there and that is a crash and i mean people are going to say brian you're wrong it's just going to keep going it's going to keep on going this is different this time crypto is here to stay and i think it's either here to stay with massive amounts of broader economic inflation or it's going to crash one of the two things i just think we're not going to get a nice even profits that are going to keep going on i don't think we're going to see that i think it's going to go either up or down and so there is that hope if it goes down that is that hope that i put in that video for you guys i'll put the link to that video up here and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content and be sure to smash that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
