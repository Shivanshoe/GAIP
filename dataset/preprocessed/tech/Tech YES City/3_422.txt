over the past few months I've changed my setup in quite a number of ways though the biggest differences being that I changed the wall color from like a salmon pink which originally was orange to then a bright yellow and I also installed at the same time an ultra wide 35 inch monitor above my two 4k monitors though fast forward a few months to the present date and I found that I never used that ultrawide monitor most likely because I'm a two monitor guy and also the positioning of that ultrawide monitor above these two monitors at eye level was just so awkward I mean I usually like to have my monitors raised in such a way that my neck bends up a little bit because it avoids me getting headaches and migraines but this was just too much and when I was playing games it was almost like I was looking at the ceiling and who knows maybe I was hoping AMD or Nvidia would finally drop their next-gen graphics cards from the skies but that never happens anyway with this 35 inch monitor I decided that I wanted to take it away from my main setup and I knew once I removed it from the wall there was going to be damage on the gyproc aka sheetrock I think you guys in the u.s. : and so instead of me patching all that up I thought I could add something else to my setup and that's when these lifesmart color lights came into play because I've looked at nano leaves and I think the other ones called lifx and it just really didn't look like you're getting a whole lot for your money not to mention the fact that after a certain amount of blocks you've then got to add in another device and basically the company that sponsors our sout on the channel here SCT keys for the Windows 10 Pro licenses they've also got a sister company called BZ future and I've taken a look at like their keyboard in the past I really like that and they asked me to take a look at their 28 pack which is a hexagon RGB tile now each tile will weigh in at around 50 grams and then you've got little connectors that will weigh in at 3 grams and how I've done this is I've made a pattern that really wasn't by choice I made this pattern to the right of me here basically out of necessity to cover up all the blemishes on the gyproc behind it though what I ended up going into this with was the thought that okay this will just be some cheesy RGB tile but once I installed the software which is on Android at least for my case I believe you can install it on Mac - I found that the software was really polished and these tiles work really good in that I can run the whole twenty-eight pack off the one USB port now before we go into this I will say I tried initially plugging that USB port off my computer but after a brightness level of 50 it pretty much crapped itself so I guess the USB port on my x-29 a motherboard didn't have enough amp inch so this requires five volt to amp to be out of power to a hundred brightness it's currently at ninety brightness that's where I like it and basically how I've got around this is on my monitor I've plugged the USB port off that so that's basically providing all the power to these RGB tiles here they won't ended up really impressing me after using it for a little while was the EQ effect or basically the music function in the software once you turn this on whatever device you're hooked into whether it be your Android smartphone you can use the microphone off that or you can use a Google home speaker or Alexa from Amazon you basically plug the app to that and then have it plugged into music and so what you're going to get is the EQ effect and it looks absolutely gorgeous where you can change the rhythm you can change the coloring effects and then also besides that you've got all these different preset effects that you can go through though admittedly most of them are cheesy and they don't look good and it's surprising because when it comes to enthusiasts tech I usually do not like the rainbow effect on a default out of the box PC RGB say for instance on ll light loop fans from Corsair but on this rainbow effect for these tiles it actually looks really good and that a slow-paced and it changes the colors it's one of my favorite effects they've also got some custom effects like flash and digital key and also forest I found them pretty good though some of them were programmed for the 28th set though you can make your own custom frames make your own changing sets if you wish to and you can also on top of that just make your own static tile set and program it all into the app and so in the end that's what ended up surprising me about these tiles but not only that they looked good but the software on the app itself was really well polished and really well done though I will say I did have some problems where occasionally the device will drop out so it does need Bluetooth and then it'll hook into your wireless and then it'll get started and you can sign in and make an account though if you don't sign in you won't get access to functions like EQ so there are a few critiquing points there I would like to see them polish up the software to the point where this device doesn't bug out occasionally and also allow it so you can just log in in guest mode and then get all the effects as well but besides that it was super quick to set up where I essentially got double sided tape and then I hooked the double sided tape on the actual connectors themselves and then as I was symmetrically planning it all out it just came together really quickly so it's super easy to set up you can set it up with double sided tape but do make sure you put some alcohol wipes and clean off the wall or the surface before you do that and dry it off so it doesn't fall off and then after that you've got that one cable running from the main connector and then you can run that to a USB port preferably off a monitor or something else that can power more than a typical mother ball as one airport and basically that's all there really is to these things they measure about seven point five centimeters from flat side to flat side so they are a six sided hexagon shape and they're 35 mil in depth so you will have to account for that to whatever surface you're mounting it to I'll put the dimensions up for you guys and the pack that I got here today it is a 28 pack from BZ future they charge about 225 USD if you use the coupon code BZ TYC and a big thanks to them for sending this out because the reason I did this video as I said in the intro was that ultra-wide wasn't working out and then they said do you want to take a look at these things and I was actually in the market for something like that because that was my plan originally and then these things came along and I'm just blown away by how good they are in the end I do have no need to try out those nano leaves or life extols but I'm sure they're pretty good in their own rights though from what I read up on the reviews so I was actually gonna buy some of these tiles quite a few months ago from what I read up on these reviews they were having problems of their own and you just didn't get a whole lot of tile or area for your money but this thing here at least with a kid that I've got here does cover roughly like from what I'd say that's roughly similar to a 32 inch monitor in size that there are some gaps there but that's basically what you get it's not massive but this kit right here will do a great job especially if you take advantage of that EQ setting that was my favorite now when I listen to music I've got these cool effects going on so basically I do give this the thumbs up it is a great alternative to the others that exist out there so if you've been thinking about getting something that's better value for money and also my opinion functions really well you know guys do let us know in the comments section below are you in the market for something like this RGB tiles or have you already got some have you tried them what's your problems or what do you like about them love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of thoughts and opinions we've got the questions of the day because a few of them are coming in at the same time and they're basically along the lines of what spray do you use to clean your computer parts and the main spray that I've been using is this right here the multi-purpose spray if I had to pick one of the many types of sprays that I use here on the channel this would be it it's non capacitive non conductive and it does a great job of not just cleaning but also making the product look really good sometimes even better than brand-new but if you want to check out my cleaning process at least for 2019 I might have to make an update to it for you guys in 2020 and I'll put the link to that video up here but also before I get on out of here these tiles right here one thing I did forget to mention is that they do have 14 preset colors to choose from so I would like to see more preset colors out of the box but you do have the option to customize the saturation and also the hue so I believe that makes up to 360 different colors to choose from in the presets anyway guys if you're into did in getting some of these tiles for yourself then I'll put the link and the coupon code in the description below when you get them for 225 shipped internationally and with that aside I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now play [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]
