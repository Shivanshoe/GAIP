nvidia's rtx 3000 launch has caused the used gpu market to
go into what could simply be described as
panic mode where people are starting to sell off their rtx 2080 ti's
and also rtx 2080s and even 2070 supers in
mass and what we're going to be talking about today is what should you do in
this situation if you're a buyer or you're a seller now
we're going to start with the problem first because if we identify what the
problem is we can then look at the solution now the
problem in my opinion is really quite simple and i'm going to be talking off
experience based on what happens locally in my market so what we had here was a
situation where before the rtx 3000 was even announced
we had used gpus being overpriced now with the announcement we saw two
cards in particular the rtx 3070 and 3080. they came in with a 500 usd
price point for the 3070 and a 700 price point for the 3080.
now my gut tells me that the 3080 is going to obliterate everything
currently on the market at this point in time there's going to be a no contest
the 3070 however is an interesting card jensen in the announcement
said that this is going to give the similar performance to a 2080 ti
now my gut tells me the 2080 ti is going to perform just a little bit better
from the get go and here's one thing about nvidia leaks too
the day before the live stream gamewood posted up
some images on their site and they were actually wrong and then people went and
said oh this is what the nvidia announcement's
going to be and then people went and took that
information and said this is what's going to be announced during the live
stream it's going to be seven nanometers it's
going to have this amount of cuda cores etc and they were completely wrong so
what we can tell from that live stream is that nvidia are extremely
tight-lipped on what gets leaked to the public even a
day before release no one knew exactly what was going to
come out of that live stream and so going forward i don't even know
when an rtx 3080 is going to rock through my studio so i can
start doing some testing and of course since i've signed an nda
i cannot release any results until the nda lift date
for that information and those benchmarks so the bottom line is is that
coming into this i didn't know what was going to happen in the gpu market but i
made a previous video saying that i thought the rtx 3000
series was going to fix the used gpu marker at least i hoped
it would and within that video i did give out
some advice saying look this is going to be a massive launch
where it's better if you're feeling unsafe
about your purchase it's better to sell your graphics card now
get what you can for it instead of waiting and risking and seeing what
happens with the new launches and i knew this
launch was going to be big it's a node shrink and it's also an
architectural performance improvement over the previous generation
those two things combined together generally means big gains now depending
on which side of the fence you're on you can see this announcement is either a
big problem or a big blessing now if you're a seller
this is going to be a big problem because the rtx 3000
series in all honesty what it looks like from so far
is that it's a lot bigger than anyone expected
and of course you've got the question of are these gains actually going to be
real and to be honest i think they are and
the reason being is you got the consoles being launched later this year
and of course amd's big navi will be coming out and video always liked to be
one step ahead of their competition so these gains are just so big because they
want to keep that market share and they want to keep ahead of the
competition so you can expect that 80 gain roughly from the rtx 2080 to the
3080 i believe that will be roughly what it will do
but if you've bought one of these cards recently an rtx 2000 series card
do not worry because honestly there's a lot more things
that could go wrong in your life for instance in 2008
i bought stock right before the crash i bought it literally the worst time to
buy stock in market history and i lost a lot of money and so that
was something i had when i was starting out
investing in stocks is that it's all about timing and that's why i said to
people in the previous video it's always better
to just wait when there's a really big launch
up around the corner it's always better to wait and if possible just sell off
your gear before the announcement happens than it is to wait and of course
look at what's going on in the markets so let's jump on our good old computer
and check out what exactly is going on in the used market
so here we are now on good old ebay and we're going to go over later to my local
markets both facebook marketplace and good old gamtree so the us
uh pricing here will be for ebay and then we move over to my local markets
they'll actually be in australian dollars
but what you can see straight away is so many 2080 ti's up for sale
and now a lot of these are going on free bid there's buy it nows for
around 600 usd and more and essentially this
is a second hand card a lot of the times you are still buying a used card so do
keep that in mind versus a new card you don't know what
environment that's been in someone could have been vaping
blowing a heap of oil over it other things that could have
not been installed a hundred percent could be on its way out
there's a list of problems that come with buying a used card
so these new cards especially the 37 he touted it having the same performance as
a 2080 ti and then coming in at 500 bucks with
also better power efficiency and this is a big one
as well as better support for things like dls s2 and
nvidia's ray tracing this makes the value for money
of the new cards even at new prices much better than anyone thought and so
you're going to see this chain reaction following through now where people are
like well damn i want to go out and get a 30 80 and so
if i sell this for 500 bucks it's only another 200
and i can upgrade to the latest and greatest so that's what a lot of people
selling these cards are going to be thinking
in the back of their mind right now and if they can offload them for a good
price then kudos to them but what should you
be paying for one of these graphics cards well i'd
say honestly for a 2080 ti and this is me being risk adverse i'm
not going to be going out and buying 2080 ti's in 2080s
at the moment because i'm honestly going to wait and see the performance
of especially the 3080 because if the 3080 comes out and it's as good as
nvidia has been touting it to be then we can pretty much ascertain from
that that the subsequent cards the 30 70 and also the 3090
are going to be very good too so everyone's got their eyes on the 17th of
september so you're probably wondering at this
point what should you be paying for an rtx
2080 ti and i wouldn't pay any more than 500 usd in fact i'd try and be searching
for them and getting them as low as 450 usd
that to me is a very low side risk purchase right you're not going to lose
a whole lot if the 3070 comes out and it's got
similar performance you've still gotten a decent deal if the
3070 comes out and it slightly performs less then you can have a card with
slightly better performance going to use more power and it's going to have more
vram so there are still a couple of upsides if you get this card
for a decent price now what about a 2080 super and a 2080
well this is where the price starts to crunch
down and it's not going to get that much different right a 2080 super
is probably going to go for around 400 us
maybe a little bit lower but that's a realistic expectation so
if you're paying any more for these cards
then you may risk yourself in a month's time having a card that's not
worth as much as you thought it should be so basically if we go over to buy it
now 650 usd for a 2080 ti i wouldn't be buying these
now at 650 usd that's just my gut reaction with what
we're seeing now if i go over to my local markets
this guy um right here wanted to buy rtx 2080 today 500 bucks
he's kind of like he's got his prices set and honestly
they whoever set this ad up two hours ago i didn't even see this just until
now this is actually pretty much right
around what i would be paying for these cards
that's that's about it in australian dollars now one aussie dollar is weaker
than a us dollar but yeah 2080s for 800 aussie dollars 2080
supers for 550. now if we go on ebay.com.edu
these are about 1200 aussie dollars on the used market and even
right below here we can see we've got one for 1200 aussie dollars negotiable
so the 2080s and the 2080 supers i believe
at these current price points are still overpriced for what they are
so now moving over to facebook marketplace we've got a similar story
there's just a heap of rtx 2080s and 2080 ti's on the market
and honestly for what it's worth i wouldn't be buying any of these cards at
their current price points so i mean i'll keep a lookout if i see
rtx 2080s going for 500 bucks or 550 2080 supers
then i'll be buying that that guy honestly
whoever this guy is uh he's just nailed it like he pretty much just nailed it in
his one ad and that's just ironic that it comes up
right here today so now with all that out of the way i'll
quickly put up a pricing guide for you guys on what i'll be paying for 2080
supers and 2080 ti's and also 2070 supers
it's pretty much the same as that dude on gumtree he pretty much nailed it
for prices and the reason why the prices have dropped so low compared to what
they were going for a month ago is of course this new use but people
also don't want to take the risk right if you're
flipping pcs and you're going out and buying rtx 2080 supers and 2080 ti's
are you going to take that risk if the 30 70 is not as fast as a 2080 ti
sure you probably made a few a couple hundred bucks
but there's a risk that it is pretty much
exactly right around the 2080 ti's performance and the 38 is going to be a
lot faster and so if that is real and that's released to
the market at the set prices then you're going to be up for i guess
potential a lot of potential downside and you'll be sitting on these cards
that no one wants because when it comes to flipping a pc i find especially the
gpu is the most important the newer the
graphics card and the more vram it has the more people stick to that listing
and especially with rtx 3000 versus 2000 people are going to
be wanting to buy gaming pcs with rtx 3000 in them versus rtx 2000 so
that's the biggest thing at the moment i think a lot of people are sitting back
like myself i don't want to buy these cards because i'm waiting for 3 000
series to come because i don't want to take on the risk personally
so essentially offering prices where your potential downside risk to losing
money is minimized that's going to be the safest option
going forward so i'm closing out today's video i'm going to say a few things and
that is rtx 3000 has seriously shaken up the market this was
probably one of the biggest announcements of all
time in the gpu market especially because it comes at a time
where pc gaming is more popular than ever so there's
much more people buying graphics cards than there ever was
with the 7 series going to the 9 series for example and
actually to be honest this uh used flipping
thing going on right now reminds me of exactly
the 780 when the 970 was released that came in at 330 bucks
and before that the 7080 was going for 500 u.s
and i sold my card right before the announcement because i just thought nine
series was going to be really big and it was and then straight away on
when i was in japan at the time the yahoo auctions straight away all the
780s were going then for pretty much 970 prices and so people
were just getting rid of them and then after 970 came
it was pretty much as people thought it was roughly around 780 performance
and so people were then selling off all their 780s even cheaper
than what they were initially selling them after the announcement so
my guess would be that if you are serious about getting an rtx 3000 series
card and you want to sell your 2000 series card
it'd be better to sell it now but the rtx 3000 series i was hoping it would
fix the used gpu market but from what i'm seeing with the pricing is
the used gpu market still really isn't fixed and i think this trend of
overpriced used gpus is just going to continue forward to the point where
people are probably just going to start just forgetting about the used gpu
market in general and just buying new gpus so basically
coming out of that nine series launch over the seven series launch was there
was two lessons that i learned big lessons and that was
first of all always do your own research and so i did my own research before this
launch and everything was pointing towards it being a massive
massive launch which the ninth series was over the seven series
this time around with the rtx 3000 series i knew it was going to be a big
launch i just didn't think it would be this big but all the research was
pointing towards look sell your stuff before the announcement so if you did
that you made a really good choice the second
lesson i learned from that is always only spend what you're
prepared to lose so when i initially bought that gtx 780
a few months before the ninth series announcement
i got off the 480 usd and so i wasn't prepared to lose the potential 150
or so that could come with the 970 launch so i sold it
before that 970 launch and in hindsight i made the right decision
now if you've got an rtx 2000 series card there is some
good news going forward and that is you're not going to lose a whole lot
more money going forward that's because the markets
pricing these cards at 500 usd a pop might go down to 450 even 400 but me
personally when i'm coming to buying these cards potentially here locally
i'm only putting down what i'm prepared to lose so that's why when you see that
guy on gumtree he pretty much nailed the head
with his pricing structure i mean just like
i don't know whoever this dude is you got to drop a comment in the comment
section below because you're pretty much right on the money there
in terms of the downside potential versus the upside potential but with
that aside do let us know in the comments section below what you think of
this whole rtx 3000 series shake up
this is just for me personally it's like it's honestly going to be exciting times
especially since i do the used pc parts hunt of the month
things are going to be just exciting till christmas i think where this whole
market has now been shaken up and we're going to have new consoles
launching this is going to be whole new builds and new comparisons and
for me personally it felt like before this
tech was getting a little bit boring but i feel like this announcement was like
jensen giving the market a stim pack if you
guys played starcraft he's like given the marine a stim pack
and it's i'll just play that little voice clip for you anyway guys with that aside if you
enjoyed this video be sure to hit that like button
and also we've got the question of the day here which comes from crypto
m and they asked do you think i can run a 3080
with 3600 x with a 650 watt power supply if it's a really good 650 watt power
supply just like just a solid one with a heap of amps on the 12 volt line
then you're gonna be absolutely fine especially if you're not overclocking
your 3600 x the 750 watt uh power supply is a recommendation
that's just to say hey like if you're going out and say
buying a 10 core 10 900 k you're going to be fine with the 750
watt power supply with 32 gigabytes of ram four hard drives
uh you should be fine with a 650 watt power supply
as uh witnessed in the past when i was running a 2080 ti
with a 3950x on a 450 watt power supply so nvidia is just doing that so they
don't have any problems with people buying their graphics cards
and so it's just a big association thing right if you bought a power supply that
was underpowered and you got an nvidia graphics card and
then starts having problems you may associate those problems with
the video and that's why nvidia doesn't want that so they're recommending
to get a power supply more than the required real limit
of the cards anyhow guys i hope you enjoyed this video if you've stayed this
far and you're enjoying that content may wish to hit that sub button ring
that bell and one thing i will say before i get on out of here is
these are just my opinions too i just analyze
what information is out there and then just give you guys down to earth
realistic recommendations based on that but those two lessons don't forget them
and that is do your own research and only ever put down
what you're prepared to lose hope this video has helped you and i'll catch you
on another tech video very soon peace out for now bye
