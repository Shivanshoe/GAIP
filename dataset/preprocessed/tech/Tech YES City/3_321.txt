here is asrock's latest addition to the
b550 family the phantom gaming itx/ax where that stands
for ax wi-fi wifi 6 it's also got
bluetooth 5.1 on board and this does differ a little bit to the
x570 phantom gaming itx we'll go through those differences today
but let's go uh first of all through the price range where we've got this coming
in at 199 usd and then for the x570 we're looking
at 240 usd so it's a 40 us dollar difference between the b550
version and the x570 version in australia we're looking at 399
currently at the prices recommended retail prices
versus 449. so i would like to see the australian
pricing be corrected a little bit i mean when we convert that 200 usd into aussie
dollars that's 280 aussie dollars roughly i mean
of course we've got taxes there's not a big of a market but really
there's a lot of sort of difference in those two prices
there between australia and the us so basically
in the us this board is pretty well priced and we're going to get on to
why it's pretty well priced right now with the vrm details where they're
putting in eight phase six plus two phases
and that's true phases there's no doublers there's no
moss drivers in here and we've got 90 amp
chokes as well as 90 amp intercell mosfets so these are the
isl99390s and then for the socs they're using the isl
99227s they're 60s but of course those six phases dedicated towards the cpu
does a phenomenal job uh for an itx board right we've got a 3950x and we've
loaded this thing up both at stock and at 4.3 gigahertz for finishing off
the vrm details we've got tantalum caps here on board this is what
makes this vrm very special too so the vrm even though you're not getting as
many phases as you used to with other motherboards that are bigger
and around this price point you are getting a better quality vrm
which does make up the difference and it does make up
the difference quite well we're out of the box it's going to boost the 3950x to
4.025 gigahertz on all 16 calls 32 threads this enables us to get over 9
000 points in cinebench single core we're getting 516 so the
single core could go a little bit higher than what i'm used to seeing
but then again the all core speeds are beautiful on this board going higher
than that of any of the b550s i did in the other
comparison and it also runs 4 400 megahertz memory
absolutely fine on the xmp stuff this is the aorus memory modules
that we've used for all our testing just to test if there's any problems with
compatibility and booting up with this memory now
overclocking 4.3 gigahertz all cores this managed to do this
and it did it whilst getting around 89 degrees maximum on the ir readout as
well as getting to 91 degrees on the software readout and then 86 on
the heatsink now the heatsink weighs in at about 80 grams so it is a
little bit anemic compared to other heatsinks but again it
is itx and the vrm is quite efficient
especially out of the box we'll get onto the temperatures quickly there
where we're scoring roughly 80 degrees in software and in hardware 79 degrees
and then 73 degrees for the heatsink so the vrm is not
getting a whole lot hotter for uh pushing out the 4.3 gigahertz all core
overclock where it is using an extra 50 watts from the wall so it's
using about 260 watts from the wall out of the box and then
when we overclock it's using about 315 watts so
it does lose a little bit of efficiency when you start to overclock it i guess
the vrm is getting a little bit hot that's making it inefficient in itself
but still b550 boards around this price range
even versus the bigger brothers it is doing a really good job on efficiency
and the 90 degrees that's sort of like my maximum that i would like to keep a
vrm at for all day every day operation and
this does uh pass that test and so it is a
pretty solid border and so the good thing is
the vrm efficiency is there and if you want to put a fan
over the vrm you'll get cooler temperatures and possibly even
better power efficiency since it will be then running cooler but what it's worth
vrm very solid implementation you are losing two phases versus the x570
version of this board but you are gaining 90 amp
chokes and mosfets versus 60 amps on the x570 solution another difference is the
mounting bracket this is am4 mounting the x570 version
actually has the intel lga 1150 mounting bracket now moving
through the m.2 configuration we've got two m.2 slots on this board one on the
front one on the rear the front one carries a heat sink this
is a hyper slot so it'll only support mvme pcie
the one on the back is ultra sort of but support both sata
and pcie nvme solutions however it will only support it that gen 3
x4 speeds is the front one will do x4 gen
4. and i tested out the speeds that are working absolutely fine the temperatures
were getting up to around 72 degrees with this pci4 device
however without the heat sink on it was just simply overheating and it would
shut the whole system off so that's something to be aware of
this heatsink if you want to use a very fast drive you will need cooling
and this cooling does do a decent job it's certainly not the best cooling i've
seen come through the studio here but it does get the job done so moving
through the onboard audio numbers of course
if you're buying a mini itx solution you probably want good audio
because you don't have any extra pcie slots to add
an extra device and also since you're going small maybe a usb interface is out
of the question and so here's where the realtek 12 20
adc and dax solution does deliver some decent numbers not the
best i've seen minus 5.2 decibels 0 to 10 hertz of roll off there and then
after that relatively flat with a 0.1 decibel roll-off after 10 to 20k
kilohertz and then the crosstalk is actually very low
up until a volume level of 90 then after that we start to get spikes on the left
channel so basically if you're using this
on-board audio keep it at a volume level of 90 or below
then for the mic input this is actually very good
if you're looking at it in one way and that is the volume level overall i found
was a lot lower than i'm used to hearing so even though
it goes up to 100 plus 30 db it's doing so with no noise but even
then that input level is very uh i guess low compared to other
mic input solutions so there is no noise but you will have to have a sensitive
mic to get the most out of this input port
they're going through the rest of the features here bios absolutely fine
got all the options if you want to overclock save 10 profiles you can
control the three different pwm fan headers individually if you want to
you've got 12 volt and 5 volt rgb one of those being addressable that's the 5
volt of course but you can't control this within the
bias something i've critiqued azeroth 4 since on the intel side of things
they tend to offer this option with the rgb control within the bios itself
and there's also no bass flashing via the internet which i'd like to see them
bring both these things on the amd side but besides that the bios
is really well built very simple to use it's also got all the advanced features
if you want to go that far in then going over the rear of
this board this is where it starts to differ a bit
to the x570 version 2. we've got usb 3.2 instead of thunderbolt support on the
x570 so if you do need that thunderbolt support on amd's side
then the x570 solution is going to be for you for sure
though we are losing the uh also optical out for the audio here as well as the
manual 5.1 versus the line in mic in and audio out
only then we're also getting an extra usb
type a port for five in total plus the type c so six in total versus five
on the x570 and the x570 does have a ps2 port
which this is missing so in the box you also get your sider cables included
antenna which is the same on both the x570 and
b550 versions then the last difference is the nik
2.5 gigabit solution versus one gigabit on the x570
and so that leaves us now to conclusion time
with this motherboard right here is it worth the money
and i'm going to definitely say yes i like where this board's coming in in
fact i'm going to be using this in a build where i'm going to be
changing over to amd for my main rig with mini itx theory i think mini itx
has i guess you know technically it's got
the shortest traces which technically would mean the best
latency this is coming from a real weird route that i'm going to go down in
the future but of course it's going to be almost
impossible to prove the differences but that being said
if the science sort of states that the difference is there
so if it's there to be had why not have it
with all these gigahertz and instructions per cycle
going on and so itx is becoming more popular for me personally
and i feel like when you're going in the realm of itx you want a really good
board to match that experience and this board really hits the mark
especially with its vrm and that's what you want to get the most out of
supporting the 16 core 32 threaded beast the 3950x with no problems out of
the box giving really good performance numbers out of the box
and then when you overload the 4.3 gigahertz handling that absolutely fine
i am left with nothing but impressed with the 199 dollar price point
now the usb speeds they checked out absolutely fine
the m.2 speeds are fine the temperatures are fine you've also got everything else
on board 2.5 g and the onboard audio works okay so
now it leads to the question of would you want to buy this or the x570 variant
and that depends on what you want to do of course you've got that money
to be saved here the 40 bucks the vrm itself both these itx
solutions have really good implementations though where the big
differences come down to in my opinion is if you need
that optical out on the x570 as well as the thunderbolt 3
where you're going to get both those on the x570 variant as opposed to this
right here you're going to lose those but you
are going to gain an extra m.2 slot which could be very handy in terms of
those extra chipset lanes of b550 versus x570
this is the one area on mini itx where it's almost useless and so because you
don't have all those extra pcie brackets on your motherboard
you're not really missing out on much with going b550
versus x570 on the mini itx solutions so really when it comes down to it if
you need those features on x570 versus the b550 version go with
that if you don't and you want to save some
money and gain an extra m.2 slot then this is going to be a phenomenal
solution so asrock have really been doing a good job
especially on the amd side of the fence with mini itx i haven't really taken a
look at their z490 itx solutions yet even though i had to use one for a
competition recently and it does the job absolutely fine
but i haven't gotten around to reviewing it properly yet but i have been
using it as my main workhorse for now and it's been doing absolutely fine job
this is the cheaper variant not even the phantom
gaming version so basically summing everything up for you guys
if you're in the us of a very solid buy for 199 us
if you're in australia i would sort of take a look around and see if you can
get it on sale because i think the pricing differential
is quite big as we pointed out in the intro there
so i'll ask asrock what's up with that they're definitely for 199 us
very solid board even if you want to put a 3950x in it and with all that out of
the way if you guys enjoyed today's review of the b550 phantom gaming itx

us also let us know in the comment section below
what's your opinions and thoughts on b550 rtx vs x570 versus
z490 are you an itx fan love reading your thoughts and opinions as always
just like this question of the day here which comes from rumple and they ask
was the previous tech yes mobile in eight six
stinger looks mint by the way so the previous uh yes mobile was
a one two four bath spider and then before that it was a whole nash draw and
i'm going to do a card vlog for you guys i know i haven't forgot about that that
will be coming uh the 86 you guys have seen on the
channel sometimes that's one of my best friends uh
shannon he's a really cool dude and he just likes coming along with the parts
hunt sometimes and we use his 86 because believe it or
not it's actually got a lot more had a lot more room than the uh one two
four bass spider i could literally fit one computer in the boot if i was lucky
on the one two four surprisingly on the eight six you could
actually fit quite a bit of used hardware in that thing
hence the reason why it popped up a lot more than the abarth did
previously in the parts hands but the stinger that
has a lot more room than both those cars combined
so that's why it's the new yes mobile anyway hope that answers that question
and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon
if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content you want
to see the moment it drops be sure to hit that sub button ring that
bell and i'll catch you another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye you
