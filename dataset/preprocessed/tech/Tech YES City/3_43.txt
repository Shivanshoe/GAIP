previously on the 100 flip up challenge so there's some good and bad news after pulling this thing apart the good news is that this is a gtx 980. [Music] and so going forward we're going to be uh selling that gtx 980 so this is going to be my plan all right so that was from a dell okay that was from a usb drive yeah and it was usb2 and i'm like it's kind of pointless so you just rigged this one up here so no no so that was this pc oh okay right and then i bought this i bought this for this pc yeah right but then i realized that that is only um it's not pwm yeah okay so it's just annoying so i can't really control though welcome back to episode two of the 100 flip up challenge and right here on the table we have the remnants of a trade that we just made for the gtx 980. so in the previous episode i was down drives i was down a case since the case that we cleaned all the components out of the case itself was just destroyed to the point where i could not use that in any gaming pc i was going to sell people just would simply not have a bar of it when it came to buying a gaming pc with such a bad case so i was in need of a case two drives and also a lower end graphics card compared to the gtx 980 in order to make a gaming pc flip where we had all the other components ready to go and so what we did was we put our gtx 980 up for sale for 300 aussie dollars and in that time i had someone was interested in buying it but then they were sort of just messaging me back and forth and they didn't sound like they were really interested then i got another message with someone who wanted to trade and they had a gtx 970 but the catch was was that the fan port on the graphics card wasn't working properly and so they had done some uh wiring up where they'd wide it to a standard three-pin uh motherboard fan header and they said the card was working absolutely fine and so i said to them upon doing the trade i'll have to actually validate if the card works properly or not so they agreed to that but they also had two cases in the deal and they also wanted to throw fifty dollars my way and i said to them well i actually need drives so keep the fifty dollars and if you've got a 240 gigabyte and say a one or two terabyte hard drive i'll be willing to do this deal i actually said they had a 256 gigabyte ssd and a two terabyte hard drive which was perfect for me because now i've got a graphics card a case and also drives in order to complete a build and they also had this right here a ux 100 rgb fan which is actually going to work out perfectly for us when we're doing this build because unfortunately we don't have any fans included with these cases well we've got a basic fan on the office style pc case which we're going to put aside but this case right here the tempered glass deep cool case we're actually going to be throwing in some of the fans that we pulled out of the wrecked build in the previous episode putting it in here and making good airflow however we're going to have no rgb and one thing i've said in the past is if you've got no rgb you can then use something like a ring cooler to really give the build a bit of focus and a bit of rgb which you might be laughing but this is important for flipping pcs people always want some form of rgb and if they've got the tempered glass and then they've got the main attraction rgb piece can go a long way now with that aside we have checked out the components they are working i will need to clean up this case a little bit right here this deep cool case i have to clean it out and also clean up the gravis card a little bit even though i won't have to change the thermal paste since the temperatures were actually really good on this car they were working fine and then we've got the backup case right here this is the 100r and you may notice there's also a power supply included but they did say that the power supply had a noisy fan so after we've completed our gaming pc we will check out this power supply here maybe there's some sort of way where we can wire up a different fan and then we'll also have a 700 watt power supply left over and also that noxua cooler will end up maybe trying to flip that on the side to get some extra funds needed to make our way to make the upgrade path happen to building up a better pc on that 100 budget so without wasting any more your time let's get this pc built and see what we come up with are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as fourteen dollars using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2 links in description below [Music] unfortunately we've come into a bit of a problem and that is this 850 watt power supply won't fit in this build it's just going to be too much of a hassle where the cables will either be running in the build or if we try and jam it in we could cause a problem so we're actually going to sideline this power supply and try and fix the power supply that came with the other build with the noisy fan since that's a 700 watt it's also got a much smaller base so that should fit in this build fine providing this noisy fan isn't too hard of a fix so we just tested out this power supply on the power supply tester it came up fine and then i checked the fan and the fan sounds absolutely fine to me and i'll let you guys have a quick listen can let me know if it sounds bad [Music] is [Music] [Music] so now after messing around with this drive unfortunately i think the drive might be dead so this is kind of like throwing a bit of a curveball on our plans because i did want to have a complete pc finished to be able to gain absolutely no problems and just having a 256 gigabyte ssd sure like i could sell the gaming pc like that but what i do is i want to replace this drive with our remaining we've got 25 left over but i've managed to get a drive for 20 dollars it's just a one terabyte drive so we're going to put that in and then complete this build run some stress tests and then put it off the sale [Music] [Music] and with all that out of the way we have a pc that is actually relatively quiet i thought the noise would be a problem but it's not i'll let you guys take a quick listen and what we're going to do now is i guess take some nice pictures of this rig and since it is thunderstorming outside we wise we'll get some thunderous b-roll of the system too and here we are now coming to a close on episode two where i feel like i was just made to do this kind of stuff where we're taking nothing and we're turning it into something and what we've got right now is a gtx 970 gaming pc with a 6600k and 16 gigabytes of ram the two drives everything looks pretty sleek i mean we're going for this whole stealth look and it's not really by choice that's all we could really come up with and turning this gaming pc in now i'm going to give you guys my price that i will list this for and what i'm going to try and do with the sale and that is i'm going to try and sell this gaming pc for 600 aussie dollars and if we can get that for it that'll mean that we'll now have a new starting balance and not only have a bigger buffer to start taking more risks but also we've still got an 850 watt power supply a noxua d15 cooler 114 centimeter fan the corsair fan and we've also got a wireless card that we pulled out originally out of the build and so what i'm going to do is in the ad i'm going to add the option to get wireless on the pc for an extra 20 and some people might cringe or frown at that but i mean every dollar counts at this budget as we saw with that hard drive we were able to replace the hard drive with a one terabyte because we had a little bit of extra money left over so every dollar does count especially at this low end where there's not really a whole lot of wiggle room but at least we had a little bit of wiggle room to complete this pc and we've still got also a case left over another uh corsair i think it's the 100r that got thrown in with that trade but i'm kind of thinking with that case if we come into some real cheap parts we could put together perhaps an office pc or a really low end gaming pc but we've got some options plus we've got this gaming pc to sell so do let us know in the comment section below what you're thinking so far what you would do personally would you change the cooler perhaps from the rgb to the d15 i think personally the rgb with the 6600k is a really good match that d15 we could use that in a higher end build in the future so it does give us a lot more options so that's it for episode two i hope you guys enjoyed this one if you didn't be sure to hit that like button and also if you want to see the tech videos as soon as they drop be sure to hit that sub button and ring that bell where episode three we're gonna have a bigger buffer and we're going to be able to take some more risks and see what kind of magic we can start pulling off now that we've got through the most difficult hurdle of the series and that's starting off at the bottom with the hundred dollars so really glad that we've got this far we've got a pc that's ready to flip and hopefully going forward i mean hopefully there's no problems with the pc too that's one thing that's uh sort of out there at the moment is you've got to sell the pc and guarantee it but i think it'll be fine everything seems like it's in pretty good nick and pretty good shape and we ran some benchmarks and we did a stress test on it and it's looking absolutely fine and the temperatures as well they're really well controlled so super happy with how this build came out and also if you guys have any questions or comments then be sure to drop a comment down below where we've got the question of the day here which comes from j deviant black and they ask hello brian i'm not into laptops but you do mention for not to for not buying the 6500 xt i got one for 170 us dollars with a guarantee it was only three days from the purchase do you think it's a bad buy i didn't like it though couldn't have a smooth experience in apex legends on an x79 platform keep it real mate thanks for the content so as we pointed out in a previous video where we tested out the xt on older platforms pca 3 pci 2 the card just struggles in certain games the 6500 xt needs pcie gen 4 but even then because it's got such a gimped memory bus it'll have problems even on pca gen 4. so i just don't like this card the fact that you're having problems in apex legends which for me personally the testing that i've done here at my studio apex legends is one of the best optimized games on pc bar none so you should be getting a very smooth experience with a 3930k or a 4930k sorry and also a decent graphics card because that game is just usually it's just absolutely smooth on a lot of different configurations so the 6500 xt when i was testing it in that game though it did give out some stuttering so if i was you i'd probably just try and resell it you might be able to get probably get what you paid for it back and i'd just go for a different graphics card even a gtx 970 i would rather that than a 6500 xt so that's saying or should i say that's not saying a lot for the 6500 xt anyhow hopefully that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] [Music]
