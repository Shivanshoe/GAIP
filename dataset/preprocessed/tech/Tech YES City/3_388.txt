[Music] [Applause] [Music] last week I was down to my last gaming PC and since then I am now below that last gaming PC to the point where I don't have a gaming PC to sell anymore I don't have any gaming PC's so what I've got right here is putting together something from literal scraps and by that I mean this motherboard right here pulled out of a dumpster each 55m e 21 and we've got for that an i7 860 which we got for 20 Ozzie dollars so we actually paid a bit of money for this and that hopefully is going to go well with this graphics card right here GTX 560 Ti and yes that's how bad it is I'm relying on a 720p monitor a 19-inch but which I got for $10 to be able to not show that how weak this GPU is in 2020 anyway we've got here 8 gigabytes of ram ddr3 we do that for 10 dollars and of course on any budget it doesn't matter if it's out of a dumpster or if it's brand new it needs some RGB bling so we're adding a $15.00 Arctic wind RGB cooler here then for the case we've got this $45 Nimitz m5 so all up this is about a hundred and 25 Aussie dollars for this whole setup because we got the keyboard and mouse which was thrown in free when I did the used part summit of the month if you guys haven't seen that we'll put the link up here but anyway we don't even know if this stuff works and if it does work I've still got to give it some tech yes loving especially this motherboard this GPU so let's get on to seeing if this stuff works and even if we can play games on a 560 Ti at 720p resolution [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so now we're ready to put some new thermal paste on this gtx 560 TI except one thing you'll notice is how big this actual plate is here covering the GPU and that's exactly what it is is actually a integrated heat spreader just like you'd see on say for instance a 3770k or a cpu from intel where it's got to die underneath the problem with taking these off is that it takes way too long it's not worth your time at all especially for a graphics card like this which people virtually give away nowadays so what we're going to do what we've already done is cleaned it down now and then we're just gonna change the thermal paste over which will need a lot more because the plates a lot bigger than a typical GPU die and then we'll put it back together and it should run a lot better than it did before because the thermal paste was all crusty and dry [Music] so now our build is complete in all its glory and we just got this together because this 24-pin here it just barely fit and we had to install it before we install the motherboard and then we've got up the top there a 4-pin cpu extender and now we've got a signal and we're just got to install Windows and then we can move on to giving this some tech yes loving while Windows is installed there speaking of Windows if you guys are after a cheap Windows 10 Pro key license in today's video sponsor s CD Keys has got you covered for 15 US dollars after you use the coupon code TYC sk on check out the key shows up almost instantly and then you just grab that key copy and paste it in the activation box click OK and then you're good to go I'll put the link in the description below [Music] look at my business keyboard I'm a businessman are you a businessman and now the PC is up and running and I gotta say it's not looking too shabby especially for the budget that we've got here and one thing I didn't know was this HP Mouse here is actually made by Logitech so hey that's just I don't know one thing I never knew though what we've got right here we can set 768 P that is the resolution so I'm guessing it's about half as taxing as 1080p so hopefully this gaming PC wants our games are downloaded will give us some smooth frame rates but what we're gonna do now is quickly tune up the PC and then we're gonna report back and give you guys the FPS figures [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so after testing out a few games I was actually pleasantly surprised with this PC fortnight being of course the main title there because it's what everyone on a low budget looks for on a PC they're like can it run fortnight and one FPS and now with this included monitor this little 727 6 8 P Zeus monitor it actually gave out really good fps and that was even with a hundred percent resolution screen scale with the low settings and epic distance and it was quite smooth and I could even get a few frags and play the game quite well so it really hit that mark they're getting roughly around 120 fps so I was kind of surprised at the same time that the 560 Ti could even get that kind of FPS and now of course with overclocking that's out of the question with this build because we're using a GPU with a single fan we've got a CPU cooler that's not really that big and then we've got age 55 motherboard and then we've got the power supply which is a an tech 350 watt so all those things together basically scream don't overclock me keep me sort of running as cool as possible where the GPU did go into the 80-degree region which I know the Fermi cards which is the codename for the gtx 500 series they did run hot by default and so this one getting into eighty degrees i guess is kind of normal for this GPU architecture there was a lot of toaster jokes going on back in the day with the Fermi architecture and rightfully so but nonetheless it could play the games quite well csgo was absolutely no problems getting really high FPS and it was really smooth - but then stepping over to f1 2019 even on the very low gravity settings we only really saw somewhere in the mid 40s on the average FPS so not really the best result that's still playable even on this little budget machine right here doom eternal I tried installing that and tried booting it up but it just basically flat-out didn't work out all so there was no way around that anyway that aside what we did here today was put together something really cheap and it ended up working fine and the main thing was the motherboard for me someone basically tossed that out and they upgraded to the latest and greatest stuff but that motherboard was still absolutely fine after I gave her some tackiest loving that thing came up like looking almost like brand-new I was really impressed with some of these parts that come through and they're used and they don't show any real signs of being worn that hard and so that's the main thing and the main gist of doing a used price-performance is getting these parts in and saying hey this is a really good score and then turning it into a gaming PC that gives out really good FPS for its intended purpose which in this case is a fortnight gaming PC though what you can probably tell by now is that I really enjoy doing this cookie cutter stuff where I've just got to put together a PC I absolutely love doing this kind of stuff as well as just seeing the performance of some of these parts where in this case the i7 860 is surprisingly still really good even to this day as we saw with that 49 FPS it's capable of getting some really high FPS and in fact I'd prefer this over say for instance an i5 2400 and of course if you've got better gear for it you can even overclock the CPU and get much more performance but we didn't overclock here today as we said before due to the limitations though speaking of the i7 860 this ties perfectly into today's question of the day which comes from MGL and they asked hello X 30 for 30 and RX 580 for gigabyte can combine any good so to answer this question quite bluntly I do think it's a pretty poor combo in 2020 where I recently took a look at the i-5 2400 and i-5 3470 in a separate video and I'll put the link up there where I found those two CPUs to be getting phased out in 2020 and basically the X 30 430 is an i5 750 equivalent it's a xeon equivalent so combining that with an RX 580 it's basically going to be a bottleneck on the CPU side of things well I'd recommend getting at least an X 30 470 which is similar to the CPU here's a zealand equivalent of the i7 860 and so you can overclock that thing especially if you can overclock it you'll get some really good performance and it will pair nicely with that rx 580 in 2020 hope that answers that question and of course I hope you guys enjoyed today's real budget micro build we're honestly playing on 720p I could still enjoy fortnight on this thing it was a really enjoyable experience and I remember back in the day I'd be playing games it's like 480p or whatever those real terrible resolutions were back in the day and I still enjoyed games back then even with low choppy FPS so this thing right here it's giving out good FPS 720p monitor and more importantly if you're on a budget you can still enjoy PC games hope you enjoyed this video if you did then be sure to hit that like button also if you've stayed this far and you haven't subbed yet and you're enjoying the content then you know what to do and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now but [Music]
