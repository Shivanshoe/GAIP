when i had hinted at tech yes city that
we were rolling around in the new tech yes mobile
and it was a kia stinger you guys requested
that i take a look at this thing and talk about all things cars
so this is going to be a video that's definitely going to be
off the beaten track in terms of we're not really going to be talking about
pc hardware at all but what we're going to be talking about
is some different kind of hardware the real deal right here
and why did i buy this car and what do i like about it
and i gotta say already this is just really weird because we're at this place
on the gold coast about 10 minutes from where i'm at and
i've already seen an echidna which is extremely rare
and there's already been a bird surfing on top of my car
such an enigmatic place for an enigmatic car
this is just the weirdest intro ever hopefully doesn't do a turd on my
door let's just let's check out the kia stinger anyway

back to tech yes city and straight away with this car we've got 280 kilowatts
roughly at your disposal and this is a rear
wheel drive car at least the edition or the gt edition that's sold in
australia now the thing i like about this car already out of the factory it's
incredibly quick and it's tuned for 91 octane
fuel and that's the lowest grade of fuel in australia so basically
if you want to you can add an exhaust clean up the air intake a little bit
at a custom aftermarket solution and also tune it for 98 octane
and you've suddenly got a lot of extra power your disposal
but the problem there is that for me personally i'm getting used to this car
still so i'm not even going to think about tuning it
for at least another six months to even a year because it's already really quick
as it is this thing can take off at the lights and it's even
got things like launch control built in so you essentially get ready for a quick
start off the lights if you want to beat your competition now
one thing about the stinger it's not like anything i used to have with my
previous car was a one two four a bath and my friend's car is an 86 a lot of
you guys always ask us about the eight six that's
actually my friend who's filming at the moment shannon neal
sometimes on his day off he likes to hang out he's a big car enthusiast
and the eight six and even the abarth one two four
they're cars that although they aren't as quick on a straight line as the
stinger they will beat the stinger a lot of the
times around the circuit so that's one weakness
of the stinger inherently it's a bigger car when you think of how long this car
is you can think of maybe a toyota camry 2020 model or 2019 model so
it is quite a big car but that said that's the reason i really wanted to get
this car in the first place because i needed a lot more space when i
was doing my used hustle especially with the 124 spider i
couldn't fit really anything in that car and then
even then i had a lot of times had to borrow my friend shannon's 86
just to do part science because we could fit more pc parts in that car but the
stinger you can fit quite a lot of pc parts in
this thing it's a really beautiful car so when it comes down to
the stinger it's luxurious inside i even opted for the red leather
edition where there's the black there's the
white i think if you get the midnight blue exterior uh mine's the obviously as
you've seen in some of the b-roll the white exterior with the snow pearl
tint and i just love this color because it
brought out all the features on the car i noticed some of the darker
colors wouldn't have brought out the features
as much where the feature sets pretty much the same on every single color on
the gt i think this white really brings out
like the moon roof the sun which is also a sunroof too and
it also helps out bring out things like the wheels and the mag contrast to the
car so i really loved this color straight
out of the get-go and i fell in love with it
straight away now another thing is too when you open the bonnet it's got these
strut bars that hold out very clean engine inside the boot is
another favorite feature too which is automatically controlled you just hold
down the button you can even set that to the sensor
where if you stand behind it long enough it'll just open up automatically i
decided to turn this off because it can get i guess it can miss
and pop off when you don't want it to pop
off though let's go down history lane now because this is easily
the best car i have owned in terms of what the history of my cars has been
when it all first started off for tech yes
i was driving a holden commodore and this was like would you call it the
bogan door in australia because these old things were just pieces of crap and
it was a piece of crap it broke down on me so many times
and then eventually i was lucky that a dealer gave me a decent trade-in value
for it where my next car after that was a 180sx
this is where i started to fall in with a
love with japanese import cars they were amazing
they were turbo they were fast they looked cool they had the cool exhaust
notes and we'll tie that back to the stinger
this exhaust note in itself is a very unique sound if you hear
another stinger taking off you'll know straight away that that's a stinger
because it's just got that awesome unique note that's not
really reminiscent of nissan or toyota or anything like that so i
really like what they've done with the engine and
the exhaust note of course if you add a turbo back exhaust you can
make this thing sound like a really cool exotic i have heard
only a few youtubers out there that have done a few guys out on youtube that have
shown these videos where they've got the exhaust note perfect so if i did do it
i'd want to do it like turbo back however inside the car right now
you'll probably hear that it's very quiet and that's one thing i love about
the stinger you pretty much have this sound
deadening that works extremely well for people
inside the car and it's great for me because i'm using the hands-free
a lot talking to people making calls here there and everywhere while i'm
driving and you can control that off the phone
itself or again with android auto so you can hear people clearly they can
hear you really well the mic for the actual hands-free is beautiful
too people be able to hear you crystal clear
and then the speaker system that they've included is very nice
too so this has got a little bit of bass not too much it's got good enough sound
that you won't want to really go out and get an aftermarket sound system and this
is coming from a guy who's quite enthusiastic about his audio
especially while he's driving they continue on with the cars that i
used to own since a lot of you guys are curious about that as well
we went from the 180sx to then jumping into an r32 skyline gt
now this is where i started to delve into cars even more and of course
with cars you guys if you haven't uh experienced cars enough yet you'll know
that they are one of the biggest money sinkholes
a man can face and i'm saying this just because it's
the way it is and so when people start complaining about uh computer parts say
a graphics card costing a couple of hundred bucks
or i can pc costing two thousand dollars i'm like man
you might wanna just start jumping into car enthusiasts
uh forums and finding out how much some of the boys there are spending because
trust me when i say enthusiast pc tech is much cheaper than enthusiast cars
you will be spending so much money so basically when i got my r32
i was dropping like an exhaust on it i got some wheels on it
and i just ended up starting like going through that boy racer stage
and the problem is yeah i'm checking the speed limit so there's the stinger just
letting me know like it's got these voice commands that
again like we heard before it just tells you it's like your little friend
but anyway the skyline that was a car that had low compression because i got
it with pretty high k's and now one thing
about the jdm imports or i guess any engine for that
matter but especially turbos is when the compression gets low
man you're going to get flawed like people are just going to laugh at you i
remember when i had my 32 skyline the compression was pretty low because i
was like i lost to this hole in astra and i'll never forget this guy in the
hole in astra yeah that was the 2-liter turbo to be fair he
was just looking and just laughing through his window at me and i
i had never felt so insecure in my life and after that
i then saved up more money traded the 32 skyline
for a sora now the sora that was the twin turbon
very similar i'm gonna say like in terms of the cars that i've had the most
similar to the stinger the soraa would be even though it's a
two-door versus this being a four-door hatch
the saw had the digital dash this has the digital dash it has the digital
heads up i think the sword didn't have the heads
up display but the digital dash is one thing that i
love i don't know why so many cars don't include a digital
dash it's just one of those things i don't understand but
they've done it here have done it they've given you the ability of course
to have the manual uh dash displays if you want them to
they're back to the saw and this is where another similarity
between the stinger and the saw is they're both boats both heavy cars and
now one thing about australia is in my
opinion you do want a heavier car generally on the roads a heavier car is
going to be safer because if some young boy racer crashes into you
you've got a higher chance of not getting
heavily injured so or severely injured so that's one thing i love about the
heavier cars i did crash the sora i had a bad
accident and i came out with a scar on top of my
head now had i been driving a smaller car
things could have been different you might not even be watching this video
to this date but that heavier car thing generally comes with in in the case of a
sports car a lot of power behind the engine and
you've got that heavier sort of torque feel which the stinger and the sorer did
share in common of course the stingers faster with a 3.3
liter twin turbo but it still shared that similarity and
the sora was really the first car that i got where i'd started
sort of doing those you know nice take off from the lights and i was winning
races man the sora was it that was the first car that i'd
really said hey i'd made the right choice here and after
that i'd also fell in love with toyota's though then i became a uni student and
for some reason i guess i just needed money so i sold my sora
and i got a toyota corona because after toyota again i had this brand loyalty to
toyota now the corona this was like some old
banger i got for a thousand bucks and the corona was phenomenal like this
thing would not stop it just kept running i remember we
had some temperature problems one time we just took the thermostat off and then
it kept running it got to the point where
we put so many kilometers on it that the door fell off
from i think it was rust and then we've got a new door for it and it just kept
rolling so the engine just never gave out and that's why i love the corona but
then after that i went to japan so after the
corona this was when i finished university i'd uh met like i'd
broken up with a girl like it was a pretty serious thing
broken up with a girl i'm not going to say her name or anything like that but
we broke up i met a japanese girl just off the rebound and um she
brought me over to japan after i finished uni and then after that i just
fell in love with japan they had at the time australia had terrible
internet i mean australia still does have terrible internet
but japan had like 100 megabits per second downloads in like 2007 2008
and i just love like the high-tech culture it was really
really good for a young dude coming up and so
my first car over in japan was a rx-7fd because of course jdm cars in japan
especially if they're used and especially if they got more 100 000
kilometers on the clock they're really cheap so i got this
silver fd and i absolutely love this thing it was quick
and the fd was a car that i loved in terms of his looks and its performance
it was a real like cockpit sports car kind of car but one thing i didn't like
about that car was easily the rotor motor itself this
thing was so unreliable it would break down so much and that's
one thing about owning a rotor is that they require a lot of
maintenance but of course they are a lot of fun twin turbo that thing was quick
then i brought that back to australia because you had the one-year import
where if you owned it in japan for a year
you could bring it back without paying all these heavy duties and you could
generally get it back as it was without having to modify it back to stock
condition or anything like that so brought that back sold it made a bit of
profit on it then we went back to japan again and the next
car i got was a subaru liberty b4 and
these were going in japan at the time these were going for like three and a
half grand and i had the liberty again was another
car that i just fell in love with this was a beautiful
car four doors it had the room it had the speed but another thing about
the liberty was it was a perfect balance between i guess
being fast in on the street but also cornering really fast but still
having more room in the car to fit more than two people in and also
having a proper boot space so the liberty in that respect was one
of my favorite all-rounder cars now so another thing i did to liberty was
actually crashed it one time because my back was
out and my ex was like you got to take me to a wedding
you have to take me i told her like look my back's out i do not want to drive
at all and she just kept insisting that i take her
to this wedding so i dropped her off and literally like two minutes after i
dropped her off like i had a like sudden like spasm because my back was so
sore and i just crashed right up the back of
someone and that ended up costing me like four
four thousand dollars so it was quite expensive it was a big mistake
uh even though you got insurance these guys request like all
oem parts like original parts and that's when they take you to town
so i got taken to town but then after that i fixed the liberty up i got a new
front bar on it i got some new mags on it and another
thing i did too at the time was i got some suspension
now this is going to tie into the perfectly with the kia stinger here
because the suspension i got was this hks kit
and it had these purple springs on it that's the addition i got
and i absolutely love this suspension it was
a sort of like it was soft but you could still feel all the bumps and
and it was pretty firm i guess soft and firm if you were to describe the
suspension now the kia stinger in sports mode is
exactly like this suspension so you've got two different modes of suspension on
the kia stinger where you can change between comfort
which i usually drive around in but then if you change it to sports mode
it'll tighten up the seat tighten up the suspension and of course make the engine
more responsive so i love the different modes you can
change in between this car but the suspension is one thing that i
love in sports mode because it reminds me
of that hk suspension that i had in my subaru liberty
now fast forward that subaru liberty about a year and a bit later
i again did a personal import brought it back to australia flipped it made some
money then i went back to japan again now this is where things got a bit crazy
because i got in japan another fd
this was a white one but one thing about this fd was it was a complete lemon the
guy who sold me it i think he hoes me down
even though i didn't pay that much for it i pretty much got this thing and it
was just it would not start sometimes it was breaking down it was just one of
those nightmares if you guys have worked on cars enough
you'll come across either a car that you own or a mate owns or you'll hear a
story where a car is just not working properly
you've done everything you've gone through the electricals
you've cleaned even sometimes you can even change the engine on these cars
and they just don't work properly and that's exactly what this
fd that i got the second one i got was it was just like
one of those cars that was so unreliable that i i just re-flipped it and
the good thing was i got almost back what i paid for it i just said like the
car doesn't run properly and i guess the guy bought it like the
look of it because it did have a nice body kit and mags on it
and it was in pretty good condition on the exterior so he wanted to rebuild the
engine i think and so a lot of drifters over in japan will just get
cars that look really nice and they're in good condition
but they've got high k's and crap engine and they'll just rebuild the engine or
replace the engine themselves that's a very common thing
but anyway that was the last sports car that i'd owned
in japan that was the finishing finale of the sports cars in japan because
after that i'd met my ex-wife we were sort of getting serious
and we had a little boy and then i had got a little family car we'd got a
toyota i didn't even yaris i think it was it
was just like this red station wagon i even forgot the name of it just wasn't
important to me as a car it was just like a
family banger car that didn't really hold much meaning
but it was good value i mean we got this car for like three thousand dollars and
it was like 2006 model and it had like only 80 000 k's one of
the best value cars i'd ever got in my life because when you buy a car in japan
you actually get what's called chican or two years registration with it
so that was three grand for everything the car the registration
and it was just such a reliable car but then i also had a little car on the side
it was the suzuki alto i think it was and i got this
banger for a thousand bucks because my ex would need the car i'd need the
banger just to drive around and do my thing so you may have seen that on the
channel sometimes but then i had owned that
for two years and that thing after i because i'd owned it for two years i
just drove it into the ground because it was so cheap it's like what's the point
what's the point of servicing this thing would it only cost you 900 bucks
so i didn't even service it just two years drove it straight and then
eventually just broke down i just pretty much sold it to the wreckers and
after that i got this little van you guys saw that on the channel i had this
little like banger van that i had on the channel
that was the last car i owned in japan now
that was that was that was a tough phase in my life when i got that car like i
was really doing it tough i just got divorced i like literally i got
so frustrated that i pulled the steering wheel off that thing and then i
had to re-fix it all and then i ended up selling it for about
half the price i paid because i had to sell it quickly because i was leaving
japan and so then i go back to australia and
my brother talked me into a holden astra 2 litre turbo now this
holden astra was i guess it was good at first like it
was a quick car it was a nice cool little banger car but
then before i went to sell this car it
catastrophically and i say catastrophically broke down on me and i
absolutely was so frustrated because i had lined up to sell this car
for about three grand i bought it for four grand aud
and i'd like to sell it up for three and it just catastrophically broke down on
me and that was the second holden that's
broken down on me so i was two for two and if you guys ever asked me to take a
look at a holden or driver holden again the answer is no and that's why i won't
drive a whole because i've just had terrible experiences with them
at least every other car that i've driven i've had like semi-good
experiences holden was just horrible the whole time so that was the car that
just broke down i ended up selling it to a guy for 500 bucks just for part the
funny thing about the holden astra was this guy came back to me who bought it
for parts like not working as is he came back to me and said can i get a refund
and i said dude that's not how an as-is sale works so
obviously he had tried he thought it was a quick
fix like he thought the holden astra just had something little wrong with it
though after the devastating hold in astra i recouped myself i said look i
need a new car after this i'm not driving
a used banger and breaking down on the road it's one of the most frustrating
things when you're driving and your car just craps itself really is
a frustrating thing you've got to organize a tow truck you're waiting on
the street for hours if you can avoid it try to avoid it and
generally the newer your car is the higher chances you are of avoiding
those situations so i decided to get some finance
and get myself a one two four bar spider now
this car was so much fun the abbas spider was
absolutely like just a fun car if you want to know what a fun car is jumping
on the bath 124 you just pop the top convertible and zip around
it's such a like it's so good at handling it's got a 1.4
liter twin turbo and it's really good on gas too so you
want fuel economies too and a little car that thing's got it but
of course as i said before the one thing letting that car down was i just needed
more space i started doing all these used parts hunts
collecting parts and one time it was so bad i had a monitor stacked up behind my
head when i was doing a parts hunt and i knew
then i was like wow i've really got to get a bigger car because this just isn't
going to work and a lot of the times i'd be borrowing
my friends 86 just because that had more room much
more room actually than the one two four but then we
finally sold the abarth and now this leads us to the end game here
the stinger and this is where we're at in terms of my car history
what cars i've been driving and i absolutely
love this car now because it does everything all the other cars do except
the one two four in terms of handling and driving around like a
really fast zip car it does everything all the other cars do and better the
exterior that looks absolutely gorgeous when you look at a
stinger you've got 19 inch mags brembo brakes all around this thing can break
really quickly too but it's just got that phenomenal look
on the outside i've also added a little flow designs body kit on the
side skirts front lip and rear but you've also got that just beautiful
styling that i feel looks better than audi's similar option i think it's the
s5 and it just looks like better than the
tesla i mean i know a lot of guys out there love tesla's but i think this
thing just looks so damn good on the exterior then when you
jump inside the car you've got the interior to match so what
kiara have done with this stinger is just beyond me because when people
hear like i was dropping off a pc one time
and the guy said i said i'm in a kia mate and he just said
oh okay i see you over there and he saw me from afar
then when he got up close to me he said whoa this
is a kia and i just said yeah that's the reaction
you're going to get from people with the stinger because kia i guess
came from the grassroots of making uh entry-level affordable fuel economic
cars then they've brought out the stinger and
this is just a complete 180 for them in terms of how the public is
going to perceive their image just such a winning car but the best
thing i like about this car is you are getting much more value than
you bargained for when you get this car like
everything is good it's got the speed it's a what they call a super saloon
it's got the luxury it's got the exterior it's got the looks it's just
got it all the feature set the speakers the handling the brembo brakes the mags
you name it this thing has got it and i just
coming out of this review i cannot say one real negative thing about it
in for what it is because you know what you're getting you know you're getting a
bigger car when you get the stinger so basically
this car is going to appeal to someone who wants it all they want the four-door
they maybe got kids they want a bigger car to fit more
people in they want more room in the boot
but they also want something that will have a lot of street cred
that will have the good boom boom music boom boom boom i want you in my room
kind of thing and it'll also have just this
oh collision warning there's another little benefit of the stinger
it's got these like it'll tell you if someone's going to hit you and if they
get close enough it'll break and detour this
like detour the accident for you but don't rely on that of course but
these are just many of the features that this beautiful car
has to offer but last thing i'm going to say about the kia stinger
is that you've got a seven year warranty and this above all else makes you feel
like hey as long as i get this thing serviced
with kia which to be honest is extremely cheap from what they told me with the
servicing i've actually got to get it serviced
soon the servicing is extremely cheap and you've then got that
seven year warranty where you've got a ticket
to just drive for seven years and not have to worry about your car breaking
down because kia's got your back they've even got your back
in terms of roadside assistance so you won't need the racq you can call up kia
anywhere in australia and they'll tow your car for you if it breaks down
so whatever they've done it's amazing let's get back to the studio and talk a
little bit more about cars and so there it all is with
cars history lane and tech yes city and i've always for
the life of me been a car enthusiast ever since i was a kid i remember the
first time i saw a car magazine with a lamborghini
and a ferrari in it i was just blown away by cars they've always
just in the back of my mind i've always had a passion for them
and when i went in my teenage days you couldn't afford much at all but you
still had to get something that was pretty quick
since then i've just grown into cars more where i've worked on them i worked
a lot with car parts and in ways that sort of i didn't even know
how that transitioned across to tech but it did like this a lot of
the stuff that i learned with car parts and cleaning them up
especially i've utilized those skills and also some of
the chemicals you see like a wd-40 multi-purpose spray and also
brake cleaner using that on pc parts i just thought i'd give it a go
and so that in time has sort of gave given me this attitude of
like because i'm from queensland in australia and queenslanders are usually
like she'll be right mate just give it a crack
and i've applied that to tech and a lot of the used parts and
pc builds that you see have that same attitude that i've
had towards cars and so always working on cars in the past has given you that
sort of just give it a go sort of attitude and i hope you guys are
enjoying the content and enjoying even videos like this where
i just talk about cars and what i like about them and things that i
don't like about cars the i guess coming out of this video is that when
they break down it is the most frustrating thing ever
you just especially if you're on a highway and you break down on a highway
i just i don't want to break i just for the life of me now
i've had breakdowns and i just don't want to have them again that's easily
the worst thing about cars but the most exciting thing of course is
the torque when you get when you're in when you're
putting the foot down and you just sit you're letting the car
just push you back in your seat and the stinger does that
quite well so that's one another thing that i love about the stinger too
though going forward the stinger it really i remember seeing it back in 2018
and it turned my head like i was like whoa that what what is that
and then i saw the badge and i was like that's a kia and then i started research
and i was like whoa okay what's going on here
and now fast forward to 2020 i got one so
it's been like since i saw it in 2018 it's kind of been like my dream car
and i've just worked really hard for it and just gone
crazy in 2020 i got one so really happy with it it's just an
amazing car and i couldn't be more excited to
finally be driving one but it comes as a bit of a shock that kia is
now i think a top dog in the game
so korean car manufacturers they're one to look out for now
going forward and i feel in ways like i mean might be a
popular opinion but i feel like korea is becoming the new japan
in terms of cars going forward so kdm might be something that you hear
going forward just like jdm has been so dominant in the car
scene and with all that aside i hope you guys
enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to smash that
like button for us also let us know in the comment section below
what your experiences is with cars do you like jdm
are you more of a european guy or do you go more towards american muscle
i mean every enthusiast car owner i don't care
which fence you sit on it doesn't bother me like if you're a car enthusiast
you're a car enthusiast and i respect you man like
that is a cool thing just i think everyone in cars has that passion for
just driving and for me personally i love driving at
night listen to those like that new age retro music and just
letting that cool breeze flow through your hair with the windows
down i'm not actually a big fan of aircon another thing about the stinger
two is got this thing called smart
ventilation so if you don't have your aircon and your windows are up
after a while it just turned like ventilation on automatically
pretty cool thing like there's all these little features with the stinger
that you just they're there and you didn't even know you want them
but kia's thought about that and added them into the car
so top notch car absolutely love it and do drop a comment love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always just like
this question of the day which comes from
orville126 and they ask hey brian is the infinity mirror affecting
thermals in any way given it looks like a closed-off front panel for thermals
so they're talking about this case that we used in this full guys pc build we
did i'll put the link up here basically we only use the 1650 so low
powered gpu uh we didn't really overclock the cpu at
all so we weren't using up much power consumption i think from the wall i
measured like 230 watts in game max power consumption and that
was on a power supply that wasn't the best power supply to begin with so i
think with the case itself it's going to be for a low to mid-range
build the thermals are not going to be good if you put say
an rtx 2070 super or a 5700 xt in it i wouldn't recommend that
if you did do that i'd recommend maybe getting a water cooler for the cpu
pulling air out the top and then maybe adding three fans in the front and even
then you might have to take the side glass off if things get too hot so
basically i'd keep that case as good as it looks
and with all the bling i would leave it to just low to mid-range builds
and there's my monitor shutting off in the background and that's time for me to
go if you've stayed this far loving that
content be sure to hit that sub button ring the bell you'll get the tech videos
as soon as they drop one now the car videos
don't expect any more car videos i don't know
um i'm not like i don't know that much about cars so i just
for me it's sort of been a distant time where
it's been a big break for me i mean i stopped kind of being real enthusiastic
about cars in terms of it was a big part of my life after i'd
met my ex and had a kid that was what sort of stopped me from being so
involved with it and i guess you just kind of can't and
then sort of from there i guess tech and video games which was always a
passion of mine since i was a kid but that sort of took over more because
any free time you got you would then just play in a bit of
video games rather than like hey i'll just go
start up the suped up car and wake up the baby can't really do that
so anyway i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye [Music]
so uh dab man uh what do you think of the uh kia stinger
i love it and i'll tell you what if you've got a job to do you'll get there
faster
