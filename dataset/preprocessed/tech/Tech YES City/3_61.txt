in 2021 you could say the tech yes man was holding back you could say i had the gloves on in 2022 i'm going to take the gloves off we're going to get nothing but straight deals if you want to buy a new graphics card here's a little hint don't go buy newer from the retail shelves you'll get ripped off go buy a used graphics card like we're doing today but in the process if you want to get a gaming pc for a decent price let's jump in that tech yes mobile aka the tech yes stinger let's go pick some of these things up are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2. link's in description below [Music] and the first deal of today is an rtx 2060 and we got this for 550 aussie dollars now they're asking 600 i found this on facebook marketplace i've actually bought a couple of graphs cards off this person before so they generally charge pretty decent prices now probably thinking well brian didn't you get some rtx 2060s last month and i did and did being the key word there where someone is begging me for another rtx 2060 pc so i've kind of already pre-booked that hence the reason for finding one of these now this looks like it's a dell model where we recently took a look at the dell alienware and some of the dell graphics cards especially the rtx cards look like they're coming out with good build quality and this one feels no different it actually feels very solid for a single card solution actually the person that sold me sold it to me said they benchmarked it before they sold it and the max it was hitting was 70 degrees so that's pretty good news that's only the first deal that we've got here today we're gonna go actually pick up now about a 40 minute drive but as a 1080 ti evga and they're asking 750 i put in an offer of 700 and they accepted but i sort of was going to pull off this deal because they said they wanted to meet me on a main road and i said well you know that smells like a hosing so i said look uh can i can you put this in the pc take a video of it working for me i need to know that it works before i meet you and so they said i don't want to do that i just said well i can bring over a pc and then they'll like okay so they went and pulled the card out of the box and then they showed me proof of it working so that's one of those things if you're looking for a card especially if you're going to be dropping what we're dropping on this 1080 ti 700 you want to make sure it works before you get it and the easiest way to do it is someone's trying to scam you they're always going to try and avert proof that the thing works because if they're scamming you they know that the card doesn't work and so you keep pushing them in all angles and if they don't respond then don't get it so they did respond and they have showed proof so we're gonna go get that right now and then we're gonna go look for some more graphics card deals [Music] and so now we just picked up the gtx 1080 ti for 700 aussie dollars decent score but i got these two gpus now i do still want to get a few more if i can as i did see an rtx 3060 local to where i'm at and they're asking 950 and i said look would you take 900 aussie dollars and they came back and they said that someone else was already going to pick it up but they said they had more gpus on hand so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to the shops because it's a sunday and i want to get to the shops before they close but then i might go home and then just check make sure double check these gpus make sure they work and also then go check out what because they said gpus plural so go check out what they've got restock the wallet and then hopefully fingers crossed we can get some good deals after these two right here [Music] we are now back at the tech yes studio and both these graphics cards have been tested and they are working absolutely fine but in the meantime i do have to put together a build very quickly because someone wants to pick it up tonight with an rtx 2060 then it's back to the gpu hustle now the next day we've built up two pcs so we built up the 1080 ti pc as well i put that in with the ryzen 5 2600 16 gigabytes of ram got that listed but the rtx 2060 pc we've now got to go do a delivery on that and i've got a keyboard and mouse with it and i've still got to find a monitor stand because unfortunately at the moment i've got all these monitors with no stance so i might have to go pick up a monitor on the road just to make the person happy since apparently they do have a particular thing so they've got to stay at a place for a particular time and so they can't really go outside so i've got to do like a door drop on this pc which is funny so away we go [Music] and we just finished the tech yes delivery which ended up being a little bit awkward because i had to put the pc in the guy's boot and he's still got to wait two days to get his test results back to know if he's potentially got the omni and also i forgot a dvi cable with the whole setup so i had to travel to a friend's house who was close by get a dvi cable and travel back but also the graphics card pickup that we're meant to get yesterday ended up being just around the corner from this drop-off so that was really convenient and the funniest thing was the guy ended up being a tech youtuber as well so an aussie tech youtuber on the gold coast so his name was robtech and he ended up being a really nice guy so he's mainly because he sold me the three graphics cards for a decent price of course other than that very nice guy as well but rx 6600 so we ended up getting two of these uh for 60 aussie a pop which look i'm going to be honest i'm not happy about these prices they're not great prices but they're better than what the retailers are selling them for especially since these cards are new and then there's an rtx 3060 ti which is uh he sold me to me for a thousand aussies so not the best prices but again at the retailers they are a lot more expensive right now where you'll be paying about 20 25 more than what i got here but graphics cards they are still the key component to any gaming pc right now so what we're going to do is get back to the tech yes studio and talk about the new versus used market especially when it comes to graphics cards because there's actually a few things that i've noticed that have been going on as recent and of course going into this year if you want to build yourself a decent gaming pc you're probably going to want to know what the best deal is yeah so we're now here the next morning and we've picked up in total five gpus but i'm going to say that the prices i've paid this time around for these gpus is not great and don't look at these prices as like well brian i should be paying that two unless you really want to build a gaming pc and then i wouldn't be paying any more for what i've paid for these gpus in today's video so keep in mind what i'm paying is what especially when it comes to gravis cards is more or less the maximum i'm prepared to pay right now especially on the higher end cards on the lower end cards if you look at 2021's parts hunts they were really good deals i was getting some pretty solid deals especially on the lower end graphics cards in fact i'm going to be picking up a lot more of those cards and that's where i'm having a lot of fun personally but that doesn't change the fact that people still are messaging me demanding gaming pcs around that you know mid two thousand dollar price point mid one thousand dollar price point they still want me to build them the pc because they want the value and they know that hey this guy can put together the pc i know it's tuned i know it works really well there's no stuttering and i know it's going to beat out the retailers by quite a bit and the reason i'm able to do that is because we saw here today the gpus are still coming in quite significantly under the retail prices and you're probably thinking why is that why aren't people really picking up the single cards on marketplace or gumtree and stuff like that and the reason being is simply a lot of crypto miners are still buying up gpus in bulk and so a lot of these guys will have we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars these guys will just drop that on these mining farms with their big factories and their solar panels because i talked to a few retailers and i am in the know of what's happening still and so they'll go pay just bulk buy this stuff they don't have time to jump on marketplace and buy and drive around like you know we do around the tech yes stinger they don't have time to drive around and pick up single cards and save a couple of hundred bucks they don't want to do that it's not worth their time and so that creates an opportunity where if you want to build up even a higher end system and not get ripped off then the best option you have right now is local markets and even ebay if we look at ebay if there's 20 available or 100 available it's a decent price then again the crypto miner who wants to buy in bulk is going to buy them all up and in fact i've seen a lot of even aussie sellers will be shipping their cards overseas because the cards overseas are more expensive than they are in australia and the australian dude on ebay just wants to make money still so your local market is definitely going to be the better deals that you're going to see and in fact an example of this would be an rx 6600 that we got here we picked these up i think it was six two six hundred dollars for two of them and then a thousand dollars for the 360 ti so we got 2 200 aussie dollars for three of those cards not the best deal again but if we look on marketplace there was someone selling an rx 6600 and i've been i was watching this card because i saw it on two of my parts ons so they were trying to sell it for two months and they couldn't sell it for two months even at 650 aussie dollars well they finally sold it said they're sold on the listing but that gives you an example of that's coming under retail by roughly a hundred dollars and it was just sitting there for quite a while and so if you're building a gaming pc that trend is still continuing on where graphics card prices just absolutely suck still but the other parts in the mix the cpu the motherboard the rim all that stuff is actually getting really cheap and it's still remaining cheap to the point where if you're building that whole pc you'll find that because those other parts are actually really cheap you can balance out the equation and then not get ripped off in the grand scheme of things but it still sucks personally especially if you just want to upgrade your gpu to be able to stomach some of these prices and like if we look at an rx 600 again this is this card should be no more than 500 aussie dollars max and so here i am paying 600 for it and i'm still overpaying for it but that's because i know if we look at these five cards i've already sold one of them in a gaming pc and there's already demand there for more of those gaming pcs so i'm just basically rolling with the punches 2021's motto is basically applying to 2022 as just keep on keep on keep rolling keep seeing what the market throws at you and just keep dealing with it and being quick on your toes and i'm just going to be flipping in that current market so if things do change quickly i'm ready to respond and that's the best thing and i've said this in the past that's the best thing you can do if you're a consumer is realize the one advantage you have is that you can react a lot quicker than the big guys keep that in mind do play that to your advantage whether it's picking up a gpu for a good price or selling a gaming pc for x amount that's your advantage that you have over the big guy so starting off this year with the higher end gpus i would say the gtx 1080 ti would be my favorite deal of the bunch still a very solid card even at 700 aussie dollars it's still got that higher end performance where it performs very similar to our rtx 2070 super rtx 3060 it'll even beat that out so it's a very solid car that's coming in under the prices of those two respective cards so it's not a bad pickup especially with the evga sc2 i changed the thermal paste on that thing and it's running like brand new so you can still get decent deals it just sucks that the gravis card market has gone this way where you're used to getting better price performance over time even inflation adjusted and you're just not seeing that but do stay tuned we are going to be looking for more budget pc parts very soon where we started off with the higher end stuff but that's only because i'm building myself up to have a lot more fun on the lower end so stay tuned we're going to be bringing back not just one series but two series we're going to be bringing them back in 2022 because the two just stands for two series though that aside if you enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what's your favorite gpu pickup of today love reading those thoughts and opinions is always just like this question of the day here which comes from neil and they ask any results with flight simulator 2020. so with flight simulator that is a game that i have on xbox game pass and as much as xbox game pass is a really nice thing for pc and console users it actually sucks for a guy like me who has benchmark rigs and has to download and copy games all the time where steam is the most friendliest for that and there's also ubi ubisoft games they're two platforms where you can just copy paste games and there's no problems in getting them to work on any different system so basically i don't benchmark flight simulator 2020 because i have to re-download the game and because my internet sucks in australia so basically don't expect a whole lot of uh flight simulator benchmarks here at tech yes city hope that answers that question and also guys there's one more day to get in with a chance for the high-end 12th gen 6800 xt gaming pc giveaway i'm gonna be drawing the winners tomorrow at midday so do get in with the chance that's australian time and
