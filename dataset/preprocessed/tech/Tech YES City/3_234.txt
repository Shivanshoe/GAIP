today we're going to have a microphone comparison between the (Kingston) Quadcast and then the Quadcast S, which from what i can tell here... it just adds rgb and changes the aesthetic slightly as well as changing the micro usb port to a usb type-c port, then in the middle here we've got the Wave 3 from Elgato and the pricing i'll put the pricing up on the screen for you guys depending on where you live the prices may vary i noticed in the US the wave 3 is significantly cheaper than both the Quadcast and the Quadcast s in Australia however, the prices are pretty similar and then for the last microphone that we're going to use in today's comparison we've got this one right here aka the ugly microphone which i've had it sitting around the studio, I do use this for voiceovers sometimes but with that aside let's get straight into that comparison first up here we're going to have the quadcast s and then we're going to change back and forth between the Hyperx quadcast non-s with no rgb so the original one had a red led this one just has rgb cycling through now you can adjust the volume on the bottom of this device just like the original and you can change the polar patterns so this is on cardioid at the moment meaning if you just speak imagine a little love heart coming out around the microphone that's the area that's going to capture and so it's going to block out as as much outside noise as it can but then we'll change over now to stereo so this is what stereo sound like you can use it this way and so if you're doing asmr and stuff like that it'll work that way then this omnidirectional that'll just pick up everywhere in the room so the microphone will sound similar if you pull it away then there's the bi-directional so this is if you're interviewing people so i think this is in bi-directional now so if you've got one voice here one voice here it'll capture both voices equally but i usually use all my microphones in cardioid pattern because i'm usually just with a condenser i'm usually speaking right into them at this distance so here's the proximity of the microphone to if you talk closer to it you can get a deeper sounding voice and if you talk away from it it'll lose that bass so let's change over now to the little companion here and see how it goes and here now is the quadcast same feature set as the quadcast s minus the rgb it's got a red led instead you can still hot mute the microphone from the top just by tapping it there's also those same four patterns that we spoke about before so it's pretty much from what i can tell the exact same microphone minus rgb save yourself 50 us dollars in australia you'll save yourself i think 60 or 70 aussie dollars and you've got a micro usb or mini usb port instead of the type c and next up here is the main microphone that i'm using personally on the channel here this is the wave 3 from elgato there's also the wave one which is i think twenty dollars cheaper and you can also get a pop filter for an additional thirty dollars but i think it's already got a pop filter built in so that basically stops you from making these big blows like if you go that usually comes out if there's no pop filter and it just blasts the microphone with a heap of air makes this real undesirable sound though one thing i like about this microphone in particular is it's also got the built-in uh hard limiter so if you just start yelling into this microphone it's not going to clip so it's going to save your audio from yourself and that's one thing i really like about it especially if you're live streaming you don't have a chance to go back and re-edit that shot and redo it and you're not going to blast your viewer's eardrums one more thing about the two quadcast mics and also the wave 3 is that they come with a headphone port though you can't directly control the volume on the quadcast as opposed to the elgato which you've got a knob on the front which you can then press that and it'll change between your microphone volume and your headphone volume and even your mixing volume if you're live streaming so you can hear yourself as opposed to what's digitally going through now the microphone that i have had for years and years and over time it has definitely aesthetically became less and less pleasing but i still use this now with an audio interface for doing voiceovers and you may notice that it's quite raspy and that's because it's got a really large diaphragm and it's pretty much just pure mic for the money and there's no denying that this thing does sound good even for voice overs which i think it's more designed for music the reason however i don't use it nowadays on camera is because it just looks that bad i've had to go to the point sometimes where i was covering it up with a pop filter and um you guys are like the pop filters around the wrong way i'm like no it's around the right way so i think aesthetics do have something to do with these microphones which we're going to go now back to the wave 3 and we'll talk about those aesthetics so with all those microphones done and dusted i am now back to the wave 3 from elgato this is the one that i'm using from here on when i'm on camera and you guys are seeing a microphone and the reason being is because the voice quality isn't the best but the thing just looks really neat and it's actually got some really good features that me as a clumsy youtuber or me as a person who's not focused on audio most the time really appreciates what this thing offers with the inbuilt pop filter and then an additional pop filter i'm pretty much going to be guaranteed not to get those big bass drops when i'm pushing peas or when i'm yelling into the microphone accidentally this thing's got that anti-clipping feature so those two features alone really are helpful for me and then the voice qualities you guys have said in videos is really easy to hear the the last thing i got to talk about with the quadcast and the quadcast s and i don't know if any other reviewers spoke about this but and there's no way to say this without i guess just being straight with you guys and look i'm not homophobic but this thing every time i put it on the desk it's literally like a phallic object just sitting there and i just like look it's not my thing it might be for you but it's not for me in terms of the design i like this simple square shaped design especially on the wave three the bay ring of b1 i use that for voice overs and this one here i sometimes use it for voiceovers too on my other computer because i don't have to port all the interface over and everything like that but i feel like the voice quality is really good but i feel like the aesthetics it's just not for me personally and i feel like adding rgb on top and not really doing much else with the microphone just to sort of create a new buzz with a microphone is not really innovating at all but i'd like to see them come up with a new design new look and see how they could really push the rgb on a microphone even further because i do think having rgb i mean it's a trend going through everyone wants rgb on their stuff nowadays and microphones are no different and i think the usb types c converting that from a mini usb very welcome addition of course i love usb type c really easy to use around your studio when everything just uses the same cable so very welcome addition there i just feel like okay the design not for me might be for you though do let us know in the comments section below what you thought of the comparison today which microphone would you go for personally if you were in the market do you have any microphone choices of your own that you want to share in the comments section below as i love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and if you enjoyed today's video be sure to hit that like button for us and you guys thought that was it we've got the question of the day here which comes from sean s and they asked 5900 x or 5800x for call of duty planning on getting the 3080 the nvidia 380 if i can get my hands on one and from my test the uh ryzen 75800x minces through call of duty they perform pretty similar ultimately i'd say if you're doing a lot more with calls and threads on your desktop besides just gaming so you're gaming at the same time you've got all these other things open and you're playing call of duty you might want to look at the 5900x but if you're just playing call of duty and streaming got another app open or something 5800x is going to be absolutely fine hope that answers that question for you and i'll catch you next time for real this time peace out for now bye [Music]
