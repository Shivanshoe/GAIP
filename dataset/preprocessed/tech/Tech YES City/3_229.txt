[Music] 2020 has been a really rough year but don't worry tech yes is going to be coming in today as santa bringing that present with showing you guys how you can build a pc that can game for under 100 dollars and this comes about with picking up deals like this a graphics card that had no fan on it and so what we did was we got a couple of zip ties attached to 12 centimeter fan and this is an rx 560. then we've got two used drives which are going to couple with this banged up pc that we picked up for 37 dollars that had the x58 motherboard and i7 cpu first gen and also a cooler and power supply in it then all these parts after we've given them some tech yes loving we're going to chuck them in this new old stock case that we got which is from the 2005 era and we got this for roughly 7.50 all the prices i'll put up on the screen for you guys so let's pull this dirty pc apart and then transfer it into a more suitable new home today's video is brought to you by scdkeys delivering you that retail single and use the license key for only 12 bucks after you use the coupon code bftyc that's right this month only you can get a 30 discount using that coupon and link in the description below [Music] after all [Music] ready to install on our case but one thing i'm just pretty excited because i haven't done this for a little while with all the new products coming out and stuff this is kind of like therapy for me however the logic behind this is that we're just booting it up making sure everything works before we install it in the case and the reason being is if we put in the case and something's not working then we haven't wasted all that time in replacing whatever could be faulty now this is actually a good practice for new builds just as well as it is for use builds because even then when you buy a new pc you could come in to some faulty ddr4 memory however with this board nothing was faulty but we had to change over from triple channel mode to dual channel mode because it was just giving out a recovering loss dram file size which is sometimes this happens on x 58 gigabyte boards in particular on a budget of course [Music] [Music] so what we saw from this display of benchmarks on this beautiful banger right here was two of the titles did pretty well and world of warcraft the good news is if you guys want to play this game even at 1080p something like this with a first gen i7 and an rx 560 with a fan zip tied to it will do extremely well where we were getting over 120 fps with good 1 and 0.1 lows and the whole system didn't even get over 65 degrees and this is in my hot ambient climates here of 27 degrees so what this means is that world of warcraft will pretty much run on a lot of potatoes out there now we did have the graphics settings set to the three preset and i found that this gave the best blend between smooth fps and graphical detail then moving on to cs go we had 1080p medium settings they've overhauled this game where it kind of does look a little bit better nowadays and we're getting from 100 to 150 average fps i couldn't actually measure in this game properly because the new cs go now blocks out river tuner from benchmarking the title however it does seem like the one percent or at least the point one percent lows are not that good that did not stop me from playing this free-to-play game and having a good time though the last title we're gonna pull up here and this will sort of give us a little bit of a shock to the system in 2020 with a hundred bucks and that is uh assassin's creed valhalla where we got here at 1080p 4fps at 100 screen rest and then we stopped it down to 50 screen res which would make it around a true 720p picture we're getting 50 fps on the lowest settings and the 1 low wasn't too bad either so basically this pc if you want to play the latest titles you're probably going to get a half decent experience at 720p though if you want to play some of the titles that have been around for a few years you're going to get a very smooth experience and i've got to say that a lot of the titles that i play have been around for a few years because they've got the gameplay to back it up though let's talk about this box right here the case absolutely phenomenal i was surprised that these old 2005 cases can perform so well in terms of temperature now the whole build was pushing out around 240 watts while we were gaming but that didn't stop it from keeping the temperatures pretty cool where at first gen i7 we'll put out quite a bit of heat and this thing was handling absolutely fine the 12 centimeter fan that we zip tied onto that 560 that was doing an absolutely fine job too however since this case was designed back when it was in 2005 the companies that designed these outlandish dragon themed cases didn't really have noise as a top priority where i gave you guys a quick listen [Music] asmr it's not unbearable but it is definitely a lot noisier than a lot of newer builds especially if you're into more expensive nzxt corsair and fractal cases but for me personally this was the build where i had the most fun this month so far where i've given these products tech yes loving from tip to toe and it comes to me as a bit of a break from all this new stuff that's being released and we've been covering it here at tech yet city we've got 6 800 1600 xt 6900 xds nvidia's got four different graphics cards they've released the amd's released heap of different cpus and i just hope that they will stop releasing so many new products because i like to cover it in the sense that i get a feel of where the new market's going and especially in terms of that price performance but this right here is definitely where it's at if you want to have a bit of fun and not risk losing much money or any any money at all and in this case if we put together a nice little kit we can even make a couple of bucks if we re-flip it on the used market so that's what for me use parts is all about it's about having a lot of fun building a pc getting into it seeing what fps you can pull out in certain titles and of course in the process giving parts that people otherwise throw away a new life and a new meaning the one thing that we didn't do however with this build was overclock it and there's two reasons for that the first reason we're using an rx 560. it's not the most powerful graphics card out there say for instance we had an rx 580 on this build i would have easily prioritized overclocking on this first gen i7 950 much more but the second thing was we were using the stock cooler as well and the stock coolers aren't that capable in terms of getting more especially out of a first gen i7 so with that in mind i decided to avoid overclocking this time around but usually i'd definitely be overclocking if i was putting in a 6 core 12 threaded x5650 for example which this motherboard is capable of doing that but one thing that we did do was lock in those xmp profiles which does give us a smooth boost to fps and that aside if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button for us and for the continuation of the used price performance and the tech yes loving and do let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite piece of today's build love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day which comes from ryan hensley they ask you didn't clarify is this for australia usa or both or around the globe minus a few locations granted they don't allow certain things to enter as giveaways so this is for the rx 6800 which we announced at the start of that video that we're going to be giving away this card because of the gpu shortages worldwide so it is a worldwide giveaway if there are certain restrictions in your country if you win then just send us a reply and i'll technically sell you the card for a dollar let's just put it that way the second part of this question was about the 5700 non-x flashing it to an xt and they're having problems with it uh crashing on the stock bias so that is a problem where the 5700 xt would be i guess slightly binned better and that it has a higher more aggressive clock speed out of the box and so your 5700 didn't make the cut in that case we did state that in that video i'll put the link up here where in the case of the gaming x 5700 that i got it was flashing to a 5700 xt it's kind of like halfway in between but it worked flawlessly but you can come into problems if you try to flash say an rx 470 to a 570 and a 480 to a 580 where it just won't be as good as a bint uh gpu silicon as that one you're trying to flash it to so in that case that's where you use the backup bios that you've got and you flash it back to its original state and you just call it a day and live to fight another day and speaking of living to fight another day if you guys enjoyed this one you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then you know what to do hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] oh
