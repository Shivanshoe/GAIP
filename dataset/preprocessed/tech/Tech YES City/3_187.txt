hey guys i'm a gamer but i'm also a miner [Music], Miner uppercuuuttt guys this is a little bit too loud i'm gonna try and get some sleep in my bed yeah that's good that's good legit windows 10 pro key license and today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 when you use that coupon code bftyc you can get windows activated right now links in description below well we got the reports in and i've actually tested the drive already that the rtx 3060 algorithm nerf has been circumvented and it's from nvidia themselves via the form of a windows insider beta driver now i got this driver through the web and regardless of whether nvidia's taken the driver down or not it's out there on the web you ain't getting rid of that driver anymore so this driver basically it's the 4070.05 you download this and if you've got a rtx 3060 in your top pcie slot which is usually called pci 0 and you have a monitor cable connected to the card you then get the mining limiter unlocked for ethereum which is the in this case i was testing the mining it's the dagger hashimoto uh miner and that essentially gives you the most profit so this card after a bit of tuning it will now be quite profitable just like all the other rtx 3000 cards before it however after doing some more testing with this i did notice if you change the card into a say different pcie slot and even if you connect a monitor to it it then does drop the hashing rate down on that 3060 not the other cards in the rig so basically what this means is if you have your rtx 3060 in the top slot monitor connected and then you fill out all the other slots on the motherboard with graphics cards you can still have an rtx 3060 in your mining bench and now here's the thing that sucks about this is that the crypto miners will now buy up 30 60s and just put them on their top slots in their mining rigs so it's done nothing in terms of helping out the average gamer and in fact this new update and apparently it's not coming out now it's taken down doesn't matter i'm guessing nvidia wanted to help out the average gamer whatever that is uh because right now the the whole 30 60 just like every other 3000 series card is now sold out and in fact i've got proof right here yesterday it was there for 760 aussie dollars today sold out so there it is congratulations nvidia if you wanted to sell these cards out to miners you did a fantastic job of doing that but i don't know about this argument of okay but what about the gamer that wants to leave his graphics card on overnight and sleep and make money and then get back to gaming the next day well here's a news flash they can go buy an rtx 3070 but guess what the rtx 3070 is now double the price there if that's if you want to mine while you sleep go pay the premium that's how the markets work right now and it's a crony capitalist structure that's now going into the land of gaming graphics cards congratulations nvidia congratulations people who make these anti-asic resistant cryptocurrency nodes fantastic job and now we're seeing the market decide on the pricing of the rtx 3060 which lo and behold is now sold out at decent prices well geniuses out there nvidia if you guys listened to the actual market you would have realized that this was working your plans of nerfing the cryptocurrency hashing rates at least in australia this was working people could buy these cards at not so ridiculously high prices and now i'm going to get back to me i'm a complete idiot because i reported on this story and i said hey nvidia i think what you're doing here was a good thing and i said that publicly on my channel and then i was met with a heap of different people saying brian you're a fool for trusting nvidia but the actual methodology behind this was starting to work we saw this at least in australia here i don't know about other countries but at least where i'm here people weren't buying these 30 60s up like they were buying up the 30 70s and 30 60 ti's to my cryptocurrency on and even the 3080s so this was starting to work this method was a good method and that's what i was putting my weight behind when i made that original video and so literally a few weeks later something that seems to be working now has the solution hacked by the people who made the solution themselves nvidia and for what it's worth i didn't believe many of the people in the comments when they said this was going to be hacked or is going to be cracked and they employ these magical fairies over in china that can crack the nvidia technology they don't need to do any of that they just need to rely on nvidia to release the solution themselves and i asked nvidia for comment on this and i got back and they officially said that it was an accident the driver was released accidentally with the hash rate limiter removed but going forward i'm going to simply make one thing and that is i'm going to be just like the skeptics now and when i report on news like this i'm not going to say it's a good thing i'm just going to simply say here's the news let's wait and see until a few months after it's been released if we can trust these guys and all the skeptics were saying it doesn't matter if the skeptics were right or wrong the skeptics were saying the bottom line is we can't trust this and those guys were right they can't trust this tech that you guys implemented over at nvidia because it's already been busted by you guys yourselves but single-handedly the worst thing about this driver update is that it now actually favors the cryptocurrency minus rather than the gamer who wants to sleep in their free time and make some money this favors them the miners because you've now got a limited driver that's out there that will unlock the rates and the new drivers coming out i'm presuming they will have that cryptocurrency lock installed so basically the gamer that wants to sleep and make money with their 3060 they're gonna have to back date their driver to a beta driver and then if they want to play the latest games with the best fps or play the latest games period they're gonna have to then get that latest driver then back date if they want to mine in their sleep way to go nvidia way to go now we're gonna close out this video and say look there's a few people saying oh brian you're empty crypto you're anti-crypto i'm not anti-crypto in the sense that if you've got money and you want to make return on your investment of course you're going to go out and buy a graphics card and put it in a system and click play and get free money i'm not against that that's the market that's what markets do i'm against the people that make these cryptocurrency algorithms anti-asic and we can go down this argument and argue back and forth all day long the bottom line is you've got a more efficient piece of tech that's introduced and is being blocked and before people say oh what creates e-waste a graphics card will create e-waste as well just an asic will do a more efficient job and therefore make less waste if we're looking at the grand scheme of things and that's presuming that cryptocurrency is forever like some of the cryptocurrency bulls say it is so the bottom line is i'm not against the average person who's got the free market mentality no you're playing by the rules fine it's the people who make the game that are making such a game that's corrupt so from the survey i did 82 percent of people did not mine cryptocurrency then there was people who mined with their singular card then there was about five percent of people who had dedicated crypto rigs which is a big number considering there's also commercials and all those numbers will make up more greater supply of graphics cards than that 82 percent this is even on my channel where i take more of a stance towards anti-gpu mining but of course the people out there who wanted to make me on anti-asic resistant we could just go a step further and say imagine a world where they made the cryptocurrency's anti-gpu compute then you would just have cpus imagine what would happen to cpu prices all over again so you can start to see here that there's just a simple chain that you're using less efficient technology to mine these cryptocurrencies it just happens to be that there's that fallback there and that is of course if the cryptocurrency crashes or it goes out then there's always the fallback to sell your hardware to and that of course is the gamer and the last thing i'll say is this being a guy that grew up with gaming especially pc gaming i love this industry i love pc gaming and even then i think some of the tech that nvidia's introduced dlss 2.0 and stuff like that it's really good tech you guys do a good job of making stuff for gamers so why not keep focusing on gamers the solutions to this problem are simple i thought what you did with the 3060 before this driver mishap was actually a good thing and a lot of people probably did think it's a good thing judging by that like to dislike ratio even though some people didn't like that original video i think a lot of people did like what you were doing with the 30 60 limiter the second piece of advice i'll give you guys over in video is please get your pr in line if you guys are testing a driver out that has this unlocked hash rate limiter inform the public get their opinion on it say hey guys we're working on a driver where the intent is to have the single gamer that wants to make a bit of money in their sleep be able to benefit from that and not the commercial miners or even people with multiple gpus and then the third thing is and i think the most important thing is try not to let it be an accident or let it leak to the public though in the meantime the skeptics were proven right and i'm sitting here now looking like an idiot so cheers nvidia for that one anyhow guys if you enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button and before you get on out of here do let us know in the comment section below what do you think about all the points that we discussed here in today's video do you think that this was a good thing that a video initially did or do you think that was a bad thing or of course i think everyone generally agrees that this mishap here on nvidia's behalf is just one of the stupidest things i've seen in a long time anyhow we got the question of the day here which comes from dmanpc1 and he asks have these sold already can't find them on gumtree or marketplace so they're talking about yesterday's video where we did the 100 flip up challenge and i haven't listed one of the pcs because that's already pre-sold like i already got a message about that before i could even list it someone wants to buy that so that's already gone i will be listing the gtx 1080 pc soon there's a 6700 xt review i've got to get through as well so stay tuned for that that'll be dropping in your sub boxes a little bit later actually under 12 hours so stay tuned for that one and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub and ring that bell and i'll catch you in another one very soon peace out for now [Music] bye [Music] you
