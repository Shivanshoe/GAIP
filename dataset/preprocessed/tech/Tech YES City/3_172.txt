this right here is the h510 motherboard now this has a big difference compared to the last generation h410 and that is it supports 3200mhz however a big question you guys had for me was does it support 10th gen with 3200 megahertz so we'll put that to the test very soon but i also wanted to talk about testing this with an 11400f with 3600mhz memory versus 3200 megahertz memory where i still think that 3200 megahertz and especially a kit like this which is a 16 gigabyte 2x8 kit represents some of the best value so if we take the h510 motherboard which on the surface is already looking like it's good value for money and then we take the 3200 megahertz kit that we just had and we couple that with say an 11400f is that going to be some of the best value in terms of building a new gaming pc that you can get out there on the market well then there is only one way to find out and let us conduct some tests [Music] so here's the asrock h510m itxac so this is an itx motherboard on h510 which i picked up for 139 aussie dollars which honestly for an itx board with the specs that it's boasting does look like it's extremely good value for money however there is one key difference that we have to be careful of and i was told this before the launch of the 11th gen cpus and that is with h510 motherboards the pcb layer has to be six layers in order to support 3200 megahertz if you only have a four layer pcb then unfortunately you are limited to 2933 megahertz [Music] so upon booting up the pc and jumping straight into the bios with the 10th gen chip there is unfortunately some bad news and that is the maximum speed here is 2666 so that seems to be an issue with the cpu itself and the firmware that intel implements on their 10th gen cpus and that they will require a z series motherboard to unlock the higher memory speeds so there's some unfortunate news but let's change over now to the 11400f after of course we do some quick [Music] benchmarking so just finished benchmarking the i5 10600 and we've done that in a variety of benchmarks however what we have in now is the i5 f and ironically enough the h410 motherboard isn't the problem in the case of unlocking memory speeds and especially having the xmp profile option that's actually locked into the cpu communicating with the motherboard itself so basically on both sides that's the motherboard and the cpu side the options have to be unlocked and then you can finally unlock that xmp profile or that particular memory speed in this case it happens to be 3 200 megahertz they were able to lock in with an i5 11400f and also the 3200 megahertz kit [Music] so after conducting the benchmarks we have three different games here across 1080p on the ultra low presets and this is designed to stress the cpus to their maximum so if there is a difference when it comes to pc gaming and you are in a cpu-bound scenario then you will see that across these four different cpus now you may notice that there is also different testing within the four cpus that is the i5 10 600 the i5 10 400 f the i5 11 400 f and the ryzen 5 3600 here i wanted to paint a few different scenarios here and especially in the case of the i5 10 600 i managed to pick this up on a used deal for 150 aussie dollars which would be around 120 usd now going into f1 2020 the 11400f does pull ahead of the ryzen 5 3600 and also the 10 400 f which is an impressive showing and this continues on with cs go now the graphics card we did use for this testing was the 6900 xt as i have been using the rtx 3080 quite a bit lately and then when i release the video with the 11400f being the dedicated focus of the video i will include the nvidia 3080 numbers with those benchmarks so getting back to cs go you may notice that just like f1 2020 there is a little bit of a discrepancy here with the 11400f numbers against the 11400f we just tested on a z590 motherboard versus a h510 motherboard and moving to shadow the tomb raider yet again shows that although the cpu is posting out some good results it is posting out some quite weird and conflicting results at times depending on the set of hardware that you use another benchmark i'll show for you guys is the power consumption numbers which when we look at these a little bit closer we can see that 11400f although it's pulling ahead on the numbers it is using the most power out of all the four cpus shown in today's benchmark which means while you're gaming you're not going to be getting the most efficient experience as opposed to the other three cpus tested they do all come in a similar league when the 11400f is then out on a league of its own technically though intel do account for this by including the all black cooler so you will get the all black cooler design included with the 11400f this time around if you decide to go with this cooler versus the 10400f which is their old-school look with the silver and black and ugly sticker in the middle that they've been using for yonder actually beyond yonder i believe they've gone with this color scheme since the dark ages so it's actually a cool thing to see that they've included this better cooler with the 11400f however we contrast that to the 10th gen cpus i believe only the i7 and i9 cpus that are non k included this all black cooler design so summing up the i5 11 400 f the numbers are quite impressive especially given its current price on the market i believe in the usa you can get this thing for 170 us dollars in australia it's coming a little bit over 200 aussie dollars so it is extremely well priced however now it is time to talk about some of the caveats if you want to get this cpu and that is especially coupling it with an h510 motherboard now in order to get these results that i got here today especially on the h510 numbers that you're seeing here in the graphs i actually had to go into the bios and then manually tune the power settings because without the power settings we're actually getting quite low results to the point where the 10400f was even beating this out on an h510 motherboard and so what we have to do here is go into the power limits and make sure towers actually disabled and then up the power limits to the maximum duration as well as the maximum wattage on this particular h510 motherboard now the motherboards may be different when it comes to enabling these settings so your mileage may vary here another thing to be careful of is also the gear ratio settings if you do lock in the 3200 megahertz profile you will want to make sure it's on the gear one and that's to ensure you get the most fps possible out of the 11400f on top of all that the cpu itself will use more power when it comes to things like gaming and also productivity so basically where that ties in with an h510 motherboard is if you are using the cheapest of cheap h510 motherboards then do be cautious with this cpu because it can draw over 100 watts when it comes to stress testing the cpu itself now the asrock h510m itx actually did quite impressive for handling over 100 watts the maximum we saw was in the mid 80 degree region on the vrm and this was in a cinebench r20 stress test however if you are using the cheapest of cheap h510 motherboard then that may come into some vrm thermal throttling which will then reduce your results when it comes to things like gaming and productivity before it's worth this board right here actually represents phenomenally good value for money for someone who wants to especially build a mini itx pc maybe go with something like the 11400f however the final points to talk about here was the 10400f and the 10600. now when i tune these cpus i go with the 3200 megahertz profile i lock that in i drop the timings down to cl 14 and then because the maximum is 26 66 megahertz it doesn't make much of a difference at all for gaming and in fact i thought the gaming numbers on display here today from these two 10th gen cpus were actually quite impressive so if you can go out and find a cheap h410 motherboard and you get some cheap ddr4 memory and you find the 10400f or the 10600 or the 10500 on sale for a really good price then don't be afraid to go with that if you're a pc reseller of course you'll want to go with the 11400 f or the 11700 f because let's face it if you're reselling a pc the consumer always wants a higher number higher number must mean better right the final thing to talk about is the ryzen 5 3600 and over the course of the 10-400 f being released and the price is being similar and then now distorting to a quite a sizable gap i would recommend thinking twice about getting the 3600 at the current market prices where they've gone way over their 199 msrp where i'm seeing them available for around 240 usd so that is a price increase of 20 percent so when we grab that 20 price increase and we compare it on the 10th gen and also even the 11th gen f cpus we can see the inverse is happening and they were coming under the msrp or at least in the 10 400 f case that was coming well under the msrp a lot of the time so it's a very good buy if you're on a budget and you don't care too much about the upgrade because i will say one thing with amd's 5000 ryzen series cpus out there at the moment they do represent a better upgrade path if you're going to purchase a motherboard in itself but that said the 11400f does provide its unique advantages over the 10400f of course that being pci 4.0 and also support for higher memory speeds up to 3200 megahertz over the 2666 on budget motherboards so summing things up quickly for you guys the 11400f it is a good cpu but i don't think it's a great cpu it will have some disadvantages going forward even over that of the 10400f but i thought the 10400f was the exact same scenario it was a good cpu but it wasn't a great cpu it had its own disadvantages too which i hopefully have explained in this video however before i get on out of here and also if you guys enjoyed the techies content then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comment section below if you have any questions about any of the parts used in today's video i'll be sure to get back to you as soon as i can but with that aside we do have the question of the day here which comes from sage and they ask you need a lot of cores and you picked the 5800x before the 5900x that has 12 cores question mark i don't get it so basically the reason i liked the 5800x one of the reasons i liked the 5800x before we even got into the 5900x was because of the market availability the 5800x going into that review i knew it was available and one thing i do do before i do post reviews is i do check stock levels and market pricing and also gauge demand on who wants what cpus the 5900x obviously from its msrp standpoint was a really attractive buy but i knew straight away when i saw that cpu and its price tag for what it was giving and also what i heard about rumors of the stock levels from retailers i knew it was going to be one of those cases where the prices go up and even to this date where the questions being asked and answered right in this video just checking actually an hour ago the price of the 5900x has gone to levels that make it far far inferior in terms of value for money to that of the 5800x and another few benefits for gamers with the 5800x as it is clocked higher out of the box than the 5900x and it does have slightly lower latencies hope that answers that question if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button and just ring it and i'll catch you in the next tech video which will hopefully be dropping sooner than later peace out for now
