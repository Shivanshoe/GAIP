[Music] it's now finally time for the episode of cash yes fix it and this is that episode where you guys send in your broken parts all those parts that are playing up and being a little bit janky in that they probably don't post properly or something's a little bit wrong that makes it work normally in your gaming PC and then you send it over to me and I do even more janky stuff and more unorthodox stuff around here at the tackier studio to try and get it to work and since the last episode there has been so much stuff here on the desk that is built up today we're gonna break it into two parts for this can ya fix it episode since we've got a heap of motherboards that have come in in total there's over 13 boards and twelve of them are really dirty and they're saying that they don't pose probably when I got them in and six of those boards are actually the same type of h97 as rock board and then we've got a few variated models from anything from B 85 to H 55 so what we're gonna do right now is take off all the heatsinks on these motherboards because I'm going to attempt to do something that I've never done before and that's get out a brush and also once the heat sinks are off quickly hose down these boards and give them some very quick and efficient tech yes loving to make sure all the grime and all the dirt is off these boards and of course I'll be removing all the CMOS batteries out of these boards to make sure there's no electric current going through them however the whole process of water on your computer parts is that you don't have any electric current going through them because if you do since that water is usually contaminated it will usually then conduct electricity which can destroy your PC parts but since these motherboards are going to have no electric current going through them then the water essentially is going to do nothing as long as it's all dried up before we then try to boot the motherboard again and of course if that motherboard does end up booting properly after doing some check yes loving in this manner then we will give it some multi-purpose spray to make sure it has a long life and it's protected against outside contaminants in the air but tomorrow we'll get onto these graphics cards as well a jewel Xeon system with its own unique ddr3 memory systems so yes that's right this ddr3 stick of memory here actually has a different layout to the standard ddr3 memory sticks that you see and it's intended for this motherboard here which supports dual Zeon's on the x58 platform and then of course we have some CPUs ram and busting down graphics cards but we will test those tomorrow because today's video is dedicated to getting these motherboards up and working so let's take all the heatsinks off now and then start the hosing and this is definitely one of those exceptions where it's actually a good time to be getting hosed [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I've just cleaned up the first six motherboards here waiting for them dry and then we're gonna get on to the next six mother bullets right here oh yeah dad man what do you think of washing motherboards nothing it's a fantastic idea I keep myself clean you might as well keep the motherboard trained yeah I think so I had to stop this sink getting scratched up put down some soft materials but you can really see the amount of dirt came off the motherboards the first six that we've cleaned and we've just got another six to clean up now because these are being left to dry and I gotta say this type of method it does really give it a nice clean shine though there is one like pretty bad sort of thing to be aware of and we'll talk about that later it's got to do with obviously using water out of the tap and rust but let's clean up the other six boards and then start drying them off and then we'll get around to testing it and we'll talk about what happens after that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we now have 12 motherboards all cleaned up and dried off and what we're gonna do is we're gonna leave them overnight so they can drive off fully make sure there's just nothing wrong but we just see all the dirt that's come off these motherboards it's actually quite substantial so that was surprising the good old washing trick does look like it's at least decent so far in that it's good for cleaning a whole lot of boards at once but we'll only find out in the morning once it fully dry it off if they do indeed work [Music] so this first motherboard here we've tried tinkering with everything tried all different memory slots even tried replacing the BIOS with another boss and we can see here the problem with this board is is that one of these CPU fan headers is actually knocked out so this has most likely been the result of a lightning strike or something like that so something's just completely knocked out on this motherboard so the first motherboard unfortunately doesn't work but we're gonna try the next one [Music] [Applause] [Music] and this is what I am talking about right here this board has gone to check yes Waterworld and it has come back with a big smile on its face and we did have to bend two pins back as well but they were easy bends and now we have one motherboard out of the four which is working so far and another thing we're gonna do right now is now give it some multi-purpose spray give it an additional layer of Tec yes loving so none of that water wash that we did yesterday incurs any sort of long-term rust or anything like that but I am super happy because this is a really nice board as well and it just means the success train is only starting up now and welcome to board number two where tech yes Waterworld has found another winner oh yeah and we got one of these fatality boards working finally finally this is a miracle but to be fair with this one right here in order to get it working I believe I just changing the boss from A to B fix that one so sometimes your BIOS chips can I don't know overtime they can just get faulty I think that's what happened with this board and it's all working now 100% so we're gonna give it now a coat of multi-purpose spray just like the other two working boards and I'm going to move on to the last few boards to go through [Music] [Music] so we've now got the second fatality bored at working in a row and I may have just figured out the trick to getting these to work and something I never thought of before until I remembered like an old car battery thing where I had a car and I just wouldn't start one time properly I took the battery out and I cleaned all the ends down and got all the corrosion off and then it booted again and I noticed a lot of these BIOS chips here with the teeth they've got that same sort of but I don't know what it's called like acid buildup on the teeth of the BIOS chip so cleaning that off and then putting it back in this time around has worked [Music] so basically you can hear besides my voice of really loud noise that's the graphics card fan and that's just going full ball straight from the get-go and the reason is doing that because the bias selection light isn't even coming on underneath and so this thing's not even initializing the BIOS to get to post which is a problem is actually quite a few of these boards we're talking about that a little bit later let's get through the rest of the boards and see what is working and what's not [Music] so now here's the final tally we've got eight boards down here that do not work and that gigabyte one was so close to working but in the end it was just kind of like this Intel board right here they both started tripping out and you can see what the Intel board that had this blue light that was coming in and out of existence which means that something's just gone on the motherboard no matter cleaning or our tech yes loving is gonna bring that back to life but what we've got on here on the top shelf is now four motherboards that are back and working so I'm gonna put the heat sinks back on them but at least four out of twelve considering all these boards were sent to me and I know they're all left with messages to say that they were not working so I'm pretty glad with the success rate at least today that we've got with now four of these motherboards working as opposed to zero when we started but we're gonna move over now to conclusion for part one because there's a few things to discuss especially with these asrock boards in this era [Music] so we're looking back now at these motherboards and a lot of those Azeroth fatality boards did not simply even get to the bit where they should be posting the LED light on the BIOS selection switch and that's got to do with a problem around the 4th gen with some asrock boards I believe this is only from what I've seen in my experience and that is I had a b85 which I put in my mom's computer and one of the hard drives after old age just gave out and then I replace the hard drive in that computer and after I replaced the hard drive I the computer wouldn't start again and I'll sing to myself what is going on here like whoa and so I started receding the memory which is the first thing usually I do and it took me about 10 tries on that b85 motherboard of reseeding the memory to finally get the computer to work again and then I told my mom after that look just do not touch this thing don't even touch the computer like when you press the power button just press it so there must be something on these fourth-generation asrock motherboards especially the budget line because I think the fatality has the same PCB as the b85 per fall or something I think that's the board I used and so what you've got when you got a thin PCB I think they're like 4 layer PCBs is that you do have to be very careful with them but over time as well I believe the trace or the integrity of the traces can diminish to the point where they are that sensitive and that even if you do something very minor it can set the board off and it doesn't work properly and so what we saw these h97 performance boards and there was an also an H 87 in there is that the washing and getting all the dirt off that didn't really make a difference it was mainly I guess cleaning up the BIOS chip in one of them that did fix one of the boards legitimately but I think at the end of the day the lot of the boards that didn't work didn't work because they were just faulty and not fixable from a fixable standpoint to begin with and so that kind of I mean that's just what it is it's just how it is I go through the boards and if they got potential then I'll go back and I'll clean them again and all go through them again and I even did that with some of the BIOS chips on these boards but they just did not work they wouldn't even give out a signal so some of the traces I believe on this PC beer just shot to the point where it can't even initialize the BIOS chip and that's just the way it is so I mean thanks for sending those out that was from a local computer store that sent me out a box of these boards and said that they came back faulty so all the boards in today's video that were working with were faulty but begin with and so the fact that I got four of them to go again I was really happy with that that gigabyte board so close to working but at the end of the day that's what happens when pins are just too far bent usually when they bent a little bit you can bend them back with these and the board will work again but some of these pins were so far bent to the point where you try and bend them back they're just gonna snap off because now they'd like there instead of being bent like that way they're bent in reverse angle and then you pull them back and they just snap off and that's happened it really happens because bending pins in that manner is extremely difficult to begin with I believe I don't even know how you been pinned like that is the only thing I could think of is someone's literally like dropped a CPU and then it's hit the pins so hard that has been them so bad that's like I don't know if there's any other way cuz yeah I don't know because I have seen it there all right I'll give you guys a little bit of story with the hot offs like I have seen at the heart offs in the past some of those pins have been mangled to the point where I know it's these young kids going through and they're like literally just pressing the pins down and even then those pins don't look as bent as some of the pins that I saw in today's motherboard where must have been like a really hard impact anyway that aside we did taste success but I would have liked to have tasted a bit more success especially since I did go through all the hassle of washing these boards up which I will admit does make the balls look really clean especially after that if you use the multi-purpose spray on top of that you've got a board that like literally looks brand new so I'm happy with the way that the four boards turned out after they got the wash artfully yes loving but one thing I will stress again is that do not wash any parts that have electricity stored in them so things like a power supply make sure you keep that thing away from water period even if it's switched off and even if you've drained it I mean I wouldn't even go there things like keyboards and mice if they've got on board ships that carry an electrical current and store memory for instance don't put them anywhere near water and don't put them anywhere near break clean or even electrical contact cleaner that's one important thing to do is electrical contact cleaner even though it's a good it's meant for electronics it's still recommended to not spray it on live electronics so one thing to come out of this is with the motherboards they're all turned off they're all D charged and so you can wash them and you can clean them up and then they will look like new again but you've got to keep in mind that there is that element of rust that can build up over time because the waters contaminated coming out of a tap that can have traces of whatever minerals in them and especially if you live close to the beach for example here on the Gold Coast that can absorb some of the salt from the breeze which comes from the ocean and then your parts will really rust out extremely quickly so water can act really fast in that manner so it is really important if you're washing parts to then make sure the water is dried off straightaway do I have a lot of other youtubers putting PC parts in the dishwasher I mean personally I don't like to mix mechanical stuff with editable foods they just don't mix together even if it's in the same place where they get cleaned that's just me personally I do let us know though what you guys think in the comment section below about some of the cleanup methods and have you had any experience with these h97 boards like I had here today where those bias lights aren't even coming on and another thing is - I do have these eight boards here if someone is local and they've got skills in soldiering and replacing chips and they think they want to have a crack then just send me a message and yeah you can come and pick all these boards up and have a golden because I know there's some people in the comments that are like hey dude make sure you don't chuck them out and the thing is I'm not going to post them because the postage is so expensive that'll be worth more than the motherboards themselves without side we do have a few messages from the viewers here for that can yes fixit's and the first was from Sina predominant it an AM for ATX motherboard and it was spilled coolant around the CPU socket and will still boot but under load it would hard reset he says he loves the channel keep up the good work and inspires me to search for gum tree for bargains so thanks so much for that be 350 motherboard I this is the thing I haven't done this in so long and nine months that I believe I fix that board up by just spraying some multi-purpose spray on and then cleaning it down and then updating the BIOS and it worked a hundred percent again so thanks for that one and also we've got from Matt he says a hello Brian I've been watching your channel for a while now really appreciate enjoy your personality and the content hopefully you can find a use for some of these older parts and so thanks a lot for that Matt really appreciate any parts that get sent in from you guys and then the last one here is from Greece so the person didn't leave a name but the message is really funny anyway says I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year from Athens Greece keep making videos and don't bash seven seven five so they're talking about LGA 775 and I don't really bash it it's just that I get so much frustration out of LGA 775 it's not funny I find usually like one in two builds that I do will have some weird problem that is just so frustrating whether it's a board that's just too old and something's gone faulty or it's just some compatibility issue where I just do not want to deal with it anymore and so that's the reason sort of I went off and switched off LGA 775 it just got really frustrating really quickly but I do think they're really good if you can get one working and in pristine condition with a kickabout to ddr2 and like even like a gtx 1050 something you can still have a decent gaming pc to this date it's just for me personally looking through it and spending all the time and that's the thing time is something that i have to place a value on in my life otherwise I won't have no life and so that's why I've kind of gravitated away from LGA 775 but anyway guys before we get on out of here we've got the question of the day which comes from Joe wilkinson and they asked what's the best value case available in the US I've been looking for a case that's relatively low price but still looks good with clear side panels and RGB fans I wasn't able to find the case Brian used in the bid online so basically in the u.s. I'm actually not too sure what the best go-to cases may be some of the viewers in the US who regularly buy the RGB cases with fans in them can give you some recommendations but from just taking a quick look on Amazon there are two cases that I would personally be picking if I was doing builds over there and that would be the fractal design focus G especially in the white because it's got included white LED fans and it also has some pretty good cooling performance it looks really good out of the box and then there's the thermal take V 200 which actually comes included with RGB fans and the build quality is decent though the airflow on both these cases are mediocre so don't really go stuffing like a 20 atti or anything in there but something like an Rx 5700 in both these cases will be absolutely fine and on top of that if you're in Australia of course I go to msy for a lot of those budget cases where they come in at like 70 ozzie dollars which is like 50 USD and they come with controller for RGB fans and the good thing is they're not I don't think this is actually a good thing because if you're dealing with a lot of older used hardware you don't have the a RGB headers and so they've got their own controller onboard and so they're not a RGB but they've just got the remote with them and it really just makes life simple because a lot of the newer boards even some of the newer boards don't even have those a RGB headers if their budget newer boards anyway that aside hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button make sure you stay tuned for part two we're gonna be going through some graphics cards with that Joule socket multiple and test out some RAM and some CPUs to and that graphics card the r9 390x and that's a bit of a wrap for today if you guys have stayed this spot and you still enjoying the content and you love what we do around tech yes city be sure to hit that sub button if you're not sub to ready ring that bell to get the content as soon as it drops in your sub box and I do apologize it has been a long time since we have done a kenya's fix it but I'll put the P o box up here and also in the description for you guys if you got some Bergin parts and you want to me have a crack at them then you know where to send it and I'll see you next time peace out for now bye [Music] [Music]
