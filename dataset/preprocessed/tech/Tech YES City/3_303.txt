it is the month of august 2020 and at tech yeah city here there's one thing that hasn't popped up yet and that is the used pc part sign of the month where we're going to be going high and low and searching for all those used bargains that we can find going into this month though we've already got two deals a gtx 970 for 75 aussie dollars and then a nintendo switch which i managed to get for 300 aussie dollars with a case and three games so that was really cool i've always wanted to have a nintendo switch but i've never wanted to go out and pay at least this year those exorbitant prices that the switch went up to during this global thing anyhow let's move on to good old gamtry and marketplace and see what deals are pop a lopping there but also we're going to go up to brisbane anyway because i think the person with the gtx 760 from a while ago they've still got that card and we've been negotiating but every time i've gone to meet them and they've gone to meet me they've been busy so hopefully i can hit them today get finally get that gtx 760. i think it's like 60 aussie dollars and you're probably thinking 60 aussie dollars for a gtx 760 not that good of a deal it's not that good of a deal but gpus are easily the most in-demand thing when it comes to pc parts at least where i am at the moment so going forward we'll go look for these deals but we'll also talk about the climate a little bit later on see if it applies to where you are locally in the world talk about trends all that good stuff let's gear on up and make this an episode to remember that's a long for remember [Music] kicking things off with gumtree from the first deal i found at the last we got an rx 588 gigabyte put down an offer of 200 it's still got the box they say it's in excellent condition so if we pick that up it's a fair deal the moving on is a really interesting deal in my opinion hybrid hard drives the 2.5 inch kind going for 10 each so they've got eight of them i just said look i'll take the lot because the hybrids are actually pretty decent especially for low end budget gaming pcs where you just need to put one drive in these will really do the job and at ten dollars you cannot go wrong next up we've got a 24 inch samsung monitor i put down an offer of 30 aussie dollars then after that is an r7 360 drop down a 50 dollar offer there then moving on with a pc with an i7 5820k 16gb ram motherboard in a case they wanted 600 for this i just dropped in an offer of 350. it's pretty low but again you're buying a used part it's untested something could not be working properly and i feel like with ryzen and also the new i5s out there this really doesn't represent really any good value at six hundred dollars the moving on is a whole pc with an i3 third gen everything else motherboard ram uh power supply case and i've put down an offer of 80 dollars but the good thing about this is the case and power supply aren't too half bad for instance we could put a 1050 ti in this thing and up the ram to 8 gigabytes and put an i5 in and we'd have a decent po tent little gaming pc on our hands here the next up here is a benq monitor and keyboard they want 30 bucks i just dropped in an offer of 20. see if they want to get rid of it i need monitors and the keyboard looks like it's in pretty good condition too so otherwise i'll try and get that and the last potential deal we've got up here is someone essentially just selling their pc and asking for offers so it's got a 6700k a gtx 1070 32 gigabytes of ram i just put down an offer of 650 aussie dollars you never know you've got to be in it to win it kind of thing so we'll see if they get back to us on that and lastly going through marketplace i've found three potential graphics card deals but two of them already got back to me they said no on my offers and then there's a gtx 1070 which was up for 350 aussie dollars we put down 300 which at 300 aussie is definitely not that great of a deal but it's pretty much fair market value on the used market so hopefully they get back to us and accept that because yeah we do need gravis cards that is the one thing that is in desperate need around techie city so with all those offers out there we're going to let them sit for a little while and in the meantime i'm going to give lez a call see what he's got kraken and in the background we've got this pc that i got to take up to brisbane anyway this is part of the 100 flip up challenge where i've found well i've sold the first pc that was the white arrow cool strike x case and all that stuff got rid of that for asking price but then we got this one in the background here which we're doing a very different trade for so you have to wait for that episode to see what's going on there this is going to be a really cool deal that's going down i'm going to hype it up a little bit in this parts hunt you have to wait and see that one and then someone's going to come and pick up this pc very soon too so it's a busy day hello liz what's cracker lacking mate what's happening i don't know i'm asking you what do you want to know okay you haven't got that pretty yeah okay okay man you and you still got you're still working [Music] what's going on [Music] you want so much [Music] um [Music] [Music] um [Music] so we're on the run here and i am now filming on my phone because i forgot my camera even though i brought my spare memory cards if the audio is good then you can thank google with the pixel 3 because i'm using my pixel 3 to record if the audio is bad then you can blame google for the pixel 3. don't blame me because i forgot my camera i guess it's just 20 20. this is just the way things go in 2020. anyhow we've picked up a heap of stuff from les we went and saw him i actually stayed for a couple of hours to have a good chat to him because i feel like really he's just been ill so i feel really sorry for him um there's my little navi it's just powering down because we're gonna hit the road soon and get this gtx 760 deal which uh is 60 aussie dollars i'm finally going to get that from last month's partner which is awesome but les has been a little bit ill i haven't seen him this ill since i've met him so we just had a chat for him he's gonna get better like i'm placing some faith in good old les and you know like after a while like people that you deal with they become your friends and so les is a good friend of mine so i care about him and hopefully he's gonna get better and then we just went up to after that went for about a half an hour drive up north uh because i had to go stop off at the computer shop to get some other stuff on the way but then i got a um i got this other deal where i swapped this that pc from the 100 flip up challenge i swapped that for three pcs so you guys are gonna have to stay tuned for that next episode it's gonna be really juicy but at the same time they also had a gtx 1070 which i got for 300 aussie dollars and an rx 588 gigabyte which i got for 200 aussie dollars so i'm doing pretty well so far but let's get back on the road because i like literally my stinger is just full i cannot fit any more parts in this thing and this is crazy because i like this is a big car this has a lot of room but i've stacked this thing up so this part sign is already too big to the point where i'm gonna have to pick up this graphics card pick up these hard drives that i've got the eight of them the guy got back to me and he said come pick them up so eighty dollars for eight five hundred gigabyte sshd's which is pretty awesome so you're going to pick up this graphics card pick up those hard drives i'm pretty much just going to head home and we'll recoup what we've got we're also going to make a plan going into tomorrow because i you know this car's full at the moment i just can't fit anything else in it but another really cool thing about parts hunting is you just meet new people and the person i met for this last deal they had a bar and they had they gave me a fresh beer on tap which was just amazing so always love a fresh beer on tap and i'm on my open's license so i'm allowed to have one and drive so don't worry about that let's get back to these deals [Applause] three [Music] and it's now about 9 p.m 9 12 p.m and we are finally back here at the tech yes studio where this is the first time ever i think in the history of the tech yes city local parts hunt where i have to split this into two parts because i just got that many deals and i stuffed them in the stinger and the sting is already like the biggest car that i've owned and the stinger was full it was chock-a-block i could not fit any more in this car and this is the thing i had to turn down a deal on the way home so basically in terms of who replied to me on the gumtree and facebook messages we had one reply on facebook to that gtx 1070. now they said someone was coming to pick it up maybe if they didn't they'd get back to us so that's still in the air but then there was on gumtree uh the person with the 19-inch monitor in the ad they said they wanted the 30 dollars firm on their 19 inch monitor so i'm just gonna let that sit i mean it's a 19 inch monitor i'm not paying any more for 19-inch monitors currently but then we had the guy with the i3 pcs and he actually replied to me and that was the guy that we had to knock back because the car was full on the way home and then basically i called him up and explained my situation he was like cool i'm free tomorrow come on over so we're gonna do this in part two we're definitely gonna see him as well as start looking for some more deals because i'm excited going into tomorrow but before we get onto that table the last ad that we had that replied to us was the r7 360 and they came back and said 50 was too low they didn't give me their minimum price but even then i'm not paying any more than 50 dollars for an r7 360. it's not a powerful card in 2020 and that's the max i believe you should go for a card of this caliber again it's used too you run the risk of it not working in a year or six months or even two weeks so it's got a higher chance of failing the list goes on with used parts and use graphics cards so never forget that factor with used parts you're not only paying for the best price performance most the time but you're paying for a discount for the fact that it's been used i never forget that now i think at the moment especially with used graphics cards in the market a lot of people are forgetting those factors and they're just running out and paying stupid prices for you scrap scouts but speaking of people who didn't get back to us we had the rx 580 that's still out there in the wild the one that we put an offer on for 200 and then we had a 24 inch samsung monitor they didn't get back to us then there's two i7 systems on gumtree both of those didn't get back to us so maybe while we sleep on it overnight all these people will reply maybe we'll get some deals who knows fingers crossed so we'll start off with a smaller table here then we'll make our way to the bigger table and first of all here we've got three monitors where we got one uh 20-inch samsung monitor another 20-inch dell monitor we got two of those and we got them for 20 each then we got a aoc 22-inch monitor les was just so excited about this monitor he's like man i love it so thin and that's another part about like hunting for these tech parts right like when les gets excited about some of the stuff i i get excited as well and you know people that out there in the audience are probably like oh he's getting excited over a 10 year old pc pile or something like that it's like yeah this is part of the i don't know man it's like micro management dude you gotta micro manage sometimes and it's a it's a fun thing to do anyway aoc monitor 22 inch and it's ballin i picked this up for 40 bucks then we got nine hard drives one of those was a one terabyte we got that for thirty dollars then we got eight of them for fifteen dollars now i managed to get a lot of hard drives out of less he didn't really wanna sell me too many but i said to him look dude you've sold us all these pcs with no hard drives i gotta piece out hard drive somehow and then he's like oh yeah he's scratching his head so he's like all right dude take some hard drives then we got these ones right here this was um the sshd's well i just read that note there they actually put a note on it brian wednesday noon that's me so we got these and we got eight of them sshd's ten dollars a pop i like that deal already it's sweet considering i need hard drives and then we've got the switch we talked about that earlier the gtx 970 but then let's pull this out of nowhere and he's like look i've got a special for you brian you're gonna love this and then i saw x79 i was like yeah like i tried to keep my excitement in two because if les sees that i get too excited then the price is going to go up as well so what i said to leslie said yeah yeah that's pretty good like you know really deep inside in the back of my head i'm thinking this is amazing man damn i gotta get this i gotta score this right now and so we got this x79 uh i don't even know what the cpu is we'll we'll check it out later towards the end we'll keep that a little bit of a secret we've got x79 motherboard anyway with the cooler for 80 aussie dollars i love it because i know this board is a really nice motherboard it's um one of them higher ender zeus deluxe ones and then we got this gtx 1070 they tested it it was working right in front of my face that we got that for 300 aussie and then we got an rx 580 and the reason i need an rs580 especially is because someone's already pre-ordered a pc with us and they're like look it's got to have an rx 5a they specifically demanded an rx 580. so we've got that and then we're moving over to the big table here where do we begin because we have a lot of pcs now i did have the other three pcs as well i did have some cases that i had to pick up along the way which aren't in this parts hump because they're not used parts and the other three pieces are actually separate for the challenge so we're gonna leave that as a special but right here we got these z 400 first gen workstations these were really like for me personally i really liked these les was doing them for fifty dollars a pop and the reason he was doing them for fifty dollars a pop is because they had these real wonky xeon cpus in them i think w3505 and i off the top of my head i don't even know what that was exactly i just know it's not that desirable but for me i know i've got a heap of first gen i7s which i'm going to try and pop in these pcs right here now another really good thing i like about the z workstation series is well actually quite a lot of things first they last a long time second they've got really good power supplies most the time but then another thing is believe it or not you've actually got high quality motherboards in these pcs that last a long time too and they've generally got the extra ram slots to go and the fourth thing is they work like i haven't come into a z workstation yet that doesn't work at least after you configure the bios and disable skewer boot with uh newer graphics cards like gtx 10 series or 1660 or rx 570s and stuff like that so we got five of these uh four of them were fifty dollars one of them was ninety dollars but the one we paid ninety dollars for actually had a gtx 660 and i said the letters look this is actually got a pretty decent graphics card in it i'll give you a bit more money and i know some of you guys will be like well man you could just like let it slide save yourself 40 bucks and like les is one of those guys i just like i wouldn't do that to he's over time i'm just he's become a friend which is you know i just don't wouldn't do that to a friend i mean look maybe if you're getting into used tech hustle you can start off at the gas station but but next up here we got this one for 120 aussie dollars when i first rocked up it was the one that i first got shown eight gigabytes of ram i5 i think it's 3570 h61 and um pretty that's pretty much it just a 500 watt banger thermaltake power supply and i mean i do like the case it actually is unique i think that's why les was so excited for this one i mean i'll probably try and do something unique with this case maybe add an led strip in because i tell you one thing about these silver inside cases is rgb or any sort of led light just glows and reflects like it just keeps bouncing inside off this shiny steel it's actually a really cool effect and then next up here we had one that was just came off the back of his truck he did say look he wants 100 bucks for it i7 920 and 4 gigabytes of ram and i said to him look you chuck in eight gigabytes of ram you get yourself a deal because ddr3 memory i mean even though i've come into a nice stack of ddr3 memory recently i know i've got to preserve that stuff and still be diligent about microing my ddr3 memory so when i saw this i was like well x58 bought i mean the zeus x58 board's the selling point here solid board then you got the cooler i7 inside 430 watt power spike case eight gigabytes of ram and then some potato graphics card but this was all sold on this so that was a pretty decent deal we got that and then we got over here a i think one of these was a lucky dip i think we had a z200 that lays through in because uh in the previous part-time i got an i5 off him for 90 bucks and the motherboard and like literally the motherboard and cpu was like that thing was buried in water or something it just didn't work properly so i just took it back to him he was like yeah dude we just took a lucky dip so i don't even know what's inside of this thing we'll pull it apart soon check out what's inside but other than that we have a first gen i5 dell system we got this for i think it did it for me for 80 bucks with eight gigabytes of ram and a first gen i5 motherboard power supply the whole deal so i was happy with that then over here we've got a free case that les just chucked in he said look do you want a case i'm like yeah sure i can do something with it i'll probably pull out the blu-ray drive whack two or actually three dvd drives in to fill out the front there and make it look decent it actually came with a corsair water cooler inside so that was a pretty cool bonus so yeah big thanks to les i guess if you take care of people on some things you get taken care of on other things so it's just all karma it's all working out so we've just opened up the lucky dip now pulled the cbu cooler off and it's an x3450 i'm gonna say not too bad like look could have been worse could have been worse it could have been an i3 so i'm i'm comfortable with this lucky dip i mean it could have always been better too like a 1231 v3 and had some ram in it but hey look i'll take this now you're probably wondering what's up with the lucky dip and basically when i brought the broken motherboard back to les he just basically said like dude what do you want to do with this and i'm like i don't know let's just do a lucky dip and then i saw his face his reaction was like dude this is such a cool idea a lucky dip so it goes to show that anyone in the world all around the world doesn't matter what age you are everyone enjoys a good lucky dip and now here's a little bonus pile as well as two monitor stands that i got thrown in with this whole package um these were just gravis cards that they said hey do you want these i actually said it first i was only really interested in the 6950s because we've got a 1 gigabyte model and a 2 gigabyte model so if you guys want to see a video on that maybe verse like even like a 2 gigabyte 7850 that would be very interesting to see if these cards can actually do anything in 2020 as opposed to like the 5 series i know these are all 5 series cards here i know these are all pretty much worthless like unless you want to play like an old school cs go potato then these are pretty much like just bangers nowadays i mean if they play valor in i'll give them that it wouldn't be too bad because there are people looking to build valorem pcs still and then les actually gave us this as well two terabytes he says it's failing the checks but since i did remember that partition trick i'm actually going to try and partition this two terabyte into a one terabyte to see if that will salvage it and summing things up with part one of this part sign we've got the tally right here at 1675 aussie dollars quick interlude we forgot the gtx 760 which was 60 dollars and we picked that up on the way home so that comes into the tally now at seventeen hundred and thirty five dollars and we have just loaded with parts this is a great little stock up here and another reason too why i wanna stock up this month is there is the potential that where i'm at could go back into full lockdown and if that happens then you're really going to find it hard to find any deals at all so that's another factor in the back of my mind because basically it started in the south and then it's sort of like starting to spread up north where as it comes more up north it starts to lock all those places as it goes up north anyway that aside fingers crossed that things do stay calm and they do stay down but it's you can already start like seeing where i'm at now like the tentacles are starting to spread a little bit so i'm talking about the rona if you guys didn't know um it's uh yeah it's making a bit of a buzz where i'm at again second wave so that's another reason why i'm uh stocking up big time this month but got a lot of good deals we're ready to rock and roll for part two if you guys enjoyed this part one episode then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know what was your favorite deal of today and why and also if you enjoy a little bit of the storytelling which i'm trying to mix in a little bit more because you guys always love storytelling so i'm gonna try and uh do a little bit more but we're going to rock a question of the day still with part one here and this is from richard brady and they asked how much do you think used 2080 supers and 2080 ti's will come down with the 3000 series launch i'm hoping to snag a 2080 super in the 400 to 500 usd range do you think that's reasonable and actually yeah i think that's where a 2080 super will come down to if and that's if the performance of the rtx 3000 is going to be as good as they say it is which i kind of do feel it will be because it's what's needed for the graphics card market right now nvidia need it as well they need to sell these new graphics cards and what better way to sell than to push out something that's a big leap and we've all been waiting for a big leap because the rtx 2000 series really i mean it delivered a boost in a delivered rate trace but one thing it didn't deliver was it didn't drop the price of the 1080 ti especially at launch like that came out rtx 2000 series came out and the 1080 i was like hey yo i'm still around i'm still fetching good money and so especially on the used market so at least that's what happened here in australia but this time around i definitely do think there will be price drops on the 2000 series because they've stopped production of them completely before 3000 series is launched and so when they drop those uh new cards you just see people just trying to get rid of all the old stock even retailers drop the msrps back a heap and they just get rid of them and then it starts afresh with new 3000 stuff anyway hope that answers that question anyway if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll see you in part two very soon peace out for now bye [Music] yes
