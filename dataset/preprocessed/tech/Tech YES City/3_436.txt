and welcome to part 2 where it comes to everything subjective when it comes to selling a gaming PC we're finally gonna go through each of these rigs first talk about the personal touches how much I put them together for roughly then how much I intend to sell them for and then after that we can talk about a heap of other factors involved in the market and what you need to look out for especially when it comes to selling that gaming PC but let's start off with the first example here we've got an RGB case this is called the TG I think it's 302 or 301 it comes with four RGB fans pre-installed and the remote controller and it's tempered glass so that would be about 50 USD now one thing is to the whole video today is going to be in Aussie dollars because that's my local market because I deal in Australian dollars I'm both picking up the deals and selling them in Aussie dollars I'm gonna be talking in Aussie dollars if you want to know the conversion rates just simply go over to Google and type them in and you'll get your respective currency and how much I'm paying and whatnot in your local currency but let's look at this build here 1660s super I picked this up the 330 bucks the rest of the components we had a motherboard ram and then a power play the case was 70 the cooler the Xeon 1270 v2 we got all this in total this build would have been about six hundred and fifty bucks to put together now we're gonna be selling this for around 950 and so we're gonna hopefully make about 300 Aussie dollars profit on this build and now the reason I'm able to charge the 300 odd Z is because I'm simply going to be adding value in the sense that I've got my SSD and my hard drive which are tucked behind there they're really cheap I got them for 40 dollars for the pair pretty much the RAM is some really nice stuff I got that for 50 bucks for the pair the motherboard is a top tier board and we got this for I think initially I got it for $80 but then I sold it for 120 and I got it back for 120 then the Z on the 1270 v2 we got that for a roughly I think it's around $50 or so and as we said before 3 30 and 70 for the case so telling it all up it really is looking like I'll make a couple hundred bucks on this bill it's looking good and we don't have to spend too much time thinking about things because we know what we got the deals for and we know the going rate for a 1660 super PC with essentially an i7 16 bytes ramp SSD hard drive let's move over now to this next one here this is a low-end system I think I am this one here is interesting because I put this up the sale initially and it came back to me where the person wanted to upgrade it even further so I actually traded this one back in but I sold this initially for $300 dollars and it had an 8 core in it and I really kind of it was a happened about a couple of weeks ago so what I decided to do was take the 750ti out of it put it in this build here that way I could use the included power supply saving me some money on this case and then I can put a six gtx 660 inside here and we got an SSD one terabyte hard drive a gigabytes of ram I decided to take out the eight core as well since it wasn't well fitted for this motherboard and put in a fork or FX 4300 so all up this build would have costed me I didn't even know because I think I've got this graphics card thrown in for free with another deal we've got $40.00 in drives case power supply model bought everything like that this thing with max costing me a hundred and fifty dollars so there's a hundred and fifty dollars profit there for this bill that's what I'm gonna guesstimate that at movie out of this next build here we've got the gtx 750ti the g 45 60 and that motherboard that we cleaned all the paint off now this build has a new case power supply it's also got the SSD hard drive same thing all these builds here pretty much have one terabyte and 120 GB SSD that's because I scored a massive deal on the both of them but when it comes to that we got a single stick of a gigabytes of RAM which isn't ideal but again a gigabytes of ddr4 it's going to match this price point and since it's a two core four threaded CPU gtx 750ti we're gonna hopefully advertise it just like the one beside it for pretty much a fortnight gaming pc where we'll charge pretty much similar money but because it's got ddr4 and it's got newer components and a 70 TI we might be able do you get around 350 Ozzie dollars for this next system so how much did this one cost me to put together well we've got the RAM stick about 40 ozzy dollars we actually pulled that out of the tech fast PC which I've already flipped that PCM made profit on so technically I could even price this is free but that's the synergy of doing all these different builds and hustling that's what you're gonna do the more builds you do and the more parts you mix-and-match and the more like even this gtx 660 for example the more we do that and pull those out and create value the more profits we're gonna make in the long term collectively they're getting back to this one right here this one I'm gonna price off at 350 Aussie dollars and I paid I believe off the top of my head I would have paid maybe a hundred bucks max for this bill because of the components like this board here I pretty much got this for just shouting the person I met dinner and I cleaned off all the paint that worked again and they have the G 45 60 bonus 40 go 40 bucks in drives 70 GI which came back and another build power supply in case so yeah guesstimating it's around a hundred ozzie dollars this thing owes me maybe even less but hey we're gonna make a nice little juicy profit off it moving down here we've got the next one here is the snowman on top of an X 56 60 on an Intel motherboard so we got 16 gigabytes around we can add another 8 gigabytes but it's gonna burn an absolutely fine and dual channel especially if we want to overclock it a little bit since we will be out overclocking this board and we've got a nice power supply in there I think it's like a 550 watt we got an Rx 590 I've got 120 gigabyte SSD one terabyte hard drive and so the balance here I'd say I'd be charging around 750 Aussie dollars for this build so all up this one I think I'm not gonna be making a whole lot of money because I'm using an Intel X 58 board which I bought in Japan for around a hundred and thirty dollars and that I just had it sitting here for a long time like I had the intention of using it for a really high-end build but then I realized like Intel stop doing the BIOS updates and I made sure I updated the boss a year ago but I'm lucky but that board essentially is not going to be that good going into the future so what I'm gonna do with this is just pretty much not make much money on this build at all and charge around $700 $1 but I think I'm gonna be going to be making $100 at most but at the same time I'm gonna be getting rid of some of the mistakes I made in the past on this PC and so you can see here - right before we move on to the next two pcs we've got 1 & 2 here these are the higher-end pcs in this whole bunch and they've got the RGB bling and so I've said this many times in the past the higher your price your pcs you also definitely want the aesthetics to go with it some people like to critique me a lot on the cables I've found especially on builds that are priced $1,000 dollars and under people will have never asked me for custom cables they just don't care because I do remember the young tech yes kid before I even got into tech I look at pcs I'll be like wow and then I'd just be looking up graphics cards and I remember some of the things I'd used to look at I'd used to look at the speeds of the CPU as opposed to actually understanding really anything to do with it the gigabytes of RAM the gigabytes of RAM on the video card those were things that now that I realized that younger me and the thinking of not knowing anything about tech and buying my first gaming PC those things apply so much to people who are going to be buying these gaming PC's so when we look at the aesthetics when we look at the specs when we look at everything involved if your PC has all those and the competitors don't you're gonna be getting a one-up on them but I definitely know one thing about the younger gaming kid the young tech guest kid before I even knew how to build pcs if I went to look for a gaming PC the only things I'd be concerned with was wow that looks pretty neat and what gigabytes of RAM does it have on the graphics card and what are the speeds of the CPU there were the only things you were really concerned with so when it comes to especially on like a PC that's around this price point having cables that are just neatly managed you don't have to worry too much about the color coordination of them I'd say once you step it up to a 3,000 or $2,000 PC yes definitely start worrying about everything on the build the $1,000 dollars and under I have never had one person ask about cables or custom cables of course me doing this video now I might get some trolls now starting to ask those questions but that's a good thing about having years and years of experience doing this beforehand you are able to correlate sort of questions and trends together and then able to keep going but let's look at this next one right here we've got an RX 570 FX 6300 16 gigabytes of ram 122 a SSD one terabyte hard drive brand-new case and a half decent power supply I think we pulled this power supply out of another build the cases around 39 Aussie dollars and the cooler this came with the motherboard and the CPU so we got that whole combo off that deal that we did right before Christmas 16 gigabytes Rams probably like 50 bucks the $60 graphics card $40 and drive so we put this whole build together maybe under 200 Aussie dollars now we're gonna be asking around 420 Aussie dollars for it so we make a nice juicy profit and then we move on the next one here we've got the V s550 and we've also got an rx 580 i seven twenty six hundred and sixteen gigabytes of RAM 120 GB SSD same stuff and I believe this one might even have 240 gigabyte SSD actually instead of the 120 and we got one terabyte hard drive now this is obviously this one lost the tray for the mount there so the hard driving sits at an angle but spec wise and performance wise this thing performs really nicely so I'm gonna be going roughly in the $600 price range for this and yeah this one in terms of putting it together again $60 RX 580 and this build actually came as a trade-in just like another PC we had because the person wanted to upgrade to a higher-end system so I was able to trade this in I believe for a roughly 300 Aussie dollars or so and then yes we're adding the $60 graphics card on top and then hopefully will profit around about 250 Aussie dollars so there it is all with those systems guys you can see that in total we're hopefully going to make roughly over maybe around $1,000 dollars on these six systems that's not a whole lot of money considering it's gonna take me a little while to sell them but it's a great thing to do on the side and of course I'm getting good deals and I'm able to then price my bills competitively so they sell them they're not sitting on the marketplace week after week and so that's one thing you want to make sure for me personally I've got a pretty good turnover rate I'm pretty healthy and the way I do these things and make sure they work I guarantee my systems and I offer a pretty decent value and that's at the end of the day what you want to be doing when it comes to selling these Pacey's and if you're doing it as a hobby like I'm doing then definitely just keep moving along and looking for those deals however you want to get the deals I don't know as long as you're not breaking any laws and you're doing it right then go for it be my guest but this is the six species right here but now we're gonna move on to and expand on yesterday's theory of what we're talking about with the objective side of things if you haven't seen that part I'll put the link up here but now we're going to go into all the subjective sides and there's a lot to it right we've got the first off the i7 phenomena we're going to talk about this straight away because I've noticed when I got back from overseas 2016 end of 2016 I 5s were still in high demand but fast forward now to the end of 2019 start of 2020 i sevens are now the way to go you want an i7 in your build even if it's a first gen i7 that sells people were looking for i7 because their friends have got a sevens and they see i7 on TV they're like wow there I went down to Harvey Norman they had an i7 laptop it was $2,000 this desktop has an i7 that's all they care about is i7 i7 i7 I mind you the smart consumers I'm finding a lot of the real smart consumers are asking for a rise in CPU but that's usually on the higher end and even then a lot of people that know about the rise and CPUs know how to build their own systems too and they usually like doing that so when it comes to selling these gaming PC's i7 is a definitely in demand metal as well as an Nvidia graphics card we're going to go over this right now but this Nvidia market share in subsequent my share is something to be aware of if you want to flip gaming pieces for instance if we get a 1066 gigabyte build that bill will perform maybe I think in 2020 form a little bit worse than rx 588 gigabyte build but the thing is the 1066 gigabyte that will sell faster and I can sell that for more money than the rx 580 built that's just how the market is where I'm at locally but one more thing as well if we look at another example our GX 2060 super builds I did a couple of them over Christmas I also did 5,700 XT build it took me longer to sell the 5700 xt build at $100 less than the 2060 super builds and this is real so the nvidia mindshare out there is that people want to get in video graphics cards in their gaming pcs there's this big wave that exists where people want to game on PC on Nvidia so for me I'm not gonna argue with the trends I'm just going to accommodate for them and make a bit of profit and so my advice take the subjective thing that goes on in the industry use it and utilize it to your benefit don't be the guy who's the hero running around on forums banging your chest all the time wasting your time writing comments about how the RX 580 should be selling better than the gtx 1066 gigabyte nobody cares for me I just look at those numbers and the great way I'm gonna interlude here with putting in the steam survey numbers this is a great way of checking what's going on in the markets and trends that you can see one funny thing was that the Nvidia market share is it sort of bounced down a little bit but now it's bouncing up towards Christmas and you can also see that with the Intel sales on CPUs they were bouncing up around Christmas so whatever happened over Christmas you just had that mass amount of Christmas buyers rushing in and they were picking up Intel CPUs with Nvidia graphics cards for gaming PCs to at least play on Steam in droves so basically what that tells me over the Christmas period is I should be offering a lot of i7 1066 gigabyte builds if I can pick up those pots because they're the pots that are going to be in demand according to the steam surveys but not just the same surveys at least a coin to what I've experienced selling products in the market but now moving on to the most important thing you can ever do when you sell a gaming PC and that is your advertisement or your ad advertisement if you're in the u.s. basically with that that is your open broadcast to the world what do you want people to see when you're selling your PC I'll give you some hints you want to clean profile picture you want a clean picture of the PC you want a detailed spec list of things and here's where you can also utilize say for instance some of those advantages to your play you can say it's got a genuine Intel i7 you can say it's got a GTX 1060 with 6 gigabytes of vram always make sure that you utilize what you've got to the best of your advantage even though we've got an rx 570 and a GTX 1060 sells better we can still utilize Fortnight because I know for a fact that our x5 70's and v 80's perform very well compared to the GTX 1060 counterparts in fortnight's so we can then say rx 570 plays Fortnight better than a GTX 1060 3 or 6 gigabyte I'm guessing it'll actually probably almost play it better than a 6 gigabyte I'd have to double check but I will double check that before I put my ad up but that's now a selling point because someone who is going to pay 750 dollars for a GTX 1066 gigabyte system to play fortnight may then go back to this RX 570 system which is cheaper and go hey I'm going to get the same performance otherwise we'll go buy that cheaper system and so that's how you can use the advertising to your advantage and you can really make the most of it and that's the subjective nature now there's a thing going on around Facebook last month I saw some dude like is I checked my competition I check out what they're doing if they've got new tips and ideas and they're really good and I look at them I'm like wow that's actually a good idea I'll go and copy/paste that don't be afraid to copy/paste your competitors if they're doing something then you know it's working and they're doing really well then go do it I know when I started out doing three-month guarantees on my systems I noticed a sway of other people started doing it because it worked but for instance on the marketplace where I lived I noticed over Christmas there was one dude selling PCs and he literally had his profile picture of a chick being strangled and I was like what's this guy doing like you've got to put yourself in the shoes of an average person going to buy a PC I mean if I was gonna buy a PC and I saw a profile pic of a chick getting strangled I'd be like you know look I don't I just want to buy a gaming PC I'm not I'm not after anything extra so there are some things you definitely want to when it all comes down to it have a clean listing have a clean profile pic have a clean pictures of your PC and then go from there that's of course if you want to make profit if you're just doing it for a bit of laws then I don't know maybe you're in the wrong field but more on the subjective thing that's what we've talked about right now is being proactive doing things that you can do that are going to make the most difference before your competitors do them but there's also something to be aware of and that's sometimes you got to be reactive as well and that if something comes out or if say for instance I'll Express starts having a flood of these cheap CPUs all the sudden and just your competitors notice about them before you do and they're suddenly selling all these really cheap pcs on the market you have to react to that and so you might have to quickly bring down your prices get rid of your current stock and then adjust to the new metas so there are things that you have to do I mean for me I'm lucky in the last few years that it's always been a gradual change at least with a few months in advance on leeway so I'm able to adjust to that over time and so I'm not losing really any money but sometimes you have to be quick and you have to be reactive and react to the situation for instance I wasn't really doing the hustle in 2014 with use pcs but I know for a fact I did sell a GTX 780 right before the 970 came out and so this was I easily know by far was one of the worst examples of a price drop and I think sellers who have had stock would have had to have been reactive in this situation that's when the 970 dropped at three hundred and thirty dollars the seven 80s before that were like five hundred dollars and then the 970 drops got better performance or it's got very similar performance it's much more efficient and it's a much more in demand graphics card little did people know that had 3.5 gigabytes versus the three gearboxes they thought it was for u-boats versus the three but regards it did have more vram it was a much better card and it dropped and all the sudden those seven 80s that were up for sale with 500 I was lucky to offload mine for around about 500 it was a lightning addition I got it really cheap and then I offloaded it right before the 970 released and I was really lucky to do that because I would have lost like two hundred dollars instantly because those cards those seven ATS they crashed all the way down to like 300 sub $300 levels after that 970 was reduced so if something like that happens in the market just be aware that sometimes you have to adjust to it quickly otherwise you're going to lose more money than what you've already lost and so if we look at a 780 the prices of 78 is now are ridiculously cheap and a lot of people don't want them because of how power-hungry they are so what it all comes down to it in this market you've got to be proactive you've got to be reactive but most importantly as we said in part 1 you've got to do your own research and the basic way to start with your own research is to look at the price segments and to look at fire strike scores like let's be real fire strike is one of the best benchmarks ever made because it relates so well to what you can expect out of a gaming PC in particular categories friends of you look at an RX 5 70s fire strike store it will probably get around 12,000 points on the graphics core we look at a CPU like a i7 2,600 miles cores these combos are then at a price point of say 550 600 ozzie dollars for this combo providing everything else is good in the PC if we step it up for now 5700 XT that'll probably get around 27,000 points so that'll be practically over double the performance of an RX 570 so we're going to expect that now that field of that performance to at least be double the price sometimes it can be more because as we go to the higher end diminishing return starts to kick in say for instance an IRT x20 atti that's not going to be over doubled performance of a 5700 XT even though it's over double the price so factoring in what you should price gaming pcs at our particular levels it all comes down to how well that PC will perform ultimately in games but as well as what deals you're getting so all the time remember if you're in this hustle for making a little bit of profit on the side or you enjoy doing just making gaming pcs for people locally the better deals you get you're always going to be able to make more out of that than getting bad deals and that's why I a lot of the time I hear of these people paying asking prices and they run around and they're not getting good deals and then they message me and they're like I can't somebody gaming PC I'm losing money and it's like you've got to be patient you got to be disciplined if you see that gtx 1066 gigabyte up there for 250 Aussie dollars and you don't have a PC that's already pre-sold say friends someone hasn't put a deposit down that PC then you're taking a risk for me I'm max I'm gonna pay for that 1066 gigabyte is 200 ozzie dollars end of story because I know when I put that in a gaming PC I've now got the ability to make some money at worst I've got the ability to break even so for me I'm always putting in the back of my mind the worst case scenario and that is breaking even and believe it or not I I don't even think to this date I've ever lost money on a PC build so basically all that self learning over the last few years has enabled me to do this as a hobby as well as show you guys on YouTube how to do it as well and enjoy it and this is going to tie in to the question of the day really well because this comes from a galio bolden sorry if I butchered your name on the pronunciation is it actually sustainable to just flip PCs like if you don't use the YouTube ads money can you actually pay for bills and eat etc I'm curious like if you never had an office and you never did YouTube that's a really good question because if I never did YouTube or if I wasn't doing YouTube and I wasn't doing any of this I would still be doing it definitely it's worth it but that being said you've got to know what you're doing like it's like any profession I guess if you don't do it right you can lose money I know friends of mine my dad's a builder he knows so many builders that have gone bankrupt and that's because they haven't done their trade right so anything you do in this world if you've got a set of skills and you can utilize that properly then you can make money off it for me doing YouTube as well it's just a synergy thing it goes really hand-in-hand though there are a lot of times like all these sick species here on the desk I I never intended to make videos on them that was just all behind the same stuff because I want to clear out a lot of the stuff in my studio and get a fresh mindset for 2020 though I thought okay people are asking me questions about how to sell pcs what do I do when it comes to selling pcs all the stuff involved I thought I'd take the opportunity to show you guys what goes in and what goes through the whole process there is more than meets the eye when it comes to flipping gaming PCs and there is a lot more below and beneath the surface that they should become automatic it's like driving a car the first time you do it you're like oh wow I got to hold the steering wheel I got to change the gear stick I've got to look right look left but then after a couple of years of driving it's all just like whew there we go driving around and getting those deals and that's the same with PCs now it's just become a thing where I don't even I guess consciously think of what I'm doing it's all unconsciously automatic thought that goes into it all and I'm able to do it and enjoy it that's the most important thing so what it all comes down to it I just I really love doing this there are some new metas the I guess the one thing I'm enjoying the most is like the new Aliexpress metas so I'm definitely gonna focus on that in 2020 because there's a lot of goodness coming in and markets constantly change the one thing I am disappointed in a little bit is the GPU market especially the sub like $200 level that really hasn't gained a whole lot in the last few years I like I remember back in 2016 you can get a GTX 1063 gigabyte brand new for like 170 delivered now what have you got for once there to live in you go around a 1650 soup bar the value for money in that segment just hasn't come far at all where the 1660 soup is really good but don't get me wrong but that's still a two hundred and twenty nine USD graphics card so it seems like that price points got a bit of love and attention but it feels like the sub $200 price point on GPUs hasn't come down to where I would like it personally to come down because people are then sitting on their GTX ten 70s and they're still asking good money for them and that enables the use price performance flip to sort of come to a stagnant level where it's ironic because GPUs were gaining so much up until 2016 and CPUs were kind of going nowhere now it's sort of the reverse where as n2 is really pushing the CPU boundaries but then the GPUs are just seem to be like whoo so anyway here's to hoping that $200 sub price point does get better in 2020 one can only hope
