I mean here marks the last gaming PC that I can put together before I completely run out of use pots and this is gonna be a kind of a precursor for tomorrow's used PC parts on of the month where I'm pretty sure that I'm not gonna be getting as lucky as I did in the previous months but also today I want to go over some of the things you can do if you're on a strict budget or of course if you still want to get a gaming PC and last night before I went to sleep I was thinking about this a little bit more in depth and when I hit rock bottom which happened in 2007 that's when I had to borrow money off my ex-girlfriend those times in 2007 at least before 2008 money was still good people still had jobs it was a healthy economy in 2007 so when I hit rock bottom I guess I could say I hit rock bottom in a fortunate time I could only imagine if you're out there at the moment if you're hitting rock bottom now and it's like literally one of the most unfortunate times in history so what I'd be doing here today is of course showing you some tips and tricks if you're on a strict budget and maybe if you've got family members and you want to chip in and build something that'll get you through isolation but also I'm gonna be having a giveaway in two days time as well so stay tuned for that video we're gonna be giving away some stuff and showing how you get in a chance because who knows how long this thing's gonna last and also right now for buying PC parts I will say if you have a plan to buy PC parts in the next few months you're better off doing it sooner than later I've spoken to retailers the supply chains are getting disrupted if you're in Australia the Aussie dollar that is tanked against the USD and also another thing is locally here on the Gold Coast it's I guess people are really starting to panic buy pcs because my competitors have sold out of pcs days ago and this is an unprecedented time where this is the first time I've ever had it competitors are sending business my way and that usually never happens then what we've got right here is the HP Meador if you guys saw the video we basically managed to reuse this power splay here which most the time comes in with a gold or platinum rating and now since we've got three SATA ports from this we can actually make magic work and then we can plug 2 into our hard drive an SSD and then another one where we can use a 6 pin adapter to get something like a 1650 super working which I will say one thing about the 1650 super actually surprised me with its performance it's a really fast card and it beats out that of a 1066 gigabyte most of the time so it's going to go perfect with today's build we've got a 47 70 and also 16 gigabytes of RAM so let's quickly whip this thing up see if we'll actually run a benchmark without crashing out because that's one thing I want to test and see if this power supplies up to that because I've never done it with a 1650 super before I believe you might have done over the 1650 which was fine but not the super but other thing too is if you do do this you have to make sure your power supply can be mounted up the top of the case if you're mounting it down the bottom it won't work as the cables just simply aren't long enough here we're using the Nimitz and 7 I believe in Australia you can pick these things up for 50 Ozzie dollars at least that's what I got mine for before the local retailer sold out of cases that's right they go no more cases left so that's how bad supplies getting I was like I guess I was happy that I got these before they ran out and then we've got an exhaust fan here which what we do is since we've got a fan header here we just have to chop the little bit here because it still will work with a three pin but we just have to chop out this little bit here and then it will go on fine so putting this PC together is like a normal PC up to a point if we can see here we're mounting the power supply which doesn't fit a normal ATX power supply size so we have to improvise a little bit here or we can screw down one corner first off and then actually unscrew the fan and use that to support the mount in the top corner there after that we get two PCIe brackets we shorten them up and basically we mount one on the outside one on the inside this gives enough stability for the power supply to then not wiggle around and be in there firmly so the next thing we're doing here is Sol during the 5 volt and the negative to the RGB on the case and this works out perfectly because we've got no Abel's left over and since this was originally intended for the DVD drive we can actually reuse that and then I sold it on to the RGB wires where they were originally molex and since we don't have any molex connectors we can just save a couple of bucks here instead of using any extenders and then probably use an adapter on an extender which just makes things a little bit weird we can just simply solder these wires together and then safety tape them off and we're good to go that's about all the differs from a regular build and we don't have any i/o shield the CPU cooler is also a OAM proprietary solution from HP though we can get around this by using four six over thirty-two nuts though the good thing is is that since we've got no cables left over there's quite literally a void of a thing known as cable management so we're now finished off this build here where the case is coming in at a very good price it's still got tempered glass and as we said before it's 50 Ozzie dollars which is about 30 USD and it still got a bit of RGB LED bling there which you may have noticed that we had to splice up the wires because our power supply ran out of spare wires and the good thing was is that that end DVD connector is a 5 volt and this RGB here needs a 5 volt so it was a perfect match made in heaven for that soldering job and then we had the spare solder connector leftover which we're using for the gtx 1650 super now with this whole setup here we've got a 47 70 16 bytes of ram and a decent graphics card SSD hard drive now one thing is if you want to go down this route where you want to use the HP 600 series and still keep your original power supply save some money like we've done here then don't couple it with anything higher than a 1650 super or an RX 470 and you'll notice I said 470 and not 570 because I've actually tried this in the past with a 570 and the sad thing was is that it still works nothing cut out or anything but the power supply goes into extremely high rpm mode and so it will sound like really bad I mean I'm one to not really care so much about noise but this power supply really just starts loose it once you start going past those two gravestones these two here I'm gonna show you guys I'm gonna do a stress test right now with a 1650 soup ah I'm actually gonna load up f1 2019 and just keep that on loop for an hour and we'll come back and it will be absolutely fine so I've perfected my HP 600 series game where it's to the point now where you can get some serious good value for money even in times like these though the one negative as we can see here is that when we have to boot up our PC we have to press f1 that's because we couldn't connect our USB 3 front out connector because unfortunately the graphics card is blocking it out you can't buy some bright angle adapters but I have had some bad stories and that the cheap ones don't actually work properly at all so your mileage may vary there but what's worth when I was younger I used to have to press the f1 key every time I booted my system anyway so it's not that much of a detriment so after we quickly run the stress test I'll come back for you guys and list some GPUs you may wish to consider still awesome I guess oddball om systems and pots that I guess a lot of people aren't gonna be buying in the mainstream they require a little bit of tinkering work but it'll still provide really good value for money in these weird times [Music] and we've just now exhausted all our battery and this machine is running fine the basically you can hear now the power supply is running absolutely fine - so this whole setup is geared towards 1080p smooth gaming on a budget so f 1 2019 actually gets really good FPS with this configuration - so let's move over now and look at what parts we can get if you're on a budget but also if you want to build a new PC just want something good at the moment so basically that is the last PC I can put together after that I'm out of stock and this is the craziest season I've seen yet it's even crazier than Christmas and all the local people I've spoken to are saying the same thing as well so it seems like the rush has just come this week where I live locally where first thing we saw was toilet paper and that was a craze that sort of come and is going at least now where I live but now it seems like gaming PC's are being targeted so my advice would be if you are comfortable and you can afford to go out and get something that within your budget then I'd do it sooner than later because I've spoken to a couple of retailers and supply has been geared up towards like a six to eight week period where they get the shipments in advance and they have that amount of stock but once that all runs out then it could be prices just go through the roof so what I showed you guys just before is some of my favorite things that I do here on the channel like that HP 600 SFF they're going really cheap even in the u.s. on eBay you can pick these things up for dirt cheap you grab a case where it has the power supply able to be mounted at the top and then you can reuse that power supply and most sellers will chuck in a hard drive a gig of ram I five and always really need to do is I get yourself a site at a six pin and the gtx 1650 super because i was looking at the 1650 super when it first released i was like yeah okay there's actually starting to grow me a lot and if you're in the u.s. it's around I think 160 which is a pretty decent price and then in Australia they're still priced okay considering the Aussie dollar has crashed so I like this card it's weird how it's grown on me but that's mainly because I'm able to extract a lot of value out of that and couple it with budget om power supplies and they don't get noisy or nothing shuts off but if you want some easier options where you really don't have to do anything besides just put a graphics card in then the del T 1650 series is a good option there's also the T 3500 and of course the Optiplex is they're very popular but usually the Optiplex is I find because they're pretty well known they do carry a bit of a premium so I'd honestly be looking for a 1650 where it matches a 1650 super perfectly so I guess the irony there is you can get a double 1650 if you go that Dell route but there's also the Z 420 desktops from HP these are pretty good same deal as the Dell series where they've got pretty good power supplies and all you have to do is add in a graphics card though one thing I did find very weird and bizarre with the HP Z 420 was that we put a graphics card in and it would work off the HDMI port but it wouldn't work off the DVI port so display an HDMI were fine but then the DVI port wouldn't work it was one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen and we tried a different graphics card and we also tried different cables and monitors and we put it down to it just being it wouldn't work off DVI we're booted okay but once it got the windows it would just clunk out on DVI only so if anyone has an answers to why it's doing that with the HP z4 20 I love to hear your thoughts on that so that's one to be careful of if you buy that rig also do be careful of some OEMs out there while we're talking about that because you get someone like the third gen Verret ons for example and they don't work with GTX 10:50 TI's or RX v 80s or anything of the newer graphics cards they only work with legacy cards so if you do come into this problem you'll know straight away and some of these Verret ons for example the third gen I'm gonna look at the m4 where the 4th gen works absolutely fine but the 3rd gen has it so that you can't change any of the options in the BIOS and you can't get that graphics card to work properly so that's a weird one to look out for I will put some links in the description below for you guys are some of the OEMs that are pretty good and I've tested before and they represent great value for money in these weird times now of course lastly if you want to build a new PC it still looks like parts are fine in the US in Australia I haven't researched other countries but it seems to be OK for now where you can get for instance of 5700 XT or rise by 3600 or an RT X 2060 and you should be okay and you're not really paying any massive higher premiums than you would in say if we compare it to the mining boom craze that went through where you just couldn't get yourself a graphics card so new parts are looking okay for now but do keep in mind in quite a few countries they are doing what is called the infamous helicopter drop where they're just giving everyone money if that happens then you may see demand especially for new parts just like I'm seeing locally here for gaming pcs you may see that start to spike so if the I guess the supply chains don't get alleviated soon then this could become a problem especially in a month or so time now of course the last thing to talk about is good old Aliexpress where if you live in a country where you can't get access to decent retail prices then that seems to have ramped up production again we're shipping times are going down again or back to normal to the three four-week period so you can get some good things like rx 400 or 500 series cards they're always a good buy on aisle Express and of course the two Zeon's in particular some of my favorites are the 26:20 v2 this thing's going off at 17 bucks 3.2 gigahertz 6 cores 12 threads I've taken a look at that CPI put the link up here and you've also got the 26 78 which we also recently took a look at and of course the infamous Rison v 2600 which is pretty much a value king going forward into 2020 though in terms of the Rison v 1600 AF that's pretty much coming in the same price at the moment as the 2600 and there and with all that out of the way I hope you guys are staying safe and this predicament hasn't affected you too much at least with YouTube at the moment things seem to be ok but the Adsense money has dropped down a lot in the last few days so that's already an instant hit for youtubers so that's one thing I'm feeling personally they do let us know your thoughts and opinions too in the comment section below if you've got some really cool matters that you can share with people on how to get a cheap gaming PC together in these rough times and I'll be sure to pin that if it's a really good one and without a sub we've got the question of the day which comes from RTF co-fired or and they ask why is he looking like a salesman for washing machines and I can only really say one thing hello my friend if you are looking for the best washing machine in history then you have come to the right place Tech yes city for only you can get yourself a washing machine that will clean up all that wd-40 out of your underwear and it'll make sure it's looking and smelling brand new for another round of wd-40 Tech's yes lovin I know guys I'll catch you in another tech video very soon if you enjoyed this one then you have to do hit that like button and if you stayed this far and you're not yet subbed then ring that Bell that options down there to get the content as soon as it drops and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now wait [Music]
