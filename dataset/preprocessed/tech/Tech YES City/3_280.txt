pcie aka peripheral component interconnect express it replaced pci and replaced it in two major ways firstly it was a serial computer expansion bus standard whereas the original pci worked in parallel with a total fixed bandwidth amount that is the more components that utilize that bandwidth the slower its access became french component per se in the system as opposed to pcie which if you added in more components then sure the maximum bandwidth is still there however the maximum bandwidth would ultimately be shared across all devices pcie also carried with it a new slot configuration which comes in sizes of x1 x2 x4 x8 and x16 most games will use the x16 slot available on their motherboard to power their graphics card however the pcie interface can also power hard drives ssds wi-fi and ethernet connections though here is where the fun starts right after this sponsor spot this video is sponsored by dashlane if you are sick and tired of missing out on pre-orders for ps5s xbox series

gone through generations of improvements starting with of course gen 1 with an x16 slot or 16 lane configuration supporting speeds of four gigabytes per second both ways in other words eight gigabytes in total read it right and this was polled at 2.5 gigahertz now this polling is very important this is what we're going to talk about later with the rtx 3090 and the results next in the improvement tier was pcie gen2 sporting doubled the polling rates at five gigahertz and doubled the transfers at eight gigabytes per second each way for 16 gigabytes in total pcie gen 3 essentially doubled the transfers yet again for 32 gigabytes in total and the polling rates were at 8 gigahertz now pci gen 4 which was introduced to the mainstream gamer by amd with their x570 motherboard launch supports 64 gigabytes per second and a polling rate of 16 gigahertz pcie gen 5 which will be later released in the future will then double the speeds of pci gen 4. so how much bandwidth does your graphics card exactly need and say for instance you're a 4k gamer will something like pcie gen 3 suffice well graphics cards or as i like to call them gravis cards work with 32-bit color this 32-bit color mode at 4k 30fps for example requires approximately one gigabyte per second transfers double that to 60 fps 2 gigabytes per second 120fps 4k gaming that will need 4 gigabytes per second transfers however these are only approximations to understand how much bandwidth a gamer actually needs so in theory even a pca gen2 x16 slot is more than enough for an rtx 3090 overclocked right well actually yes starting off with the games the numbers and the benchmarks our test system consists of an i9 10 900 k for pca gen 2 and gen 3 tests and then on the amd side we're using a 3950x for pci gen 4 tests since the intel side doesn't have dn4 support from the cpu just yet but both these cpus were used with 3600 megahertz cl 16 memory to ensure that the rtx 3090 would be pegged near 100 gpu utilization as much as possible go on to the numbers here we can see that shadow of the tomb raider pcie gen 2 x 16 was coming awfully close to the successors gen 3 and 4 at x 16 speeds though limiting the gen 3 bandwidth to x4 showed that this rtx 3090 that was overclocked was starting to power through these limits though not by a whole lot horizon zero dawn showed a pretty similar trend though it was slightly more in favor of having more bandwidth available do maternal very similar showing the pca gen 3 x4 similar to gen 2 x8 and of course the og gen 1x16 was reaching its limits here the division 2 yep nothing to see here folks and then lastly modern warfare same scenario as before however testing 1080p on the flip side showed an identical trend to the other games at 4k so basically summing it up gen 2x16 is more than enough for even an rtx 3090 overclocked in 2020 though you may have noticed that gen 3x16 on the intel side of things was beating gen 2x16 by slightly better margins in all titles and you may be wondering why is this well this has to do with what i believe is the polling rates and we hinted at this earlier but basically the difference between five gigahertz and eight gigahertz is a sixty percent increase in the polling rates so the cpu pulls the gpu shader essentially faster giving that slight increase that you see in the fps numbers gen 4 if we were to theoretically put this on the intel side of things this would in turn give us slightly more fps as well but it would start suffering significantly from diminishing returns an easy way to help conceptualize this is to just look at polling rates on mice where razer for example wants to go from a thousand hertz with an average of 0.5 milliseconds delay polling all the way up to 8 000 hertz an 8-fold increase in polling rates but only an absolute drop in 0.4375 milliseconds average as opposed to say 1 000 hertz versus 125 hertz we have a much larger drop in absolute average delay of roughly three and a half milliseconds average if you're trying to figure out the math just think that some poles will hit the start of the wave and some will hit at the very end hence why it averages out and so there it is with rtx 3090s if you want to put these in sli overclock them on gen 3x8 slots it's going to be absolutely fine though i really don't think your wallet would be however these results were ultimately a big surprise for me personally i thought the rtx 3090 would require a bit more bandwidth but the numbers and testing always paints the biggest picture so keep in mind although you won't need to seriously worry about pcie bandwidth for gaming for some years to come even on a gen 3x16 motherboard what if there was a revolutionary breakthrough in the way that your motherboard and computer graphics were processed well you'd probably just go out and buy a new motherboard with the latest and greatest pcie gen 6.9 so there it is with pcie gen 3 versus gen 4. it's nothing to worry about on any modern day graphics card through an x16 slot and in fact gen 2x16 is still okay so currently the biggest difference between pcie gen 3 and gen 4 is actually i believe on the nvme side of things where the x4 slots do gain a lot more speeds on pca gen 4 motherboards where you've got those higher speed ssds running at higher speeds because the throughput is ultimately doubled going from gen 3x4 to gen 4x4 and with all that aside if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button for us also if you're enjoying the content around tech yes city and be sure to hit
