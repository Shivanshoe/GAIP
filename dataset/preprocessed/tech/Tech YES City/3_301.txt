last night nvidia did their live stream
and Jensen delivered the news that a lot of us tech enthusiasts have
been waiting for and that is rtx 3000. now they've announced three
different products and that is the rtx 3090 the
rtx 3080 and the rtx 3070 but what we have seen
already is that another youtube channel called digital foundry
has uploaded gameplay footage with percentage differences
between an rtx 3080 and an rtx 2080. so in today's video
i'm going to be doing some educated guesswork with the numbers that we
already see in that we're going to grab those
percentage numbers convert them back to fps
and then guess the performance of the rtx 3070
and also the 3090 and even compare that to the rtx 2080 ti
to see the value propositions of these new cards
in a number that's easy to digest let's get on with it
straight away looking at the numbers in the cuda core account from nvidia's own
website we can see that this is essentially cuda
core is nvidia's name for shader and amd call it stream processor what
they're doing here is something that you can't really compare
directly with the rtx 2000 series or turing
versus the new generation ampere because in one of the illustrations
and one of the videos that they showed they had the shader like literally
splitting into two kind of doing some matrix agent smith
duplication kind of thing here and so what they're doing with the cuda core
performance and also the cuda core count is actually
a lot different than the previous generation so
basically if you got out your good old calculator and you said oh wow
the 3070 has 5888 cuda cores and the 2080i only has 4 352
and then you said okay it's going to be 35 faster you would actually be making a
wrong guess at least in my opinion and reason being
is because what we can do however is look at the fps that's already out
there on that 3080 versus that 2080 comparison that we saw
over digital foundries basically it wasn't an fps comparison
but again we'll throw it back in let's say
the 2080 is a 100 fps baseline and what they showed was the 3080
was performing 80 faster so we can convert those numbers
now into fps so we've got 180 fps versus 100 fps
on the 2080 and so from here what we can do is actually
then grab those cuda cores on the same generation and start to derive some
numbers this is a fair practice for guesstimating numbers you just can't
compare them from different generations because
there's changes in the architecture so what we're going to see here i
feel is that a 2080 ti is roughly 25 percent faster than the 2080
and so we put that in 125 fps and then we see that the rtx 3090
is going to be about 20 percent faster than the
3080 so we put that in around 216 fps now the 3070 actually has a lot lower
cuda core count than the 3080 as well as the 3090 those
being 8704 and 10 496 cuda cores respectively
there's also 28 billion transistors on both the higher core count gpus
versus the 17 billion on the 30 70 and the 18.6 billion
on the 2080 ti and so what this means is the rtx 3080 is actually going to be a
cut down version of the rtx 3090 rather than the 3070 being cut down
version of the 3080 that's actually going to be a different die
and size altogether and then basically taking the rtx 3070 cuda core count
comparing it to the 3080 we're going to have around 68 of that
shading performance available on the 3070. however one big difference
here is that they're using gddr6 memory on both the 38 and 3090 so that's
going to have more throughput as well as a bigger memory bus compared
to the 37 whereas the rtx 37 is gonna have gdr6 memory
the same as the 2080 ti albeit it is going to be clocked
at 16 gigabits per second versus 14 gigabits per second
on that 2080 ti so significantly higher memory speeds and drastically higher
cuda core counts is going to make the 30 80 and also the
30 90 in a different league compared to that of the 30 70 and
subsequently the 2080 ti which if i had to guesstimate on the 30 70 now
you can maybe expect around 120 fps versus 125 on the 2080 ti so
although nvidia is saying that you're going to get pretty much the same
performance as the 2080 ti i believe it'll be a
little bit lower on release and then of course with driver
optimizations over time you will see the 3070 beat out the 2080 ti
and so with those guesstimated numbers out there we can look at the value
proposition of the cars themselves where the rtx
3070 is going to come in with a 500 price point
releasing in october and i'm going to guess that that is early october
because they're going to want to get these cards out to market as soon as
possible whereas opposed to the 3080 that's
coming out on september 17th and then the rtx 3090 is about a week
later so the 38 is actually going to hit the market first and i believe it's
going to be one of the best value cards in this lineup coming in with
performance of a value proposition at least versus the 2080 ti
of what my numbers would guess here is 186 percent
roughly 44 more fps and roughly 42 percent better valuable
costing 70 of the original thousand dollar 2080 ti
it's going to deliver much better fps it's also going to be much more power
efficient and also deliver a better price point
then look at the rtx 3070 that will be roughly just under 200 of
the value of an rtx 2080 ti so that will edge out
the 3080 but in the realm of getting the max fps
possible that's why i'm leaning towards the rtx
3080 actually being one of the best buyers for enthusiast tech heads out
there with this current lineup though lastly the big fish in the room the rtx
3090 coming in with roughly 20 more
performance than the rtx 3080 they're costing over double the price is
not going to be a value proposition it's also going to be designed for
someone who wants to do say more 8k gaming with the 24 gigabyte vram buffer
so it's going to have significantly more vram than the 3080 coming in with 10
gigabytes of that stuff versus the 24 gigabytes and another
thing about the 3092 is it's got the ability at least from nvidia's website
to be able to be put into nvlink so if you want to do some serious 8k
gaming with max ultra details and of course you've got an endless supply of
money within that wallet of yours then nvidia
is certainly going to be giving you that option so when we put it into a
nutshell rtx 3090 is not really going to be a value play
but it's going to be for someone who wants the best experience possible on pc
and of course they have a lot of money then we've got the value
plays they're going to be the rtx 3080 and 3070 and also the upcoming 3060 i'm
guessing is going to be bringing really good
value to the table too so those numbers aside that's only half
this video where we're looking at the raw price performance figures and i'm
just having a bit of fun guesstimating the value and the numbers
that are going to come out of these cards
what nvidia showed in their presentation was a lot of
different things in terms of not just they're moving to eight nanometers so
you're going to get better performance per watt or better
efficiency out of these cards but they're also showing things like
improved ray tracing performance more tensor cores
and also the shaders which they're saying are going to be more efficient
too but on top of that they were working on
dlss 2.0 which is essentially their super
sampling tech which is going to be giving
a better image but also giving more fps because it's doing it while super
sampling up from an inferior image previously
to fill in and basically let the gpu do the prediction
on the image quality so at least that's my interpretation of it the next thing
they announced on top of the gpu launch was
one that was really cool for me personally and this was the reflex
technology and that is that they hope to reduce the
input lag by essentially working with the game developers to offer a new mode
that's going to offer overall better input latency so what we can see with
this graph that they showed here was that they had the average system
input latency and at the end of the graph we could see that that line had
moved drastically to the left but at the start
of the graph the line had only moved a little bit to the right so
basically what they're saying is they're going to be looking uh
working with the game developers is my guess again
in that they're going to be making sure that the slowest frames
or the stuttering or micro stuttering is eliminated from the game
by drawing the gpu frames as fast as possible another good thing is you don't
have to own an rtx 3000 card to get this technology they're going to
be introducing it released from the graphs
with gpus like the gtx 10 series and rtx 2000 series as well
though another thing they did announce was with a new series of monitors
they've got these 360 hertz monitors coming out but they're going to be
adding an input latency or system latency
module into the monitors themselves so you monitor things like your pc latency
your mouse latency or your total system input latency
including the monitors by using this module so
that's going to bring for some really cool comparisons
where i've been doing these in the past with 1000 fps camera
i'm going to be definitely testing that against the 1000 fps camera
and just seeing how cool this module really is where a lot of mouse reviewers
out there especially my friend rocket jump ninja
could really use a technology like this when they're
doing their mice reviews just to get you guys
exact mouse input latency figures but speaking of reducing
input output they did talk about rtx io which essentially looks to get really
fast gen 4 ssds and load up things like textures
and map pop-ins just directly from the ssd
to the gpu where as opposed to beforehand it would
have to go all the way through the cpu pipeline
and then out to the gpu so nvidia claims this will bring more fps
as well as reduced input latency on top of
reducing input latencies by working with the game developers
and their apis so performance figures latency figures we're done talking about
that but they also announced rtx broadcast
in their software suite which is essentially going to help streamers
without green screens so even like i'm using this backdrop here i
won't need a green screen and i could put myself in the middle of new york
bringing a live stream minus the ambient noise well actually even if you had the
ambient noise i think they got the rtx voice thing
that could cancel out the ambient noise so you could just say hey i'm actually
in new york and maybe people would believe you or
they wouldn't believe you but this is essentially using your gpu
just like rtx voice did to process the background and eliminate
it and just keep the subject in focus how well that's actually going to work
just in say a setup like mine i will test for you guys when we get the
gpus as well as testing everything like this input latency
numbers the performance when i get these cards in and i start
testing them when the review embargoes drop
i'll just give you guys the numbers straight and of course if you've got
special requests on the testing that you want to see then do drop a
comment in the comment section below and also let us know in the comment section
below is this the gpu launch you've been
waiting for which are the cards are you looking at getting or are you going to
wait for say the rtx 3060 and possibly an rtx
3050 to come out before you get your next
lineup of gpu in that rig of yours though before we
get on out here there's one more thing to talk about and that is the coolers
and the power connectors that they've announced now they've listed on their
website the 3090 is going to have 350 watt power requirement and with that
power supply recommendations of 750 watts just to be on the safe side
and that continues for the 3080 with its power requirement of 320 watts
then down to the 3070 which is 220 watts and
recommended power supply is 650 watt though the 12 pin power connector this
was seen in the video footage so that will be a thing though i'm
guessing nvidia is just going to throw in an adapter
so if you've got a currently good high powered power supply you're going to
have to worry about this and i believe this is going to be the way
for quite some time to come though we are seeing custom aib models being
shown out there in the wild and a lot of them are just still going with the eight
pin connectors and in the case of a zeus i can see a
three eight pin requirement there so the 3090 is going to need a bit of power
but at the same time it's going to be a very powerful gpu
so naturally with that extra power consumption you're going to have to need
four extra power connectors or in the case of nvidia
introducing a new 12 pin power connector though the cooling design itself on the
reference model is something to i guess look at and wait and see and see how it
performs because the science and at least from what they
show with the illustrations does make a lot of sense where
you're going to have one part of the gpu venting out like a traditional reference
card but then you're going to have the fresh
air in a good airflow case by the way and i'm guessing in video saying well
since you're buying these higher end cards you're most likely going to have a
higher end case with good airflow so this is designed for a higher airflow
case scenario where the back of the gpu is then going
to flow air out over the cpu so would this make
hotter cpu temps or is this designed with aio
water coolers in mind i'll give you guys the numbers when that drops here at the
channel in the meantime a lot of the aib
partners are just going with the traditional
just fans blowing air onto the gpu seems to work and it has worked for quite some
time it's still going to work absolutely fine
and of course back to that age-old saying if it ain't broke
don't fix it so speaking of not fixing things this question of the day we don't
really need to fix it it's from angelo king
and they asked do you know the name of your wallpaper it looks nice in the
background and the wallpaper that i'm currently
rocking right now is a photo that we took
locally here actually rocket jump ninja's eye he took that photo
and it's just of the beautiful ray trace sunset on the gold coast here so
if you guys want uh this photo i can just maybe google drive it for you
and you can rock it as your background if you wish to as well and with that
aside if you guys enjoyed today's video then you know what to do hit that like
button for us and if you stayed this far and you want to see the content as soon
as it drops here at tech yeah city then be sure to hit that sub button ring
that bell and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon
