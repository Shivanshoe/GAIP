oh what is tech yes citizens today we are going 
to go through the tacky studio in 2021 and have   a look at what's changed since the last time i 
did a studio tour now the biggest thing is i'm   still at the same location but i've added a lot of 
rgb into the mix now there's a big question that   i've been getting asked about oleds and it's like 
well brian after using oleds as your main drivers   do you have problems is the burn in an issue so 
we'll get straight on into that because this is   the biggest change in my entire studio is that 
i went from this main setup here and this is now   still like a main setup we'll talk about that a 
little bit later for this here being my main setup   where i'm using two 55-inch oleds and they're 
both 4k one being the b7 which is from 2017   and this one here being the cx now i'm going to 
say in terms of oleds they are absolutely amazing   in terms of viewing angles colors and especially 
this one here 4k 120 hertz but there is one big   problem that i'm having with the oleds and that 
is that they're too addictive and this is like   i'm you might be sitting there laughing and but 
this is serious like i i sit on these things and   i just get lost in playing games like starcraft 2 
which is from like 2009 i just enjoy playing games   on the oleds too much to the point where i 
was thinking i'm just going back to like 4k   60 hertz monitors with matte coatings on them 
and 32 inch because i think they would be better   for me in terms of just not getting distracted 
so much because if you guys didn't know one   of my problems is that i can get addicted to pc 
gaming and it's one of those things where it's not   healthy like i don't think it's a healthy thing 
but anyway let's continue on with the studio tour   and i will say today's video is sponsored by busy 
future where they did send out some really cool   things and i thought like some of the things 
i don't like and we'll be talking about some   of the things which i think are not for me but 
but some of the things like this here this mouse   bungie from moto speed is absolutely amazing it's 
a little mouse bungee but also has a four port usb   hub and a bit of rgb bling i think this thing 
right here you guys will love a gadget like this   if you want to get a cool mouse bungee but let's 
go through the rest of the setup here ultra light   2 for my main editing setup and then we've 
got here a deteriorated heavily deteriorated   microsoft ergonomic keyboard that i absolutely 
love because of the shape and people will say   brian why don't you get and use the mechanical 
keyboards they're so much better and i'm gonna   my argument against that will be we all use the 
mice for the shape and shape is a huge thing   with gaming mice then the same could be said for 
keyboards for me the shape of the ergonomics is   absolutely phenomenal and i want to see what 
companies could do i think because the patent   has run out for the ergonomic i think a lot of 
companies could make some really cool designs   just like this one here but with mechanical key 
switches i'd be looking forward to that because   i absolutely love the shape of the microsoft 
ergos the og ones back in the day this one has   been running i think for nearly 20 years now in 
terms of production and i've also got another one   that i picked up on a deal and i got this for ten 
dollars by the way and i got another one for 20   and they go very cheap on the market then we've 
got a stream deck i use that for switching scenes   when i'm live streaming and then we've got the 
elgato wave 3 which i absolutely love absolutely   phenomenal microphone in terms of ease of use but 
also the quality of the voice work that i do for   you guys you guys always say you love seeing this 
thing on live streams and we got the virtual oso i   use this for around the studio with the wireless 
adapter for talking and working at the same time   very handy then we got back there that's an 
upcoming video with we've got some laptop cpus   that we're going to be using with z3 70 and then 
we've got here the main setup this is the main   rig that i'm using at the moment and you may be 
wondering like what's going on here you've got   the uh this is what used to be darth jar jar i 
made it work in terms of functionality so it is   a bit of a messy rig it's definitely not anywhere 
near as good looking as the synthetic sewer build   that we put together but you maybe notice that 
i'm using a 6800 xt and this is one big thing   for me because i wanted to try amd for years i 
haven't i've been using nvidia cards on my main   workstations and i'm going to point out i'm not 
going to sugarcoat anything i'm going to point out   the big differences at this point in time for me 
personally and that is that the nvidia cards with   rtx studio they do work better in adobe premiere 
pro which is the main video editing software i   used videos for you guys but the 6800xt also has 
at least with the oleds here i've been seeing   some driver issues the most annoying one is when i 
leave my computer i either idling i'll be watching   some youtube videos while i'm working and the 
screens will automatically turn off or i'll just   turn them off manually what happens is it just 
won't wake up and i have to like hard reset my pc   in order to get the signal out again so that's 
the uh that's a driver issue i'm having with   the 6800 xt at this point in time it is a little 
bit annoying but other than that has been solid   we've also got 64 gigabytes of ram and the 18 core 
7980xe in this big base right here which does a   great job for 4k video editing and we've got more 
rgb here we've got some grog and then we've also   got the colo lights these things are really cool 
and that you can control them by your smartphone   if you want to you can also manually control them 
from the back of the card and they make a really   good backdrop especially when i'm live streaming 
or doing talking head videos from this setup   these things really make that backdrop come to 
life then we've also got a yongnuo yn300 air 2.   we'll talk about that a little bit later when we 
go through the camera gear and lighting and then   we've also got some more subtle rgb and a ring 
light well this got the panasonic g7 this is a   japanese edition which you can't change over into 
english i'll show you guys what i'm talking about   right here if we turn it on you can see there you 
just got japanese in the system but i get around   that because i can read a little bit of japanese 
and it's easy to navigate for me and then we've   got the key light and that provides the lighting 
from when i'm live streaming and then we've got   two more uh key lights up there as well this one 
being the air so it's a smaller more efficient   version then we've got over here one more key 
light air to provide lighting if i'm using the   pc from this way or if i need a hair light for the 
camera work now behind that is some rgb this is a   new addition to the tech studio which you guys 
say is a really poppin in the background so for   this i used uh kolo lite rgb strips these are the 
five meter versions they've also got a two meter   version and all up this will cost you if you want 
to get a big backdrop like this with ambient rgb   lights i'm using in total 20 meters of rgb and you 
can control that from your smartphone if you want   to i've also got a remote for it but basically 
this has a big piece of acrylic and it's diffused   and that essentially allows the rgb light 
to show up in the background like it does   and i really like this for when the it's dark 
at night too and you need that ambient lighting   behind your monitor if you're using the setup 
so that was a really cool addition that we did   in terms of also covering up holes from what 
i was changing i used to have two monitors in   the backdrop here and i've changed that 
over just now to a single ultra wide   which uh the monitor has automatically turned 
itself off but here we've got the main synthetic   sewer now in terms of building something like 
this right now especially with the rtx 3080s   they are ridiculously pricey and who knows when 
these prices of these graphics cards will come   back to normal because at the moment it's looking 
like we're either suffering two scenarios and   that is either inflation nation where the prices 
will just grow into that new norm or we will see   a crash but either way something has to give 
it's not going to be a smooth sailing line   like i've been saying here on the channel but in 
the in the meantime i just at this point in time   i wouldn't recommend going out and building 
an rtx 3080 system unless of course you've got   a huge amount of cash flow and you can afford that 
but i mean this build right here i've been i was   saving up for a long time to build this thing and 
i hooked up with designs by ifr corey and we built   this custom pc and it was absolutely amazing the 
whole process and i think the finished look just   shows that corey's work is on another level where 
we called it synthetic sewer but this is hooked up   now to the corsair k100 this keyboard is insane in 
that the speed at which the keys actuate is pretty   much the best i did a review on this thing and it 
was insane if you're gaming and you want a really   fast keyboard for that and then we've got here the 
mz1 zeiss rail so one of my really good friends   one of my best friends on the gold coast here 
zai i've known him for a while we met years ago   when we were both doing a collaboration together 
on youtube and we just hit it off and we're really   good friends and since then he's been working with 
extrafy to design his own mouse and this is what   the product is this is actually an engineering 
sample he gifted to me and i was very grateful   i'm using this on the ultra wide gaming setup and 
i absolutely love this mouse for fps so if you   want something to aim within your fingertip 
gripper especially or you're a claw gripper or   you just have really small hands in your palm grip 
then this mouse is going to be an absolute winner   i really love what he's done with this thing i 
think it's awesome that a youtuber is designing a   mouse and you can get one of these if you want to 
support zai i'll put the link in the description   below then we've got right here an rgb headset 
which i gotta say these are extremely comfortable   one of the most comfortable pair of headsets i 
have ever tried on the rgb on the sides i don't   know if that's going to be for you or not if you 
love rgb then you're definitely going to love this   headset right here but surprisingly the sound 
imaging on these was extremely good for a closed   back headphone and also the mic wasn't half bad 
one thing i will say though is that they are a   little bit tinny on the tinny side but they've 
also got heavy bass so if you like that v-shaped   eq profile then you'll definitely love these 
but if you like me and you prefer more warmer   headphone then you might want to try something 
like the l ones that's my personal favorites   then moving over here we've got the test bed setup 
this is the intel side of things and then we've   got the amd side of things so for the intel side 
we have the 11900k currently and this is hooked up   i'm testing out a z590 azus rog motherboard here 
but the problem is right now i've been very slow   to do the z590 coverage even like having this 
stuff for a few weeks here i i'm gonna be honest   with you guys i've been really jaded when it 
comes to doing a lot of uh this newer stuff   and that of course has to relate to the graphics 
cards where you can't really build a new pc right   now because you can't really get your hands on a 
graphics card at a decent price so a lot of this   new stuff the reason to get it isn't really there 
and so i've just been having a really tough time   personally seeing the point of reviewing a lot of 
this newer stuff where i think the used stuff is   a lot more exciting in terms of some of the other 
gadgets right here i just quickly whacked in some   xpg ram that i got off a deal just to test that 
it was working and you can see here it does work   absolutely fine though i will say out of this 
whole test setup right here one of my favorite   products to date and the easily the best cpu 
cooler is the h115i rgb platinum this thing just   does an absolutely amazing job the 280 mil rad 
the two 140mm fans so quiet and it remains so cool   this thing hasn't missed the beat then we've got 
two random sticks of memory that i was testing out   to make sure they work and they do work absolutely 
fine now we've got the k70 rgb special edition   keyboard with a custom wrist rest there i always 
recommend people get a custom latex wrist rest   if they're serious about spending long time and 
long hours on a keyboard then we've got the g102   just to match up that white aesthetic on this test 
setup right here then we've got a 4k monitor using   for uh testing out both the intel and the amd test 
system here which is x570 phantom gaming x at the   moment we've got the 5950x in this thing so when i 
need to test out a gravis card from nvidia or amd   i can test it on both intel and amd and get you 
guys reliable results we'll see if there's any   discrepancies between the two platforms then 
we've got another corsair cooler right here   this is the capelex version but i will say that i 
personally prefer the h115i rgb platinum i think   out of the box this thing is just the go-to for 
epic cpu cooling then over here we've got the   dare you 10 keyless keyboard that busy future 
sent over now this keyboard is honestly extremely   good so we're going to talk about the mouse pad 
soon which i actually don't really like but this   keyboard right here is absolutely phenomenal the 
build quality the color scheme they've also got   different color schemes with it and you've got 
a magnetic cover which if you're using this for   traveling is going to save you a lot of hassle 
if you want to clean the keyboard you just take   that off get rid of the dirt and then put it 
back on and it's going to be very functional as   well in terms of its size and weight and you've 
also got the option there to take out the usb   type c connector to carry this with ease and the 
best thing is you've also got optional rgb which   you can then control from the keyboard itself 
so very sturdy keyboard you've got the choice of   cherry mx blues browns and reds and i absolutely 
love what this keyboard's bringing then we've got   this mouse pad here from moto speed hard surface 
i'm not a big fan of hard surface mouse pads i do   prefer as you can see here around my studio i've 
got the cloth cloth and then also cloth soft style   mouse pads but if you like a hard style mouse 
pad and you like rgb on a mouse pad then this   is certainly going to be for you me personally 
i think the rgb on a mouse pad is a little bit   annoying because you've got this extra cable 
now to contend with and then over here we've got   another product from dare you this is a i don't 
know what to say with this one it feels like a   zowie fk2 i believe so if you're into a hybrid uh 
fingertip sort of palm grip uh sort of grip there   and you like low button height then this 
mouse is definitely going to be great for fps   very good mouse very good shape and the build 
quality on this thing is extremely good so if   you're looking for an alternative to an fk2 then 
this mouse is definitely going to deliver and   then next up here we've got a 100 tripod this one 
said it was heavy duty because the last one broke   hopefully this one does stand the test of time 
but it's funny because i've still got this tripod   right here this was one that i bought from a junk 
store in japan for 50 bucks and now apparently   some of my friends are telling me like brian 
how did you snap this thing up apparently these   things are going for like in excess of 200 but i'm 
starting to see why because they were just so well   built back in the day this thing has stood the 
test of time i've had it around the studio since i   did that parts hunt back in japan a long time 
ago but speaking of camera gear and production   stuff i've got two of these in recently they are 
the godox sl60 watts and these things are just   like they're bright they're really bright 
you've got all the way from 10 to 100 percent   and they're soft boxes even though i've got 
one of them that's not on softbox at the moment   that's just providing like a pin light and these 
things like for what they are they're really good   value they're not too loud they've got a little 
fan in them because they're a 60 watt led but   they provide so much lighting if you're in a home 
studio i think some people are saying like you   should get the 150 watt i mean if you're filming 
outdoors definitely the 150 li what is going to be   beneficial fighting against sunlight but in terms 
of inside a studio the 60 watts are absolutely   perfect you don't need to get anything more you 
can save yourself a lot of money by just going   with the 60 watts and they're going to be a little 
bit lighter so you won't have to buy as expensive   as a beam there to support it anyhow we got the 
desk here i added in rgb lighting to this desk   and that's been really good actually because it's 
got a little lip here that comes out of the desk   so whenever i'm building pcs and we've got two 
builds in progress at the moment uh whenever   i'm building pcs and screws get to the edge they 
don't fall off the table so that's one really good   benefit of this rgb lighting plus it provides a 
good sort of extra element for when i'm shooting   photos of the builds before i flip them and so 
that's a new addition we've also got this 360   hertz monitor here which azus sent in and i use 
it all the time for testing it's really good for   testing our system input latency and doing other 
tests because it has an inbuilt latency module   inside but this monitor right here being 360hz 
it isn't cheap by any means though speaking of   cheap this led lighting here it was pretty cheap 
to add in i think i spent 80 dollars in total   getting this done with a five meter strip and 
then my friend came around with his tools and we   got the desk here because i was lucky because this 
desk was really thick were able to dig into it and   then that was able to put the led lights in and 
it worked out perfectly though other tools new to   the tech air studio if you're into fitness one of 
these things here i got this for 30 aussie dollars   i absolutely love this thing it's like one of 
those sit up support things and when i first saw   this thing i thought it was a gimmick but then i 
tried and i was like damn that really really gets   the abs working so can really recommend one of 
these as opposed to a lot of that other stuff you   see on fitness channels and stuff it's a lot of 
it's gimmicky but then we've got the weights there   for just sometimes i do a bit of it i haven't 
been doing weight training as much as i'd like to   i will get back into that soon then we've got 
the new setups here where i got this desk on   sale on the used market for 30 dollars and it's a 
clear sort of glossy desk it was pretty much like   brand new and i've been using this set here 
for b-roll where i got these from the local   hardware store they were just some floor tiles 
and i was like well they're gonna look pretty   cool as a backdrop so decided to make this a new 
little set for filming uh smaller products not   so much builds but individual products like you 
see here and all up this costs like i think 50 60   so for the backdrop and for the little table 
but i also decided to add in a little light   here which i got for 10 bucks from ikea and that 
sort of just adds a little bit of spice to this   whole set right here then we've got another 
set which i put together but i found myself   using this one more for selling pcs where we 
got these 3d tiles in the backdrop and then   you'll notice i've got some rgb bling right here 
these are the yong nuos and they're a little bit   expensive and you do have to get your own 
adapters for them and so i've i had to go   buy the adapter separately and then the light but 
they do provide so much lighting in terms of rgb   and you can use them as normal lights too i think 
if you're starting out in the world of film these   yn300 airs are definitely going to be a really 
good investment i've actually got two of them   right now which gives you a nice look if you're 
getting the set all set up for whatever you're   filming in this case it's a used banger that 
we're gonna be putting up on good old gametree   anyway sitting down now summing up the studio tour 
i've also got some cool little tips and that is if   you want some cool coasters you for your drinks 
then you can pull them out of broken hard drives   this right here is a one terabyte platter and 
i also managed to pull out some really strong   magnets out of those hard drives as well anyhow 
guys with the studio right now i'm sort of at that   point where i don't know if i should change back 
to 4k 60 hertz monitors or keep going on the oled   because i do want to get more productive and stop 
being sidetracked for gaming i think that's the   main conflict i've been having with myself lately 
and i've been learning to get over that because   in december halfway through december cyberpunk 
came through and i binged through that then i   started playing starcraft 2 and dota 2. and that 
was just it's i still play some starcraft 2 and   it's so enjoyable on the oleds to the point where 
i've got to cap my addiction and sort of like the   oled feeds that so i don't know if you guys had 
have had similar problems where you get addicted   to video games but it's one sort of achilles 
heel that i know is up with myself and i don't   mind talking about it publicly and i just want to 
get back onto being you guys want me to get back   to being as well going hitting up the gym more and 
being buffier city and going out and getting more   deals that's the verdict that a lot of people are 
telling me so i'll get back to that in the next   couple of months and in the meantime i may 
change out those oleds for as i said for the   more boring monitors i think that's a big sort of 
personal goal of mine but i mean that in ways is   a testament to how good the oleds are it's just 
an unexpected thing that's come out of it in the   last few months for me personally but speaking 
of everything else around the studio here it's   mainly like lighting rgb and cool little gadgets 
that i've added into the studio since the last   time and with that aside if you guys want to know 
anything more about the tech yes studio and stuff   that we use here behind the scenes but be sure 
to drop a comment in the comment section below   i'll put all the stuff and prices that i can find 
for all this stuff in the description below as   well so if you want to check out some of the cool 
things that we featured here today and if it's   a decent price then i'll drop it below if it's a 
rip-off i'll just leave it out of the description   but other than that uh we got the question of the 
day here which comes from it's actually a really   good one it comes from joe mars and they said 
how is jensen still not fired and they're talking   about the video we recently did with the uh 360 
ti's being sold for ridiculous amounts of money   the fact that individuals were able to get so many 
of these cards and in terms of jensen being fired   he's not going to be fired anytime soon i mean he 
would have to resign himself if he was to leave   nvidia because over the track record of nvidia he 
has grown the sales he's grown the company which   is what mainly what shareholders care about they 
care about if they're getting a return on their   investment from nvidia they don't really care 
about the gamer well especially they don't care   about the gamer and whether they're getting 
a graphics card or not but in the long term   they actually should care about gamers because 
that is their long-term loyal customer base   and so i think jensen could take a look around 
and implement those mining limiters sooner if   he wants to take care of that loyal base even 
though he's not going to get as good of a profit   as he would in the short term i think in the long 
term it would do better for him to consider that   especially if say for instance intel comes along 
and they start making gaming gravis cards and   they put in just anti-mining algorithms that lock 
miners out then they could build loyalty towards   their brand and take it away from nvidia same 
with amd so i guess that's one thing to consider   for uh jensen and nvidia is that they do want to 
definitely take care of those gamers in the long   term but in terms of the short term yes the gaming 
graphics cards have been going to a lot of miners   and that's been causing a lot of disruption in 
the industry but in terms of gen site i don't   think he's going to get fired anytime soon he was 
i think like last year rated the number one ceo of   the world anyhow hope that answers that question 
and if you guys have stayed this far and you're   enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit 
that like button for us and also smash that sub   ring that bell and i'll catch you in another 
tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
