wow this is the most expensive pc i have ever seen yeah do you know how much i paid for it oh at least three thousand nah man i paid a little over a thousand bucks for it oh that's as cheap as fried rice [Music] over the last few years on youtube i've seen a lot of pcs that involve the title sleeper in that there are really ugly looking build and they've got some really good components inside though i've never built one personally because it just doesn't compare to the same feeling that you get when you drag race in a sleeper and you see that person in a ridiculously expensive car and the reaction on their face i don't think you can get that with a sleeper pc though back in the day there was also another element called the opposite of the sleeper and that was the though the funny thing about the ricer car was even though at the lights you would be uh drag racing them and then taking off and you'd be five car lengths ahead in a matter of seconds and you'd be looking back and laughing and you think yourself wow this car's got it all it's got the looks it's got the sound it's even got neon strips underneath it's as if someone pulled this car out of fast and furious but the problem was it just didn't have the goods under the hood to perform like it looked there was always two respects that i gave to rice's back in the day that was the first thing they would always pick up and they'd pick up pretty well the second thing was that they had good resale on their cars that was undeniable and sometimes they would even make a profit though let's go through all the components here to see how you can get a pc that looks like it's worth a few thousand bucks it's got that i9 title it's got that flagship amd graphics card title on it but it ends up coming in under 1 000. [Music] welcome back to tech yes city and this pc involves a few core components that are very important to make it this ricer build and the first thing is the i9900t engineering sample we can currently get these from aliexpress for 215 dollars shipped that's right we've got an i9 9900 it's got the same amount of cash on board it's also got eight core 16 threads and it's also coming in at under half the cost of a 9900 k now the caviar here is is that simply it doesn't clock as high in fact what i'm reading from reports here is that it's only going up to 3.2 or 3.3 gigahertz all cores however there are some really big augmented benefits besides the cost savings versus the 9900k and the first thing is we can use an h310 motherboard these can be had for as little as 60 dollars in australia i picked this one up this is the h310 vdh pro plus from msi we got this for 89 aussie dollars now out of the box this worked absolutely fine with this cpu i didn't even have to update the bios but of course if you do get an h310 motherboard you may have to update the bias and i don't know how many motherboards this cpu will work with i just got lucky in this combination in that it worked flawlessly as soon as i turned it on the next component is we can now save on the power supply since our cpu i think will juice a lot less power we can now get away with a more budget orientated power supply i managed to pick up a high tech 750 watt which i've used in the past and they're pretty decent i got this for 20 aussie dollars off the used market the next component is the cooler since we're going to be putting out a lot less heat we're now getting away with a 25 aussie dollar cooler or 17 usd for those folks in the usa this makes our motherboard power supply and cooler combo literally come in under that of what you would get with a single cooler on your 9900k so we're absolutely winning already now for the graphics card in this build we're using the msi gaming x 5700 however in a previous video and i'll put the link up here i flashed this to a 5700 xt and got more performance out of it so now we've got a flagship msi amd graphics card that not only looks the part but also really quietens down on noise and just has an amazing aesthetic that it's going to bring to this build this ended up costing me 543 aussie dollars shipped and i got it on an ebay sale to be about 367 usd but for storage here we're going with a 256 gigabyte ssd for our main boot drive and then a one terabyte for our game storage and then the last component in this build which is going to make it riced out of control this is the bitfenix tg dawn this case has it all it's got timber glass on the side the front and the back and you've got diamond effects on the front and back with rgb glowing through that which you can control the lighting effects from the front panel itself with the click of a button so all these components in today's build tally up to 922 us dollars or if you're in australia 1362 aud now i will be adding two rgb strips which should work off the included controller on the tg dawn so we won't have to buy any extra controllers and it'll all work off that single button these will cost around an extra 15 or in australia 20 aud so with that total cost out of the way will this build end up being a complete blunder in that the temperatures don't work the parts just don't work together or will the tech yes intuition here birth an entirely new meta let's build this thing and then find out [Music] so [Music] so [Music] and now we've finished this build here the ultimate ricer and it is spiced up it's got rgb all over the place we've got a vertically mounted gpu even got a core 2 duo supporting that graphics card so that's right core 2 duos can still support something in 2020 but right now what we've got to do is tune this thing up because the 9900 t i've never used this before i don't know what it's capable of i've got to check it out try and tune the memory as best as i can and also try and overclock the gpu as far as that can go because i really want to get the most out of this whole build and besides that i want to test the airflow on this case because so far it does look really good especially once we've added in some glow at the front here so we actually ended up putting a longer strip in here to light up the whole front of the build so we could actually see the gravis car because that's got only a little rgb light on top there but on the front here it's got this whole unique pattern that shines through the glass and i gotta say i thought it may have been tacky at first but after looking at it it's really well built uh like bit phoenix have made sure that they've got this little glow going around the whole edge of the timber glass kind of like a semi-modular power supply but in this case it's like a semi-tron rgb lighting and you've got the button up there with ease to change the color scheme and even turn it off if you don't like rgb so i'm really liking this pc and what it's about so far but anyway let's see what we can come up with temperatures and tuning and all that stuff and then we'll get on to the fps and the [Music] gaming [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so we just finished the tuning and all the testing and there's nothing but good news and the first thing we're going to start with the h310 motherboard these are designed for i believe 65 watt tdp max in mind and here's where the really good news comes out and that is that this 9900t only juices around 50 watts on max load and that's going 3.2 gigahertz on all cores now i can't clock this any higher manually there's actually no b clock overclock on this motherboard too so that's the maximum speeds that we're left with though the single core speeds did go up to around 3.6 3.7 gigahertz the cinebench scores showed that we got all calls in r20 of 3347 points and then the single score was over 360 points so what we had here was a really good synergy between budget rgb memory a budget cooler and also a budget motherboard testing out the vrm temperatures on this motherboard during a stress test in 28 degrees cm environments saw the maximum temperature of 63 degrees so the motherboard's absolutely clear for this cpu the cooler that was pretty like that wasn't even getting warm to touch really so i was doing a fine job but the cpu was running a bit hot so with the tempered glass side panel on versus off we saw 99 degrees max versus 94. though the tj junction the max temperature is 110 degrees so we still have a bit of headroom here it's just it might need a d-lid or something like that since it is an engineering sample i'm guessing that d-litting it would drop the temperatures quite a bit but then again they might be using the stim on the engineering samples but for what it's worth this is a stress test this is pretty much the worst case scenario in games it's really only going to go to around 70 degrees max i feel so we should be okay we shouldn't have to really do anything to the cpu and its temperatures though testing out the gpu now pretty much with this 5700 xt flash uh overclocking it even just by a little bit didn't really net us any gains worth mentioning in fact when i ran the eugene heaven benchmark uh both times not overclocked and overclocked we saw 3681 points versus 3653 points so we only gained like 30 points and the minimum was actually worse with the overclocks in meaning this card's pretty much pushed to the brink after this v bios update and the flash from the 57 to the 5700 xt though what about the gpu temperatures which is one of the most important tests when we're testing especially in the case of the dawn tg and with the tempered glass side panel on versus off we saw 69 degrees versus 73 and then on the memory 82 versus 86. the vrm temperature for some reason wasn't reading out that's most likely because of the flash that we did but then again we're only losing 4 degrees on the gpu and it's still in the 70s so it's absolutely fine of course ideal temperatures would be to be dropping if we put that side glass panel on but in this case we're making up a lot for those temperature drops with the bling that this case has to offer though the ideal scenario with any case tests i do around here is actually when you put the panel on you get lowered temperatures on either the cpu or the gpu the fact that the temperatures are going a little bit higher can definitely be attributed to that front glass panel which although makes up for anesthetics it does become a detriment to temperatures though the good thing is this whole build is really quiet even while we're stress testing it so i'm happy with that and i'll let you guys listen and see if you can hear much noise okay time for gaming [Music] so the first game we finished up testing on the riser pc is 4 on it and at 1080p and 1440p we got 153 average fps and 103 average fps respectively the minimum fps was showing exactly what the graph was showing the whole time and that was ridiculously smooth fps as well as that gpu utilization was practically near 100 let's move on now to the next title which is shadow of the tomb raider and completing shadow of the tomb raider has painted an interesting picture first of all the cpu utilization and the wattage it's using during these benchmarks it's only using 20 watts and it's going somewhere between 3.2 and 3.3 gigahertz all cores so it looks like in games you can extract an extra 100 megahertz out of this cpu though uh 1080p we've got 86 average fps 1440 people got 64 average fps and 40 40 people saying gpu bound 99 though it is saying gpu bound 61 at 1080p so when i do do this comparison with this cpu versus say ryzen 5 3600 and a 9900k i will be interested to see this 1080p result with this flash 5700 xt to see if we're losing much performance versus those other two gaming scenarios [Music] and now we've got f1 2019 with maximum settings taa and also heavy rain on the benchmark which does place more of a strain than a clear day what we saw here at 1080p we got 77 average fps 61 and then 0.1 low of 37 and then at 1440p we saw 66 average fps 53 uh 1 and 38.1 percent low so the fps does seem a little bit smooth on this title though i am really curious to see how this will perform against those other two cpus that i mentioned before and to finish things off with the last title here fortnite we had epic settings at 1080p and also 1440p and we saw the results were pretty similar so the cpu was being stressed at both these resolutions and when i stopped it down to low settings with epic distance we saw pretty much identical fps at both 1440p and 1080p so this graphics card is pushing this 9900 t at both resolutions so it would be a better combo suited for 1440p gaming because of that though all in all we did have a system that really balanced out everything from the noise to the temperatures and to the most important thing of all and that is the fps where the 1 0.1 percent lows were really smooth we still managed to get that ddr4 memory up to 26 66 megahertz with tighter timings because it is 3 000 megahertz x and p though the limitations of that h310 motherboard and the memory speeds the funny thing about that was the cost of this total build is coming a little over 900 usd or 1300 australian dollars which is pretty incredible considering we've got an i9 and a 5700 xt in this build though with that i9 and 5700 xt in this build boosting up the spec sheet i can't help but think the ultimate rice piece of this build was that bitfenix dawn tg case it has the tempered glass all around we added those rgb strips it has that rgb fan at the back as well as the onboard rgb controller and then we've got rgb memory coupled with an rgb fan on top of our cpu cooler now the good thing about the top down cpu cooler too was that draft of air going down on the vrm which i believe did help cool down this budget motherboard although there was a little bit of detriment to the temperatures when we kept the side panel on versus off it wasn't that bad in this particular build though i do caution if you do go with like a 2080 ti and something like a 9900k which at least from my testing here would use up roughly 120 more watts on the cpu alone than it would with the 9900 t so it's basically over three times the power consumption for only 1.8 gigahertz extra speeds so you see here that the diminishing returns on the 9900t versus the k is massive and so that heat being dumped in the case would if we had a much higher end spec build increase the differences between the side panel on and off so with the dawn tg it does look really nice but do keep in mind i wouldn't be going putting any sort of higher end parts in this thing than what we did with this build today so say for instance a mid-range cpu and a 5700 xt i think it's a good balance especially if you want to get the bling and extract the aesthetics out of this case though on top of that it does have a lot more support however for things like radiators so if you wanted to use a 240 or 280 mil rad you can put that at the top as well as support at the front for a 360 or 280 mil rad2 and then there's the ability to mount up to seven 120 mil fans as well as five one 40 mil fans at the top and the front of this case so lots of options that you can do with this thing and the build quality was surprising really straightforward instruction manual checked out as well as the top of the case had this like airflow dust filter thing that blocks everything off i never used them i kind of wish bitfenix didn't include that and dropped a little bit off the cost of this case and just kept the mesh on the top as this thing currently comes in at 129 usd so it's not too bad for the price considering the amount of bling and tempered glass it's bringing to the table as far as aussie pricing i'm not too sure but all in all we ended up totaling a build here that came in at just such a good price point but what's more important is i'm interested in hearing you guys and your feedback on the 9900t that budget engineering sample of aliexpress that when i checked from the particular seller on aliexpress they've got over 900 of these things available which is a lot so i don't see them selling out anytime soon so the stock is definitely there but when it comes as i said before with a different h310 motherboard i'm not too sure the one that i bought here from the store had that bios i think it was like the third revision automatically installed and i didn't want to risk updating the bios again because you only really update the bios if there's a problem that's the general reason for updating a bias if nothing's wrong everything's running really smooth then usually you don't need to update the bias and that's exactly what happened here because on the flip side of things if i did update the bios on this h310 motherboard i do then run the risk of maybe they're taking out the cpu microcode support for the engineering sample which i have seen in the past and that could cause our cpu not to work so the fact that it all worked out of the box smooth i was super happy with this cpu even though it says cpu000 that means it's actually an early engineering sample in the process i believe this cpu was made in 2018 though that aside i will be comparing it to the 9900k as well as the ryzen 5 3600 in an upcoming video within the next week so stay tuned for that i'll probably compare it with the 5700 xt as i think the 200 price point for a cpu is best coupled with the gpu around the 400 price range of the 5700 xt so do let us know in the comments what you think about those upcoming tests as well and with that aside we've actually got two questions of the day but they're pretty much similar questions that came in within a short time span of each other and the question basically is what music do you use at this point in time this is awesome and the other person says i really want to know what this track is and i get this a lot when i do upload my videos and i do apologize for not putting all the names of the songs in but it usually takes me a very long time so i do list the places right down the bottom where i get them from and this song was a monan horizon from royalty free planet now they upload a heap of good tracks that are mainly focused on that sort of retro modern uh vibe of synthwave if you guys know that genre of music i absolutely love it and so they've got a lot of cool tracks that i put in my videos and usually with music i just download a heap of different free to play music and then i go through and i select the best stuff and i usually don't keep track of some of the names that i use but i do keep track of the places that i get them from and you can go check them out and then see all the different cool music that they've got available but hopefully that answers that question and with that aside if you guys enjoyed this new ultimate ricer pc then be sure to hit that like button for us and do let us know what you think of this build this is sort of like a new experiment we're going into a new sort of zone here with this build but i thought it all worked out in the end and it all worked out really well and with that aside if you guys are enjoying this content you want to see it the moment it drops and you're not yet subbed then don't forget to hit that sub button on the way out ring that bell and i'll see you in the next one peace out for now [Music] bye you
