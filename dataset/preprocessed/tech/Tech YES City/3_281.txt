and hopefully we're live like youtube's got to wait for the live stream to pop up but if it does i think we are live if we are if we are i apologize yes i think are live yeah we're live by the by the looks of my sidebar on youtube it looks like we're live okay welcome back take your citizens to a live stream for the end of september i'm joined by the one the only gear seekers how you doing man yeah i'm pretty good what's cracker lacking oh he's taking the tech yes uh agreed yeah yeah i gotta do it bro things are cracking pretty well around here um well i mean there's there's a whole like the i got i'm actually streaming now on the 4k setup the 4k oled setup and it's a lot of fun so oh man like you know i well my brother had one like the c9 so he bought it yeah like last year and the c9 was apparently supported the 120 hertz so as soon as he's like dude you got to try this i was like yeah okay try this the 10 bit so we took it over we tried it the g-sync still needs a driver update yeah um there's this issue where it flickers like the screen will flicker black i get that sometimes with the benq panel as well yeah so there's that issue there and i mean they'll solve it with the driver update and that's what we're going to talk about right now today is the um the big issue of the the caps right this is a huge thing still being talked about the caps and inverted commas okay so yes i mean so you're you're on the side of the fence of so nick's on the side offensive it's just a driver update right things are going to be fixed polished up right well the reason why i say it is because when i was testing the uh 3090 the asus card it was crashing in shadow of the tomb raider at 1080p it crashed like four times in a row before i could actually get a successful run yeah and then i was like i s all these cap stuff started coming up i'm like okay like fair enough like capacitors haven't really been that bad since the 80s so i didn't really believe it so i was like hey let's try this in linux and no problems and we're hitting higher boost clocks in linux as well so i just thought it had something to do with the what is it the rip the noise suppression that was all it was like it had something to do with the very micro refinements of noise suppression so and again this is what i said in my video i was like dude i think it's just overclocks haven't been validated properly that's what i thought it was like they just haven't had time to properly validate their overclocks and instead they've rushed it out that's what i thought and instead of um just saying all right we're going to run these at stock settings here you go guys they're all going for the highest performing cards because they want them to look the best in the benchmarks and so that's like look i know that and this is the thing this hasn't been since this is a different issue because this has happened on a few launches where some of these cards there's you know they're essentially faulty because they're overclocked too high and as opposed to other models they work for a big part of the problem is everyone will jump on well let's use amd for instance right everyone's like oh amd's got the worst drivers for their gpus in the world blah blah blah god forbid nvidia having a bad driver right it's just not possible because nvidia is perfect in everyone's eyes but the reality is uh and this is from my experience with amd gpus i don't really have those problems i don't have crashes i don't get anything weird happening so maybe i'm just lucky but yeah i think yeah maybe uh like i've had issues with multi monitors on amd cards that's been my biggest issue with amd drivers and um i mean look in my main rig i've used rtx studio look i can't live without that pretty much and you like your cup of tea he likes his cup of tea my floral cup's just for you by the way oh thanks but i've got a cat i've got a cat on here so there's a cat there i love cats man i'm a big cats person i also like big dogs like the big ones that are yeah i like german shepherd but they're a lot of work i'm not a fan of little dogs they just get annoying yeah they have that small man syndrome where they're just like i'm just angry all the time yeah yeah i do i kind of agree there can't can't deny that yeah sorry if you own a small dog so all right so the the manufacturers now but we'll get into this right now because uh we just got a quick plug though from our today's video sponsor guys so uh today's live stream sponsor is scd keys you want to get yourself cop yourself a cheap windows 10 pro oem license then i will update the description with the link because we're going live so i can't really update it live but you just back in bang in the coupon tyc get 18 off 13 and a half usd let's get back to this article right here so video cards actually did a great job they summed up all the manufacturer responses in one article now this all started when uh really jay just made the video right and he just said look this is this is what's going on eagles labs posted on it and so after that evga came out and said they noticed in production that they were having the six post cap setup wasn't as good as the um putting in say five plus gaps first ten mlcc caps so the problem is they were um calling sp caps podcaps is the first problem yeah i said they're not they're not the same thing right so i'm not an electrical engineer but i know that they're just not the same thing right and these things are all kind of they've got really high tolerances and like i said before things that actually create this issue right so even if it was bad capacitors there'd have to be some kind of driver issue where it was over exerting the gpu well this is the thing i think like i got i'm getting i'm going back through some of my comments people like oh you're an nvidia shield blah blah blah i'm like guys i have not had this problem here at my studio i've got 3090 3080 and i've had a retail sample 3080 come through here none of these cards have had the problems that people are reporting the only problem i'm having is with the 4k oled g-sync on the lgt but nvidia are already aware of that they've told me look we we know this is we're working on a fix with the driver updates and we're working with lg to fix this asap yeah so they're aware of that yeah so it's yeah it's one of those things where i can't report on like for this for instance the 2080 ti with the micron memory i actually had that problem and i didn't know that them at all yeah so i could report on that i could show people hey but you know people calling me a shill for having what an experience of me having no problems with this and i think like a lot of people are getting cold shills for reviewing the cards that they've had the cards and they've had these they're not they don't have these problems so how can they how you probably had problems with your gigabyte samples and whatnot i'm like i never had any problems with the gigabyte cards the founders 3090 no problem the only card i had a problem was with the rog strix card and then the updated the drivers and it went away oh so you've updated the driver in the problem yeah yeah even so i i before the stream i've got my test bench running on the side here but linux that didn't push out a linux driver update i wonder why because it was already working there was no problem with the driver and that's what i found when i tested linux i had no problems with linux at all well so yeah well in back to this article anyway we'll go through the article look this is i'm just like guys i'm the messenger don't like people like you know in the last video i made people having to go at me like blah blah blah i'm like hey guys i'm just reporting on the story and giving my two cents where i thought it was oc validations and time will tell we'll find out yeah we'll find out it's still too early and the stuff just launched people are getting so angry getting their pitchforks out but they forget that this happened with the 2080 ti and the memory it's like it happens every generation on generation people just have really short memories but i will it's not i think this time it's worse though because there's other problems that are compounding this release right i think it's because it's the highest stock yeah like there's other problems and this is just like that added on icing on the cake to say hey here's another problem with this launch now the pitchforks are coming out in full form here's my pitchfork i've sharpened this thing up because i i had it ready to go because i didn't get a 3080 at launch anyway yeah and um yeah so that's i think it's just like for me i'm like i'm beta testing right now i've got 3090 in the system i'm actually having a lot of fun beta testing on this thing i'm not going to lie like it's a lot of fun this card like yeah i was playing flight tim on the 39e founders last night and i'm like wow this is actually like pretty good yeah like impressive and people are calling me a shield because they're like oh you know like the numbers aren't that much different between the 38 and 39 i'm like but they're for two different things i'm like yeah bro you're a chill yeah i'm a shell you know you're a big time someone's going to take that completely a fun love and chill that's what you are fun love and chill so anyway i like to spread negativity that's my thing like i just want to know a solution and i want the community to come together and find solutions to things rather than getting pitchforks out i will add to that i will add to that right so i don't one thing i do is i point out negatives on products right i point out negatives but i won't bash a company exactly i won't bash a company because you've got to put yourself in their shoes right do these companies surely these companies don't make this product with the intention of it flopping right exactly they would make this um product with the intention of it doing well but somewhere in the process they might have had a few fake yes men in the process like i'm the real yes man you know what i'm talking about i'm bearing the energy i'm bringing the yes the positivity but they've got these fake yes men that are like yes this products amazing and they don't critique it in the process design so they're releasing this product that's flawed that's what it is and then the people who get it have an open mind they're like this is not what i want so i don't think companies set out to make bad products they just along the lines of the design process they've got tunnel vision and look i understand that because i'm one of the i mean i probably like got the biggest case of tunnel vision on the gold coast where i live yeah like man i focus on one thing and that's it the world around me just blanks out that's all i got to do that's me and youtube as well like all i think about is youtube like every day like that's one track mind yeah yeah so that's i have the biggest problem with it i've i've got tunnel vision man a one-track mind exactly and that is uh like i think these companies aren't designing these products with the potential flopping but anyway we'll go through this article so evga have said look they noticed refinements they noticed it was slightly better when they put on the mlcc solutions so they're sort of adding to the uh then zeus after that said look in the production phase we noticed that the overclocking headroom was better with the mlcc caps so that's sort of adding to the like really it's it's not a big issue but it is an issue where it could affect overclock so that's when i saw that i was like okay oc validation overclocking better with the mlcc caps there's my that's my pick at it anyway msi have come out and said no um we we go there's no problems with our products so the driver update fixes the issue and uh all right i've got an msi card right here right yep and this has got a mixture of both yep and from what i can tell i well i mean from using this thing a lot because i've been gaming with this thing for about almost a month now yeah i've had not a single crash with it even and that's with the old drivers and the pressure off it's not a single crash and i've i've logged probably like 30 hours of modern warfare on this thing and okay no problem fair enough bro oh you know the best game i actually got to do a video on it soon best game that i've found recently new meta game for test and stress test is just outer worlds bro like if an overclock's unstable yeah just the menu man 4k smash ultra yeah yeah i do i did a heap of overclocking in the review right when i was doing my reviews i did a heap of every other game was passing like smooth and then i just loaded up outer worlds in the menu crashes straight away i'm like oh wow this uh so i had to that's when i had to adjust my overclocks rerun all the benchmarks again and i was like why didn't i just load up outer worlds first so outer world's menu the menu it does something magic where it stresses the gpu at max percentage but it also stresses it in a way that's like it's like you know ten thousand fists versus one thousand fists which is what the other games are thrown at them you know what i mean so like outer worlds so you got to maneuver through these fists when you're in outer worlds even though yeah i don't know anyway um outerworlds is awesome i'm playing through that even though it feels like it's a short game i don't know i'm sorry i've played a bit of it but i i don't know i just i'm funny with games man i'm like i play what i like and then if i don't feel like playing that day i just get bored yeah so basically msi but okay sorry msi's like no not a problem not an issue just get to just download the drivers yeah so zotac's done probably one of the best they're like hey guys uh everyone's fun loving um and so we'll update you shortly and that's what that that's basically them in a nutshell so we'll keep you on show we might we know the issue um we're going to submit us a proper statement later galax are like look we've tested out these and they kind of loot like they're alluding to what if it is a problem or not they're just saying look we made it with sp caps we made it with mlcc's on the ones that are out there in the wild it's a five plus ten configuration uh the one that did have six sp caps there's a few of them like engineering samples out there at the moment but there's none in production and they said that's about it they can't give you an update on that gainwood have said um so actually i didn't actually read up on gamewoods what did now that they just update the website okay gamewood's game was basically saying that they use four sp caps on their rtx 3090 and they're using a five plus ten so they got a four plus twenty and a 5 plus 10 and they got no problems if you have any problems you've got a warranty claim where you go fellas you know 3d you're like yep we've got no problems gigabyte i like yo our caps cost money bro you could buy a like look we got a mad deal we got a mad bulk buy on these sp caps and we're using these sp caps we don't care about the mlcc caps we got a mad deal on this we've got to use the ml uh the sp caps so gigabyte's like no no problems here too just update your drivers just update a lot of people talked about like the pricing of capacitors but it's it's kind of irrelevant because when you're when you're mass producing stuff it's you know like it's gonna be you get a bulk deal on some capacitors and that's your bottom line it's going to be yeah like i think some of the viewers are saying it too they're not more expensive it's just that they're harder to source i think yeah like they source a lot more sp caps so economies of scale they get better deals on sp caps i think that's the i guess not the issue but the issue is like you've got to see the same graphics card you've got to see that same pcb right if you want proof of it you're going to have that same pcb and you've got to have it with the sp caps and then without the sp caps and with all the mlcc and you'll get to the bottom of it but will those manufacturers show those results of course not that's yeah they're all ones that's what i mean the whole thing's under lockdown like there's all these contracts that are written behind the scenes we're really not going to go all it is is if you've got a pro that's that's true if you've got the card and you've got warranty that's what warranty is there for use a lot of the people i spoke to like in our discord and just around the place as well are saying like people are reporting this issue and it's and it's happening but who's actually reporting it almost no one okay what um well i've actually you know the funny thing is i got a call this morning and someone's bringing over what they think is a faulty 3080. so i'm going to check it out yeah check it out thank you let me know i'm curious to hear what what the deal is because i'm only skeptical because i've seen this similar thing happen in the past close to and just after a launch where there's instability it happens every single time and it's usually a driver and actually someone in the chat mentioned that um the bower did a video about it he changed the caps and it was the same deal oh okay so the big db has confirmed roman did a video where he swapped the caps out between uh sp and mlcc and it was man he's next level on that damn hey like dude if i try getting out of soldering on it like i barely have any luck soldering wires together dude i drink too much coffee so i'm just like shaking yeah hey guys [Laughter] oh man anyway we could get into some uh more inappropriate jokes on this live stream but we're not going to we're just going to start we're not going to go there but anyway some stories from hanging out irl though right we should because we've got some good ones some pg ones okay i mean i probably do i got plastered so i pro i forget half of them like um there is really good stories like the aussie scene for tech at events is amazing that's probably the biggest thing like covert has done that right it's taken away like the events i i love going to taiwanese too like marco's like dude when are you coming over to taiwan he's like hanging out with me all week and he was like he was telling me that he misses us and everything so marco if you're out there we do miss you bro we miss you man yeah yeah yeah marco is a legend hey so when he's waiting for us to come back to taiwan and do a parts hunt and then i actually really want to go to japan and do bart's hunt and see my boy and all and all that good stuff so i love japan let's go yeah yeah that's what i mean so they're well apparently they're talking about bringing um opening up the borders soon in october like that's crazy like i've read on that's pretty that's pretty soon man and a straight wall australia is opening up from december so yeah 2020 has just been an absolute mess and you know what's even more funny like i've got literally a raging fire about two kilometers i'll post it up on twitter after the live stream there is a raging fire outside my house like two kilometers away it's actually whoa it's actually extremely bad right now it's really really good it's like yeah if the livestream cuts off you know what happened there's just this fire like just engulfed my house anyway um here's the funny thing right i just updated the drivers just before and i ran a quick test before i started this live stream so um horizon zero dawn has gone from 73 average fps to 72 and that's a pretty precise benchmark i've ran that so many times on the founders card on the azus oc model that got sent in it's now running at 72 so i've lost one fps very slight drop but i think that's where that's negligible though one frame per second is negligible i know is it like with with horizon are you measuring the frames like point frame so at decimal placing or is it just like straight up here's a solid number yes yes it could literally be the variance of like yeah 0.1 yeah technically you're right yeah that is but i mean it's still a difference you know yeah anyway that's benchmarking for you but look you're right there but it's just funny like if i feel like that it could have been the cards were just too aggressive out of the box a little bit and they've just tuned it down just that little bit because i knew i also noticed one thing though you can't tell it's mim in my head was when i was running horizon zero dawn i have the power consumption up there went from about 340 watts down to 320 watts yeah so that's um yeah that's interesting that's interesting yeah so the newest drive is sort of like just put in a little bit of a like a teeny weeny nerf it's like a minor starcraft balance change you know like turrets don't cost 75 minerals they cost 70 minerals now you're like okay it's not really going to change the whole game a lot but it is going to um it is it is a difference regardless yeah so next up here though that's the issue if you guys um also after the stream's finished we'll hang out with chat and you guys ask questions we'll chat uh but we've got the next issue well not issues sorry this one's actually better news so that one's one's talking about problems and uh what you can do if you come into a problem but look i'm going to say before we move on to the topic as well if you bought like you're hanging out for this rtx 3080 you bought it and it's there's problems that would suck right i feel for you right you've been looking forward to this for ages and you get it and you're like it's not working properly i know that feeling like it sucks i i before youtube um i mean we're a little bit spoiled now but before that when you when we were like dumping money onto stuff and stuff wasn't working the pain hurts it still happens with like non-tech stuff that i buy and it doesn't work properly i'm like ugh so i guess that's generally why i like to buy from a store with warranty so you could just go back in there and say hey guys this isn't working this is what i've done fix it and they do even though and then you've got the time waiting out right so this would be the most painful with the 3080 because it's so scarce and then it is good like look this is the thing right on the topic of leaving out of this 3080 that the card is a massive boost and if you're not seeing that massive boost or other reviewers aren't showing it for example then maybe they're not testing with the right gear or the right scenario because yeah 1080p you're not going to notice a huge difference right yeah it's not going to be there but it's 4k this is where this card is going to shine that's the point of it like that's that's what everyone's been missing is proper 4k gaming it's becoming more popular all the new consoles are pushing 4k so 4k is really where it's going yeah and people just need to accept that but don't worry i feel you if you bought this card and you have problems i feel for you right now i would still wait for radian i'm just i just want to know what's happening there big navi okay so you'd say wait out for big navi wait up big nappy let's okay here's my theory right yeah so amd's been i'm not an amd show i couldn't care less if it's a good product from anyone i'm gonna like it right so it doesn't matter who makes it so if you don't know see this thing you're not called and aimed at sure you're called an amd fanboy and you're called nvidia shill so if you're an intel right and then you're an intel nvidia shield right yeah but if you're amd you're an amd fanboy so we've got to make that clear we're going to make there's a clear difference here right okay so i'm not an amd fanboy but he's here's my theory right so it's just time it's just time for them to have something it's been when was the last time that we saw something decent one ah r9290 right something kinda decent right i'm going to say okay i'm going to come out of the and the and this is probably not going to be a popular opinion but at the time i wasn't that excited about rx 470 and rx 480 but now looking back i really loved what they did with that because this is what the market needs right now yeah a big injection on this mid-range low-end entry level stuff it needs it so bad man i look on gumtree and facebook there's dudes popping sick gtx 960s off for 200 bucks and this is the thing this is the worst thing people are actually buying it for that price like doesn't mean one of my friends one of my friends who you know one of my friends said look i had a guy come to me and said he bought a 960 4 gigabyte for 200 aussie dollars and i'm just like in 2020 he bought what like mind-blowing you could buy a 1660 super money secondhand that would just wipe the floor with it absolutely mind-blowing it's just yeah whoever that guy is look if you bought a 964 gigabyte in 2020 for 200 dollars you deserve to not have your two hundred dollars that's what i'm gonna say except for your money because you don't deserve that like at all and this is this is the used market at the moment so it's like please that's what i'm saying recently please nvidia please amd release something on the low end like in video hurry up and get a gtx 3050 out i don't need raytracer i just need something that's good you need something that's good that's gonna cost 200 bucks and people can just put in a build and be like yep i'm playing modern warfare i'm playing this game this game i'm playing at 1080p with 60 fps and it's it's good high settings that's all we need but the market's just like not we've got to go rtx 3080s 3090s and then big nappies and big navy look big navy is going to be good i know it's going to have 5120 stream processors right well possibly i don't know exactly but xbox series x already has that like this is the old this is the thing about big navi it's sort of like not too much confusion as to what's going on there because we know they're putting in something with double the stream processes of a 5700 xt like series x is going to be huge man series x is going to be a big console like i'm actually really looking forward to that as a guy who doesn't play on consoles at all i'm i'm more excited for ps5 but you got less stream processors yeah but it's okay okay how do you let's talk about the game it's the games for me so all right well forget about fantasy 16 the second i saw that yeah that morning i was just i think i chatted to you about as i'm like straight up pre-order i don't care give me a fun new final fantasy game i'm pre-ordering it okay fair enough fair enough have they done seven remake yet yeah it's out on ps4 is it on pc no no i suspect it'll probably come to pc they usually do like that one year exclusivity whatever they do with games and i think it'll probably end up coming so let's call it epic game store because everyone hates steam at the moment really yeah did you see with rock rocket league the other day they pulled their they pulled rocket league off steam they put it on epic store and if you claimed it for free on epic you got a 15 epic store voucher as well wow go do it go do it epic is really bringing some competition to the table i think i mean it's like it's like the the devs want more money i think and they know they can get it now because the whole market in general for pc gaming is a lot bigger like yeah it's the biggest it's ever been it's huge now pc gaming is massive so these developers kind of want their own economies of scale right they're like hey look you're selling way more copies now your platform's more refined data's the cheapest it's ever been in the server market we want a discount and epics like we're going to throw you cheap and gaben's like no we're keeping the prices strict man you gotta hook us up uh is it 20 25 30 structure yeah it's like that yeah like hey if you're just getting into it you're just getting into it 30 percent bro and that's a hard pill to swallow man 30 would be hard pill or swallow the problem having pc gaming at the moment and this is like the big reality in about two years i'm gonna need a whole nother hard drive just for launches because there's just too many launchers now even if you use gog galaxy it's still too much like i just want to have one program they have it on console right you know the console itself is the launcher why can't there be an experience like that for pc gaming it's getting frustrating to me especially like you get and you get an ubisoft game on steam right and then you install it then installs you play on top of that as well it's like why yeah well i'm waiting for that corsair made a meme about it but i'm waiting for the launcher game launcher like the launcher that launches the game launches they have it gig galaxy is like the launcher that launches oh that is it oh okay wow okay see that's how that's how behind i've been with my pc gaming wow so there's a launcher of a launcher that actually exists technically yeah gog galaxy it allows you to like link all of your accounts but the second you launch any game and it still launches the launcher oh okay yeah i want one that yeah i want one that's just like yo here we go yeah and it does all that but anyway um big navi let's quickly talk about that before we go to 5800x so big navi i feel like it's going to be of course big it's going to be better than 5700 xt and we just i think with this one we've got to wait and see i think it can match a third like i really legit think they'll match a 30 80 in performance i really think they can do that i think they're gonna do it i just have a feeling it's time it is about time that amd brought something competitive for gps i think they can do it yeah but again you've gotta like i think people like i don't think like the 39 is huge man it's like i'm getting 15 percent more performance at 4k than 30 80. yeah and that's already like it's huge like the performance on a 39 is huge so i don't know if they're gonna match the 30 90 but i think the 30 80 is possible for them to match and if they do it they'll have a great job the top end big navy would be good because it's going to have more vram right and that's but this is the thing they're not going with 6x they're going with too yeah but that's for cost saving purposes okay again i'm wait i'm wait and see on this yeah i don't know we're not we don't have crystal balls balls we're not clairvoyant we can't tell we just gotta wait gotta wait like the rest you guys yeah i think yeah i mean ultimately we've got to wait that's the big thing but at the end of the day it's going to come in with competition though that's the main thing and it's going to bring competition because that's why nvidia's launched 3080 so aggressively because they know something's coming from amd they do and so i mean if you yeah it's just this whole wait and see thing it sucks right now it's so this is the biggest curveball in tech history where waiting and seeing means you're missing out that's a thing right i think in australia all the pre-orders for 3080s are already gone for like october and even possibly november but yeah it's any of the distributors even have any when you're getting stuck either so like this is the thing you've you've got a lot of people out there saying never pre-order anything don't pre-order anything and it's like well this is going against the grain like i pre-ordered my ps5 in my xbox series x and in hindsight i made such a good decision to do that yeah i pre-ordered the ps5 the second i could because but that's the thing those pre-orders i literally like people are re-flipping those pre-orders like not even getting the product and they're making double they just doubled up their money that's that's pretty that's pretty scummy though that's it yeah it is but that's like but you're pre-order you're sitting on something now that's worth more than what you got it for that's the bottom line though yeah that's that's right that's like it's scary reality now because i mean yeah you pre-ordered limited edition stuff like i know there was like a limited edition ps4 and stuff like that they were they went up in value as well but this time around it's like a mainstream product this is just like a standard graphics card a standard ps5 a standard xbox series x and they're getting pre-ordered and the the the flipping on them is the biggest it's ever been it's like oh this is the year of the pre-order the year of the tech scale bot it's called i mean everyone's at home as well so that kind of adds to it the other thing that i found really weird was it felt like a gpu was a console for this generation like it was just so much hype because i remember when the 20 series came out i was building a computer for a mate and he wanted a 2080 on the day it came out he walked into m wave walked out with a 2080 no problem yeah and you could do that right yeah no problem and temperature series as well you could do it like 10 series some of the stores they got stock yeah yeah i just got stuck but it was so bizarre that it turned into this super mainstream product because it was so much hype around it man i've been into tech forever like i've been doing this forever like before youtube like way before it oh yeah and just to see the shift in the market like that is crazy it's nuts man yeah pc gaming's mainstream now so he's like we're all mainstream man we're getting mainstream in here we used to be the the really nerdy not cool kids and now we're like the cool kids boulder's gate two this is the thing i'm going to talk about give a quick shout out to baldur's gate 3. they're coming out soon man that's what i mean this one i got i gotta do a few videos like i have to make a review for this course there uh you told me your doorbell would ring yeah that's probably another gpu delivery you know because all the youtubers are taking all of the gpus you know isn't that is that what everyone said bro you're going to make the audience angry man like i actually i didn't get i didn't get it um colorful actually was going to send us the 3080 but they pulled the pin so there's oh really yeah um so there's probably some truth behind they didn't you know what i mean they had problems with them and they're like look we've got to delay it so that was that was interesting but i've gotten like i've got a few videos to do with like the h59 elite capel x um rgb cooler and i've got to do a keyboard and then azure extend over the desk mini that supports renoir the xbox 300. nice but i can't get a renoir cpu in australia i called the amd rep i'm like yo how do i get one of these i don't care if i have to buy it this is really cool like the viewers will love this and he's like you can't get one in australia i'm like what like you know like the 4750 yeah well there was um someone in our discord um he ended up buying it from some place in germany he ended up just getting one i'm just chipping in i'll see if i can i'll ask him and see if he's got like a place because we'll get him asrock was super excited they're like look we got this awesome product and i'm like i'm super excited i'm like this is cool cause i love the desk minis they're like one of my favorite things from asrock and then i'm just i'm looking at you can't even get one you can't even get cpu or the apu to do this like well they announced the ap is all so excited because i wanted to do like a new storage server video using the apu because it's just really interesting because an eight-core apu is like that's like the holy grail of apu's right there and yeah they were nowhere to be found dude that's sadness yeah on oz one there used to be a chat channel called ozone there used to be a topic called sadness on oz one this is sadness right here are you talking about irc days yeah back in the day so anyway um sadness when i was one mate that was it um so yeah that so i'm going to do these reviews but his boulders gate 3 is launching tomorrow and i think it's tomorrow so we're a day ahead in australia boulder's gate 3 is launching 20 years ago they released boulders gate 2 and that was the game that really made me a pc gaming nerd like sure starcraft brewed war i was being competitive on that but it was that game that did it for me boulder's gate 2 was just like this whole new world of sophistication customization story everything it had it i even replaced like one of the few games i've gone back and replayed because it was that good i was like yeah finished up with my paladin gonna go back and make a fighter mage and then after that i made some rogue like it was just amazing man that and now bold gate three is coming out i'm like oh man i gotta get all this work done i just want to sit back and play boulders gate three so oh october six cool all right oh cool someone just said it's october 6. okay cool man all right i'm sweet i heard it was like tomorrow okay that kind of thing for me like back in the day when i was just like video games was duke nukem 3d duke nukem 3d okay and i'm just i'm dos and i'm just like can it get any better than this can the graphics look any better than this there's no way like this i got a pair of glasses you don't need a pair of glasses scantily clad women as when you're like 12 years old in a video game you're like i didn't know i didn't know i felt this way about this kind of stuff you sure you don't need a pair of glasses [Laughter] anyway let's uh we'll move on to this for people that are like oh man like this zen you know zen3 we want you to talk about so there's um apparently it's gonna be a ryzen 750 800x and a ryzen 950 900x that's what we're looking at so the performance like look there's not really going to be any solid perform like zen 2 was so tight-lipped and you're going to get teasers like this where apparently they've compared it to a 10-900k in ashes of the sink like i why do people show ashes i'm sick of ash as a singularity it is the most pointless game no one plays i never i've never even heard of someone saying bro i've you played ashes of the singularity it's literally a bench yeah it's literally like a bat that's all this game is a benchmark and it's like and even then like it's so it's doing really well against the 10 900k like well it's doing pretty well and so the 3800x is scoring 125 fps but the 5800x is 167. and it's like like that just doesn't seem right these fps numbers don't seem right hey a lot of the time as well that i find with these um some of these websites is the fact that they don't talk about the resolution i know but they it's fine they're crazy 4k it's doing really well like that's apparently what it is but you're kind of like show me another benchmark that i know like just show me horizon zero dawn because i know how it scales it's got a gpu thing there and it's got a cp like it's actually a really good benchmark to run horizon zero dawn because it has all the numbers there and you know like you just see okay there's the average fps number yeah is there a driver bottleneck or is there a cpu bottleneck or is the gpu just not that powerful it tells you everything ash's singularity is just like it's a garbage game i think it's amd's benchmark you know what i mean like because every time they talk about benchmarking it's always ashes yeah well it's just yeah ashes are the singularity yeah ash is ash's they but they're telling us like the ryzen 7 3800x which is a good cpu they're telling me that the 5800x in games is now like 40 35 faster yeah like you look at like i just yeah sorry i i can't believe that it's just it's too far flung bs like that's what that is like you know like hey guys here it is here now like suddenly we went back and with ashland's singularity and we found the the code like they're watching the netflix documentary where we found the code guys we've found it and this unlocks magical fps numbers that you've never seen before forget if you're gpu bound this does yes sir 33 more than your 3800x oh man i'm just i'm sorry to say i just like i'm seeing this i just gotta call bs on it man like that's straight yeah like unless of course then they show you the figures oh yeah the uh 10900k 3800x we're on 2133 crucial ddr4 and um yep these 38 5800x uh just uh you know um 3.8 gigahertz memory two yeah in the fine print i was like yeah but these are real numbers guys so anyway um i i tend to like i see those leaks and we'll have people in our discord like sharing all these leaks and my reaction's always fake news guys like it's just fake i like this one in particular it's just the fact that they they're comparing like the 37 like having the 3800x there which i know is a good cpu and then showing it with that much more effort it's like where does this fps just come from magically sorry but uh not buying it so show me another benchmark to instead it was hiding but um game i don't think anyone actually uses this benchmark anymore anyway yeah so i don't even own it i don't yeah i i have it but i just stopped using it because i was like well no one actually plays this game anyway so it's completely irrelevant so zen but we've got 5900x 12 cores 24 threads and apparently it can go to 4.9 gigahertz like and that's the thing like is that going to be all core is that a single core boost and again i'm looking at the all core speeds because especially for me right i edit videos and that's when you need the extra cores extra threads and you do need a balance of clock speeds too so is this going to be the one that brings you over the line is this going to be like the the value the 12 cause it look the 3900 x was a really good cpu i liked it i liked it yeah big fan of that yeah so that's what i mean like these two skus the 5800x and the 5900x i'm liking where they're at and the higher clocks better ipc bring it on uh and of course apparently they've got like they're saying here apparently they've got now eight cores per ccx module i hear that too yeah which would be very interesting i i think that for me personally that's more interesting for like threadripper and above because you know me like i'm a threadripper guy when it comes to all this stuff like oh dude you keep halfway on about how good thread yeah good man it's good i'm the i'm the opposite man like in premiere pro i just noticed that the intel just sort of takes the corners better right like little things it's all about for me it's all about the snapping and the micro um all those little actions i do where i can sort of make i can make thread ripper choke out can definitely do it um i think it's a lot to do i think i spoke to you about this like couple months ago but the codex that you're editing as well it's just different just different workflow yeah for me we shoot everything in blackmagic raw and it's just like thread ripper let's go and it's just i never have problems with it i'm i'm on a 24 core thread ripper and i have a 32 core okay it sounds spoiled but i um i just haven't bothered to switch it out because the 24 core is doing everything i needed to do dude my audience hates you right now good yeah your 32 chord is sitting there and you're not using it no i use it because like you know like our channel is like super build heavy as well yeah so we do heaps of build so i like to keep cpus for builds in rotation and then like once we're like done with that then we'll just use it in a system fair enough yeah well i um i just i've built this one up now this is the scuf jar jar i posted up some pictures onto it i mean this is absolutely a mess it's a mess this build like but you know the funny thing is it's streaming right now open side panel it's quiet yeah it's quiet and i i realize this is what scuff jar jar was meant to become he was meant to be the prettiest ugliest gaming pc on the internet and i think he's achieved that he's even upside down bro this is held up by a pcie bracket like this top bit here because it'll fall down otherwise and and then yeah i've got the 18 core in there the 7 10 980 xe and i've overclocked that to 4.5 and this thing smashes through my workflow man like honestly so you've gone back from the 3950x back to intel well i've got my 3950x in my other rig see i set this one up here because i wanted to test them just side by side same video files to make sure my judgment call was right and for my workflow the it goes in a scale of uh 10980xe then 10900k and then 3950x 10900k and 3950x are very close and i think it's got to do with the memory controller too this has got quad channel memory and it's a 4.5 gig it's on 18 cores and it's it smashes through adobe man so either adobe amd have to go to adobe and say look these are the codecs we're working with how can we optimize this to get faster i guess snappiness within adobe itself right and then there you go that's a whole can of worms you're opening now because i've got strong feelings about this but i mean that's something i can only yeah at the end of the day mate i can only show you i can only say yeah come over come over to my house and i'll show you exactly what i'm talking about because that's at the end of the day that's all i can do and you you know so i can't say okay i you know and i believe you on what you're saying right you wouldn't be using threadripper if it wasn't the best thing for you i wouldn't waste my time with it if it didn't work that's how i am like i like to i like the right tool for the job if it's doing the job then i'm going to use it i'm not going to waste time and like be a fanboy of a certain brand because that's what i'm sure about i mean yeah i know but you can always tell you'll tell a lot about a man by the car he drives see i drive the stinger bro it's value it's it it's the car to get it's the car to get i don't care if there's a kia badge on my car i could not care hell when you told me you broke that car i was so excited i'm like hell yeah you better come bring that down to sydney bro i'll wear a shirt this thing is sick dude i like it i'll wear it i'll wear a stinger shirt bro i'll wear a key a hat i don't care yeah like i'll be a walking advertisement for care if they're going to keep making cars that are this good in terms of what they give you for the dollar yeah dude that's a monster yeah absolutely i love it man that's what i'm all about i'm all about i don't care about the brand name and people should never care about the brand name and text just like well dude like it's it's tech you know i went from shooting sony back to shooting panasonic too you know the main reason for that the lens ah the color science from the camera itself that was sick i didn't like sony's color science and they're white balance too i think i said that to you a little while ago as well that like that's why for the acam stuff i prefer panasonic it's just easier to color grade yeah and if you've got the right lens and body combo it's good yeah so i mean sorry guys we're sort of talking about full nerd stuff here like we've gone from editing in premiere pro now to talking about cameras we've got to get back to the game actually let's let's quickly circle back to that before we forget right what i wanted to say with um amd cpus and premiere it's fine the problem i have is with amd gpus and it's nothing to it's not really to do with amd from what all the testing i've done is to do with adobe not implementing opencl properly because if you look at opencl benchmarks for stuff like blender it's it's pretty decent right it's pretty decent even like with the radian 7 for instance it's it's it's quite acceptable but the radiant seven in premiere is absolute garbage okay all right well i've just i've used the video in my main rig for a while because of the stability and consistency that's why i use nvidia for gpus and video editing because amd just doesn't make any well well adobe doesn't really implement opencl well so i'm not going to use it okay and now i guess we're done with the topics like so 5900x guys it's going to be announced very soon yeah eight days is it eight days i think they're announcing it oh sorry did i get my dates wrong eighth of october is it well it's six months out of the six of the year you know in a week's time i'll have a better outlook this 30 series stuff has taken out so much time i've forgotten about everything else it is frustrating isn't it like it gets this yeah it's a bit frustrating because i mean there's 30 70 coming 36 there's so many there's so much stuff coming until christmas and i just want to sit back and game on my 4k like i'm serious guys i just want to sit back and forget the world ever existed and game on this 4k oled but the show must go on so we'll talk about show we'll go we'll go to a q a now so if you guys have questions let's chat let's hang out for a little bit let's talk make sure you drop some of those super chats as well you know okay yeah super chats yeah oh yeah yeah that's happening all right so yeah all right let's go to q a so who's got some lovely questions um so hey brian do you think a gtx rtx 3060 ti will be faster than an xbox series x let me just get out my crystal ball here and the imaginary gpu yes so um i think like i think honestly i think my gut reaction says series x is going to be bigger than people expect it's going to be huge man like that's the thing though for the time being right two years time the consoles are going to get again fall behind pc but this time around out of the box consoles are gonna be so much better than they were last generation in terms of how like dude when the consoles came out last time i was beating that price performance with used parts now it's going to be so hard to do a console a proper console remember when ps1 came out and then the graphics on ps1 and the pc guys are just like where did this come from kind of thing and then 3dfx then came out and started making accelerators and whatnot because of playstation so i think it's going to be the same this this time around like there's going to be some like like with the rtx i o stuff with pcie gen4 and using the storage to accelerate loading in textures and shaders and stuff like that yeah i feel like the consoles really put the pc manufacturers like put them to work they are now man it's a good it's a good year but it's not a good year in weight it's a good year for like advancements but it's not a good year for supply because everyone's sitting around twiddling their thumbs trying to figure out new stuff because everyone's at home so nuts this year man it's just such a weird year man like i'm sick that's what i said to people just roll with the punches man just wake up every day make sure your health's in check make sure it's all good up here and just keep rolling that's all you can do right i was like yeah what's going on guys you know what's going on guys so we got russell watts and he asked did they fix the chroma sub sampling on lg cx or is it only b and c9 working this is the thing about the chrome sub-sampling so i'm doing um i've got 10-bit hdr enabled on my cx-55 and i'm not noticing any issues besides g-sync not working properly still and that's the only thing so i had a few comments about people talking about the g-sync with the lg panels and one of one of our admins in discord is like super into reddit and keeps up to date with everything and what none he reckons is probably just going to be a firmware yep well i've already spoken in video behind the scenes they said they're aware of these issues and they're working on them they said look do you even want to try early early drivers beta drivers before they're even released and i'm like guys i don't have time like i know you're going to get on you're going to get on top of this because it's a huge market it's actually a huge selling point for the rtx 3000 carts is the fact that people can get these ogl lgo leds and now they've just got beautiful hdr 120 hertz gaming oh man like there was a sale on ebay so i was like no brainer i've got to get on top of this miss that stuff oh i mean you got to get on top of this man well if you've got your guys in the discord too man like tech yes discourse like ebay sell bank get on it guys 10 off because a lot of us hunt parts you know what i mean so yeah yeah you'll just buy you'll buy a batch of new parts and so excalibur asks what's good brian uh yeah what's good like just uh just the flow that's what's good the flow is good yeah so we got cheap tuesdays in australia cheap tuesday pizza night so we had pizzas last night that's good is that is that why you're not feeling well today no i'm feeling great man i'm just i'm so confused when it comes to streaming you know this is the weird thing about youtube live streaming now i just had to hit launch and that was it i'm used to waiting like in the thing to edit my stream and stuff and then i can be like go live now they've changed it where it's like i had to actually live stream first unlisted get my live stream ready and then delete the live stream and then launch it again look at least it works and we haven't had any problems and i'm sticking to the virtuoso because i have no problems when i live stream on this headset so i'm going to stick to this when it comes to live streaming mike the mic on the that headset's really good it sounds really good to me as well claire uses them claire uses them so yeah okay there's a question about use intel and trouble not for implementing pcie 4 with rtx 3000. i'll get a video coming out about that very soon that's actually one of the next videos i've got coming out it's oh you're going to it's going gonna be shocked at the you're gonna be shocked at what actually is the the deal with pca gen whatever well i did testing i did testing initially when we got the 3000 cards and i built up a whole test bench i made this whole deal of doing pcie gen 4 because these new cards have got gen 4 and it turns out like at launch and initially with everything it made no difference to performance and everything within within a margin of error i'm going to save it for the video i got some i got my own knowledge and my own things to fit to the table but as far as like is intel in trouble for not implementing it well the boards already support it you just got to wait for a cpu that does it too yeah um they're not in trouble i just think it's right it doesn't matter what people have people always want the newer stuff so when you're seeing gen 4 being advertised of course people want gen 4 over gen 3. and the biggest thing that's making the difference is the nvme drives in their read and write speeds yeah so that's the biggest thing that's all that's all i'm going to say wait for the video i got some truth truth uh i'm not going to say that other word because i don't get demonetized i've got some truth bees to drop on you guys with the pca and stuff i think bifurcation is a big deal for me personally as well like i like to have that functionality and to have it with pcie gen4 amd cpus is really good for our workflows but that's not a use case that you know everyone has so yeah yeah so either you guys going to be running comparison tests on consoles to pc that's what i'm hoping i want to get these like these consoles are actually going to be a big part going forward because i feel like they're going to absolutely destroy the pc market at a certain price range like they are at least for a couple of years because it's you can't beat that price performance and then you've got xbox game pass which is actually really good i just got it the other day with discord nitro because i just wanted to see what it was about and i'm like there's so much that i don't like so much on here i don't know what to play now yeah it's pretty good like yeah good i mean i get my voice i'm just going back to my teenage days it's good um yeah so xbox game pass is legit and it's good and the fact that they're offering that on consoles and you man you're getting so much value out of that and it's as a pc price performance guy i cannot deny that right now the other thing is um someone was talking to me about it the other day where i think microsoft is like leasing consoles to people now like for the new generation where you pay like a subscription fee you get the console as part of the subscription so you don't even have to buy the console anymore wow which like that's pretty crazy so it's less about the hardware again and it's more about the software microsoft at the end of the day is a software company that's what they're known for doing so it's pretty amazing dude i'm using a microsoft key but you know what i mean like microsoft traditionally is a software company so they always have really good solutions for this software i love the yoga man let's keep telling y'all 915. wireless no i love the yeah dude like you know this is how i was able to do a one-arm pull-up bro i even showed that stuff on twitter i saw that that's legit man yeah it's your wrist spray your wrist say like you know when i took when i i started typing on this thing um you know for four days for four days my wrists were aching aching yes because they adjusted in a different manner to typing on this as to what they were used to on the normal keyboards so whatever dude this thing is tried and proven man like that's what i mean you had back in the early 90s or late 90s i think it was late 90s they were developing the year ago i think they released it when did they release the first one sometime in 90 something yeah i remember they went one and it was like pre came with like packard bells and stuff like that and people like what is this thing see like in ways i feel like they were the the golden days of r d now those days are finished like oh do you see people afraid to experiment like they weren't afraid to experiment now everyone's just too cautious like for me when they started pushing white leds in monitors i felt like that was the day of where corp you know corporate profits overtook actual people's health yeah where like dude white leds are garbage man like straight up they're garbage and there's no other way around that you've got a blue led light source at that core of that led and it's like yeah that was the day for me where it all just overtook and it was like okay we don't care we just want to make profits they're cheaper to make they're easier to produce we can market it with more power efficiency everybody's winning here except the consumer with their eyes and it's like yeah anyway we can get started on that let's go back to uh what we've got some other juicy questions coming here everyone's just like joining us chatting everyone's just hanging out let's see everyone's just hanging out okay i saw something that i wanted to talk about this is actually this is when i'm with greg great everyone's like everyone when i'm with greg everyone's just like spamming chat with comments so you guys are joining in on this conversation this is fantastic uh gen 4 drives are hotter than gen 3 ones uh yeah that's true but uh they don't not all the gen 4 drives actually throttle the seagate ones don't without a heat sink so that's question for brian would you be interested in redesigning the perfect keyboard to 3d print as a proof of concept yeah we'll see i just all i'd want from a keyboard is this with mechanical switches yeah well microsoft's too lazy to do it microsoft's just like no we got the ergo it works that's it i'm like no microsoft you need to make the gaming ergonomic keyboard gaming it ain't broke though well it's got rgb leds on it look i need a bit of ram i needed a bit of rgb in my life bro over the last few years it's growing on me and uh like all these rgb stuff started i'm like not a fan and then you actually build a pc with rgb like hey this is kind of cool like it looks cool and then yeah and you find yourself never looking at it because i need that rainbow i i've gotten used to like changing the car i even like a bit of rainbow puke like yeah it's not bad like they're the right build it looks good yeah a bit of rainbow puke in your build it's good and then you got then of course you've got the the gaming actuation like it's faster to actuate so microsoft need to get on this and make the gaming ergo and i'd be in heaven microsoft if you're listening gaminggogo and then you can release it with the new consoles and bring our series x and then make windows 10 on the series x so then people can just be getting so much value out of that series x and they won't even hey that would be good but that'd put you out of business wouldn't it it would yeah see it would put you out of business too bro [Laughter] we're just all out of business to build any more pcs ever just buy an xbox and hit microsoft ergo keyboard that's all you need hey you going we're starting off the parts aren't for the month hey guys it's got an xbox this month it's all dried up now bro there's nothing wrong where's the parts man where's the parts just got a series x bro calling it a day i'm really looking forward to the consoles i mean this time around like ps4 when i saw the specs i was like wow they're using an apu joke as well like yeah it was like look the last time they read this at consoles i just looked and laughed i was like yeah but this time around i'm looking at i'm like whoa what what whoa whoa uh guys uh whoa and i'm down playing this anymore like you can't downplay it that's bottom line if you down play it then you're an actual shield i think the only problem i have is um clear calls at the mom and dad tax yeah with with stuff so um the ssd the seagate one that they're selling as an external for the series s and series x is almost as much as buying a series s yeah like the acting the nvme drive and i think that's it's the values insane like you just can't get around it man no but i mean that's too expensive for an ssd like 220 us dollars or whatever it is for an nvme yeah that's yeah nvme's cost a bit of money bro nvme is like one terabyte nvme has cost a bit of money dude so yeah like you look at those things they've come down a fair bit though they're losing a lot like they're losing a lot of money on those consoles man bottom line that's it so i don't know how they can afford to make them well remember with ps3 sony was losing and with xbox 360 they were losing so much money per console just to get it out the door yeah so anyway all right guys so that's about it for today uh we're gonna close down the livestream because i've gotta go and uh get some food into me and i'm gonna film our three-year channel bursary and our silver play button on boxing and yep i'll be watching that for sure i'll be watching that thanks for coming on two dude uh had a great stream actually if you guys yeah if you guys want to see more gear seekers uh greg was mia today he's been m.i.a for the last week i'm pretty sure i've messaged him late bro you want a live stream we've got a live stream man viewers want to chat you just want to hang out um but yeah gear seekers if you guys enjoy gear seekers let us know on the chat and check his channel i'll put a link in the description once this live stream is finished and thanks all for tuning thanks y'all for tuning in really good yeah and um basically yeah we'll catch you in another tech video very soon and i was going to usually with greg i do the american accent but because he's americans like well we can't it's weird i can't kind of do that with nick it's kind of weird like i love doing the american accent we're not going to get it this month that's so sad yeah unfortunate that's i guess that's it sadness when i was one bro yeah sadness all right thanks for tuning in nick and also uh we'll catch you guys in another one very soon love each and every one of you and we'll catch you next time do you want to do the honors of peacing out for now yeah buying this stream peace out for now and bye peace out for now
