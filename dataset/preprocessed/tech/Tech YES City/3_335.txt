[Music] I got all set is he ready
[Music] over four months ago here on the channel
at Tech YES City, we had a young gentleman by the
name of Sethe he came around and he said to me "look my PC is giving me so many
problems I cannot play fortnite properly in clutch situations I'm losing
games because my fps is dipping really low." and then I took a look at his
machine and I said look there's a few things we can do we can try upgrade this
PC or I can just give you another PC on the spot and we fix up the difference
and so what I did for him then was I did him a 4th Gen i7 (4770) at the time with two
8GB sticks of ddr3 to make dual channel and a gtx 1660 super and
since he has taken that pc and you might be thinking well he went from 8th gen to
4th gen how's that considered an upgrade i believe it or not the 4th gen cpus is
still pretty good but it's mainly due to the fact that the acer nitro 50 was just
so bad with a single stick of ddr4 memory no options in the BIOS to even
tune that memory and it just ended up being a much better option for him now
here's the crux of this video he's been really happy with this machine over the
last 4 months and he's actually told me he started winning fortnite tournaments
now and with that winning money and so now it's become a serious deal for him
where he needs the absolute best FPS possible the best tune on this machine
and of course the 240 Hertz monitor this is where these things matter the most
when it comes to pro level and it comes to playing for money and so he came to
the yes man for the advice and so today we're gonna run through his old PC and
what he's upgrading to and then tune this thing up and see how good of an
upgrade this machine is for him let's roll that intro if you're sick and tired
of seeing a Windows needs activations message in your bottom right-hand corner
in the today's video sponsor SCD Keys has you covered for as little as 13 US
dollars using the coupon code TYC on checkout you can get yourself a Windows
10 Pro single and OAM user license links in description below so now it's the
next and I'm joined by Sethe and he's like, I'm
not that short okay he's six foot seven so he's really tall so we're about to
now we got this PC right here and we're now going to quickly clean it down which
is something I always do when PCs come through here but I'm also going to now
upgrade the system and we'll quickly go over the components I'm gonna ask Seth
is he ready yes okay [Music] so here is your new PC what do you think
so far it's pretty crazy I can't wait to test it out yeah this way let's get into
it so basically says what is it you do on
fortnight at the moment ah I put a lot of screams I just practice to get better
pretty much and yeah okay so for the viewers out there I actually don't even
know what a scrim is because I don't play fortnight that much what does a
scrim exactly a hundred players loading to the same Lobby and it's just really
competitive and try and win it's for the best practice yeah tournaments how does
that differ from a say a pub game where you just log in so low a lot of people
try a lot harder in scrims definitely pub games people don't take that
seriously but yes games are for like the elite I guess okay so that's where
people just keep building up and up and up yep okay see in pub games it's more
like when I've won a pop game before and it's just been me sitting on the ground
and then somebody's jumped into me and I've won yeah okay so it differs a lot
from that definitely yeah okay cool man so this is we upgraded from the a so
which was terribly tuned we went to a forty seven seventy a sixteen sixty suit
bar but now you feel like you've outgrown that yeah yeah and so what was
the problem with that PC at that at this point in time before we upgraded now I
was getting a lot of FPS drops in game in the later stages of the game FPS is
going down to about 70 which is extremely hard to play on when you're
trying to play on like the best of the best
yeah okay okay fair enough and that's fair enough like there's only so much
you can do out of say a forty seven seventy on a budget so this is now
marking a ninety nine hundred K you can't get any better so your opponents
if they're beating you they're beating you now because they've got better skill
yeah okay cool let's fire this thing up and see what Seth can pull off
[Music] [Music]
so now we are finished up with this PC that Seth has got and how are you
feeling about this PC pretty excited yeah so you're now getting double the
FPS in those situations yeah yeah and that's gonna make you play better
definitely yeah okay so that was the most important
thing now cess can go into this and the gear is not going to be holding him back
whatsoever so I think that's one thing that I've always been passionate about
here on the channel is getting the most and giving the most to pro players so
when you see the input latency testing we do here when you see getting out
those differences they don't matter to me personally but I know how they can
matter to some people who want to start winning tournaments and want to be the
best at this sport anyhow with all that out of the way I am gonna be monitoring
Seth closely now and seeing how he evolves because he went from a I'd say
terrible asa nitro 50 and he went to then he went to a tech yes loved price
performance gaming PC now he's gone to the best of the best in the CPU side of
things in the GPU as we said before it doesn't matter a whole lot in fortnight
so this going forward I hope you enjoy your new PC thank you
yeah upgraded PC and I am going to monitor him closely and who knows
something may come out of this you may see a new gaming brand called the yes
crew so Seth has now collected his computer has gone home a happy chappie
and this really relates to the whole path of pro gaming in this video you're
seeing here and that is that Seth was able to get into Cpl which is the league
that have really good players in it and it was able to get into that by I guess
with a price performance budget used banger and that's what it's all about is
you can get into that level of play and know that you need more and if you need
more then you can spend and so what we did in this video was I
guess that we proved that hey if you've got a mediocre computer with an i7
fourth gen 16 gig of ram and just say a gtx 1060 or something like that you
don't have to go out and spend all this money on ninety nine hundred k or go get
a 240 hertz monitor or go get the best final Mouse in the world to know that
you've got the talent that talents gonna be there that talents going to exist
regardless of the gear you're on but of course if you find yourself then
starting to play in these tournaments where your competitors have all this
stuff and you're at that top 1% of the crew then you're gonna know that you're
gonna need that better gear and so that's when it's justified I feel for
getting the most out of your gear now of course we saw with the 9900 K that we
whacked in and upgraded for him that he was now getting a much smoother
experience he was just smiling the whole time he was super excited super happy
that he's now able to compete at this level with the best gear around town so
super excited to do this upgrade for him I loved seeing these young guys come up
and I loved using that knowledge that I've built up over the years to get him
the best settings getting the best fps and of course make sure that his
competitors now don't have an advantage if anything he'll have the advantage
over his competitors because we've got all the right settings we've tuned up
his system to to be able to go max FPS to the rim anyhow with that aside if you
guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button and going
forward from here on in is there going to be a tech yes version of a gaming
label I'm really thinking about it I really want to get into more the eSports
tech side of things bringing these players up showing them the discipline
and hard work can set you above the rest not just the hardware and the gear but
also everything up here is important in order to be number one but basically
with pro gaming was when I was coming up as a teenager I was pro at StarCraft
brood war but there was no money in it literally I was emailing sponsors trying
to get anyone I could to jump on board and people just looked at you and they
literally laughed you can ask anyone back in the new millennium if they were
coming up in Australia trying to get into pro gaming there was just no money
in it whatsoever fast forward to 2020 and eSports and
especially games like fortnight it has so much money in it it's what everyone's
doing everyone's into it and I'd say it has a much bigger player base even a
game like fortnight has a much bigger audience rich than certain games in
Australia like rugby and also AFL that's how big this kind of sport is now and
it's just the future I feel and I basically feel like these guys have come
to me because we've also got someone else who's come to me recently and
that's probably another video in the works as well feel like these guys have
come to me for a reason maybe fate has it that were meant to make this gaming
label and show the world what the power of yes is capable off and if you guys
have stayed this far and you're enjoying that content then be sure to hit that
sub button ring that bell to get at the moment it drops in your sub box but
we've also got the question of the day before I get on out of here comes from
Pat Davis and they asked this is totally unrelated so it's on a different video
put the link up here but have you had any experience with an tech power
supply's will it be reliable and not catch on fire and so basically if you're
building a computer and tech a builder of power suppliers and they make really
good power supplies at least in the like literally hundreds of power supplies
I've gone through a lot of them have been antics and I've never had one
problem with a Antec power supply personally though I have read of a story
in the US where a bad batch went through and they had bad soldiering and they
caught on fire honestly I say if the antec power supply
hasn't caught fire by now then it's good to go going into the future hope that
answers that question and I'll catch you guys in the next one peace out for now
but [Music]
