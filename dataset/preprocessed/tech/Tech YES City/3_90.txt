i woke up this morning and i got a call out of the blue and this was a supplier that i've never met before and they said brian do you want to come and take a look at what i've got and i just like i always put out a feeler i'm like okay uh what have you got he's like oh i've got a ryzen 5 3600 32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory i7 i'm like okay yep cool let's uh let's go check this out so i'm now just jumped in the car straight away so you guys can come along with us for the ride and we can see what deals this new supplier has i'm pretty excited because maybe there might be some graphics cards there too i didn't ask but i'm hoping there's some gpus there if you've just built a gaming pc and you're getting this annoying windows needs activation message even on windows 11 then today's video sponsor can get rid of that message quick and easily for as little as 12 using the coupon code bftyc you can save 35 in the month of november links in description below don't miss the old days [Music] so we just finished up at this new suppliers place and it was so much better than expected i got so much ddr3 memory and this was coming off the back of the path hunt that we just did and i already got heaps of ddr3 memory in that part time too so overall i think there was roughly 200 gigabytes of memory this time around then we cleared a heap of i7 cpus we got that ryzen 5 3600 with 32 gigabytes ram the motherboard it even came with a water cooler which is always good when you're building a gaming pc to re-flip because uh people love like water cooling for some reason if you're selling a pc water cooling people just love it uh so we got that we also got more graphics cards than i expected even though they're old cards i can still make good budget pcs with these gravity cards so we got a heap of uh 79.73 gigs and we got them from about forty dollars a piece so they were about forty dollars a piece and we picked them up and then we got also a gtx 570 and there was just a heap of other stuff too which as we're going through the price list i'm just like yeah that seems pretty good we'll go with that but as we're going through the price list there was some x 79 x 58 and also x 99 now this stuff the guy's not 100 sure if it works so i paid 100 bucks for these three motherboards but even if one of these for instance the x99 board ends up working out then that'll be worth more than all that other all the three things combined so that in my opinion is a pretty good deal but in terms of what else we got let's get back to the tech yes studio and then we'll also start testing some of this stuff and seeing if it works [Music] [Applause] [Music] and here we are now with all these parts laid out on the table we ended up scoring six gpus in total where we got uh three seventy nine seventies a gtx 570 gtx 1050 ti and a gtx 650. now i've quickly cleaned all these up just a five minute tech yes loving light uh where we just get all the dirt off but we're gonna run through these cards now and see if there's any problems with them because this set right here is the ryzen 5 3600 with 32 gigabytes of ram a power supply and that came with the 1050 ti and the water cooler for 400 so that's what i got charge 400 aussie about 300 us for that kit which pretty good value and then over here we've got 55 sticks of ddr3 memory we've also got 10 cpus most of those being i7s and also some 7th gen i5s as well as one 9th gen i5 so the prices for all this stuff in total we got charged uh 2 grand aussie for all this stuff but i did i did get a massive discount because i'm going to trade an xbox series x because the person who sold it actually said they really need a series x and there's none on the market wall there's only some on the market but they rip off prices so they said oh you know i wanted to pay around 800 for one i'm like oh well i've got one i can do it for you for 800 because you're hooking me up with all these deals right here but what we're going to do now is we're going to go through two phases of testing and test out the gpus then test out the motherboards but we'll give them a clean as well and then we'll see if there's anything here that doesn't work because i even though these got sold as a bundle the motherboard some of them i actually pulled out of a dumpster because uh the person said look some of the stuff we it's just not worth it there's nothing it comes from broken machines so they just chuck it out and i'm like well if i can get a motherboard to work then i'm i'm really happy so i pulled out a few motherboards that i thought were potentials sure they got some bent pins and stuff but that's my specialty is trying to bring this stuff back to working conditions and also there's a lenovo and also a dell i'm going to do a special video with the dell because i want to try and convert that into a gaming pc and then we just got some random monitor here which they said was just sitting there they didn't want it anymore and i said look i'll take that so anything that's kind of junk i like turning it into treasure so that's what we're going to try and do here today in terms of at least getting the parts ready for the treasure process to begin so let's get on with this gpu testing we'll come back and we'll see what works [Music] so out of those six graphics cards that we just tested one ended up giving us out an error essentially it's a faulty card it won't work in its current state it's giving out that b2 error coming from the motherboard which means that the pcie device in this case the graphics card is faulty and it's not working properly however the other five gravis cards they all work fine we've tested out run the heaven benchmark on all the other five cards all work fine so five out of six cards i'm pretty happy with that it's time to now to clean up some motherboards bend some pins back and see what luck we have when it comes to the mobos now we're getting in close to the motherboard here where the pins are and straight away i can notice there's an anomaly right here where these pins are a little bit out of place so we're just going to bend them back and then if this board was previously not working then it should now it should actually work after this so we're going to do that coupled with a little quick cleaning session going to go through all the motherboards and make sure all these pins are just in that good position where they're not well essentially they're going to be making contact and they're going to be working so one thing as well in general older boards like if you're going back to first or second generation boards you may even just want to give them a little glaze over and try against the grain kind of like you're shaving very soft which we'll do on some of these other boards to give them the best chance of working so let's get this party started [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] look at those skeletons down there they had atomic energy but they couldn't control it look baby is different the other the race was changing by mutation [Music] now imagine a shifted hip socket so they could walk upright the baby was already without a tail no that would mean they were changing into committed suicide [Applause] [Music] [Music] machine got him the same way look at those skeletons down there they had atomic energy but they couldn't control it look the baby is different the other the race was changing by mutation look at those skeletons now imagine a shifted hip socket so they could walk upright that's one dumpster motherboard [Applause] [Music] [Music] so what we're doing now is we're going to be soldering uh an acer connector which is a 12 pin connector into a 10 pin connector for lenovo don't know if this will work but i just want to know if the motherboard works i'm very curious to see if that pin bending session works usually i would just wait like a month for the connector to come in because you can buy these converters off ebay for very cheap but again i need to know if this board works right now or not and i don't know this kind of stuff can be fun sometimes so let's solder up this new connector and see if it works let's see what we got baby fingers crossed baby come on boom [Music] please take your city please build me a budget gaming pc [Music] the race was changing [Music] and there we have it we've got all those motherboards every single one of them works so this new supplier i am definitely going to be calling him up a lot more and hounding him and hopefully doesn't get too annoyed because when they say something's untested that was they actually meant untested they didn't know if it worked or not because i only had one part that was broken that was a 7970 and usually like i find if i'm buying off marketplace a lot of people if they're selling a single item the untested in that case would probably be like over half the untested stuff on open marketplace is usually faulty so you're seeing here kind of what untested really means most of the untested stuff generally and used if you're buying it off a seller who actually hasn't tested it they've just got to move this stuff most time it'll work even this stuff that i'm getting in and i'm bending pins back on it's all working and even in the case of that lenovo with that connector i just had a feeling like all that as i'm going through the stuff and it's all working i'm like well let's try this connecting because i'm curious i got a feeling this motherboard will work this lenovo and it was sure it wasn't a no-go it was a a yes go so yes go and that ended up working fine and what we've got here now is just like heaps of memory heaps of parts for builds we've got five gravis cards uh we didn't need to test the ryzen the 3600 because i already saw that working he had that on display for us because i guess it was like the the newer stuff the truce the trophy prize so i got to see that all working before i picked it up but we got cpu's galore memory galore seven motherboards five gravis cards i even had a banger monitor thrown in and so what i'm seeing now is a lot more so yes the graphics card prices are high but they won't remain high forever it's basically you you've got to have the next guy willing to buy that uh you know chuck e cheese token on the internet for whatever the guy's prepared to sell it for so it's only a matter of time before that whole crypto thing does come down and when it does then there'll be this massive demand for all these other parts that are going out for cheap because suddenly people want to build gaming pcs again so when i for me i'm just seeing that a lot of these parts ddr3 ddr4 it's all going really cheap so i'm just going to keep picking it up and doing what i do and so when i see a good deal i'm going to snap it up and so on the parts hunts i've seen a really good deal uh today i found this new guy he's got really good deals for us and that's the name of the game so now all's we're waiting for is that rug pool to happen on crypto and then if you know if that happens we'll have um we'll have cheap graphics cards again and pc gaming will get back to normal i will admit there's definitely a bias there i love building gaming pcs so anything that sort of brings the price of a total system down i'm more than happy to see it happen but you know this kryptos this crypto mining profitability is just it seems to go on forever and so as long as that mining profitability is high people are going to keep buying those graphics cards and putting it rather than putting them in gaming pieces and put them in crypto mining rigs so that's the go there but in the meantime i'm finding there's really good deals on this used stuff even those gpus that people don't want to put in crypto mining rigs they'll still play games especially like a 7970 that'll still play games absolutely fine even though the newer driver support for it's dropped off it doesn't really matter it'll play a lot of those titles at 1080p with smooth fps so i expect a lot more budget coming to the channel i'm definitely starting to see these deals they're starting to show up a lot more keep your eyes out keep peeled and again the only thing left to complete the full value circle here is that rug pull so if that crypto rug pull happens we're going to be having happy days if you are into pc tech but in the meantime if you are a gamer do stay patient patience will be a big reward i feel especially in the coming months there's a lot of cracks showing up in the world right now it's only one of those cracks that starts to really get big and then that could spell that big anyway guys i hope you enjoyed today's behind the scenes look at what i do uh finding out new suppliers and stuff like that i figured a lot of people like were messaging me behind the scenes bro i want to see more content so i'm just going to start vlogging a lot more sort of this kind of stuff the quick and easy testing the toothpick the pin brushing all that stuff this is what i do behind the scenes and i get very good results out of it i i do save a lot of time i get to the end result pretty quickly and then we've got parts now that are just completely workable for gaming pcs and that's the most important thing so i'll keep if you guys want to keep seeing this stuff i'll keep posting it do let us know in the comments section below also what was your favorite deal in today's video and also if you enjoyed today's video too love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here and this comes from tacman2012 and they say love your vids question what is the equivalent to your tech yes lovin spray here in the us wd-40 so the one that i use in australia it's right here water dispersant multi-purpose spray this is unique kind of i have tried a lot of different ones i've tried wd-40 wd-40 is definitely safe it's safe but it's a lot thicker and it does have a stronger smell than this stuff and i'd say the closest one that i like personally would be one of the crcs i used to use it in japan i did like it um this stuff here though is by far the best value but it's also the best for pc parts it's a little bit lighter than crc and also wd40 and of course coming in cheaper i can just blast this stuff for days and get that really good clean that really look good look shine it works so well on cleaning off pins as well for cpus absolutely love this stuff i'm just not sure in the us if you guys have any recommendations of maybe a unique brand in the u.s you could help tacman out in the comments we'd love that too anyway guys i'm going to get back to doing what i do if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now [Music] to bye
