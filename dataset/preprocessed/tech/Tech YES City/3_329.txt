i bit my lip like an hour ago so in this
video if i'm kind of like stumbling when i talk
then i do apologize in advance but with that aside we have
smt on the amd side and ht on the intel side now smt stands for
some magic truffle (simultaneous multi threading) so that means if you basically put it this way if you've got
a single mouth and you're eating a truffle then what happens is with
hyper threading and also smt it splits it off into two smaller mouths
and you can now eat more theoretically you can't there's not
like two full-size mouths compared to one big mouth but it
can eat more in grand scheme of productivity now on the
intel side you've got ht which stands for holy truffle
and now that's a different breed that was sort of in before
amd had their smt so that's why it's got the holly truffle now
of course depending on the brand if you go with amd or intel
both truffles are going to do a pretty good job compared to not eating any
truffle at all though with that aside when it comes to
gaming do these technologies work when you split a core
into two threads versus having that single core with one thread
going in and going full ball what is better for gaming
let's find out in today's video after we roll that intro
[Music] so coming off the back of our 2013 8
core xeon versus the 10900k and also the 3950x
i decided after i did this video to run a heap of different tests
with smt off on amd's 3950x and then hyper threading off on intel's
10900k and also the 1680v2 and what we saw here is pretty much
going to match up with when i made a video on this in the past
the opinion is pretty much going to be exactly the same or at least the
recommendation if i recall correctly but let's get
through the results first with shadow of the tomb raider 1080p high settings
we saw that we gained three fps on the 10900k
then with the 3950x we gained five extra fps
and then on the 1680v2 we actually lost three
fps so it really didn't make a huge difference turning it on or off in this
game really wasn't going to make a world of a
difference here but moving over to fortnite now probably the
most interesting of the bunch where turning off hyper threading and also smt
uh made the numbers worse all across the
board it didn't matter if we had the 8 core the 16 core or the 10 core
we were getting less performance so do leave this
on if you want to play fortnite competitively it's going to give you
more fps and then when it came to the one percent and 0.1 percent lows they
were virtually the same i mean one percent lows were winning out in some
cpu tests and then the 0.1 lows were losing out in some other cpu tests but
next up we have the division 2 here and this is where uh turning off
hybrid threading and also smt showed us that on the 10900k side we
gained three fps and then on the 3950x we actually got a
sizeable boost here going from 167 fps all the way up to 182. so it started to
really scream ahead with smt off in this title this is the
same memory speeds same clock speeds as the previous video
we did with these numbers and so what we're
seeing on the xeon side of things however we only gained 1 fps so
negligible for the intel cpus but it did make a difference
for the 3950x and then over to tom clancy's ghost recon in vulcan
we saw here an actual drop in fps on the 10 900k
a slight gain on 3950x and then a 1fps gain on the xeon so
really didn't make a huge difference here either way that you look at it
it seems like the 10900k is probably the biggest difference here but that wasn't
even worth writing home about though moving over to warzone
here we've got a similar trend as most of the other titles except with the
exception of the xeon 1680 v2 which scored significantly lower fps
with hyper threading turned off and that must
be the 8 cores now versus the 8 core 16 threads where
doubling up the threads gives you more theoretical max
performance and this game is taking advantage of that as opposed
to the 10 900k where it's already maxing out the gpu
and then same with 3950x it's maxing out essentially it's cpu
um core component tree where the smt's off or other smt's on
so in warzone i would suggest just leaving hyper threading on
or leaving smt on and then we go to the last title here we got grounded
which is going to be released later this month and i got early access to it so we
got here uh testing out hyper threading on versus
off on the 10 900k this made actually a huge difference going from 102 average
fps all the way up to 127 on the amd side we
went from 92 to 98 and then over on the 1680 v2
we still gain a slight boost as well so all across the board here we were
winning with hyper threading and also smt off
however when i was analyzing this game i also looked at how many threads were
actually being utilized in game play and it seems to only be using eight
threads and even within that itself it's only heavily using two threads of
course some other last minute tests here ccx latency
that doesn't change whatsoever on the 3950x side of things
cinebench scores will change quite substantially
both on the intel and also the amd cpus and this is to the tune it can be around
30 so you'll definitely want to leave your
hyper threading or smt on if you're doing any sort of productivity
work that can utilize all the cores and all the
threads your cpu has to offer though power consumption also during
gaming uh really didn't change a whole lot
the 3950x was winning the bunch there when we tested that in ghost
recon and with all those numbers out of the way my opinion with turning these
settings on versus off remains the same like it did i believe i
did this video two or three years ago but i remember my
conclusion was in general you just want to leave hyper
threading and smt on with your cpus but say for instance we
can see that in certain titles and depending on the cpu you can gain
fps now if you are playing that game
competitively and you're in that top one percent or point one percent of people
who play that game and you need to just extract that little bit extra
performance and that is all you do then perhaps this setting turning it off
may be something you want to look into and of course
we only tested six games here but it does show
that it's an easy setting just to quickly check you just go into the bios
and you can disable it and re-enable it pretty much in two seconds
and then you can test the fps for yourself in that particular title
and see whether you need to leave it off or on but of course in general i will
restate this again in general you just want to leave your
hyper threading and smt on because in general when it comes to
working in productivity it's going to give you much better
performance and then of course when it comes to gaming
depending on the game it can give you a lot better performance
as opposed to the other side of the fence which you're only going to be
losing maybe 10 and even at worse with grounded 20
and that's an unreleased title so imagine that game will get some fine
tuning in the next few weeks and once it's got its final release
those differences will be minimized anyhow hopefully this video was some
good truffle for you and you enjoyed it and if you did then be sure to hit that
like button for us and also let us know in the comment section below have you
tried disabling hyper threading or smt in the
past for regular use if so what was your experience like love
reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the
day here which comes from sally bowie and they ask is ryzen 1500x and b350m
gaming pro for 150 aussie dollars a good deal
and it's a pretty decent deal i mean you can't go wrong with that it's not the
best deal i've seen out there but it's definitely a decent deal so
if it was if that deal was around my area for that price i'd pick it up
so hopefully that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon if you enjoyed this video and you stayed
this far and you want to see the content at the moment it keeps rolling out here
at tech yeah city then be sure to hit that sub button ring
that bell and i'll catch you in the next tech video very soon autobots
peace out for now bye [Music]
