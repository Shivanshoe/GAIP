so graphics cards are really expensive right now and building a pc will unequivocally encounter strong resistance from an economical pricing standpoint of monetary nature what is the solution you ask well meet our friend here the xbox series s the easy solution if you want a game and not get ripped off now i was thinking of doing a video on the xbox series s and right as i was thinking about this today's video sponsor microsoft came along and said look would you like to feature the xbox on your channel and i was thinking this is a complete no-brainer this tiny console unit measures in at 65 by 151 by 275 millimeters is lightweight weighing under two kilograms consumes very little power even whilst it's gaming and this is mainly thanks to the new tech it packs inside with a ryzen zen 2 8 core at the heart which also features the ability to multi-thread supporting up to 16 threads of processing it can handle even the most intense physics and shadows that groundbreaking engines from new games demand but that's just the cpu what about graphics well here's where the rdna 2 20 cluster units is powering the graphics that's the same cluster units going in even their most latest and greatest pc graphics cards which means that this little unit here not only has the portability but also packs a punch when it comes to gaming and if you want to set this thing up in a hurry and play games then it also sports a 512 gigabyte nvme m.2 solution so if previous generation consoles left a bad taste in your mouth with slow loading times then the series s will leave you frothing at the mouth wanting more basically this little compact unit right here will emulate the experience of an enthusiast gaming pc at a fraction of the price especially in today's current market though enough talk let's see what this little thing can do in games [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so the gaming experience that i got out of the series s was extremely fluid so playing halo 4 on the halo master chief collection as well as playing doom eternal and also playing forza horizon 4 i was just noticing it was a completely smooth experience with no stuttering whatsoever this is in part thanks to the fast gddr6 on board the series s which you get 10 gigabytes of and there's also the ability to hook up a mouse and keyboard to the titles that support it so you play many of those games not only that you could play on pc but just like you could play on pc as well though another feature that is also often overlooked on both the xbox series s and xbox series x was a piece of tech that microsoft implemented back in february this year it's called fps boost and what microsoft does is give you more fps without losing too much detail some would say oh this sounds like fsr yet fsr wasn't implemented back in february basically i would turn this on if i was playing competitive multiplayer titles and i needed the best fps while fragging though the hardware inside the series s versus the price and the value this thing's offering isn't just the reason i chose it if you're tired of paying hundreds of dollars on new release titles every month only to stop playing those games after you finish them or you get bored of them or further on top of that can't fork out the initial outlay costs for a console then the xbox all access option might be just for you for a set fee of 33 dollars a month you can get the series s instantly no costs up front and you can also gain access to hundreds of games that also include many of the latest aaa releases like microsoft flight simulator and even the upcoming age of empires 4 which i personally cannot wait for these games on their own can cost upwards of 60 or more and you can play them for free on the xbox all access pass you even gain access to ea play which is included with your game pass and gives you access to even more games like battlefield fifa need for speed and star wars now the series s and series x also have some extra cool features packed in like wireless and bluetooth support hdmi 2.1 though if you're looking for more power then there's also the series x however recently i built a pc here at tech yeah city that i'm selling on the market for a similar price to the xbox series s and so what i'm going to do is quickly compare the fps of this gaming pc that i built up against the series s and quickly see how it fares [Music] and so there we have it with this little console right here i feel like budget pcs at this price point are just hard to justify against the xbox series s at least until gpu pricing becomes more affordable and if you're in australia there's even better news and that is the xbox are teaming up with telstra with no upfront costs if you're already an existing telestric customer you can get a brand new series s console and xbox all access ultimate for 33 dollars a month over 24 months or a series x for 46 a month anyhow i'll put some links in the description below especially if you're an aussie go check it out and if you enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comments section below what do you think of the xbox series s and series x especially with the all-access option there giving you heaps of games i think the affordability is just straight up winning with the formula of the new xbox consoles i mean coupled with that game pass it just puts them in a league of their own in terms of value in 2021 compared to any other gaming device under the sun and if you've stayed this far then we're saving the best till last and
