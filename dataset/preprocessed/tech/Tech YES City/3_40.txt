what is cracker lack and tech yes citizens today we're going to be talking about graphics cards and the prices have recently been plummeting here in australia and i'm sure this trend is going to follow through with the rest of the world we're already in the usa prices are coming down on rtx 3000 series cards as well as amd 6000 series cards however you may be wishing to know is this gat aka gamer appreciation tax imposed by nvidia and amd going to come down further to the point where we will see graphics cards at msrp pricing and if prices are indeed going to come down further then when is this going to happen and answer this question for you guys in today's video has to do with two major different factors both of which go hand in hand with each other in my opinion and the first being the economics surrounding the graphics card market the supply and demand i'm going to talk to you guys about that unique situation as well as giving some accounts from retailers that i've spoken to and then the second factor has to do with the central banks aka the federal reserve and the money printers and the outlook on inflation so let's dive right into it and get you guys the juicy details are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro two links in description below welcome back to tech yes city and straight away we've got the prices that have just plummeted in the last week to the point where they're getting close to msrp in australia at least and actually the other day i saw an rtx 3060 ti on sale coming in under the msrp where in australia 3060 ti is recommended at 688 aussie dollars and this does include a 10 gst sales tax so if we took that off we'd be getting closer to around the low 600 aussie dollar mark and then of course that's getting close to that 399 usd msrp that nvidia said these cards would be starting from and we actually saw this coming in at 679 aussie dollars delivered and this is the type of scenario that i thought would happen when the price has come down they would come down hard and fast and when we look at some other gravis cards the rtx 3060 that's coming down in price it's the cheapest i've ever seen it since launch here in australia there's also the rtx 3080s 30 70s 30 70 tis and the rtx 3050 is coming close to that msrp of 429 now for some reason on the amd side of the fence it's a bit of a mixed bag with the rx 6600 and the xt for example have come down a bit in price but my favorite card out of the amd rx 6000 series is the 6700 xt and that's remaining the same price as it actually has been here for the last few months so i'm waiting for that to come down in price and that'll be more so the amd card that i'll be recommending to viewers here at the channel for a more higher end option as opposed to the nvidia side of the fence i like the 3060 ti the best and it's good to see that that price is coming down so as it stands if you've been waiting out for a long time especially through 2021 and you thought there was no hope in sight for graphics card prices to come down and you've been saving up now is a decent time to be buying a graphics card you can get your build at a lot cheaper prices than you would last year and this is actually a really weird time especially if you're building a hulk pc from scratch and the reason being is that there's actually inflation picking up on other pc components for instance ddr4 memory in australia recently went up in price and so these things behind the scenes it's important not to miss what is going on because the commodity prices are going up and of course companies that manufactured goods whether it's tech engines and cars and whatnot they all have to source materials and when the material costs go up that is then going to raise the final price that we pay at the shops so as it stands with gravis cards there is the most important thing with any market in the world and that is supply and demand and as we see with these graphics cards they have been in record supply in the amount that they've been produced yet how many of that supply has been going to gamers is a completely different question where i'd say as of recent a lot of institutional investors have stopped buying graphics cards and so when they were paying higher than msrp prices to get their daily mining profit and their fancy 200 300 now it's 400 day rois they were only looking at it from a business standpoint and they were taking that supply from the gamers who are only prepared to pay around the msrp price and so therefore there was less supply for the gamers in the end and this caused massive problems in the markets where what we saw what the gamers were being offered were prices higher than what those institutional miners were prepared to pay and so that created a problem in 2021 especially where the gaming graphics card prices were just ridiculous but what we're seeing now with ethereum is they have completed apparently a successful test on the proof of stake system and so they're going to be moving that what looks at the end of quarter two this year and so once that moves over to proof of stake there's going to be no longer a demand for mining on the ethereum network and the actual volume and liquidity in crypto especially cryptocurrencies that are mined with graphics cards there's actually not a whole lot of liquidity outside of ethereum and so when you've got all these crypto miners then that will come off ethereum i don't believe the system will be able to support all that hash rates and ultimately all that profit taking and so what we've got right now from the crypto miners especially the big miners and we're talking about the guys who'll be buying thousands of graphics cards at a time because they're the people that have really made this whole supply situation for the game is very difficult the casual miner buying five to ten gravis cards has not contributed in my opinion anywhere near to the amount of the problem as the institutional investors and their mining setups have where they were taking just thousands of cards off the market at any given time however as those thousands of cards are at risk of potentially making those investors no money and in fact we could see a scenario where proof of work becomes some profitable where it may cost more in electricity aka costs than it does in profits then that will be a catalyst for these particular people to be selling their graphics cards off to of course the gamer so this scenario will only really happen if either two things happen and that's if a theorem moves over to proof of stake or of course the crypto price of a theorem and the liquidity involved in the theorem drops massively and that does look like the first scenario that is the proof of stake is on course to take place later this year and so until that happens however the institutional investors and even the casual crypto miners they're still mining and taking profit because it actually is still quite profitable to be mining crypto daily however i think a lot of these people that were previously buying all the gravis cards for mining are actually nervous in that if they buy a graphics card at this point in time they're at heavy risk of not getting their money back so they're sitting on the sidelines and this has now alleviated a massive supply problem that the gamers were facing and so now the retailers all around the world are suddenly getting this massive supply of gaming graphics cards and what this means is of course they have to sell them but the regular gamer is not prepared to pay what the crypto miner previously was paying and so this now makes a situation where the price naturally has to come down to match what the person is going to pay for that said supply and so what we're seeing now is just naturally prices are coming down on gpus to levels where people are comfortable paying that said price though if that's not good news for gamers then the next part we're going to segue into is as we hinted at in the intro the federal reserve and the central banks they have actually stopped the money printers as of last week the federal reserve had purchased their last bond buying program on the quantitative easing system and this meant that there's basically not printing any more money to buy government bonds and other mortgage-backed securities and things like that to pump money into the system so in other words the extra liquidity from jerome powell turning on the printers has come to an end and then recently they have raised interest rates even though it's not in my opinion anywhere near enough to fight inflation i think looking back and at least what i've been studying in the last year basically all the economics and all the finance that i learned university in 2005 i feel that's irrelevant for the modern day system that they have in place with money printing and then trying to balance that out via fiscal policy and then they're also really going slow with monetary policy and that is interest rates so what we're seeing here now is a scenario where the whole economy is reliant on government spending more than it has ever been and what this means is it's a dangerous scenario when these printers turn off that means that also the government's real output and real expenditure also slows down too and now here's the problem with printing money is that it increases the prices of everything across the board and that is when you've got more money in circulation prices will naturally rise this is the true definition of inflation is increasing the money supply so what we're seeing now in this new system is that it's starting to snowball out of control if we looked at the amount of money printing that occurred in the last two years that's more than it's ever been in the history of the fiat system however you may also notice if we look at this line it looks like it's starting to go in an exponential type curve on an upward trend meaning that the governments and the central banks actually have this problem where they have to keep printing more and more money to now maintain even the same real services and product output and this comes to a real big problem where in 2022 this whole system of fiat is now at a crucial point in history and it's my personal belief that even if they hold the printers off and they raise interest rates slightly and even if they don't raise interest rates a whole lot i believe the economy is actually going to decline in real gdp in other words we're going to see a recession the longer these printers are turned off now there's also two scenarios that can happen from here and that is they can keep printers on and will go into a period of high inflation and even possibly hyperinflation if they continue that trend or if they hold the printers then of course we're going into recession but if they do what is called quantitative tightening and that is they take money out of the system and they sell the bonds on their balance sheet this could mean that there's now less liquidity in the economy and this will basically force prices of everything to come down and that includes graphics cards however there may be a few you out there that are thinking well brian they need to raise interest rates to five percent even possibly 10 to tame this inflation and this is where we're at another very crazy point in history where the debt levels obtained by the governments the debt levels contained by the average household and the credit card debt levels are at all-time highs and now traditionally debt is a deflationary instrument in an economy in that once you're paying back the money to the banks or the governments are paying back money on the bonds this is taking money out of the system so all things considered if you have the money printers turned off and then you have all this debt that needs to be paid back and then the output and the new loans that are being created are less than the old ones then this is actually deflationary in nature and so that's the biggest problem that the central banks and governments face now they're scratching their heads and like how do we deal with this problem and that is what's called the liquidity trap they don't know where to go from here and so they know that inflation causes massive price instability and instability is a key word that we're going to focus on there because what we're going to see and i believe going forward is we're going to see roller coaster on pricing one month you'll see prices go up on certain things then one month you'll see them come down however this instability causes a lot of businesses a lot of stress and a lot of uncertainty in that even if you're in a profitable industry if you've got one month where materials are out of control and you've signed certain contracts this can send certain businesses bankrupt and that's actually been happening here for example in the real estate industry in australia where we've got these uh big time builders and construction companies going bust in one of the biggest real estate booms in history so it's very crazy what inflation can do to an economy so central banks and governments ultimately know that they can't create too much inflation because it's going to cause massive problems in a given economy so now with all that information out of the way you guys may be wondering well brian all this economic jargon all this fancy stuff what does this mean for me as a gamer and buying a cheaper graphics card and this has to do with the fact that all things considered if the printers stay turned off or even if the federal reserve and other central banks decide to do what's called quantitative tightening that is take money out of the economy then graphics card prices will continue to come down but during that process you may see problems and instabilities where say for instance certain companies within the tech scene go bankrupt and then that reduces the supply now if you're reducing supply and there's a constant demand then that's actually inflationary and we can see this with governments also imposing certain restrictions and limitations in an economy this can bring about artificial inflation and we have seen this definitely when it comes to the price of oil and we've seen this with the price of gas and you guys are probably seeing it when you go to fill up your tank at the gas station how much prices have risen make no mistake about it whichever way you slice it that is artificial inflation caused by governments reducing and restricting trade so now we take the supply and demand within the graviscard industry and then we cross that with the financial outlook of the world economy in general especially with the us which seems to be leading the way in terms of policy implemented when we combine those two together at its current trajectory it looks like graphics card prices will continue to come down and i believe personally when i look at even more data in terms of different months of retail we can see that september is a lower month going forward than any of the months that are upcoming meaning that it will be retail wise the cheapest time to buy parts in september but also on that note i believe if the printers stay turned off and the interest rates keep rising then also conditions via then will make cash a little bit tighter to the point where it's more desirable and so the price of graphics cards will come down in relation to that then we've also seen the catalyst from crypto miners potentially selling off a heap of gravis cards by that time so i believe these two major factors point to graphics cards coming down i'm looking personally at september being the bottom for this however in that time you have to keep on your feet and this is one thing i've been saying around tech yes city to all my viewers always be on your feet always know what to look out for especially with that second factor and that is the central banks printing money because any given moment as we've seen in the past they can just roll up the printers again and they can roll them up very aggressively and so what this means is you can expect massive inflation and so basically if you see on the news aka the lame stream media that there's this new virus that's hit the scene and the governments have to spend more money or australia or america then starts to go to war and the printers have to roll up again that will mean that graphics card prices and a lot of other things as well will start to go up in price because they're just creating more money so with that aside i hope you guys really enjoyed today's deep dive into the graphics card situation and the pricing and my outlook as the current economic conditions stand prices will keep coming down so hopefully that has helped you guys in terms of making a purchase decision but of course always look out for the headwinds that can occur at any given stage and also coupled with the fact that the prices are a lot better now than they were last year so if you bought a graphics card right now and you've been holding out then the prices are definitely a lot cheaper especially if you're in australia they're even coming down to levels near that of msrp now you're probably wondering the last thing you may be wondering is why does australia get these cheap graphics cards why is australia getting such cheap gravis guards as opposed to the rest of the world well it has to do with australia actually having a bilateral trade agreement with china and so since we don't manufacture gravis cards in australia any product that's not manufactured in australia i believe is a tariff free or basically there's no import duties on that particular product so gravis cards coming direct from taiwan into australia and so that's why they're able to get them here a lot cheaper than other countries and so also on that note australia in itself has believe it or not the highest gdp per capita spent on enthusiast tech products in the world basically we're a bunch of hardcore geeks and hermits in australia we love our tech products and that's probably also why you may see there's a lot of aussie tech tubers in terms of australians relative to the rest of the world even though we've only got a population of 25 million we definitely have a lot of tech tubers out there in the youtube scene though the final thing to talk about of course not just the gravis cards is also the word on the street speaking to retailers and what do they think and they're seeing grav star prices calm down they're telling me wow they couldn't believe some of the drops in the pricing i believe in australia gigabyte was leading the way they wanted to get pricing and i'm not quoting the person directly but i was told the gigabyte want to get the prices just a shave over msrp and so those prices on gigabyte cards are definitely coming down and so you'll then be seeing zeus and all the others follow suit and that they'll want to compete and get their prices down so that's in australia graphics card prices looking like they're going to be at pretty decent prices and then we also if we look at other computer parts i'm being told that they're actually going up slightly in price because they don't face the same crypto market distortions that the graphics card market faced so that's in a very different market when we talk about graphics cards as opposed to ddr4 memory motherboards and also things like cpus and cpu coolers power supplies and stuff like that so i was told that they're going up in price so it may be a good time and as we said this uh two months ago maybe a good time if you see cheap prices on all the other components but gravis guards may be a good time to buy those components just have the rig sitting there when the graphics card price comes down to the right price just chuck it in you got yourself some of the best value gaming that you can get in 2022. anyway guys we can talk more about economics and how it relates to gravis card prices and other pricing in pc i find this stuff personally fascinating i love researching it i love sharing it with you guys so if you toss us a big like if you enjoyed this video then that would be much appreciated and with that aside we do have the question of the day here which comes from tallbeast and they asked brian with old hard disk drives do you have a limit date of manufacturer power on hours so basically when i come into hard drives i usually buy them in bulk from people who already test them and make sure the speeds are fine and they've got a good life left in them however in the recent video i got a heap of untested drives so when i go through them and so i'll put in a pc if i notice there's any noises or any rattling or anything that sounds really odd remove it straight away if it doesn't work i'll remove it straight away as well but then if i install it and i notice it's horrendously slow then i'll also take that out because any gaming pc i sell i use an ssd as the main drive but i use the hard drive as the backup and for game storage and if it's too slow then i will take it out of the system and then just move on to the next drive but in general i like to think that hard drives manufactured after 2012 for some reason that's just my goal uh make sure they're not before 2012 they're generally quite fast so hopefully that answers that question and with that aside if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tag yes content make sure you hit that sub ring that bell to get the content as soon as it drops and also if you want to get some behind-the-scenes footage make sure to consider becoming a member well we talked about this in december behind the scenes about the economic indicators that would have uh allowed you especially if you started offloading some of your stuff in december would have definitely saved you a pretty penny in terms of getting ready for the better deals to come anyway guys i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now [Music] different bye
