i think we might be live hopefully we're live if this works it works if it doesn't then i apologize in advance but uh welcome back to a tech yeah city live stream and this is the date this is the one sorry i haven't uh live streamed in a while it has been a long time but uh it's just been a busy lead up to christmas and we finally got a heap of stuff done and today we're gonna talk about of course the most asked question the gpu prices everything's still focused on that people want a bit of outlook on what's happening in the market right now there's actually things are pretty weird right now we're gonna talk about that weirdness starting off with this first topic but also we're gonna have huge giveaways so during this stream during the stream yeah and the chat's popping what's up guys in chat so it's going it's going well guys i hope you're staying healthy wherever you are in the world too hope you're just drinking that green tea we've got jar jar he's got green tea loaded up he's

first gets the key we're just going to be dropping those so i hope you guys have a merry christmas over this break and uh we've also yeah also behind the scenes guys we've got if you want lately we've been doing a bit of sort of been focusing more a little bit behind the scenes as well if you guys want to know a little bit more information about what's going on behind the scenes and you can join for a little dollar us a month you can join the channel i'm uploading uh some little sort of niche vlogs talking about a few different things especially if you're into flipping pcs this might be a great little chance for you to get just talk about things that we don't sort of talk about in the main videos uh and so yeah it's very cheap you also get in super chat you get access to uh like emojis while we're live streaming all that cool stuff and there's three tiers but of course i give pretty much everything on the cheapest tier and so that's an option if you guys want to join in and support tech yes city behind the scenes but let's get on to the first very controversial topic that happened so there was a person on twitter and they just started flexing and they just started flexing so hard with their mining uh mining rigs and i just they've deleted their whole twitter account now so i'm guessing something pretty serious came down from this but they just were flexing so hard and the thing that like look i don't care if these guys acquired these gpus via the means that everyone else has acquired them if they got them off ebay they got scalped or they went and lined up at best buy like everyone else at midnight but there was something clearly wrong with this video so they've deleted it but your boy here we have taken i managed to screen cap this video so we can see here this is the video right here now we can see these we stopped there we can see founders cards galore this is the thing there are so many 30 60 ti and 30 70 founders cards that was what it angered me and angered a lot of other people that this person wasn't playing fair it's that simple they weren't playing by the game there's the rules in the game and they were clearly had some inside contacts and they were ripping the system now i'd spoke i got this confirmed as well so 30 80 and 3090 fair enough it looked like nvidia was off their game in terms of what happened there they don't know what happened exactly you know bots were picking it up off the website but after that they had select distributors select people that they were sending the 30 60 ti and 30 70 founders to and those people were informed to give one founders card per customer so i just find it hard to believe that this person has a whole like whole farm full of these founders cards and was one person getting them all so that was the whole thing right they knew a contact they knew a distributor the distributor broke the rules of the engagement and they were selling them off to them at a higher price of course they were happy to buy them in bulk then they stuck them straight on their mining reasons so it's this unfair nature that the average consumer has to contend with that a lot of people are frustrated with myself included when you see these people just blatantly flexing on twitter about you know how they're basically roaring the system then of course it's going to anger a lot of people now i'm guessing that anger is the reason why they've deleted their whole twitter account because people are just frustrated so um anyway anyway it's not and so i agree i agree with you guys in the comments like you shouldn't be hunting down miners or anything like that like you know leave the guy alone but at the same time i think he's done something so dodgy in the in the pipeline that you know these cards were never intended to get to this guy in this manner so there's something really inside there there's something dodgy going on and that's the biggest graph that i and a lot of other people have they're not playing by the rules they're not playing by the game of um a fair market so and that's like and and you know if people are going to say on chat nvidia supports them i mean nvidia sells the chips like nvidia is just selling the gpus that's the main thing that they're doing they don't have control ultimately of what the distributors are doing and so this is definitely coming in the middle of the pipeline and that's i know this from locally here as well i know people that are sort of you know people that are wronging this i i know of them but they're not they're not out there flexing on twitter and sort of rubbing it in people's faces which i think this is the first mistake this guy did so it wasn't yeah it's one of those situations where i mean yeah i don't know let us know in chat what you guys think of what's going on here but i i mean i called it out on twitter i was really angry myself just the fact that there was all founders cards there and it's like man you know people had to join a raffle in australia like i'll tell you what happened in australia people had to join a raffle to even get a chance to buy a founder's card that's like there's the difference between this guy just going to the district hey y'all here's all the money bang as opposed to someone trying to get one in a raffle so really really just i don't know i i put it this way people are arguing free market you know and then there's guys on twitter i'm arguing with a guy on twitter about free market and it's like well no you can't argue elements of a free free market and then say it's a completely free market it's not a free market at all what we've got now we've got uh basically a government's pumping so much money into the system that it's inflating all these assets crypto to begin with so i'm going to ask you guys in the audience do you think for a second the crypto would be as high as it is if the governments didn't turn on the printers do you think there would be all this uh free money going into crypto if the governments didn't print all this money out and my my answer is definitely no i know crypto because because money would have more value people would be like well i'm only going to spend it on things that help me enhance my productivity my whatever my services or enhance my life and so people there wouldn't be much of a demand for crypto if the printers were off and so of course the the ultimate goal here as it comes back is to the money printer it's where that's the source of the problems here so anyway it's a it's a crazy market but we're going to talk about how crazy it's even more it's uh how crazier it's getting right this is the thing if i go on my local marketplace i'm going to call this the nintendo switch effect because this one this one's getting pretty funny uh this is the nintendo switch effect and like last year there was so many nintendo switches for sale like so many uh sorry not not for sale sorry there was so much demand for nintendo switch you couldn't buy a nintendo switch anywhere last year and now they're just everywhere for sale like this is this nintendo switch galore now and this is weird because it's coming up to christmas so you can just see how the like the market's really distorted right now to the point where it's kind of hard to believe what is going on is even real right now like it's like okay so we're seeing a reverse a potential reverse in an oversupply of products and this is like you've got to remember a whole economy especially a world economy is a slow moving thing it doesn't just change overnight but you can see like these these tides are turning where perhaps people the insiders i'm going to say the insiders perhaps they're cashing out their crypto they're cashing out their stocks and they're leaving the sucker with the bag and then we're actually going into the opposite of what we saw last year and that's what i was saying with the roller coaster ride in into like earlier this year the only way i could analyze the data was that we're going to see ups and downs and they're going to be bigger than what we've previously seen in our lives we're going to see these heavy inflationary periods heavy uh crashes it's going to be an absolute jet coaster and that's what i feel going forward just by looking at not not just by looking at a nintendo switch not by just looking at a nintendo switch that's uh that's not what's happening there but i mean we just see the effect of what happened last year with people so desperate to get some of this stuff and now it's just everywhere for sale so the nintendo switch effect that's what we call if we look at xbox series x's where i am locally right these are 750 aussie dollars for a nintendo sorry for a series x 750 aussie dollars you can pick one i pick mine up for 700 aussie dollars a series x so i got it under retail price and that was just off marketplace there's just a heap of guys now just like this guy's discounted his because he can't sell it at 970 dollars he's dropped it's 90 over retail but i'm sure some of these guys will just let them go at retail now because they're sitting on them and they can't sell them and the same is kind of with uh the same as kind of with the playstation five there's a few of these like 720 bucks now so playstation 5's coming in stock these were i mean last year you couldn't buy one i mean they're double the price and it was fifteen hundred dollars here locally for a playstation five or an xbox series x and uh yeah so um so people are asking the comments analyzing data brian by any chance are you an actuary no i mean i like one of my favorite topics from youtube sorry from university was uh statistics statistics don't lie it's that simple people can have arguments for or against the end of the number at the end of the day the numbers are never going to lie so when you look at what's happening you always correlate that to numbers and you'll see what's going on here right i get the argument people we'll move on to the next topic as well then we'll just join over to free chat with you guys because you guys got so many questions as well i mean i know some people have been wanting to join in join in on the live streams for a while i just have been a bit hiatus from live stream we're going to pick that up a little bit more as uh things wind down a little bit i mean it's just been such a busy especially z690 when that dropped it's just like there was an added on load that i had to work through but speaking of z690 we've got a cool mystery box that will open a little bit later been meaning to open that for over a month now by the way but we've got here 6900 xt's look what some of these are selling for okay so one of these sold for 1350 us that's for a 6900 xt right that's a flagship card you'd think wow okay uh i think one of these even sold like the cheapest i saw yeah twelve hundred and fifty dollars for a 6900 xt right you're thinking well that's expensive but i mean when we contrast that to what a 6700 xt selling for right so some of these are selling for if we go to completed items here uh eight hundred dollars you know the cheapest you can see one's getting picked up for us around 800 us so in contrast to what the pricing was of the 6900xt at msrp versus what the 6700xt is you see there's a much more inflated figure going on with the 6700 xt and that's just simply these prices we could literally correlate that to the profits per day if we look at this this is the mining profits 3.50 versus 2.50 and so you can see here that it's still just miners buying up these cards that's all it is you know people argue oh the scalpers are the ones ripping people off it's the uh scalpers it's the gamers as well uh it's a lot of this is miners guys the the whole the gpu shipments in total is up and the scary thing about it is is we haven't even seen entry-level cards being refreshed right we haven't even seen a gt3030 which i'd love to see nvidia pop out i'd love to see amd hurry up and pop out like a real like cheap car like 100 they perform similar to a 1050 ti that'd be absolutely amazing i think the market would go crazy for i'd go crazy for it because a lot of people just want to play simple games you know a lot of people i had a guy pick up a pc yesterday and he's like i just want to play league of legends man will this play league of legends i'm like yeah definitely man you'll get really good fps i had one guy he picked up like a gtx 660 rig and he was just messaging me over over the moon how he could get like 240 fps in league of legends and i'm like well okay i didn't know a gtx 660 could get 240 fps in league of legends but that's all people want to get and they're not prepared to pay more for it then there should be like a newer gpu that satisfies that demand because there's a huge demand for it so anyway we're seeing that the miners are still just buying up a lot of these cards miners just want to get cards whenever they reach a certain price i'd say it's around 200 days return on investment when it reaches that the miners just keep buying up the cards keeping the prices over inflated so tweak town did an article i think anthony was like praising this guy um praising this guy for buying up all the gpus and like anthony what are you doing man you should be like should be like uh at least sort of a little bit disappointed that this is ruining the whole pc gaming industry anyway let's talk about ethereum blake another thing is too here's another indicator that you guys might want to look at is that the volatility volatility is picking up now you can see here it's getting more wild more wild and we'll point to some other indicators that crypto's really it hasn't dropped as fast as i would hope it would but it's definitely reaching a peak the momentum has slowed down drastically on crypto and uh this is in aussie dollars we'll try and put it in usd so it's a little bit easier for you guys to uh take a look sorry got jar jar i need a green tea ah much better so jar jar the headline oh the great cover-up so the headline was we we covered it up before so like we covered that before the great the guy was just like you know he was this guy so we're quickly interlude sorry to answer the questions quickly so what happened with the cover-up was the guy just quickly deleted his twitter account he was saying like he was buying them up from multiple little retailers like he was he was getting these founders cards like an honest customer was you know he was just buying them up even though they were sold out in like two minutes at every place you went to so somehow this guy on twitter that was flexing with their gpus uh we got the uh tweet down article here so this person was flexing with all their founders gpus somehow this person had a teleporting machine he had superman speed he could run into all the best buyers at the same time and he could buy up all the founders edition cards before anyone else could that's what his argument was and of course i called him out on twitter and that was you know and then he still like i mean i think a lot of people called him out his reply section was insane i i mean at the same time like do you feel sorry for the guy well at the same time if you're gonna do something dodgy you shouldn't be flexing about it that's all that's like i think read the room is a big thing and that's like a big thing going into i mean with my deals hunting when i always look at you guys like not getting scammed and stuff always try to read the room as well because a few people on discord they've been getting scammed but speaking of not getting scammed brocky thoughts donates 20 aussie dollars thank you very much and he says merry christmas to you at tech yes hope the new year gets better for us all thank you my man i hope you are staying healthy that's the most important thing um i mean 2021's been a weird year it's been the weirdest year of all it's even weirder than 2020 to be honest this has been such a weird year things have been um i mean there's things that like you could talk about and probably get you know the youtube filter kind of thing so kind of like i guess there's just so many weird things going on this year that you kind of just scratch your head and you're like uh yeah i'm kind of not going to believe that so but other than that the most important thing you can do guys as always drink green tea you should be waking up drinking a green tea lunch time drinking a green tea feeling the flow keeping yourself as healthy as possible and that's all you can do going forward stay healthy stay positive and also stay laughing so if you laugh it's good for you so hopefully we can provide a few lulls later on in the stream anyway this is the price of crypto look at that peak in may right that was your even though people talk about okay the price was higher here this was actually the peak mining profitability for miners so here we go right here this was the peak in may so if we contrast that to the ethereum difficulty which we've got up here so this was when in may you can see that the difficulty is much much higher now than it was in may right so the price was relatively similar in may than it was to now but the difficulty was a lot less so miners were making a lot more money back in may than they were now so that sort of momentum is dropping off a lot more people are just dropping gpus they're buying all these gpus up they're buying them up all here for mining it was a bit of a dip and we did see the prices come down temporarily we saw the prices of graphics cards come down a bit miners got a bit nervous here so all it took was a moment of profits dropping and a bit of a scare for people to stop buying gpus for the miners to have a pause and that was when gpus were a lot cheaper i mean i saw 6 700 xt's going locally here for around 850 aussie so about 600 us so they were priced a lot cheaper gamers were starting to pick them up so if we now since the difficulty is so much higher if the price even drops say 25 percent miners might start getting a bit more nervous with their investments so that's uh one thing to look out for is i think we've reached this is like the peak of peaks right now if it goes up anymore oh man i just think we're in for a massive roller coaster anyway so stay tuned don't worry the prices haven't really risen from may it's still a bad situation but i don't think it's going to get any worse in terms of gpu prices that's all so the difficulty is just loading up here people want those juicy ethereum profits but the more people to get in on the more it's going to go down so it's its own worst enemy and in time it'll defeat itself so gamers don't worry be patient still stay patient so we got here five donation from digital demonic davros thank you very much uh 6600 xt go for 250 more than my aurus 5700 xt bought mid last year for 750 aed now uh low end is flagship prices so i think the is the 6600 xt i think you can get it a lot cheaper than the 5700 xt and also uh thanks for the donation my man uh we got this guy i've seen people sell on 5700 xt's this is how ridiculous they are you can see these cards right here people are picking them up and they're p and they're paying more than a 6700 xt which in itself is proof that miners are paying more money for gpus no game is buying a 5700 xt for this price absolutely none because you can get a 6700 xt which is better uses less power for gaming for cheaper so you can see that the hash rates on this is better so miners are paying more money for it so that's all it is plain and simple so yeah i mean if you've got a 5700 xt just sell it grab a 6 600 xd and pocket the difference that's a that's an easy one i mean that's what i'd be doing personally so and then of course donate five bucks to take your city easy thunder turbine 88 another donation thanks brother have a merry christmas bro uh hopefully you can see your son hope you're holding up again thanks yeah so that's going into another green tea thanks for the donation my man but uh yeah that's the that's my biggest drag right i haven't seen my son for two years now very uh very emotional uh it's it sucks because all i want to do is see myself it's like my top priority you know it gives me passion it gives me energy for everything else in life but i i talk to him every single day i send him as soon as i wake up i'm sending him messages everything we chat on a regular basis that's keeping me going i mean if i couldn't chat to him or talk to him i wouldn't be making youtube videos it's that simple i'd be in distraught but you know trying to get through this i'm trying the first available chance i get to go to japan i'm going to go see my boy as well as make awesome content when we're over there for you guys and it's just that whole element of everything being shut down and locked down that's annoying me it's annoying a lot of people because you're seeing that certain types of people we're getting into almost like it's like a two-tier society here we've got the elites that travel anywhere they want do what they want uh ignore all these restrictions and they can fly anywhere they don't care the rules don't apply to them and then your citizens second class citizens like me and most of you probably say most of you guys out there we have to follow a different set of rules and it's it's just unfair and so that's one thing i've been sort of getting really i mean a lot of people are getting frustrated with this and so yeah me seeing my son hopefully that happens soon and sooner than later i've been really missing missing him a lot thank you thank you guys as well for caring about that that makes me a lot uh happy as well so you guys show us that love so actually we've got a um there's something else we're going to pull up as well and that was a quick second key giveaway for windows 10. there we go bang we've done two of them we've got eight more to go during this live stream eight more keys to give away eight more keys so yeah and brocky you feel the pain as well yeah it's it's cool man like join our discord we can chat you know everyone can hang out but uh now that's kind of like the topics that we wanted to talk about today with uh what's going on with prices so now we can look at when are prices potentially going to come down well all this is is all it is right now we're seeing nintendo switches up for sale gaming pcs if you are buying a gaming pc right we'll get over the big screen here gaming pcs what i've noticed locally here is that a lot of people are getting strapped for cash this is what's happening locally so i've got budget low end bangers for instance those untested graphics cards the ones that worked and i tested and stress test and change the thermal paste all that good stuff i've flipped them all they're all gone the low end is just absolutely on fire but then like i've had like two messages on my higher end stuff so the higher end stuff has just come to a complete standstill even though i'm offering like pretty like competitive prices on my rtx 2060 system or whatnot the prices are just at a complete standstill people just aren't budging they just they're strapped for cash so what we're seeing here is a complete two-tiered like everything's two-tiered it's almost like uh you know your economy's two-tiered as well you've got those who are benefiting greatly from what's going on and it seems to favor already those who were bigger going into this to begin with and then you've got the the middle class lower class most of us guys we're suffering we're starting to suffer more and so for me i'm i'm just uh what i'm doing is i'm just rolling with the punches low end baby living the potato dream hooking people up cheap rigs and they're just moving man they're moving like bang bang bang one out of the other but if you try to sell a high-end rig like i had guys message me they're like bro i'm trying to get rid of my 800 system and it's just not moving you know what what do you suggest what do you what do you suggest i do and i i just said to him straight up i'm like brother like i'm not moving my high end rig as well well i can't really give you advice so so sometimes locally where you're at it's just it's a it can suck so if you're coming into that struggle especially if you i mean so in other words if you're cashed up right now if you're not into if for instance if you're not into um say for instance you're not into a just wait we just got to quickly pull up something else in chat there's another bang another windows 10 11 key into the wild that's that one out she goes out she goes fellas that's the third key down we're gonna given away more of those during this live stream so stay tuned and then uh so back to the pc thing right so if you're cashed up right now as long as you're not wanting to get a graphics card you can buy so much other stuff things are actually getting cheaper it's just the graphics cards that's all it is the graphics cards is on its own pedestal right now and i believe i i think someone was pointing me towards a a 12 700 k at micro center i believe i saw some deal where this was going for 300 like the bread this is pretty much a flagship cpu when you think about it because it's almost like a shampoo time two dollar donation thanks brother called in sick today and a live stream that's it perfect timing thanks for the donation brother thanks for the donation 300 for a flagship cpu i mean you're only missing four little e cores but let's be honest like who cares about the four e cores 12 700 k is definitely where it's at for 300 bucks what is going on this cpu just launched this has never happened in the history of tech you've never seen such a desirable product become so cheap this doesn't make any sense what this is like i meant i'm loving i'm loving this price but that's a buyer's market right there that's a buyer's market that's cpu so it's like okay what do you do no one's buying it that's what it means not as many people are buying it as they anticipated that's what that means that's what that price right there means want a nintendo switch they're everywhere want a series x at market price they're coming on too want an xbox series x hey let's have a look at xbox series x yes hey do i let's do it sorry i just had to laugh for a second xbox series s 250 aussie dolls i might even go pick that up let's have a look how much that is 250 aussie dollars this guy's selling an xbox series s this is the i'm pretty sure that's that's i got a double chat this is a series s right yeah series s or is it a one nah it's got to be a one s okay here's he's click baiting he's click baiting i mean get a series s though okay i'm not clicking on that i'm not clicking on that but me okay series s 390 aussie dollars you can get one for 277 usd [Music] 270 us bucks to play games very very comfortably there's like okay the market in ways is fine that's all i'm gonna say it's not the end of the world fellas don't worry if you cannot get a gpu right now the miners will have their day there will be the day of reckoning just like this difficulty chart points right here the miners were loving it the miners were loving it now there's the next wave this is the second wave i would call this the sucker wave the sucker wave has come in and they're buying up all the first wave it's almost like the same thing has gone on here right that same line has gone up at the same momentum so we've got here the sec the second lot is paying for the first lots profits now after this we need a third wave to come in so unless uh jerome powell decides to ramp up the printers again which they've actually indicated that they're going to be doing the opposite they're indicated that they're going to be doing the opposite oh someone's in chat like oh man oh i really want a windows 10 key okay brother okay someone really wants one boom there it is okay there's the next one someone really wanted one okay i really want one man you've got to burn it up straight away so like that's like a it's like a race right when i drop these keys you better be on the activation thing ready to copy paste and bang it in and activate before everyone else does so that's why that's just the life giveaway for that um so we got here the second wave buying off the first wave the thing is though the printers are rolling down their signal the printers are coming they're rolling down the printers they're potentially raising interest rates so that news right there is tapering that means the easy money is going to be drying up and when that happens do you think this third wave that people are predicting is going to come in if that third wave does then so be it but i don't i don't think it will now i think we've reached peak so stay strong fellas look at all the other market indicators intel can't even sell what is a and the 12th generation is really good i was impressed with what intel did with 12th gen very good job and if they if they can't even sell these things 300 bucks they've got to discount them because it's obviously not going at 450 is it nintendo switch series s playstation 5. all these things are going starting to go cheap man don't worry hold the line if you've been waiting to get your good gaming experience been waiting to get your fantastic gaming experience it's already coming so it's just the gpus just these ones here people are going crazy over it they're loading up they're borrowing to the hilt they're like look please pop a bank borrow me more money so i can buy more cryptocurrency and that's what you call a bubble so and then we've got inflation now inflation we can talk about that pretty soon if you guys want to go on that tangent but what i wanted to point to was the fact that just hold out for now get yourself a second hand two gigabyte graphics card get yourself an xbox series x just hold it out that's all you got to do brothers and then we're going to see fireworks that's what i think fireworks is slowly coming on it's slowly coming on and another thing is too you might think what's what's this up here what's what's going on here uh we're doing a video very soon you guys are probably gonna love this video so i think gamers nexus did a video on the aurora amd i think he did it on horizon system and he said it absolutely sucked so during black friday sales in australia i picked up a 30 80 ti system 3080 ti system with uh it's a whole system for 2066 usd it was like an aurora system and this was uh this has a i5 eleven four hundred f sixteen gigabytes of ram nvme ssd i think it's i think it's a 850 watt power supply i gotta check anyway so we're going to do that whole experience check out if this dell aurora on the intel sides any good and then after that i'm going to be checking out if you get it and it kind of sucks what can you do to make it awesome and what amount of money would you need to spend on it to make it awesome and would it come under a high-end gaming pc so the aurora is i picked that up for around yeah 2 900 on the black friday sale i picked that one up so i was like i'm keen to make some content but at the same time i want to see if i can flip it and make a quick buck on it too not gonna lie that's straight up uh brocky's thoughts another five dollars aussie thank you for the donation i meant i wonder if organized crime buys gpus and goes into mining as a way to launch money who knows man who knows um all i can say is there would be a lot of dodgy dodgy stuff going on in the space of crypto man because no one really talks about like the fact that you can mine ethereum and then you can buy whatever coins you want right so you can buy the complete privacy coins and you can cash those coins out so yeah people can say oh the bitcoin the people aren't laundering bitcoin well they can just buy other cryptos that they can launder and then sell them because they're complete private they're completely private so you're seeing there that there's a whole market of these completely private uh cryptocurrencies i think monero's one i think there's another one as well uh zen cash was one that was one that i used to be into when i had all that experience with mining and stuff like that um i still got some money in my crypto account actually from way back i haven't even checked it i think i might have had like point one of a bitcoin or something in there i'd have to pull up that wallet somewhere but and hopefully i can sell it and then help this uh price drop off uh and we've got whales gaming with a five uh pound donation thank you brother uh what do you think will happen with the amd cpus looking for a drop on prices to compete with intel we can check right now i mean uh you know i hear people complaining about the i think i think there was a i think the reason amd cpus might be high right now is because there was this rap term there was again another cryptocurrency that came out and there's no like what is the argument for for mining on a cpu like a gpu is way better and then the anti-asic stuff that's the gpu argument so the cpu argument just takes the cake and for me it's just like okay what what kind of a joke is this so but sure enough there's going to be people that buy this buy the gear mine the crypto don't sell the crypto because they think the crypto is going to the moon but then when it crashes they're like oh i wasted all that money in the meantime there's people pumping up that crypto because they want you to get into their crypto buy the hardware what not so i don't know at the moment man crypto just seems so and i'm going to say the word useless i don't know if you guys have tried ethereum i have tried a theorem i really back i tried to see what it was all about and it was i think it was like i think now it's 50 or something to do a transaction a simple transaction cost you 50 and then you've got to wait you've got to wait like a minute and this is something that's been six years in the making sure the concept's great but for six years in the making the uh the experience is almost i would compare i would compare it to that of uh what's that game that never released that space one um you know remember and this is the thing they were hyping that game you guys spay what's the space one let me know in chat there's that's i even forgot the name of it because it was that long ago and they were hyping it out um they were hyping it up the space game remember yeah someone in chattel someone in chat will tell me it the um star citizen that's the one yeah star so star citizen there's the one i'm gonna call like some of these cryptos man almost like star citizen they're going to keep promising the world over promising and under delivering in the case of star citizen under-delivered so hard they just had a broken game and so many people lost their money so thanks guys yeah star star citizen that's the one i wonder what's i wonder what's so anyway we're back sorry we'll answer the ryzen 5 question and we also got another super chat we'll get on to that one next um sorry we'll get on to we'll finish the rising question i'll get on that next one for you so ryzen you can get this off aliexpress for still a decent price right if you want a ryzen 5 if you desperately want to get a 6 12 thread amd cpu you get one for 190 bucks the problem is the problem is is that intel is literally just smashing the pants off them you can get 11 400 f which 167 bucks 11 400 f so it's cheaper it's better there's no point in getting a ryzen 5 3600 now 10 400 f which i liked the 10 400 f i remember i copped a lot of hate for saying this is a good cpu sure at the time the ryzen 5 3600 might have been slightly better value but just watch this cpu now it's 140 bucks easy no brainer save yourself 50 dollars so right now intel is clobbering amd for value for the real gamer and if you want to go 10 100 f you got this for 85 bucks there it is so yeah in terms of ryzen cpus and what's going on and what how amd's gonna have to respond to that well i don't think they need to respond right now because of some uh cryptocurrency where people are buying up amd cpus or i mean i don't know what what's going on with their silicon perhaps their i mean the 5600x so this is down like this is 290 so it's as much as a it's as much right now as a 3600 that makes no sense the 3600 is more expensive so we're i mean we're on live stream so just just be sure like this is what you're seeing is what you get right there's no there's no hiding anything man we're just doing a bit of research on the live stream raptor room prices raptor i remember this one what happened with this one i was watching this what happened with wrapped room because this one is your research right here okay let's have a look is this one being held up by phony money no this one's dropped okay so the whole amd cpu craze should not really be a thing people shouldn't be buying like as this goes down and down and judging by the trading volume this is almost like a fake craze it was like a fad this might have been a fad 120 grand in trading volume so as soon as people are mining this crypto with their cpus and they're selling it the market just won't be able to absorb it so okay so in terms of amd yeah they're going to have to start competing because their little rap durham outlet might be seeing that people bought all these amd cpus to mine on them and then they're going to be re-flipping them on the market so then we can go to ebay we do a little bit of a detective on the live stream here and we'll answer that five dollar question thank you uh drifters smorgasbord is twelve hundred dollars too much for a zeus 6800 xt tough yeah especially when you get the uh we're looking on ebay before you could get the um 6900 xt for 1250 so i would just go with that right see miners are not going to care about a 68 from what i remember i think the 6800 xt has the same hash rates as a 6900 xt correct me if i'm wrong as well as a 6800 they should all share similar hash rates at least when i did my review i checked that out do correct correct me in uh comments if i'm wrong there but you should be able to see yeah as identified my man they're going for the same price i mean i've shown you guys that miners are buying these cards who in their right mind would pay more for a 6800 25 more than a 6800 xt unless they didn't care because they provided the same return on investment only a miner would so you've got here the situation where they're all going at the same price that's what i thought i didn't check this out until now but they're all going for the same price 6900 xt 6800 xds and 6800 so if you wanted to get a 6800 xt you're better off just buying a 6900 xt if you're a gamer and the reason being is because you might be able to pick up one for 13.50 or pick up one i mean i'm not i wouldn't pay these prices i would not go out and buy a 6900 xt for 250 bucks but even then it's coming isn't it like what was what did it msrp out again i just got to check that out 6900xt msrp or what did amd say they wanted this thing so 999 dollars i mean yeah it's a big leap over the 6800 xt but that price differential isn't showing up on ebay so you're not paying like if you if you paid 1250 for it like i think one dude you got one for 12.50 so if you sit there and you want to watch ebay that's pretty good deal like it's not bad 25 premium considering miners are still chopping up these graphics cards left right and center that's not too bad so there's that option straight up so there it is so bang what do you know guys another giveaway during the tech yes giveaway stream that is what's happening we got five more keys left actually it might uh you got to burn these up straight away too you got to burn these up straight away they're going they're going and we're also going to start giving away azeroth's giving away a z590

be doing this man we're gonna be doing this we're gonna be chatting maybe chat chattaroo so this is that time where i want you guys to ask me anything so we're gonna be moving over got the setup we're ready to go there's no problems with this live stream too i don't think we've come into any problems which is like the first perfect live stream we've done no technical difficulties is windows 11 worth it windows 11. um it's annoying because they've i don't know what microsoft did here right there's better hdr support there's better hdr support in windows 11. other than that i mean it looks better to me personally the the ui looks better it looks cleaner it looks more modern but then there's the functionality that they just quite simply stuffed up oh so with the giveaway so okay quickly people ask me how do i enter the giveaway so yesterday's giveaway is in that video for the pc i'll link it after the live stream that's for the whole pc you just gotta watch that video and it's easy to enter today's giveaways i'm going to be drawing them out soon so we got the keyboard we've got i'm still thinking of how i give away the keyboard the mouse and the hoodie and the motherboard so there's four prizes to be won and i haven't thought that far ahead so this giveaway is going to be completely live completely spontaneous and i want to let you guys how should i give away these four items i think i asked we do a round robin with questions and the first person to get the answer wins i think that's how we did it last time it worked out pretty well you just got a comment so if you win these four items coming up then make sure you just comment if you're the winner and i'll get back to you in the comments section and i'll reply and then we go from there so uh what's all the jazz music it's just live stream we're just live streaming we've got the jazz music on in the background just relax and that's the most that's the most important thing so windows 11 it's a love-hate relationship it's a love-hate relationship for me personally so this is what it is with windows 11. i think windows 10 does functionality better so for me personally like drag and drop works way better on windows 10 right you dr you go down you want to drag something from the taskbar that works in windows 10 they took it away on windows 11 at least this update that i'm on now um windows 11 there's also like other little bugs where um for instance i forgot like i've come into a few bugs and they're just really annoying so it's still buggy still bad oh we got a donation as well for cody robinson 799 aussie amen merry christmas on the gold coast i saw your listings on facebook the other week love the work man thank you very much thanks for the donation so yeah we're always hustling man whatever you guys see in the videos that's real there's nothing i don't cover anything up at tech yeah city where you know and lately i've been getting way more in to the used parts the used hustle and i am absolutely loving it i'm getting back to my grassroots again i i just i mean i had a lot of down time there was a lot of down time and you guys probably know the feeling especially in 2021 there's just like a down okay so people want windows keys all right get ready we're going to be dropping another one to get ready for the windows keys we'll get the windows keys out of the way first we'll get the windows keys out of the way first and then we'll get on to the other three prizes and then we'll just talk if we join in join in fellas join in play down under men at work yeah i will i wish i could the problem is the stream will just get shut down that's youtube you can't play any copyrighted music so that's kind of that's kind of sucks so is is the music good though if it's too loud i can turn it down a little bit too so that's fine um my gtx 970 died can i do editing work on i7 7700k oh that's rough man if you're in premiere pro that's going to be rough but ultimately we'll get back to windows 11 versus windows 10. windows 10 i'm thinking of going back to windows 10 just because the functionality ultimately it works a bit better i just think windows 11 they needed to polish it more they they just needed to not take away like have you guys tried print screen in windows 11 it absolutely sucks now it just opens the snipping tool for you it's like no i want like there should be a choice in windows 11. if you're going to change something at least give people the choice to say hey i want windows 11 to work like the old print screen or the new one when i press print screen just open snipping tool now like what that just takes me extra time because i've got the whole frame i want to copy it in to whatever photoshop or whatever i'm doing so print screen is just crap in windows 11. that's one thing yeah sorry so there's two things i really don't like about windows 11. taskbar sucks and the print screen button absolutely sucks so why do they ruin these things that's what i don't know that's why i just don't know who asked for print screen to become a snipping tool shortcut like is there anyone out there that did because i didn't who asked to take away like take away a feature like drag and drop through taskbar who asked people to take that away so these things are frustrating other than that great great ui i mean it looks great looks polished looks very aesthetic i mean you need it and the sad thing is you need it for 12th gen too for the for the advantages so if you're on 12th gen you need to use this so it's like what what are they doing and then there's another thing as well we'll talk about i was going to make it in a separate video but if you've got gpu scheduling on turn that off you're just going to potentially crash your system i've got 20 donation from boom as well thank you so much have you tried using tesla gpu oh and merry christmas merry christmas to you guys out there everyone thanks for the donation and have i tried using a tesla yet i i've used quadros i don't think we've tried a tesla yet i've been on the lookout for one and i think it's only a matter of time before i do find one i actually haven't come into a tesla yet because i think the guys that come into them who if they were to sell them to me i think they get too much from on ebay and at least that's why i haven't really got a lot of quadros as well because on ebay people i think it's a lot of apple people still love those older especially older teslas and older quadros i think people using hackintoshes love those cards so i i think don't i if memory serves me right i think that's what that why they're still relatively high priced as opposed to going out and getting some gtx 680 or 670 and still rocking it hard on performance mode for tonight so um you know performance mode fortnight man that that's a that's a good selling point yeah performance mode the best thing to ever happen to potatoes you want a tesla they're cheap in taiwan and take your city marco how you doing man marco's been dry he's in the chat marco when we get back to i've been this is another thing about the whole cv i'm just going to call it cv do the whole thing about cv i can't i haven't been able to go to taiwan they've canceled computex two years in a row now and computex is like the funnest event for tech enthusiasts it is like the grand daddy the the king the queen combined into one wait no that just sounds weird i'm not this it's just it's it's the it's the big one it's the big one it's the big one and i've have i've missed out for two years because when we go to taiwan me and marco we do use pc parts hunts and they're absolutely awesome i've been meaning i want to do an asia tour as well like looking for i really want to do an asian tour i want to go to singapore i want to do india i want to do hong kong uh you know south korea all these asian countries japan like these are all on my list i just want to go through and just go pc parts hunting um malaysia philippines you name it let's go there let's parts hunt because people are telling me from all their countries they're like man i can't get deals like you prime how do you get the deals all the time and so it's like i was saying in the used parts on this month max out the edgy tab fellas the agility max it out that's what you're gonna be doing maxing out the agility tab that's the only thing that's the only thing i can really uh give you in terms of advice so um yeah but in windows 11 lately they've been pushing it hard there's still one thing i was going to do another video on windows 11 for you guys because you guys are still um talking about that so we've also what's the status on ethereum switching for proof of stake to proof of work no idea man look as far as i'm concerned ethereum is just one big massive load of you know what they just keep saying this and that if they really wanted a cryptocurrency that was functional and worked a lot better they would change to proof of stake they would do that no but there's some there's some reason why the ethereum they want to keep it on proof of work and so that's when i like i get suspicious of all these things i'm not going to just go on live stream and just just blatantly put things out there and what i'm thinking because you've got to be careful what you say but there's something going on there with this whole proof-of-stake delay because it's in ethereum's best interest as a cryptocurrency going forward to move over to proof of stake it's in their best interest though if they want the best functional cryptocurrency out there on the market so anyhow that's uh that's that one out of the way we gotta i wanna get back to the positive positive vibes on this live stream as well so um uh hey man i saw your channel a few weeks ago so interesting thanks brother so i'm going down a different route now i want to be going into the hardcore i wanna get my hands dirty like literally i want to get my hands dirty now and that's why i've been liking the dumpsters and uh in outside in ethers star citizen yeah that's it f is if you guys are pc gamers f is literally becoming the star citizen of the cryptocurrency world and it's the number two cryptocurrency like that's what it is like this this project that's been promised to be so great for so long and then i remember i jumped on it to do a transaction they wanted 50 bucks i was testing it out i was like what's going on here is this for real i mean if you're on ethereum and you want to vouch for how good it is are you vouching for like one minute transaction times six years after it's been developed so it's one of those things where yeah i mean like if you're making money on it good on you like if you're making money off crypto i have no like i'm not i don't care like people sort of attack me like man i'm feeding my family off this i'm loving it it's like brother i wish you well like good luck but in terms of a merit of a tri a proper true functioning economy this thing ain't working right this thing ain't working by the rules let me tell you so um okay so we got pakistan as well uh man uh yeah like pakistan i'll go to india first just see what india is like yes there's one day i want to go to india see what india is like and then if pakistan's good we'll head up there as well um so that's the asian tour man one day i'm fingers crossed one day hey i'm still locked up in a room for what it is and uh in australia they've definitely teared it off so you've got two classes of citizen nowadays so there's that one going on man star citizen is playable at the moment in alpha 3.15.1 still only one system though fun to play when it works when it works brother i mean this is how many years on how many years on has star citizen been in in operation i mean it's just it's getting ridiculous man they especially the amount of money they got paid to develop this game they got given a lot of money to develop star citizen and i think what they needed to do was they initially was star citizen they took on too much they bit off more than they can chew they said look we're gonna have the game that does everything and it's like well maybe you should have just focused on having like a fps style first open the fps world up get that engine running right and then open up other things like space sim so if they if they if they'd approached it a lot better i think they would have had a lot more success instead they took on too much and they just sucked a lot of money out and the game's like i don't know man i don't no one's ever talked to me about star citizen except me bringing it up now as to what kind of ethereum is to the to just try brian just try it man age of empires four okay let's talk about a game that is uh kevin burnell five dollars late to the party cheers to all thanks for the five dollar donation brother i hope you have a merry christmas uh let's talk about a game that works really well age of empires four lovely game absolutely loving it and you know truth true story i had to uninstall age of empires four i had to just completely uninstall it you know the reason why i had to uninstall it was because it was just affecting the hustle it was affecting everything like i woke up like i was playing an age of embarrassed four and all of a sudden i look out of the window and the sun's coming up and i'm like whoa i've been playing like i didn't notice the time i did an all nighter playing uh age of empire and this happened three times three times i was up two and i'm like nah that's it this is so age of empires 4 i'm calling it guys best game of 2021 that's mine but i'm biased i love rts but i had to uninstall guys and if you are having trouble playing games where you get too addicted to them that's my achilles heel right achilles heel is that i can get addicted to really good pc games um i get really addicted to it and so i have to uninstall that's my achilles heel it's the answer so the problem is i can get addicted to a really good pc game answer is to uninstall and that put it this way the last game that i had to uninstall well i didn't notice the boulder's gate 3 was the last one but i'm waiting i don't know if they've released the next three chapters yet but boulder's gate three was also really good so they were my two favorite games recently of course uh we've got donations coming in two guys we'll we'll answer them quickly so any jobs going i'll come work for you for free on my days off if i can build some pcs love doing custom builds brocky's thoughts okay where are you at dude if you're out locally yeah like swing me an email and um if you wanna yeah just come to the studio and i mean i do have a few custom builds you can try like do build up uh that'd be awesome yeah sure send me an email love to love to hang out matthew west with a five dollar aussie dollar donation how's the stinger go mate any issues since only okay stinger so the car i got last year was a stinger best car period like for what i do right for what i do i'm gonna i'm gonna put listen i know there's gonna be like subaru fanboys there's gonna be toyota fan but all the fanboys can be out there but i think car lovers all respect each other car enthusiasts all like they're all like yo respect you respect your respect stinger let's talk about why the sting is so good first point we'll talk about the issue okay so one issue with the stinger is that it's got this problem where you open the boot like the automatic opening thing and then it'll just like close suddenly it's like a bug it happens once every say 10 times you're opening the boot it'll open and then it'll automatically decide to close itself i don't know why that happens that's my only gripe with it other than that it's been going perfectly but the stinger um yeah for the yeah so the best for the money not period not a period bro for what i do use is like if what i do it's the best car out there period for what i do so that's that's completely subjective for the money it's also amazing too but um the gear stinger right it's big so i can fit so many used pc parts in there that was the first thing i was looking for when i was going to buy a car is it big can i fit all my gear and they and people are like man that's a brand new car you're putting used pc parts in there and i said to myself look i've hustled that hard i want a nice car second thing is i'm not going to change who i am just because we've got this nice stinger i ain't going to stop hustling pc parts man that's the reason why i got the car in the first place that's like turning your back on your grassroots you never do it i mean some people do it but i'm not doing it and so the kia stinger huge car it's big my neighbor had a toyota camry and he was like yo you got you got this thing is big man i'm like yeah i love it that's why i got it big so we can fit all the used parts in there first point fit all the used parts absolutely amazing second point is this thing is quick this thing can go hard man the stinger is a fast car it's like just bang you put your foot down that thing is cracking it's poppa lopping brothers that's what i love about sting it's got that raw and the third point is the exhaust the exhaust note sounds amazing on it i love the exhaust note love what they've done and then we got the fourth point fourth point is the thing just looks so good it is a sexy car it is an extremely sexy car gt stinger yeah i even put like these um undercover thing like a little body kit kind of thing on mine so it just yeah the the kia stinger is it man it's my favorite car and i've driven a lot of cars i've driven a 35 gtr and that's like more cockpit like if you want like an airplane sort of racer boy experience that's going to be a 34 35 gdr i haven't driven an audi r8 so if you've driven an r8 let me know how it is but there's a few cars like this thing is just amazing comfortable so comfortable so good looking so nice i love it so that was the stinger man that was a stinger so we're going on to car talk now we should get back to a little bit about tech anything else let's just any any conversation we're here guys this is the tech yes city live stream you guys want to hang out and chat so let's do it brothers put a huge turbo on it yeah well you avoid the warranty so if you put a huge turbo on it the thing has got seven year warranty so i can just thrash this thing for seven years and if it breaks down they're fixing it man so that's the beauty of the seven year warranty there's just no the peace of mind is there i don't have to worry so that's uh that's the one there so the kia carnival oh man so you guys are just going off on on cars sorry but yeah my car history i've got a lot of jdm it's funny man like the funniest thing about cars right now is how expensive jdm cars from when we're like young and kids from when we're teenagers all those cars are worth so much money especially the 32 gtr now it's worth so much money like if we go on like um we'll pull it up here so i think if we go like on car sales or something maybe like you'll see how much these are and they're ridiculously expensive too so nissan nice i think in the us people say it's nissan nissan nissan okay any location let's have it let's have a look how much is a gtr gonna set you back 260 grand dang man okay 2008's coming in with the clutch so 2008 is coming in clutch we've beaten for cheaper price tag um i'm looking for ah did they do it skyline no we're looking at the wrong one i think they they call it sky they call the gdr the gdr and then they call the skyline the skyline the skyline gtr yeah so there it is there 125 grand wow for 32. you know five years ago this is like 20 grand i got five dollar donation from marcus fish too brother thank you so much merry christmas to you brian thanks for the ongoing inspiration i just sold my 80 second flipped pc got started after watching you a few years ago awesome to hear brother this is what it's all about love hearing you guys making it for yourselves right you see all these youtubers like even me i'm guilty of it we get these nice things sent in but i'm showing you guys on this channel if you hustle hard enough you can just get that stuff as well you're making value you're making a service this is like stuff a lot of people just don't know how to build a pc flat out they don't know what value is and they're sick of going out to a retailer and getting completely ripped off you're the middleman you can come in and provide that good service that good value for that end user i do it a lot and that's one thing that i actively partake in and i love seeing you guys hustle as well and you know buy yourself some nice things buying yourself something buying yourself can't really buy a duty i don't think you'll buy a gdr um 32 anytime soon that's probably not it's probably not coming along but uh these the skylines one yeah these cars were like in japan these cars were like 10 grand back when i i got an fd let's check out an fd in japan i picked up an fd rx7 i think it was an fd series six picked it up for like in aussie dollars us dollars us dollars 2 800 this was back in 2008. i picked up a mazda [Music] what's with this site man come on all models uh rx7fd rx7 rx7 was it rx7 yeah that's the one there i picked one up for 2 800 bucks now look at the price 80 grand man i'm investing in the wrong thing here i should have just been investing in jdm cars wow look at the prices of these things the fd even you're going to be kidding me you gotta be kidding me man that's it like you know these things these things were like we call these dangers and if you guys in australia know what a danger is a danger is a pile of this thing here like what it's going for 62 000 wow people must really want to collect cars because this thing was renowned for being a total sack wow yeah like it you know who knows like why but that's what i'm saying why would you go out and buy an fd for 89 grand this is what i think this is where we're ultimately going with the cars why would you go and pay 89 grand for this when you get a stinger for 60 or 50 you know what i mean like i just don't know like i like trust me when i say i've driven an fd i've driven a stinger there is no comparison absolutely none unless you like having to go to the chiropractor getting your back popped in every couple of weeks uh having a rotary that breaks down on you consistently as well the only consistent thing about an fd is that a rotor will break down on you and i'm surprised this one had 190 000 case i don't know how he made he must have rebuilt the engine like four or five times and then i just don't understand i don't understand who wants this car for 89 grand but that's actually got a 13b okay 13b yeah it's a 13b okay setting bl that's the stand looks like standard stuff but i mean there's one bit cheaper this one looks a bit nicer less case but that one's like 2002 okay i don't know man i'm not like that's what i mean i look at these prices and i'm like why would you want to buy this like i would i i'm just not even looking at something like this because it's just you know how many how many people want to collect an fd when there's this many for sale like doesn't look that scarce to me so this one looks really sick though but if you're collecting it aren't you meant to get an og like original condition isn't that like the whole thing about buying a collectible car this guy's modded this with like what does it look like front mount uh custom bonnet custom front bar custom wheels he's uh fender bent the rotors fenders bent fenders out you know rolled defenders this thing looks insane so yeah so that's what i mean it was like what would you say this is the thing with cars like why would you i just i don't know who's buying these here like this like especially this here oh man you're welcome to drive this all day every day i'll drive the stinger man not look back so but you know i had a history with uh japanese sports cars they were a fad that was for me it was a fad it came through i love the 32 gtr gtr 32 is like one of my favorite cars that thing was so good and i can see look i'm going to be honest i can see the appeal with the 32 gtr iconic car from back in the day even to this day it's a very fun car to drive so i'm not going to hate on the 32 gtr i just think it's expensive but if i was to buy one of these nostalgic cars and i won the lotto it'd be a 32 gtr so that's um that's like my favorite car it is nice and i've driven a couple of them before and they just have that real jdm boy racer feel the gtr is pretty awesome covers it kind of covers a lot of bases so yeah i love cars i've i used to be into a hardcore i used to sell car parts from japan to australia that's like that's where tech yes city comes from guys so like my grassroots is cars my grassroots is actually cars and car parts and then from there i uh i just got into tech as well and that's when you know people on youtube were loving the tech so i just kept going with that you know people like people love that i love the tech as well the whole used tech scene was opening up it was so enjoyable so new because before 2015 i was doing car parts i'd been doing it for about six six or seven years and it was it was getting very repetitive it was getting very boring uh then the use you know use pc parts was just like so cool and i love it now as well it's so much fun especially the dumpsters now we're hitting up the dumpsters it's too much fun the dumpsters is where it's at and you guys are loving the dumpster content as well so we're going to keep that up that's one thing that's a staple i've called the guy at the dumpster and i told him look man can i be kind of like a regular here and he's like yeah you can be so he's just like yo so there it is and i also got to say is guys get ready for another cd key bang go activate that one it's out there free keys for everybody um and if you you know if you missed out on that one there's another one in the comments chat's gonna be poppin you guys merry christmas merry christmas we've got one more to give away one more windows 10 pro key works for windows 7 pro works for windows 11 pro you got to get activated straight away because once it's activated it's a single end license as well so once you burn that one it's all gone now another thing is two people ask me is like can windows get deactivated yes it can i have proof of this i have proof windows can get deactivated so we're going to give std keys a quick shout out for selling single end single end license keys don't get deactivated but you can't i've got a screenshot someone sent me a message like oh my window's getting deactivated i'm like oh okay try one of these they're like oh thank you so much so i gotta screenshot that so i'll show you windows can get deactivated just realize that especially if you're buying some dodgy um keys off ebay or whatever they can get deactivated believe it or not so yeah we've got one more key to give away so get ready get ready is uh we gotta hear from mr hantak is 425 pound for a gigabyte eagle 6600 worth it for putting into a budget pc build and woo loveheart here's a love hardback is it okay is it is it worth it i'm gonna say i've i've flipped an rx 6600 pc and when you're flipping gaming pcs it's it's still here where i'm at locally it's all about a video people want nvidia graphics cards people want video graphics cards and that's all i'm going to say my experience was i i wouldn't get that 6600 personally because it's just so hard for me to flip in a gaming pc like honestly at the moment the market would be more receptable to an rtx 2060 super or something like that than a 6600 xt nvidia has this massive massive sentiment going on in the scene you know people just buy an nvidia card and look i'm not going to i don't care like amd's offering some good value with some of their new cards i was i was actually surprised when they released the rx 6800 xt i was surprised how close that came to nvidia's rtx 3080. i was like no way that's really good and then the pricing was very similar too so they were competing really well but the problem is that people wanted video because they got the dlss they got the other features then they got the the nvidia you know green you know green gaming experience and people buy into that as a seller i'm not going to sit here and care i gotta make a sale i don't care like my opinion doesn't matter when people are buying up nvidia cards so for me personally i wouldn't actually buy that rx 6600 for a flip that's just my opinion because you're not targeting like when you're selling a gaming pc you're targeting a beginner beginner's gonna be more susceptible to go i want a nvidia graphics card now ryzen uh we'll get on to ryzen soon i think we had another question up here sorry uh is use 2060 super for 350 dollars a good deal talk the guy down from 500 bucks it's decent it's a decent deal i think in my parts hunt if i was that's that sounds like it's usd right so i thought one for 550 aud to usd i'll just quickly look it up so i paid 390 of my parts hunt for one so that was my maximum miles prepared to pay for a 2060. so i think you're getting a decent deal like it's a decent deal for a flip you should be able to do pretty well off that that's for sure should be able to flip that in the game pc or use it for yourself as well that's pretty good um captain mcdobber uh thanks i'm now looking at r34s don't need that in my life no you don't need in a live man you don't need to you don't need it this is like if you have a friend with one you just go just go driving with them for a day get it out of your system uh intel 8700 or a 3600 i would go for an 8700 i7 it's got the logo uh you got better resale value with the i7 my man uh ryzen 5 though you i mean it's probably going to be technically very very close very close experience there i wouldn't say you're going to one's going to be drastically better than the other but the i7 is going to give you that i7 especially if you want to resell it in the future so that's why i would just pick that oh sorry then the rest of the chat's like yeah go with the i7 cool you guys are switched on this is what i love about tech yes city we're all thinking on the same page here brothers that's what i love and uh we just got a nori ss g'day brian how's pops doing curious about your hunting expedition thanks for the donation 499 from nori ss thanks brother he's curious about the hunting expedition have you ever had a deal go sideways or needed to use protection oh i have i have had a deal like not ghosts like i have never had someone wanting to get like go crazy and wanting to punch on i haven't had that i have had a deal where i've rocked up the guys wanted to sell me garbage and then i've just jumped in my car and bailed that's the worst i've had because when you go to inspect a part if someone's all sketching out and then yeah you ask them like hey does this part work brother oh yeah yeah yeah it works man it works can i see it up and running because straight away like their body language and the way they're speaking it tells me that something's wrong and then i'm like can i just check this or do you have a video of it working because they're like oh yeah when i pulled it out it was working i'm like did you take a video on your phone show me it was working oh no no no no i didn't do that didn't do that i was like okay man i'm not buying it just jump back in my car and bail that's it don't risk if you got that gut feeling that you're gonna get hosed just avoid it you're better off there's guys on the uh discord terms of protection as well i i do i do have something i'm not gonna explore like explain it on um on live stream but yeah you should always have something on you to protect yourself as well that's like rule of thumb at least where i grew up on the coast because you never know when you could run into i've had friends on the beach that have run into um people just randomly wanting to clock them you know this is this is the thing so you should always carry something on you i'm not going to say what but that's up to you that's user that's you know that's um you know dealers dealer sorry that's uh the dealer's choice no it's the player's choice that one so but in terms of deals going sideways yeah i just like if i sense if i sense that something's up something's really wrong i just jump back in the car and bail like i just say nah man i'm not interested see you later i just don't think this works and that's it don't like a lot of you guys don't a lot of you guys will have this nicer kind of nature this really nice nature and i love that everyone i meet that has that nice kind nature i love that and we'll talk we'll you know we'll we'll talk for hours sometimes have a beer even when i'm on the road i have beers with people i just barely met because i can just sense that they're good people but then you you don't let people take advantage of that don't let people take advantage of you where they talk you into buying something that you don't want to buy just straight up jump back in your car just say oh sorry man or the best excuse is to check things out if you if you're a bit shy when you pick up deals this is going to be the best one this is the golden one okay we're going to give you a golden tip on live stream then we're going to give away something you just rock up you say i'm paying cash rock up check out the part if you've got butterflies or you're nervous whatever if you're nervous you're just like i don't want this deal just say hey man i just got to go get the cash i'll be right back in two minutes go down the nearest atm and you just don't go back that simple so there it is that's i have done that one back when i was doing uh early when i came back to australia that was the early one i did that one that was the earliest one i did um yeah so that you know and then i got comfortable just whatever you know so that's it aussie bogan check that's how you do it man no i am yeah there you go oh man so yeah yeah bro just let me go get some cash out that's it and you just jump in your car and never see you again hey man you're coming back and just then just block delete so that's that's that's it if you just sense like and this is the thing i like i have been hosed in the past especially lately i got semi-hosed on one of the gravis cards but like you know i've been hosed on little items big items anything over 100 bucks i have not been hosed on i think when i first got back to australia there was like one gpu i got hosed on for 120 bucks um oh yeah for the mic if you guys want to know what mic this is we'll get hey thanks for the we'll give them a plug man

dumpster has sort of given me that opportunity to say hey brian this is where you need to go with youtube you need to head back to that dumpster and show some appreciation and that's what i'm gonna do you know all these other guys you know they're afraid to get their hand i think a lot of these other youtubers are afraid to get their hands dirty you know they've got to have hand sanitizer and then

just like uh hot rod was all out of anna john we're all out of keys but now we've got a z590 motherboard from asrock so which one did they say they were going to give away i think it was a phantom gaming velocity so someone's going to win this a phantom gaming velocita got nori ss with the clutch dono he's like do you still have any new urban streetwear left from that deal you made for the gaming pc would you still do this trade again um uh would i do the trade again probably not uh it it was like i had just closed i did the i gave away all those clothes i literally gave away every single like everyone i knew i filmed i got you know new fittings myself had a new wardrobe my brother dad man friends all my friends got hooked up uh then i had a heap of stuff left and what i did was i just gave someone contacted me off the channel they found out through the youtube channel they're like hey i would really love to give this to underprivileged people i'm just like yeah come and collect it man take it straight away so they came and took all the clothes so i got none left so i gave it all away would i do it again uh it's just i don't know i don't know i i just think it's too much of a pain like clothes everywhere i had boxes full of clothes all over my place so there it is uh that that was the clothes if you guys are new here we're talking about a video i did a couple of years ago man that was actually it seemed like yesterday i did that video we went and traded a pc for just boxes and boxes of clothes it was actually a lot of fun people enjoyed that video i i enjoyed that one a lot um yeah youtube might it's it's kind of yeah kind of sucks some people are getting delays on the stream it should be a delay for everyone though the delay should be like evenly because it's going to youtube servers i guess it does favor those who are closer to the youtube server that's a bit of a unfair advantage i can do random numbing generator i can just like round robin the people in the chat and we can just do pick a comment but this is a z590 phantom gaming velocita from asrock this is it fellas this is it um actually 11th gen like speaking of 11th gen it's not bad it's a good option too like the motherboards especially the b560s they're pretty cheap so like 11th gen even though 12th gen's out it's taking the the crown everyone's talking about 12th gen 11th gen stuff ain't bad man shouldn't shouldn't undermine it it definitely did have an improvement over 10th gen so that was pretty cool um let's give away this motherboard though so man i gotta think of a question and it's gonna be very difficult actually because people got those too easy people got those ones too easy right they were like we warmed up we started with a generic then we started with like kind of a semi-google generic this one's going to be for the zeon lovers we're gonna do a zeon it would be it'd be a sin not to pull out a zeon question in the round robin i know this one okay so what is the name what is the name of the haswell zeon there's a haswell xeon that was released wasn't actually released too much like it was a very very scarce unicorn cpu what is the name of the xeon that's overclockable it's a v3 haswell xeon what is the name of this xeon that has 14 cores 28 threads whoever gets it first gets the motherboard this one's difficult i know this one i'm going to see who gets it first haswell zeon 14 cores 28 threads it's a unicorn i know the answer because i've been eyeing one off oh we're close we're close we're close you're gonna get the full answer you're getting the full answer someone's gonna get the full answer someone's gonna do this full answer here there it is oh okay okay see i don't know this is where two people got it okay this is where kind of i don't know what the rules is the full answer because sticks maribo he got the answer but he didn't add the v3 he didn't add the v3 but then we're going to show you guys so you guys can see this live he didn't add the v3 so he got that that was the answer but he didn't add the v3 and then i think marco swooped in i think marco at least what my eyes are no so i reckon you two okay so i'm gonna say he didn't he didn't do the full answer so but he did get the answer and then vel newlandness got the answer fully so you guys are now on around robin i'm going to pit you guys against each other in a round robin are you there are you ready so i wanted the fullness was the v3 it was the v3 but sticks maribo versus okay one more question okay here it is what was the final xeon what was the final zeon to support ddr3 memory final desktop xeon to support ddr3 memory this is a round robin between the two winners what was the final zeon to support ddr3 memory this is between styx maribo and lennon linus yeah villain in the villain i can't man that name so there we go you too round robin sticks maribor ventilators got it man it's for the motherboard brothers for the motherboard what was the final zeon to support ddr3 memory it sticks maribor he has no idea all right well final generation then if you both if you don't have no clue if you both have no clue final generation okay man okay he's got no all right fair enough all right you all right we're just going to rock series of paper you two then live stream let's just do it on a live stream okay random number generator okay sticks maribor your one and then linen the venenous your two brother okay give me one and two there it is upper limit two here you go guys your live stream who's going to win the motherboard is going to be determined by this okay loneliness you win bang get the results sticks maribo drop your thing in the comments anyway i'll hook you up brother they'll i'll get you something as well okay drop your name you're both winners thank you guys for participating in those two in those giveaways also we have something look gigabyte sent this in okay gigabyte sent this in and i'm gonna give it away

congratulations okay that's there it is we're going through right now i got to get there joshua 524 9880 he got it joshua drop a comment congratulations you won with the random number generator okay he was there shampoo time you came in after the fact wait yeah you did yeah so was joshua five yeah joshua you yeah you won congratulations okay just yeah that's actually pretty funny hey [Music] okay done i'm done with this motherboard i'm done this whole thing the unboxing experience i just wanted every other giveaway was so much more fun than the z690 has just been causing it okay there it is joshua drop your comment brother congratulations now now let's get back to it okay live stream topics everyone's going crazy okay [Music] joshua won that fair and square that was actually really lucky

just found it bang he was there man so there it is congrats brother drop a comment we'll get back to you there it is done like a dinner thanks yeah anyway yusef's right yusuf is going to come around help me like i don't know how to do live stream giveaways like really a hundred percent fair because it's live the question thing seems like it's unfair it seems like it favors people that are closer to the google servers so it's like eric [Music] let's talk tech talk let's talk tech let's talk tech let's talk topic networking so like are you talking about like networking okay that's actually a good topic are you talking about like networking is in finding people at the dumpster yard or are you talking about rj45 networking because the the former yeah joshua 524 that's it you're legit you've got that legit there it is um okay so can i put a third cpu on a sandy bridge motherboard so networking is the first topic uh we'll talk about tech flash and that's coming in um okay so you gotta i have to ask you is it networking is in dumpster diving contacts or is it networking is rj45 cable you have to tell me which topic are we talking about then there's also uh i have a question can i put a third gen cpu on a sandy bridge motherboard it depends if you upgrade the bios if you can upgrade the bias then do it but if not you can't uh dumpster on the brain so 10 gbe studio when that's actually coming early next year that was i wanted to wire out the whole studio with 10 gbe that's my goal because apparently tp-link have a budget 10 gig eight switch router now so that's really good are you giving away tech don't get stressed man thanks guys yeah it's just like i want it to be fair so i don't know how to make it fair as as completely as fair can be where just random nature decides who wins that's my biggest grife with giveaways because you know i felt like the questions maybe people like the keys the keys are awesome because the key is like bang we're just putting it out there whoever gets it in chat chat's not delayed chat everyone gets chat at the same time so that's why i like the scd keys thing the best works the best uh can i have windows 10 still on 12th gen intel yes but it won't work as well it's 11th gen's been designed i mean sorry windows 11 has been designed around 12th gen stuff anyhow uh let's do this okay so we've got here uh how did i deal with the shipping though uh do a repairing so networking okay so if you're networking it's all about feeling the room brothers it's all about feeling the room you know networking is what we do technically i'm networking on youtube i chat to you guys i listen uh give you guys the content you want and then we grow from there right so locally if you want to network for pc parts it's all about just getting to know someone so that's why it's always good to say try and find a deal if you say for instance if you see someone like les let's give an example of les i saw les way back years ago i knew les years ago i knew les because i saw he was selling a lot of stuff and i was like okay this is a guy that i want to get to know so initially went and saw him got to know him paid good prices for his pcs he was happy with me and then slowly we we networked you know what i mean so slowly got to know him and now let's i consider as a friend he's a cool guy really like him he actually calls me up sometimes like just out of the blue how you doing like what's going on we have a ginger beer together he loves ginger beer i love ginger beer um i actually like the sarsabarella that's really nice sars is really uh sarsaparilla is really good so when you locally you got to find your less exactly you got to find your less that's it so that's all you got to do for networking find your less it'll take you to good places so i think i found the laser origin story in the deals hunting video and say that is correct that is correct you've got good memory cherry tofu that is correct so that was the origins of les and the networking from there that was the best contact i got dumpster contacts now uh got a lot of contacts in the scene man guys at retail know a lot of people man and you just take care of each other you know like i think new year's we'll be doing like a party or something at it's all like a pc enthusiast party really i mean it's all just mates gathering but we're all friends so there it is uh do you take old pcs from viewers i really don't want to leave them at the recycling center my oldest pc has a gtx 570 yeah i'll take that off your hands especially if it's dirty we can do an ultra clean i haven't had a really filthy pc come in for quite a few months so i really want to do an ultra clean man i'm hanging for one so yeah feel free to drop a comment after the live stream i'll drop a comment now and i'll get back to you and yeah i mean gtx 570 it doesn't matter you know it's funny because gtx 570 should be if i if the game doesn't have a vram limit and doesn't have all the fancy driver optimizations then a gtx 570 should technically be faster than a 750 750 ti people are paying good money for 750 ti still so there it is there we've all been hosed yeah we have been mark last is telling you like it is oh mark lost and christopher conant they've got that's so awesome okay that is so awesome these guys are reppin they are straight up reppin the uh the join they straight up repping the youtube membership man i love that i love that if you guys want to become a member see the join button there dollar a month we're going crazy on the vlogs i'm gonna be making a vlog soon but we've got the aurora video coming the aurora video is going to be crazy because we're going to see if dell skipped corners on the intel side just like they do on the amd side now i know for a fact amd don't have i know intel have some pretty strict regulations when it comes to board partners and stuff like that so that'll be interesting now we've got a 4.99 from norway ss everyone has given away z5 19z 690 boards that came in bundles for a third to half of retail price example search ebay okay zeus six six ninety pro and osprey that's weird okay well we'll pull that up why are they doing that that's okay z5 are with graphics cards i see so they're bundled i get it they've bundled the they've bundled the gpus in with a mo yeah you're right 125 bucks for a mob wow yeah 100 someone got a z590 pro for 124 wow someone made off like a bandit 142 bucks yeah this is z590 gaming edge wow what 74 bucks yeah you're right that's a bargain hey if you want a z590 motherboard just start buying them off the people selling them in bundles that's intense these are going for dirt cheap man wow i gotta pick myself up some z590 motherboards that's that's pretty awesome that's a good tip what about i mean z690 surely not surely people let's see the cheapest z690 went for 175 bucks and no one bitted on it wow okay it's a good no one bit it on 150 650 bucks that's cheap for a z690 motherboard did you i mean you can't get the ddr5 though see the ddr4 board that went that went yeah oh wow the ddr okay so yeah you can get cheap z five nine and z six ninety bubble but it's good good hint there you go guys get one off ebay on a free bid there you go there that's pretty intense that's good that's a good hint i love it when you guys give people chat you know you give people chat you give them hints i mean i love the super chat too that's awesome five bucks i can buy dab man a beer tonight um okay so we got here uh graphics card prices are really crazy in the philippines yeah i mean they're crazy everywhere but as we pointed to earlier in the stream there is a trend coming through so last off we'll close off the stream with that financial message okay the juicy one i know any tips of finding crt monitors oh dude crts are super hard to get like they're really hard now the only way to get them would be to go to garage sales only way people cleaning out their closet and stuff like that garage sales a hundred percent for a crt monitor it's the only place you're gonna get one at a good price like a really desirable one um that's all i got to say so otherwise people who know what they're worth will charge for them especially retro gamers i think retro console gamers love the crts uh hey brad thank you for the shout out where is dad man these days oh he's just been chilling man he's been taking it easy so dadman's doing his thing i i think he's busy today so i'd love to get him on live stream i think he's busy today but we will be doing another live stream before the end of the year i'm gonna do another live stream i want to do two a month for you guys just so we can chat hang out ask questions get up to date we've got a donation here for a ron so i 776 he donates the wrong uh we all went nuts over the motherboard but can most of us even afford paying for a balanced older lake system true that ddr5 is ridiculous actually we can pull this up on live stream thanks for the donation problem too ddr5 look at this pull that off this stuff is going this is like a 32 gigabyte kit six seven hundred dollars people are selling this stuff for i think i saw one like believe it or not i believe i heard someone paid fourteen hundred dollars for ddr5 32 gig this is what people are paying for ddr5 it's like just wait you know it is it will be fine you know the ddr5 will come down in price like this is insane a thousand dollars some dude paid a thousand bucks for 32 gigabytes of ddr5 memory so what's wrong i actually don't even know either people in the comments like what's wrong i have no idea ron sounds cool like for a currency um someone knows yeah i can check now what is wrong romanian loot okay i actually haven't heard of that legitimately that's cool to know thanks for my brother in romania with the romanian lou ron sounds like a pretty cool hey man you got some ron yeah bro he's my mate just call him up get ron over here we'll get ronnie over here ronnie hey man can i have some ronnie yeah mate that'll cost you 5 000 ronnies for your ddr5 memory mate you got 5 000 ronnies ronnie love it man what a cool currency um so ebay there we go five eight hundred dollars for some dominator 855 bucks come get your dominated memory some dude want 1600 bucks so yeah man if you're paying a thousand bucks for this stuff wow wow that's insane just for a kid of ddr5 memory you'll be kidding me 32 bucks 32 gigabytes you know what this stuff cost to make i tell you what probably cost like max for a 32 gigabyte kit of memory like that max cost like 70 bucks i'm guessing so someone's paying like 20 fold uh so nori ss only one beer for pops also you're usually right but you might be wrong about prices coming down i just traded my last non lhr msi 360ti vendors 2x for a 30 70 ti foundation i don't mind i don't have the space okay so we'll talk about price so right now we've got two tiers right we talked about this earlier in the earlier in the stream right how's our series ass how's the line how's the how's the average person going series s is now can't even sell it retail 247 bucks see the gaming is fine if you are on a budget you can game for under msrp now especially on a series s so what we've got now is a glut a glut incoming on certain things like i showed you guys the earlier example before facebook i showed you the earlier examples before and it was um the nintendo switch effect so here it is here nintendo switch and there's heaps of sale and then we go over to our series x it's the same thing there's a lot of stuff coming up for sale people are getting strapped for cash look at that that's under news brand new series xbox and he's selling it for under like in australia this is 750 aussie dollars so you can see the effect people are strapped for cash now this is christmas as well of all times we're like six days away from christmas here this should not be happening there should be actually kind of a shortage on xbox series right if people are buying the stuff if people are buying this stuff then there should be they should be you shouldn't be able to find it really like if there's so much demand playstation fives everywhere i mean they're not 750 but there's one there for 700 bucks from old mate that looks like the disc edition so i guess people are dropping the prices as well the scalpers the scalpers are kind of like whoa man i got a drop at 300 the scalper is getting nervous now that's at least not on gravity scars yes graphics cards are still expensive right we pull in a 5700 xt the mining's special someone's selling one for a thousand bucks they know what they're worth the mining right the only thing propping up mine there's one thing keeping gpu prices up right now it's the only thing and that's this ethereum that's this here up and down like a yo-yo up and down with volatility now if this happens again one more time with the amount of difficulty that's out there the amount of difficulties insane this difficulty if we have another one of these then your gpus are going to get cheaper and suddenly because the sheer amount of gpus being used tomorrow let's pull up that difficulty chart for ethereum again because that's important to look at this was 2018 right mining was so heavy in 2018 everyone was mining back then i was mining back in 2007. i i'm an x miner there was pretty powerful cards right there was rx 580s that was uh gtx 1080is there is [Music] like nearly like there's over threefold the amount of gravis cards or over threefold the difficulty than the once was and you remember this is now cutting out gtx 1063 gigabytes cutting out lower end cards back here you could mine with those lower end cards there was heaps of people mining with four gigabyte three gigabyte cards back here they've cut out all the four gigabyte cards now all the three gigabyte cards they're all gone and look how high it is there is so many graphics cards mining cryptocurrency so many and i feel like if you have one more little this is on a knife's edge they're trying to prop this thing up right they're punching the price up of the theorem they're like yo we cannot let this thing crash right now if it you know i would dare say i'm not going to call anyone out here but i'm going to say there's some certain companies that would be in their best interest to keep this price up and so they're trying to punch this price up as much as possible while the insider you can see all this volatility how it's picking up so violently the insider's just dumping it they're like yeah yeah we're getting that good fat cash for this great thank you so the bag the bag exchanging is happening right now that's what i feel finally it's time to pop so a big j might be propping it up that's what comments i i look you guys are you guys are talking in chat i'm not going to object okay but people you can see here they're desperately trying to punch this price up until so many people keep taking profits that it all collects they can't keep it up anymore they're starting to lose money whoever's punching it up starts losing money that's when it all collapses and so that's why it collapses they can't people are cashing it all out there's no demand the money's not there to cash it out everyone's running for the exit at the same time what happens to all the people in the building on average so yeah they're trying to like it's like the final pump they're trying to desperately keep this thing desperately trying to keep it up now so i i like i've been predicting it for a while i mean i was wrong in my timing but the end result is going to be the same so that's what i feel i feel like there are some useful cryptos but at the moment they're only shrouded in all this speculative mania that's going on and firstly yeah it's ruining the pc game it's ruining pc gaming that's for sure especially when people want to look for the latest and greatest games and they want to have like a decent card like say a 360 ti and they want to play it but they can't cause the 360 ti how much is that 399 399 card is going for 930 bucks 875 bucks it's going for like two and a half times its price 900 all day every day and that's revision too i hate to see you here revision one thirteen hundred bucks huh so there it is people are paying three and a half fold msrp or 3.3 times msrp just to get their hands on a non-lhr version that's how much mining is propping these cars i wonder if you could buy 1300 bucks you could buy how crazy is that someone sold a 3060 ti for more money than a 6900 xt let that sink in for a second they both i believe they both have similar hash rates i believe the rev one should have similar hash rate to a 6900 xt but there's you like there's your calculator that's what people are paying it's just a calculation that's all it is and it's just all the miners that's all it is when you've got someone paying more for a 360 ti than a 6900 xt something's wrong look i mean i'd probably rather a 30 90 or a 3080 than a 6900 xt but i'd definitely rather a 6900 xt than a 360 ti any day of the week i mean by the time you turn on dlss you're still getting more fps on the 6900 xt so yeah the whole market like don't worry this is the final market this is the final market to go the crypto will be running to the very end while switches nintendo switches i think i want oh okay okay all right i'm getting a message about oh oh man the giveaway i'll sort the giveaway out later oh man i saw that that controversial giveaway i'll sort that out later yeah i'll saw that giveaway later it's on facebook okay but what we've got here okay what we got here is all this stuff playstation fives um why yeah okay playstation five xbox series s's series x's these are all going to start coming down in price there's going to be so many of them in the market and gpu prices might still be high but this is an indication that things are turning in the wrong direction so there is other things out there as well as people pointed out in the comments evergrand that has defaulted so there you go that's a contagion that starts to dump one bank at a time so so there you go engine default that's a huge what were we talking about 300 billion of debt that's just dumped on the system now and sooner or later that's going to keep those losses will keep coming in until the whole thing just collapses so that's what it's looking like especially when the printers get turned off this whole thing is being propped up by printed money that's all that's going on now so there you go guys it can happen at any time like i said i'm sticking to my i believe crypto people like crypto's staying brian f's going up to 50 grand i mean in a hyper inflationary environment yes but that requires government stimulus now where i'm at locally governments have wound down their stimulus at least in australia i don't know what it's like in the u.s but the governments have wound down their stimulus here last year they went they loved the printers last year they were going crazy on the printers this year they've wound it down and they have um slowed down that printed money and then we've got the problem and now here's the final thing inflation has picked up inflation's a delayed effect i was warning about this last year there's going to be inflation so that's a delay 12 to 18 months delayed now we're seeing it it's happening big time inflation's coming through so what inflation does now it's the natural balancing act you can never have a free lunch the reason why you can never have a free lunch with uh inflation is because someone is going to have to pay someone has to pay for this this printed money sooner or later and we're all paying for it now with the prices of higher goods so your prices of goods go up your rent goes up your gas goes up your food goes up everything goes up and then suddenly you can't afford those uh luxury items so the luxury items come down in price hence the nintendo switch is coming on for sale hence the xbox series x's the playstation 5's they're all starting to come up for sale gpus are still fine because those people making money by the you know that inflated market someone's punching it up still until they got no money left to punch it up uh that'll be the last to go but what you're seeing now is inflation is sending people broke and so when people are even in an inflationary environment yes assets do go up in price but it's an imbalance it's a distorted market it's a two-speed market and that's what we're talking about a two-speed market now those who see value in things can definitely buy them if you see value in something especially and this is the time if you've got a bit of cash and you can buy something that benefits your life and your lifestyle get it don't even think twice about it it's cheap it's going on sale that's it so that's what inflation does it creates a distorted market and that's what we've got all these distortions coming out and they're only going to get worse unfortunately so yeah they are they what they did they opened um they did in history they called the inflation genie and yeah they've let that out of the bottle now it's going everywhere it's so hard to put it back in the bottle so there you go inflation genie's running around everywhere now causing havoc pushing inflation on everything and that's what i mean it the inflation genie touches one thing at a time inflates one thing at a time so certain other things are still cheap so it doesn't have time to do it all at the same time and i think tech i think tech itself enthusiast tech products were the first to get touched by the inflation genie but now the other things are getting more expensive it's balancing out and so the enthusiast tech which was first to get touched by the inflation genie needs another hit from the inflation genie but the inflation genie which is the federal reserve or australia the rba they're like well we're kind of like well guys we can't give the inflation genie another touch there we're just going to let him do magic otherwise other places or we've got to try and get him back in the bottle and so we're going to see some it's going to be interesting watch what happens in the markets remember defaults are heavy deflationary events because they tighten up the monetary system so when evergrand's defaulting that is a deflationary event evergrand's this prop chinese property developer with actually a lot of international money invested in it so when you've got catalysts like that happening can spell danger for the broader market so just keep that in mind don't go too crazy like uh don't don't have a lot of fomo but at the same time i mean i just i just do what i do now that's it this we're all in this roller coaster together don't worry everyone on this roller coaster we're all in it together just know that because what's going on from here and economics and stuff like that it's it's actually never been done before in the history of fiat money anyway so what what goes on from here is anyone's guess but my guess roller coaster city so that's it roller coaster city you could see years you could have a year of deflation and then followed by a year of massive inflation another year of deflation you know it's it's i just think it's gonna be a roller coaster so get ready for it and strap on up buckle up fellas it's not positive news i know that but i just always give you guys my thoughts and opinions my analysis of it so you could see crypto drop 50 60 percent suddenly everyone's starting to sell their graphics card so they're not buying them up because the profits are down then a year later crypto could be all on again so these are the distortions that happen who knows who knows there it is get ready for the jet coaster roller coaster whatever you want to call it because we're already seeing it right now come through so there it is there it is so we've got more questions about eth uh look i don't look at the earth they've been talking about switching over to proof of stake forever and again i just think they keep talking about it because they want to sound like they're doing something about improving their network to the actual investors of ethereum they want to keep those investors like yeah ethereum's great it's got a good future again back to the star citizen thing you want to keep people coming along giving you money for as long as possible but really what you're giving it was in best it was in ethereum's best interest to change over to prove steak a long time ago and they didn't so that's on them so i don't even bother listening to what they got to say anymore because to me it doesn't matter they just keep this uh i would say this system of mining going on for as long as they can uh bitcoin on asics correct so switching to a different crypt i mean bitcoins beats to its own drum bitcoin bitcoins actually i mean i admire the fact that bitcoin went to asics because that really didn't affect the gpu market that was a good thing for the gpu market and that's what i've been arguing against these other cryptos they should have switched over to asics and left the gaming cards alone especially if you uh care about the environment and care about power consumption all that stuff should kind of let that go but uh yeah that's my thoughts i mean yeah crypto's crypto like i i get tired talking about it because i'm i'm yet to hear people talk to me about how crypto is changing their life for the better except for them making money and it buying them nice things because they made money off speculation so uh can you get asrock to design an apocalypse themed mobo i can put in the word to asrock i mean they were kind of a little bit angry after i did the z690 review but again it's a review that's it review on tech yes city means review means you get the uncut this is what i think i mean they sponsor me but like it's like i mean the motherboard was too expensive but it was a nice motherboard really nice board we're giving it away in the z690 gaming giveaway pc uh bitcoin is pretty consolidated i mean it is what it is i mean i just think once the printers go off if there's enough defaults and then the whole uh leverage system starts on deleveraging then you could see something really spectacular i don't know if you call it spectacular you might call it you might call it depressing some people i don't know but yeah i just it doesn't look like it's good news whatever's on the horizon and the i've i talked about this behind the scenes as well so if you remember i made a video talking actually giving you guys a lot of like basically bro summed it up towards the latter half of that video about the five key indicators that you've got to look out for right now and they all point towards so sooner or later anyhow guys it's easy as a consumer to say we want this but making this happen it's a real process yeah if you've mentioned this and i've i've missed it i apologize but what are your thoughts on amd's fsr and nvidia's nis especially with the chip shortage and inflation of gpu prices i mean i think they're both just like this technology has existed for a while i i believe that fsr and nis like i like temporal like what don't we want the temporal upscaling like dlss is temporal upscaling isn't it so we want the better version of upscaling that's up to the game developers to implement that or ai on the rtx course so the fsr and for me like i tried fsr on dota 2. my opinion on it was well i would rather just play at a lower resolution like honestly i just i could notice the sharpening it was just for me it felt like they're both glorified sharpening filters and that's for me i mean people are going crazy over these two technologies uh people love it but i don't like sharpening i look that's just my opinion so for me my thoughts on it is they're both kind of gimmicky you know at the end of the day you can polish a turd but it's still a turd and that's what you're doing you're just using a lower resolution image and upscaling it and then sharpening it that's pretty much all you're doing with those two technologies so i think they definitely definitely they wanted to market it i'd say amd and nvidia like to market that stuff more and just make it look like they're doing so much for gamers but what nvidia and amd really need to do is release a lower end gpu that's affordable and has say two gigabytes of vram or three or four gigabytes of vram that people don't want to mine on so it's designed for gamers to get in an entry level system and play games at 1080p that's what nvidia and amd really need to do don't get sidetracked by these upscaling technologies that have already existed for quite a while but i'm just being real like you guys want to ask for an opinion on a live stream i'm going to give it to you straight up i just like i tried fsi i tried it like nis and i'm like wow cool great and then amd fanboys got angry with me and i'm like that's just my opinion i mean you go you can go to other channels out there other tech channels and they're going to praise fsr they're going to make it sound like fsr is going to change your life that's what they're going to sound like guys i tried ever so i was so good and it's like really like i tried it man it was just like looked like a sharpening filter on an upscaled image like that literally looked like it would look like you see these other guys like oh so good man it's like you know amd bowl of like they've got the amd logo on their bowl of cereal just loving it for me i just like i said i just i've got the 4k especially on a 4k oled you can see it so clearly so quickly and so yeah if you want to ask me about nvidia or nis or intel's upcoming upscaling if it's temporal upscaling then we'll take a we'll take another look at it if it's just upscaling with a sharpening filter you can talk all the fancy talk you want at the end of the day you still you know yeah you're still just getting an upscale image that's all it is yeah let's keep going let's i mean next question next next question brothers so so i mean i mean yeah as long as it makes it look as close to native resolution of your model with height it's a win for me i love this image scaling like fsr and nis it's up to you man so each opinion to their own i just think yeah for me it may it hurts my eyes because i know what sharpening looks like both those technologies hurt my eyes so you just see the over sharpened image so yeah each their own man i mean probably like for me i mean uh it's sharpening plus anti-aliasing so not just sharpening yeah i mean like i said like i i tried it on dota 2 i just wasn't wowed by it at all like i would like i'd um yusuf around do you do like yeah we'd rather play at a lower resolution because yeah you just notice that for me i could just notice the sharpening so there it is i mean at the end of the day it's up to you again is it a good thing yes and no this is the thing would it be good see would i like fsr would i like nis if nvidia and amd were doing their best to get budget gamers graphics cards yeah but instead i think these technologies that they're releasing are just like basically a side track to say hey we could be doing more for you guys but we're just going to do more here with some software that's all that's my opinion on fsr and nis cool they're good things they're options but why aren't they releasing budget graphics cards where's the gt3030 where's the rx 460 replacement where are these graphics cards they can easily they should have easily been out on the market now they should have been out on the market six months ago so i think there's a you want to ask me about these technologies sidetrack that's all it is sidetrack so take your distraction off what's really going on and that is amd and nvidia cannot get enough of selling gpus to miners that's the real that's where it all boils down to and i'm critical of them on that and i've critiqued them i'd love to see them release budget gpus a gt 1030 successor because it'd be a great cut i know for a fact a gt 1030 d5 version is already okay you release an upgraded version of that with double the performance you've got a great budget graphics card there it is you've got a great budget graphics card and it'll stop people from going out and paying 400 500 bucks locally for a 1060. so we've got a five pound donation from i danish thank you brother when i had a gtx 480 i would create custom resolutions enabled gpu scaling because msaa is now a rare form of aaa and taa equals sharpening okay you guys are starting to get a bit technical i'm just i'm losing i'm just using my eyes that's all it is i'm using my eyes looking at the image and going look i don't really like these technologies that's it so i'd rather play like i'd rather get a 720p monitor and play at 720p then upscale with fsr and nis and that's it so and a 720p monitor you're going to save yourself some money there you go so uh i doubt that he still sells off the species and they do not always need avx i don't know you guys are talking about stuff do you think a zeus would send me a free pc no just being real with you any chance of a used gpu giveaway oh man like ugh if you asked me that a week ago i would have said yes but i am stretched now like i am down this one in the thumbnail right this one in the thumbnail someone's already booked up a pc with that so i've already like kind of pre-sold that that's how like it's nuts like the low end this is the gtx 970 i wouldn't say i mean is it low end is the gtx 970 really low end do let us know in chat but i've already this one's already been booked up it's already been gone it's already sold so i yeah and i know i'm out of gpus so i got to go find more potatoes and that will happen i'm thinking that's going to probably happen after christmas like i want to have like a couple of days off been going hard brothers i've been going hard i've been flipping been going flipping so okay i'm playing on a 3066 768 on a gtx 1050 and using fsr uh-oh uh-oh my battery like i've got the usb power i got the usb power on for this camera and the thing ran out of battery still uh oh let me just take a second here guys this is unexpected man that's hot [Music] okay hang on we have to check you can still hear the audio i think i think you might be able to still hear the audio but we might have had a technical difficulty here uh just bear with me two seconds the camera we're using the sony a7c and the camera overheated i think we've been like it's summer here so live i don't have my air con on because i just do it tough so i just like to tough it out but we'll change over to another camera so this one will probably overheat but probably got about 30 minutes in summer before this next camera overheats okay this one is going to overheat maybe welcome back to an overheated camera stream it's summer i've got an excuse technical difficulty wouldn't be a techie city live stream without a technical difficulty and let's go okay maybe that's gonna work [Music] okay yeah all right we got this i think we got this guys i think we have got this maybe maybe whew we're back we're on the cannon now so do let us know this is a direct if you're on a live stream this one here she overheated she had enough i thought i had it sorted probably this is probably one of the longest live streams we've ever done so i had to change cameras during live stream that's our difficulty that's not a technical difficulty that's just the difficulty um yeah hey sony uh yeah look honestly it is summer no aircon look i'm i kind of enjoy the hot 30 degree weather that's probably why i'm a little bit cooked um 4.99 donation considering the msrp game both amd and nvidia played this round how will your review conclusion going a change going forward fe cards 20 cheaper than aib yeah look going forward going forward with graphics card reviews i'm going to be i hope this is in focus that should be actually pretty good so going forward i'm going to be very critical of amd and nvidia on gravis cards um hopefully i think we're in focus like it looks like it's in focus to me okay so you guys are talking it's going canon versus we just changed over from sony to canon so canon versus sony added in the comments so going forward graphics card reviews i just think i think the lhr thing look when we look back in hindsight it worked but how about we go to the next level how about you just make it like 20 percent mining rates on those cards right the lhr is only nerfing it by 30 miners are still buying it up so i would love to see amd and nvidia just like literally just slash the hash rates like to 20 that'll stop your problem of miners buying up gaming gpus that's if they can't there's a thing people like that's a free market they can do whatever they want well yes and no right they've built up their audience off gamers nvidia and amd have built off gaming graphics cards a gaming audience now gamers can't buy that product they say they care about the gamer there is a solution but are they willing to do it because that'll make it go away if you drop if you nerf those hash rates to 20 or whatever and you put in an algorithm that can actively do that you've got yourself look months later months later people said oh brian the lhr is going to be cracked i said it wasn't i said it's very difficult to crack sure enough the crack came from nvidia themselves that was a there's something going on there that i called that out in a video but then they quickly corrected it and now it hasn't been cracked still lhr cards people i think can they can they can do some janky workarounds but they still can't get their full hash rates uh alandrio rubio five dollar donation yo tech yes man sending the love from southern cali keep up the hard work gone thanks brother thanks for the donation merry christmas tier two two dollar where you guys coming from you suddenly i changed the camera overhead and you're like let's just donate this man money okay hey look look i can put my air con on but i just don't like doing i i've gone three years now i think i'm three years running with no aircon on that's how i like to do that two dollar donation from john hanson thank you brother no question though intel can save us so the last question we got from you guys is can intel save us again the only thing that can save us and i'm going to be honest is if the governments turn off the printers that's what it is stop printing money that benefits those who borrow those who have the capacity to borrow all this cheap money the average person do you think the average person on a 50 grand a year mortgage or a wage sorry can go out and borrow the same amount of money that elon musk can borrow that's where the distortions are coming in when people say this is benefiting the rich it is it is benefiting the elite because they can borrow more and when they've got access to super cheap money they can go out and bite off more than they can chew and that's all there is to it it's not fair for the average person the printers the money printer is not fair for the people that make up an economy that's guys like you and i the lower and middle class this is this is the biggest problem i don't talk about i'd like look i'm i'm not a socialist i am i'm anti-socialist i'm all about capitalism but what we've got right now is not capitalism and i wish people would stop referring to what we've got now as capitalism because it isn't it isn't free market capitalism what we've got now what we've got now is crony corrupt capitalism that's what you got you wouldn't even call it capitalism it's just crony corruption that's all you got now so there it is so what we've got now is the most distorted market where you can throw out a prediction and you've got an x amount of chance of being right because the only way you're going to know what's happening is if you know what the insiders are doing what are the federal reserve guys doing well last year they were selling i mean sorry earlier this year they were selling this stock so that should be an indicator um can you do another inflation music video yes man yes certainly but that's the only thing that's going to bring grass cards right down so intel cannot save you if profits are still high because intel will probably work off a similar hash rate to amd intel is probably getting into it you know shout yourself so matt green thanks brother how you been too matt green i remember remember your brother shout yourself some summers before we gotta catch up yeah we do have to catch up you gotta head around so that i got i met matt on a parts hunt and i picked up i think it was i forgot whether it was a hp or a dell i picked up some oem um system off him in 2017 i believe so i've known him for a long time thanks for the donation brother yeah and i will i'm going to get myself a haze man have you tried haze from burley local beer absolutely amazing i know my man yusuf he tried it with us we were like damn we gotta get some more haze so that's that's how it's going uh i 776 ron 25 donate economy doesn't just mean pc parts of fast cars it's also food insulin transportation yeah it's everything yeah and everything's going to get distorted so thanks for the donation brother everything's going to be distorted wild wild things that are going on right now and all i gotta say is a lot of people that are in control of this economy you should listen to the stuff that they talk about because these guys it's almost like they've been indoctrinated into the camp of things just grow from nowhere like i hear what some of these politicians say in australia and it's like like did this guy like has he ever done a course in the school of logic because these politicians they put out these and the people argue like i love it like i love it how people in australia like put one party against the other in my point in australian politics right locally here they're both become an absolute joke both these major parties in australia have become an absolute joke and i usually never talk about politics but i look at the stuff these guys are saying now and they're so disconnected both of them in australia what's called labor and liberal these people are so disconnected from the average person and the average person in a business and a job that it's surprising that they can't even just take a look and go walk around and see that the damage that they're causing from their reckless policies anyway printing money favors the rich it's that simple printing money in this current environment favors the rich and it's an inside game it's an unfair advantage that is not capitalism that is not free market capitalism so we can talk about markets for days who do you think makes the most money off crypto mining do you think it's a guy like yourself if you buy a 3090 and you've paid back your gpu no like yeah you've made a little bit of money but it's the guys buying thousands of gpus they're the guys profiting off this and then probably borrowed that money too so they can pay it back and then they've just created inflation that's all they've done they've created inflation which you and i pay for it in the end you and i pay for it that's all we do uh we've got another donation here from euro sigma ah sig free thanks brother hi from spain where gpu prices are atrocious too thanks for the live stream ryan you're welcome but just just realize that all these problems intel when people say intel when people say intel can save us or intel can intel save us no the only ones that are going to save us well the only thing that can save us is if governments and all these big banksters and final regular financial regulators get out of the way turn the printers off give the dollar some value again and get out of the way because then productive money will find productive assets and productive goods that simple and as it stands as as far as i'm concerned a gaming graphics card for people who want to play games in their free time that is a productive leisure asset simple as that do you think some people would do you think if this printed money didn't exist do you think people would be going out and paying half a million dollars for a copy copy-paste picture of an ape i mean so be careful what you might uh wind up in yeah two-dollar donation from john thomas yeah i gotta be careful like at the same time though that's what sort of kept me down and i've spoke about this to a lot of people it's kept me down in 2021 but i i kind of the more that we start getting over all this crap that's going on the more that we realize that the average person the little guy the middle class the lower class we're all getting screwed by governments the sooner we're going to realize that we can have a better economy if they just get out of the way stop interfering with our lives so that's it why would governments even allow another currency to be used yeah isn't that true no they love it no the governments love cryptocurrency because they're taxing it that's it someone's borrowing money buying uh buying cryptocurrency someone's taking that profit the government gets a cut they don't care inflation's a hidden tax make no mistake about it ladies and gentlemen inflation is a hidden tax the governments love it government love bitcoin government love ethereum that's why they're putting in all those new rules they want to get tax out of it so yeah so but just keep in mind that what the system is in place the system that we've got in place right now favors the ultra rich because they can borrow with their contacts they've already got contacts set up they've already got um access to uh they call it what they you know hedge funds uh investment banking they've already got access to all this cheap money so as soon as the pandemic hit as soon as the borrowing facilities ramped up the elite rich borrowed up a heap of money bought everything that's all it was and then the average person noticed how the money trickled out after march 2020. they didn't just give everyone money straight away they trickled it out after that to prop up the super rich and that's just a cycle that's all it is so the end of the day the balance comes out though so if you guys haven't heard of it it's called the misery index and that uh that's just basically that will uh take into account true inflation so what the misery index measures is it measures um inflation true inflation and unemployment true unemployment so if you're seeing you know so basically what happens with the misery index if you see crime go up that's an indicator of inflation and unemployment going up so the government can say whatever they want the government to put out numbers for inflation that i personally don't believe the other can put out unemployment numbers which they change the they change the rules i think if you're employed for 10 hours a month you're considered employed now in australia or something like that it's only ridiculous so they can put out all these numbers but at the end of the day if crime's on the rise that means the misery index is going up so yeah no and so like i'm like when it comes down to free market capitalism i'm just going to make this clear i'm all for free market capitalism but what we have right now is not free market capitalism at all and it's just being ruined by governments that's all it's been ruined by so yeah brian can you give away a spare gt 1030 oh dude so the reason the live stream was late 30 minutes this morning was i sold a gt 1030 pc i had my last one and i saw like literally i sold it in the gaming pc this morning sorry brother otherwise if i still had the gt 1030 i'd probably yeah probably just drop it on here and give it away but yeah got the gtx 970 here that this is booked up though so sorry about that guys if you guys are enjoying the economics we can talk more about it i love it i love it but um yeah my prediction going forward is we're gonna see ups and downs that's the only thing because that's what the indicators are pointing towards inverted yield curves momentum momentum's really running dry on crypto as well that's another thing look at the momentum so there it is apparently cars and housing isn't part of the equation inflation numbers are bogus oh yeah oh yeah so you guys you guys realize that so yeah capitalism has its inherent functions and this is where it takes us yeah if we go through history yeah history repeats doesn't it you're better than my economics teacher oh thanks brother that's a good compliment so yeah economics is is good but you just go look around look at like the best thing you can do with economics the best thing you can do always is look around with your own two eyes what's going on outside what's going on outside look around just make your own call make your own judgment that's the best thing you can do and opinions like mine are just another opinion always make your own decisions always think for yourself and that's the most important thing you can teach people always have your own opinions always think for yourself that's why i'm not afraid like that guy on twitter you know flexing his crypto about you know his uh founders cards and it's like well dude you're you're not playing the game fairly and i just let him have it on twitter i didn't care you know if he was playing the game fair because if he was k you know if he's playing the game fairly that'd be it so i believe you're lying eyes exactly yusuf look believe those eyes they lie to you that's what the so some of the news would have it some of the news would have you believe that right now hey your own two eyes no you can't trust those things anymore we're telling you the truth what about my ears like i heard these i heard no no you can't that's you did not hear that so well how can i read the news if my eyes are lying to me there's the paradox right that's the 101 paradox so 22 second delay damn that's actually sucks i love your online marketplace hustling videos okay yeah we got a lot more guys so thanks for tuning in this month um actually we're gonna do a live stream before the end of the year so make sure you tune in again if you love the live streams you've got questions uh make sure you tune in anytime i will be announcing the live streams in advance now because that way it gives you guys uh chances to come in and and talk and just chat um brian have you made or lost any money in the stock market this year earlier this year i made 30 000 usd on amc and i got in the day before it pumped because i could see the trend so this is the only time i've made money in the stock market any time i actually haven't even touched the stock market i'm gonna be honest i haven't even touched the stock market um before that i hadn't touched the stock market for years i hated the stock market due to having uh oh bold ram thank you brother you became a tyc supporter what is up welcome to the fam we've got the members fam here join on in it's only a dollar a month guys dollar a month hit that join button and uh do you believe in moas what does that mean again i gotta put that in i forgot the saying i i recognize that i just forgot it what is it okay mother of all short squeezes oh that was okay yeah yeah of course uh that was actually going to happen with uh if you look at gamestop mother of all short squeezes was going to happen on gamestop that was going to happen they stopped it from happening so that moaz was yeah in theory it was going to be proven right before they shut down gamestop what they did so yes that is the true thing um okay so i made uh with amc i could see what happened with gamestop and so what i did that day i was telling it was actually funny cause i was telling my really close friends i was like go buy this stock buy this stock tonight it's gonna go and i was up at like 12 a.m that night i was up oh thank you guys coming in with the support thanks guys awesome tyc supporters rocking on in so with amc i looked at the trends right and so i uh i saw that get a game stop and pumped right and so gamestop i didn't know where it was going to go i think it was 60 70 at the time and i was like wow that's insane i saw gamestop pumped and i was like okay what's going on here there's definitely going to be one more big whammy that goes through this short squeeze so i pulled up the exchanges in america because i knew it was going to be a non-american exchange and actually more specifically i found out what exchange gamestop was on because i knew it was going to be on the same one as gamestop so i had my rules for picking out this stock so i was looking for it so what happened with gamestop same traits it was on the nyse it was cheap and there was the next one and that is it had to have a short uh seller percentage that was really high so whoever picked out gamestop and then made it a trend i knew they were gonna pick out one more and so i saw amc and i put all the criteria in the only one that stood out was gamestop stood out like i mean sorry amc stood out like a sore thumb i was like wow this stock is cheap i think it when i bought it was like four dollars and it was so cheap it was four dollars it stood out had the same attributes as gamestop and then i saw the short squeeze a short seller percentage on it i was like yep it was on the nyse hit all my criteria that day i put down 10 grand on it u.s with my interactive broker account because that i had access i couldn't i can't short sell i can't buy anything i can actually buy stock that's all i can do on my brokerage account i use it for currency transfer from yen to australian dollars um and so i saw that and i put 10 grand out i i should have put more down in hindsight i was kicking myself because i was like it was just standing it was so i was so confident this was going to go up next day goes up to 19 bucks and i'm like and i'm like yep sell straight back and i was done with it so yeah that was that was my quick hit earlier in the year that was the only time i played the stock market and then now that was the only time i played the stock market and then um and then since then i've looked at buying put options on nvidia stock which my broker doesn't let me do so i wanted to buy some put options now on nvidia stock call it weird but hey that's my gut that's what kind of like yeah at the end of the day guys that's my research i just think we've hit like everything like we can check nvidia stock now um but that's my story on man hold on i just gotta wow uh we just gotta restart the background music this live stream has gone off for ages this is thanks for watching so far you guys are awesome uh but we'll check out nvidia stock right now let's get back to it so nvidia's stock price oh wow okay i like i saw it go i wanted to put in the put damn i wanted to put the put in around 300 i was looking i was like yep okay so i i i can't put the put option i cannot put the put option down with my broker they won't let me to it's not yeah this is not investment yeah okay i'm gonna say that this is what i i'm thinking of doing this okay i'm thinking of doing this i did amc then after nineteen dollars i didn't touch amc okay you could have ten yeah yes okay so you know i did all all this amc stuff i was here guys that was me this actually see that says 13 there that actually was 19 intraday that's when i did it right there like it was it was just picking up 3.50 and then i went to 19 bucks and i sold that was me and then i was out i didn't want to know about amc this is not yeah it's not financial advice bro that's it like yeah i'm saying what i'm doing that's it i'm doing this is what i'm doing i'm drinking green tea does it mean you should drink green tea yes it does mean you should drink green tea there's no downsides only upsides that's not that's health advice yeah that is health advice drink green tea but when it comes to finance i'm only telling you what i'm doing that's it and i can't do this next one i can't do it um okay so i can't do this next one okay so look yes amc went to sixty dollars yes i sold i could have i could have held on to amc i could have sold it to sixty dollars i could have uh 20x my money but it doesn't matter i forexed my money i went from ten thousand i had forty thousand us after that great little payday um yeah you could have would have should have bottom line is there's some i i think there's someone out there that bought at 60 and they're now looking at it at 29 so someone out there's put down 10 grand and they're down to 5 grand that money's changed hands so there it is that's how the game goes you know you make decisions based on the information at the time the information after that it had pumped amc looks terrible as a stock amc looks terrible right now it's in so much like its finances look horrible i don't know if you guys have been to an amc theater but it's i went to one in california i went to an amc theater in california and i thought i was walking into a bank and i was shocked because in australia you just walk into a cinema and you just buy your ticket your popcorn whatever it's free there's you know there's like a bullet like literally ask the dude at the amc counter i'm like what's with the bulletproof glass man like there's like it's like a bank you'd think going to a cinema to buy a 10 ticket it was it was absolutely crazy like what kind of an experience is that like it was just sad that was when i went to california anyway so yeah yeah we we're talking this is just a live stream we go on any any direction this is what a youtuber like the youtube chick who i was talking to she actually wanted me to livestream she's like live stream brian just you know you're good at it i was like okay thanks that's a good compliment but she's like you know your viewers want to talk about anything i was like yeah they do we're talking about amc stock we're meant to be tech but this was the one move i did in the stock market now the next move i want to do and i can't do it is buy put options for this that's all this i feel this right here is significantly overvalued look i like nvidia graphics cards don't get me wrong i like them but this stock if you guys remember nvidia did a stock split four to one uh earlier this year this stock would be close to what eleven hundred dollars right now a little over 1100 usd that's from a stock in 2019 there was a like i went down to 150 that's a 10x like has nvidia grown their 10x their shipments 10x no they haven't they haven't grown their business 10x are they going to grow 10x with what's to come i'd say no so my my opinion is i think nvidia's reached a peak i think from here on in they're going to go down to around 150 bucks people might laugh at me but i feel like in the next six months nvidia is going to drop big time uh am i going to try and get put options right now yeah that's what i'm going to try and do i don't care this is me i've done my research uh we can check out amd stuff amd stock price let's have a look 140 bucks there it is now they're in a bad position they're in a real bad position at 140 dollars because their cpus are overpriced right now intel's giving them hard competition on cpus and intel is giving a hard uh competition there and their gpus uh if crypto comes down that's that's a potential catalyst so i don't know that one like again i just know for me it's nvidia's heavily invested in gpus and i think crypto is on again that's just my opinion there so uh corsair gaming of course corsair went public they went public so i don't know too much about corsair 20 bucks i mean i haven't really looked into corsair i look i love of course they're a sponsor here at the channel too they're all like i love their stuff uh some of their stuffs like i'd say some of their lower end power supplies personally i wouldn't use it in a high-end rig or anything like that but this stuff's been pretty good this microphone is elgato corsair love it um i think it's one of the best mics you can get if you just want to easy i would i buy it would i buy it or sell it no i don't know like i haven't researched corsair gaming stock would i buy it or sell it i have no idea i just haven't researched it and honestly i don't have the time to research it i can check the volatility on it okay it's actually gone down wow okay so it went down from 45 dollars to 21 okay fascinating that's actually an interesting one okay corsair gaming so we got amd what about intel stock price this is the last one you should be so a hedge fund what a hedge fund would be doing let's describe what a hedge fund would be doing right a hedge fund would say um they'd be buying intel stock and selling amd stock that's what an intel that's what a hedge fund would be doing right now that would be one of the trades on their portfolio right now that's what a hedge fund this is what a hedge fund does this is what hedge funds do right they hedge so you're hedging intel against amd you're basically saying intel is going to outperform amd's stock and so that way they're shorting amd this is how hedge funds work right because in any market if a hedge fund's good enough they will make money even if the market's collapsing and you're like okay how did these how did these uh how did these some of these guys i mean like look at michael barry and and stuff like that they made a lot of money because they better one way in 2008 but there was hedge funds out there were betting two ways so basically you're a hedge fund right now you're buying intel stock and you're shorting amd stock so you're pitting one against the other so if the market collapses and intel goes down to thirty dollars amd might go down to fifty dollars they're still making money because they're countering one against the other so there it is um so there it is i i want like is that like finance chat is that what you want to talk about chat is that where you wanted to go you wanted me to go this way i went this way finance you wanted me to go this way we went that way we had to go there i guess we had to go there people asked me man so there it is we had to go there now we just got we're going to wind up we're going to wind down stream oh the gpu cover-up earlier if you guys are joining now the gpu cover up we have the video the guy deleted it since he was like he was is this a guy on twitter flexing i will show you right now this is the guy on twitter flexing i'll show you again is this the guy here i've since deleted his whole twitter account this is the guy flexing on twitter like straight up flex man and the thing was i don't care about the gpus he has it's the fact that he had all founders if we stop there they're all as cards man he had so many founders cards it was dodgy it reeked of like hey again it's like the little guy properly gets screwed that's what that was about and people are sick of it people like i guess it's only a so matter it's only a matter of time before the little guy gets sick of sin especially when you're flexing it right the little guy just gets sick of seeing it man because these cards were like they were strictly meant to go to one per person right especially the founders right every other if this was i wouldn't complain about this at all if there wasn't founders cards there i wouldn't care i just look at it and go okay another minor doing something but this was clearly clearly a dodgy backhand deal and that's what it was and it's the it's you know at a time when people can't buy a graphics card for christmas i hate it i hate seeing it and it's like you know you get over it it's sooner or later you speak out against it and that's what i did on twitter and that was you know this is the cover-up you know they say like oh i was buying them at retail and again unless he's got superman speed he's a kryptonian he ain't buying anything retail he's got a dodgy mate bought him up paid extra money for him through the supply chain and gamers got screwed again that's what it all was this one and that was the big cover-up we covered it earlier in the stream and uh yeah i got a video that he since deleted his twitter account but i screen capped it bang that's it baby i actually screen capped it with uh this program obs that's what i screen capped it with anyway there it is guys it was sad yeah it was sad we want to go positive we want to end this kryptonian that's actually true uh if yeah i guess the guy was kryptonian with a c not a k [Laughter] you know that's it i love you guys that's why we live stream man anything can happen anything can happen yeah there it is okay so he reckons he's pro i think but i think see the thing about the hx 170s i think i think um they you can procure like those deals with nvidia direct i think with the mining cards nvidia is doing direct deals and the thing about those mining cards is they're using the silicon that otherwise gets passed off um ah kevin hundred bucks brother whoa huge donation damn i was like i was gonna wind down the stream and i was like here feed me a hundred dollars i feel like damn i'm gonna feel guilty if i close the stream off after getting that donation whoa that was huge uh yeah they're kryptons yeah with a c that's it they're the fake kryptonians kevin 100 merry christmas treat yourself to a good feed and a night out if you can um yeah i'm definitely gonna treat uh i'm gonna go get some haze beers after this brother i gotta run down the supermarket i'm gonna get hayes beer i enjoy myself tonight thanks bro that was awesome really nice to you thank you so much you didn't have to do that you know you guys don't have to donate you don't have to do that super nice thank you so much that's actually really nice so you guys are awesome heart cymbals yeah throw them out i'm gonna throw one in chat as well anything you guys want to talk about we'll stay for a little bit longer we'll stay until this battery runs out on this camera this one might have cooled down by now i'll actually just quickly just wait just a second all right so we've been mine it's over three hours three hours of strain this is the longest live stream this is the longest tech yesterday live stream i've missed you guys you have wanted to chat and it's been so long it's been crazy please hang out much longer i'll hang out we'll do another half an hour max then i do actually have to start prepping for i gotta get on the shop to get some dinner ready and all that stuff um so yeah we'll we'll stick around for half an hour promise let's do it so let's get some juicy topics so we've covered we've covered inflation we've covered finance we've covered the broken market uh does brian have a girlfriend now oh man private quest i i it's kind of difficult at the moment it's complicated that's all i can say i that that one's it's just it it's it's kind of yeah it's i would talk about that but it's it's just a bit is it's uh one of those things i'll just let just that question you know i mean we'll leave that off the cards for now that's the one question we'll leave off hey brian uh would you go so far as to say it's time for gamers to rise up uh it's basically so again we've talked about this early in the stream it's not like the miners are a symptom of a much greater problem and that's why like when people say oh you hate mine i don't hate miners i like you know like i'm friend you know son of a tech i'm good friends with son of a tech uh you know the guy's a cool guy very just casual dude you see what you see is what you get i talk to son of a tech he's a hardcore minor this guy is like mining mining mining but he's an honest guy that's what it is so a game is rising up against miners don't pit yourself to that sort of us versus their mentality the only us versus them we need right now is the corruption going on in our politics it's huge and it needs to be called out and gamers need to join out the rest of the people in calling this stuff out because it's ridiculous it gets ridiculous after a while so gamers can rise up but you just gotta understand where the problem is really coming from and that's coming from the money printer that's where it all is plain and simple all our problems that have been caused since the start of 2020 having caused even before that the money printers have been causing problems for a long time yeah so that's it ah so there it is now we know we've already touched on politics so we've already done that we touched on it lightly okay that's it but yeah gamers need to join the rest of the people rising up against tyranny that's the problem anyway that's what it is rise up fellas yeah that's what's going on right now just a load of woof woofy woofitty that's what it is a load of woofity woofity i had another word a load of woofity woofity so yeah that's it they need to shut the printers and this is the thing the best resource you can get is watching some of the old school stuff that like this is all history repeats now the only problem is it's history repeats with the middle and and lower class being poorer than they ever were that's all it is so um but the best the best leaders the best dictators um there's some in history we look at julius caesar there were some in history there are leaders out there that are good leaders and they love the people they're the best leaders so you got to ask yourself does your leader i think like i look at florida like if i look at a place like florida apparently the local government there from what i see i don't know i don't live in florida but the local government in florida loves the people they're standing up for the people and so that's like something i see and so you know it depends on the person but the best leaders are the ones that love the people they make the rule book fair they here's the rules make them fair for everyone that's all that's i think that's all people are asking for it's a fair go and that's all like that's where i come from i come from the land of fair go so you know look at me i built this whole channel up off a dumpster like off hunting at used uh japanese junk stores did i ever think i'd be doing youtube videos and making you know working with the latest review samples and stuff no i had no idea when i first went to a i used i just wanted to say hey like look how cool this is i got a a q 9 550 cpu for 20 bucks and i could sell it for 80 bucks and i could make a budget gaming pc you know because at japan japan was really good japan had like japan had a much better system than what you know a lot of other places have japan was like you know didn't restrict the little i mean when you restrict the little guy and you don't give them a chance i think that's when people get frustrated so alandria rubio 5 donation thanks brother also texas i live in california and trust me it's crazy here so no far more take ah yeah i heard i i've actually been hearing stories all over the place man um but yeah like you want to when it comes to voting you want to vote in someone who loves the people you know that's who i'm voting for at the next delay the person i can see who loves the people that's all it is they want to let everyone have a fair go rather than taking bribes and all this other crap that goes on it's so dirty anyway now al ansari aed thanks for the donation brother too thank you so much you didn't have a question uh what is your personal rig specs okay this is gonna like this one here i'm gonna be strapped review sample 10980xe uh 128 gigabytes corsair dominator memory i i begged corsair for that memory and they came through uh rtx 3080 from aurus and we've got a capture card uh h4 sorry the 420 mil h170i elite capel x and we've got a two terabyte m.2 it's not it's tlc i'd love to get an mlc drive for video editing but that's my personal rig at the moment now i got the 12 900k so we've got two of them sent in this is how weird it was like i got two 12 900k so one was from asrock asrock were adamant they're like give this away we want to do a giveaway do you accept i'm like yep cool viewers are going to get a 1200k and then i got the one from intel the 1200k thing is i haven't even desired i haven't had the desire to build a 1200k system because the 10980xe this is based off the 7980xe by the way which has been out for i believe close to four years it's really good like video editing is so good on this thing i don't need a better computer now so if i get to that stage where i'm not having problems with my pc i just don't really care it's weird it's going to sound weird right should i put the 12 900k in there and go yeah it's so much better and flex i don't need to this thing does everything i want it to so i mean it is a really high-end system admittedly but you know like it's weird it's like one of the first years where i just haven't really cared for wanting to get better specs and stuff like that um so brian i'll speak to our governor here in florida tell me what we need to do and to get you to bring your talents to miami florida to fulfill your destiny become a florida man also caribbean thanks nori ss you're in florida that's uh thanks for the donation he's from florida i think that's why he's got the big donations like thanks brother but yeah to get me over there into florida i don't know like we our government needs to let people out of the country for starters so apparently i'm not allowed to leave australia because i i have no idea why again the logic makes no sense for me why i'm not allowed to leave and see my son because apparently i should be depressed and i should be being my own worst enemy rather than going see my son so anyway that's that one so hype for the 12 980 xe yeah i would be hyped for that i would be actually really hyped for that because that would be huge uh do you think crypto have any future his financial asset yes but again crypto has to prove it's crypto has a lot of proving to do man like when it really comes down to it the only actual useful one right now i believe is xrp when it comes down to crypto uh if you if you guys use international money transfers you'll know how powerful xrp is right now xrp is actually not bad it's a useful cryptocurrency uh funnily enough it hasn't uh gained from the speculative mania that bitcoin and ethereum has but xrp is actually useful actually useful for instance i can send my son money for christmas from australian dollars he gets it into his account in five minutes and that's because the system i'm using is based off xrp so xrp is actually useful and when it can do that when something can better something that's already when it can better when it create more productivity and more service then it's actually got value so that's at the moment i tried ethereum i ran for the hills i tried ethereum i was like what is this doing it was this like sluggish fifty dollars for a transaction like hey you want to buy your kid a hundred dollar christmas present uh wait up uh fifty dollar transaction oh okay he gets half the present of what he previously had hey son here's your um half uh toy car yeah it's chopped why is it chopped in half dad oh i bought it on the ethereum network anyway that's uh [Music] have you made a video about engineering sample qualifying sample intel extreme edition uh cpus they are pretty cheap on ebay and x299 boards are still in production no actually i haven't okay thanks for the hint travis you legend i will check that out even on live stream let's have a look how much a 79 gotta pull the chat off how much a 7980xc is on aliexpress because that's a really good cpu trust me it's the one i've got right now it is a 7980xe really when you look at it same thing just refresh two times 7980xc let's have a look oh that's pretty hexy that's pretty expensive i'm not sure where the engineering samples are coming in okay i can't see any engineering samples of it maybe i've got to put a space there okay is there another one you want me to try 7980xc like i can only find one for 686 dollars 12 900k from what i gather i haven't i gotta test i got to pit them against each other still again one of those bucket lists thing no sorry one of those on the to-do list and bucket list would be seeing my son [Laughter] the way things are going um uh 700 686 would you be better off buying a 12 900k that's the question so you know that's it's the expensive price to pay for it like i was hoping maybe we could get an ngo sample for 300 bucks that'd be insane because you can get the 26 99 v3 18 calls 36 threads this is insanely cheap for 18 cause 36 threads insanely cheap that is crazy cheap so so basically yeah that's it uh pc giveaway tonight so we did all the giveaways pc giveaways in two weeks gonna be in the new year my man so i'm gonna be drawing the new i'm gonna be drawing the win on the new year so stay tuned that's in the video so yeah there's the 18 callers 60 36 threads that is did i say 16 thread eight so 18 cost 36 threads for 187 dollars so uh landro rubio thanks for the two dolls a question if you want how hard is it not seeing your boy it's hard man yeah like that i like i think i'm okay now do you know any japanese height nissan [Laughter] i've come to terms with it so in 2021 i've come to terms with it um and i realized that what i've applied to youtube and it's funny because youtube's been the best teacher for me in so many ways this channel and you guys i've had to grow up a lot through this channel right and so it teaches you to accept things like keep on keep on don't give up sort of thing that's the biggest thing with tech yesterday don't give up don't give up so he has a japanese channel he never uploads to that is true right that is true marco priorities man priorities man um how about mandarin josh absolutely no that is not happening i cannot speak mandarin i remember you know in university this is a true story i had a a friend i was to be like i don't know i can't like okay i was doing something for them and they were paying me money that's all i can say because i don't know if there's any implications if it's dodgy or not it was helping them anyway they were chinese friend they would do me like uh the chinese bubble tea i love that that was cool but very kind of like kind of not good for your teeth i don't think anyway the bubble tea was good and then they were trying to teach me mandarin and i was like i for the life of me i i remember i was trying to pronounce words i was trying so hard too and i just was i was butchering it all the time now like like i think after like 20 minutes of trying to even say one word i just gave up mandarin is so hard to speak properly like if you're coming in learning it japanese is okay japanese you can learn that uh it's a pretty cut and dry language uh mandarin is like another level i you know can you speak australian yeah mate hugh w mate what do you want me to say man you got jar jar you mate yeah you know hey you can come in with the live stream it's up to you guys i can talk a bit of australian you you know come down me uh gotta get me old man uh six pack of beer just straight after this live stream fellas so yeah just join in on after after we do it mates just join on in just speak a bit of australian if you want to hear what's going on how hard is it to learn mate it's not too hard you just got to know where you come from and you know so the best way to like the best way to talk any language japanese and everything like i learned japanese at the bar so i just like before that i tried studying it and i couldn't i couldn't even like yeah studying wasn't for me talking and getting out i think that's for me everyone has different personalities i like to go out there and get in the action so that's the best way for me member for 25 months merry christmas brian are you a christian um i like born i i was baptized and i'm gonna be honest with you guys i've thinking i've been lately it's been on my mind and this is the thing it's been on my mind to become born again like that's what the term is so that means to become like you know i want to be born again because i've got a lot of christian friends and they're the loveliest people i know people like you know they they go on about religion blah blah blah like for me i it's not a focus of mine but i've just realized there's so many lovely christian people christian people throughout my whole life i haven't met one christian person that i didn't like or had a problem with so i've got this experience in my life and chris thanks for the five dollar donate love it brother thanks for the joint for 25 months too but the like i've met christians throughout my life and every time i've met them i've been met with nothing but kindness so it's like okay if i become christian am i you know i've got to look into it because i you know if i become a christian you know i want to do the same thing i want to be nice to people i mean but the thing is i've got this i've got a different attitude where it's like you be i'm stern like i i'm i've got to see what i'm struggling with and i'd ask a christian is uh you know could i become christian when my motto is treat others how they treat you that is literally my like that's how i live by if someone wants to come up to me and be a complete you know a-ho then i'm going to be that back to them and that's i mean i don't think that's very christian like so that's that's sort of what i've been struggling right now you know what i mean so but i love christian people i got a lot of christian friends loveliest people so i've never had a bad ex like never had a bad experience with all the christians i've met throughout my life so people can rag on religion all they want but when i was in japan as well i've got a story about a christian guy i know that his name was justin awesome guy such a lovely person he stood up for me at my job and he's just like it's almost sentimental man i don't want to go on about but the story goes a bit deeper than that but you know in time of need there has been christians that have pulled forward for me and that's all i'm going to say and it's made me want to convert [Music] but i just don't know as an individual if i'm if i'm you know if i'd be worthy if i'd be able to because i'm not going to change my way i believe in what i believe in is in i believe in that kind of old school treat others how you treat yourself and treat others how they treat you so there it is so it's you know so i don't know like if christians are out there could i um you know if christians are out there could they you know would they accept me that's the thing and i don't want to change so you know okay so you can christians are called to judge people discernment of good versus evil cool okay all right brothers well i'll look into that so you know yeah that's it like that's what i mean like one of my favorite bands pod they're christian as well like i just love the way they talk if you watch them in interviews it's just how you roll man like if you're gonna do bad by people then you're gonna get bad done by you and i believe in that so if that's the way christians roll too it's like it's good you know no giveaways worldwide giveaways are worldwide so anyway um okay it's very possible okay cool now we're covering now we're covering religion man now we're covering religion oh we've got we've done it all in the live stream we've gone full circle we've gone full circle here guys whoa that's okay i don't know but that's what happens what happens on a tech yeah city live stream brothers um so five dollars from alandrio rubio five dollars thanks brother you've been donating all stream thanks so much i used to be a hardcore atheist and i 100 agree with you yeah check out rob skibber work uh no matter what you say pod yeah brother thanks man yeah i love like i wouldn't see i i went saw pod live before uh the lockdowns and stuff that was like my last concert i went to and i absolutely loved it you know so you know it's just like yeah who are we to judge yeah that's what i mean so that's what i mean i agree with some of the things like do i believe in like you know do i believe in an angel flying down flapping his wings like no i don't like so there's certain things i believe but i believe in one thing and that's with my experiences right so when it comes to religion my experiences with people themselves and every christian person i've met without fail has been absolutely amazing to me took me in cooked me dinner etc and that's what i love about christianity is the people so yeah that's that's what i mean you can you know are you atheist at the core whatever you can be proud whatever you do what you want but it's so it's so weird like it's so weird like my views on religion before you know 10 years ago you would ask me i'd be like no it's for crazy people but now i'm like well it's for me it's it's it's a way of life you know and that's you start to listen to some of the interviews of people that are you know turn to christianity and you listen to what they say and you're like yeah it's about you know believing in the better of people as well there's a lot of things to it so yeah there we go so yeah man we've done everything so uh we've done religion economics politics but it's really so i mean i was baptized as i was a kid i remember it's like my first memory like one of my first memories of being alive was i was just dunked in the water and i was like oh like i remember just coming out of the water like almost choking so um love your brother as you are thanks guys yeah i love all you guys as well we just yeah keep on keep on and don't change who you are that's it so yeah that's that's what it's all about man staying true to your grass roots never change who you are man always pass the good on brothers so yeah that's what i mean i think faith can save this world so that's one thing because yeah from what i'm saying is a lot you know 2021 is definitely worse than 2019 2020 was definitely worse than 2019 so that was one thing i know that's for sure so i found two cars two cars 1660 super for 184 and 118 euros refurbished should i buy them or is it risky they give a two year warranty it was a legit two year warranty yeah i mean that's that's an easy like that's an easy pick up in this current environment so yeah as long as they work as long as you're not getting hosed make sure you don't get hosed just make sure like if they want bank deposit and they want you to buy over the internet paypal get your buyer protection abide in christ 10 donation thanks brother for our gospel come not unto you in word only but also in power and also holy ghost and in much assurance okay i i will have to after the stream i i kind of you know that's um thank you brother i i you know there it is okay so good night good night brothers yeah we're gonna wind down the stream soon as well so i've been i think we're approaching four hours for our tech yes city live stream you guys have had so much tech yes city it's not funny you guys it's going crazy so it has gone crazy yeah so uh you guys are rooting for me man i'm rooting for yous as well so that's [Music] that's it man we're doing this it's too bad shipping is so much in the u.s so our equivalent of gumtree craigslist is dead and everyone on facebook marketplace and us thinks they have a pile of precious metals worth thousands uh it's mainly gpus man it's mainly gpus that's what i'm finding uh what about running a gtx 1080 ti still viable even though running an amd fx 6300 yeah that's a fine combo man that should do most games some games you might have trouble with the cpu but that's um that was it so yeah a lot of people are getting tired man yeah i think i mean we could make it to fif we can make it to four hours officially but i think everyone's getting sort of like yeah i gotta go out and get some food soon so i have made it this is a huge stream and thanks so much guys for tuning in so we will that's a jar jar mug that's not a fox mug that's a jar jar binks from star wars i've had this mug i found it this is okay before we get on out of here we'll explain the story for the guys who don't know i found this for a deal uh in japan it was when i was first parts hunting for pc parts i saw star wars mugs i forgot how cheap they were but they were really cheap and i bought the darth maul i bought the uh the jar jar i think there was an r2d2 as well um the r2d2 the problem with that one was the handle fell off so the r2d2 didn't pass the test right jar jar has been a champion he has lasted so long and been an absolutely amazing companion for a cup and uh after that like after i got the mug i started appreciating jar jar more so yeah that's it uh so aussie how's your burger tech with my health problems i do hope you're right and i'm wrong with the whole god thing it's like it's not about being right or wrong man at the end of the day it's like for me like when i talk about religion i'm talking about the people that's in the things that you know the face like so it depends on how i you know i've got a different view on religion than i had 10 years ago too so i guess i guess age and time humbles anyone and that's the truth it humbles everyone man and that's the truth you've probably seen a more humble tech yesterday than you saw four years ago too in age and time man that'll humble anyone so that's it so don't worry and uh that's all there is to it brother so anyway i gotta go get something to eat my stomach in my belly this is a huge livestream the biggest on history you guys are you guys are definitely definitely worth it i have loved every minute of this live stream we've gone through so many tangents and we will continue to go through tangents that's what technically live streams about and thanks for the donations everyone thanks for the memberships as well a giveaway winners make sure you have put those comments in i will get back to you do be a little bit patient as well over the christmas with the giveaways they will get out to you it can take up to a month to even get some of these items so do be patient as well don't you know i've had guys you know in the past they've won the giveaways and like where's my item where's my item every like two days it's like you know i and um except that gigabyte motherboard i don't have control over these uh giveaways like corsair's sending out the corsair stuff and um corsair is standing out this the corsair stuff and asrock sending out the azeroth stuff the keys we've already given those away uh we will actually do one more giveaway i almost forgot i was like man there's one more thing we can give away a hoodie as well we can give away a hoodie corsair wanted to give away a hoodie they wanted to give me one and give you guys one as well they did say that so who wants to win a hoodie who wants to win a hoodie and then we'll get on out of here then we'll get on out of here okay one more for the road one more for the road one more for the road yes giveaways international for the hoodie okay [Music] and what i'm gonna do for this giveaway for the hoodie okay if you want the hoodie what i'm going to do is i want you after the live stream is closed so we're going to close down the live stream too this is this is that simple everyone comment and i'm going to a random comment generator so in the actual comments of this video i'm gonna close down the live stream i'm gonna put the random generator video on twitter someone's gonna win a hoodie okay so just comment in the actual comment section not on live stream and that way it's just fair it's a random generator so it's going to pick a random user that's the fairest way to do it i think because all you guys are watching the live stream you're all supporting the channel and that's the best way to do it so just yeah when you win that hoodie just comment on the after the live stream so there it is that's the easiest way that's all i can think of because i'm running out of options that's all i can think of so brian please do you have a spare gpu please man are you local like if you're i'm not posting a spare gpu it just costs heaps to post stuff from australia i'll post it for the giveaway but i'm gonna ask gigabyte to pay for the postage uh for me to post
