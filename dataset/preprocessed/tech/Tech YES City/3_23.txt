so this gaming pc right here you may recognize it from the recent video we did where it was an under 300 us dollar budget build however after i finished benchmarking and presenting the video i noticed later that night the build just shut off randomly and then after that it started giving out some very weird issues for instance the keyboard would shut off sometimes and then the whole build would just freeze after that would lock up and of course the blue screen of death that came up every now and then and i realized there was something wrong with this pc and i crossed my fingers i hope it wasn't an actual hardware problem where if it was would then have to replace that part out and of course that just cost money but thankfully it wasn't that and we're gonna go through today the steps that we took in order to get this build running a hundred percent especially since i'm going to flip this and move on with the build on to the next project never pay full price for windows 10 or 11 again with today's video sponsor scd keys you can get activated as little as fifteen dollars using that coupon bftyc links in description below welcome back to tech yeah city the first thing you'll notice here is that these power cables are all loose i actually undid them because i thought i'd try a different power supply and that was the first thing that came to my mind when it started shutting off randomly i thought okay maybe this used power supply is not good since i have in the past had power supplies that even passed a power supply test meter but then would later on have a weird fault where the pc would shut off randomly it is rare but it can happen however once i swapped this power supply out for this one right here the behavior still continued the blue screens popped up the random shutting down popped up and then after that it was actually pretty consistent to the point where if i booted up unigine heaven i could do one test that would make it pretty much crash all the time and that was just yeah trying to run the unigine heaven benchmark and so after this test what i did was i thought okay maybe it's the cpu speeds i tried down clocking the cpu turning off the intel boost settings turning off the eist setting and even doing something like underclocking the base clock just three percent because usually this likes to sit between 97 to 103 that's usually the range for this so giving it three percent less may just be that whole sweet spot to get the build running fine especially with since we're using an i7 3770 and that is an older cpu itself so it could be sort of running past it's used by date so after that i was like well could it be the motherboard could it be the system memory and so what i managed to do in windows is i typed in the windows memory diagnostic tool and if you run this you can it'll restart your computer and it'll test out all your system memory and tell you if there's any errors now this isn't as thorough as mem test but i've never had a memory stick that passed this test and was faulty so i guess that says something for windows memory diagnostic tool usually takes around 20 to 30 minutes may take a little bit longer if you've got a lot more memory to go through but with 16 gigabytes takes around 20 to 30 minutes but after that test it finished and then we got back to windows pc kept crashing i thought okay it's either now of course the motherboard or the cpu i did rule out the gpu because the gpu i that day i was playing apex for a few hours it's almost certain with gpus you'll have a problem with the first 10 minutes of using it on a stressful test or playing games or indefinitely within the first half an hour something will go wrong and usually it's a driver error the whole system won't actually shut off unless you've got a power supply problem to your graphics card so that left us now with the motherboard and cpu to go through and i had this thing in the back of my head i was like okay i took the cpu out the i7370 and i remembered with ivy bridge that's third generation intel instead of using solder on the cpu they actually use a cheap thermal paste and i do say cheap because this stuff dried out before it was even shipped so this thermal paste i remember this stuff causing a few problems i just didn't think it would cause such irrational behavior on my system so going through this what i did was i delidded it and since i didn't have my tools with me from australia i had to kind of resort to using the tripod and screwing that off just with like my pliers and that did the job it managed to delete the cpu and then from there we cleaned off the glue and then we put some gd900 on somali express budget thermal paste works absolutely amazing definitely recommend this stuff and then after that we put the cpu back in booted it all up and the good news was this whole thing started working properly again the whole pc and i have tested this now for over a day and i'm happy to say that this system is running 100 i have been playing games on i actually did the whole gtx 970 video came into absolutely no problems not one so this pc is running 100 and so now we've fixed the issue and everything is working fine i will say with pc problems they can range from so many different things where if you've only through really through experience you get to know what to look out for with a pc but definitely testing one thing at a time i never would have thought that the cpu itself would be fine but the thermal pace would have caused it to be unstable to the point where the temperatures were still okay and this is where it comes down to you guys would be like brian surely you would have tested this in cinebench and ran the test and the temperatures you would have seen that come out and that's where i did do those tests i did run cinebench on that pc it's one of the first things i do and the temperatures were absolutely fine that's what bothers me and in the games the temperatures of the cpu were fine and even after changing the thermal paste we're not a huge difference in temperatures from what we were getting before with the stock thermal paste but one thing that i do guess what was happening was that there was a hot spot that wasn't being picked up from the actual temperature sensors on the cpu and this is the problem that can happen with a cpu a very rare problem in this case where changing the thermal paste that covered the whole die allowed it to connect with the integrated heat spreader and then that then allowed that hot spot to sort of not be a problem anymore which was very surprising going through the motions i never thought deleting a cpu that didn't have a problem with bad temperatures to begin with would have solved the issue of stability so that's one thing to look out for very odd problem in the end and so cpu problems they can come about they're not that common but i will say one thing the more this older stuff does get used as time goes on eventually they will meet their maker and they will find the tombstone so that is the unfortunate sort of trajectory of some of these older parts but one thing is you can always get more life out of them by either lowering the speeds or upping the voltage and they'll last for years even after that and that's sort of one thing i always test for with the hardware is seeing where the clock speeds versus the default voltages line up with because over time basically the parts get burnt out so to speak and they keep working but they just require more voltage to run at the same speed because they're degrading over time anyway guys with that aside i hope you enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to hit that like button also do keep in mind that this is a very rare problem it's an extremely weird problem that'll prop up most of the time if there is a problem due to thermal pace between the integrated heat spreader and the silicon itself that's going to prop up straight away with temperatures you're going to see those temperatures go sky high straight away and you'll know that's the problem this itself which is such a rare problem in terms of making a hot spot that i was only able to see after actually taking it off and changing the thermal paste and then seeing that the computer was stable after that so do keep in mind that only a certain few generations from intel did carry this thermal paste for instance the generation before that sandy bridge the i7 2600 for example that use soldering and then recently with intel's chips they've brought solaring back and then pretty much the majority of amd chips i believe they use soldering too in other words if you try to delid those cpus you're actually going to destroy the cpu in the process so there is that and also there's one more thing with the h77 motherboard we had a budget gigabyte motherboard here today so for me i couldn't actually change the cpu core voltage on this motherboard which was a little bit surprised because usually mostly h77 motherboards they will allow you to change the cpu core voltage but i couldn't change it on this one so what i did was i underclocked the cpu instead because that voltage is fixed underclocking it will then see if it's the cpus just degrading over time but most of the time you will have with motherboards the ability to change the cpu core voltage and so you can do that by just simply manually upping that value and that'll allow you to instead of changing all these other speed settings you just check if your cpu needs a bump in voltage perhaps anyways without aside we got the question of the day here which comes from billy boy and they asked the five-year warranty sounds good but how good are they at honoring that and this is in relation to the western digital sn 570 video that we did in the recent video and it says five years limited and professional installation recommended on the box so be interesting to know so with the recommended professional installation that's just a recommendation that's got nothing to do with your warranty in terms of you getting the product itself the warranty does have the limitation in that if you've used this drive way too heavily over that five years then what will happen is they'll say well look you've had fair use on this drive so it's actually going to fall out of warranty so i believe they've got their endurance rating there with the terabytes written so once you go over that limit then it's out of warranty but if you're under that limit and the drive fails within five years you'll get the replacement i think that's breaking it down in that manner keep in mind though if you are doing extreme data intensive work in a professional environment definitely go for a higher end drive from any of the manufacturers that give you a massive tbw rating so that's always one thing to look at when you're looking at warranty though for most casual people that warranty will be absolutely fine even if you're doing um video editing and whatnot though for me personally i do do 4k video editing in really high bit rates so i do need a drive that is going to last the distance because i'm constantly dropping probably 100 200 gigabytes every video on the drive and so i quickly do get up to that terabytes written quota quite quickly so it all depends on what you do but hopefully that solves that question for you and with that aside i will catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one also do let us know in the comment section below have you had any bizarre problems like the one that we saw with this gaming pc right here love reading those thoughts and opinions as always and i'll catch in the next one peace out for now bye [Music]
