[Music] you guys have been asking me to build a pc with the 26 78 v3 has well this is 12 cores 24 threads and it's some of the best price performance that the useon market has to offer and since the rtx 3070 has just been released if you manage to get one of these around msrp you can make yourself a whole pc with the best of new and used for under 900. and that's exactly what we're going to be doing now some of the best points of today's build is that we've got 32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory and we couple this in with the quad channel support on this motherboard right here and we can not only get some really good gaming performance but it also will double down as a 4k video editing powerhouse and i'm going to be testing this out towards the end of the video against my 3950x workstation where i currently use that and i want to see how much of a difference it has where i'm going to be editing this whole video on today's build just to tell you guys if this build is really that good price performance another thing i'll also do is get this 3070 and test it on a 10 900k and then compare it to this 2678v3 to see if you're losing out on much performance and to see just how good of a value build this can really be now with that out of the way let's get this thing built up with some quality used and new parts where we've got the 4000d here which is coming in at 80 usd this is the white and gray version where they've got kind of like this yellow accent also thrown in in some parts of the case and it does look neat but i wonder how it does perform in terms of dissipating heat so we will check that out later and then last of all in terms of dissipating heat you guys have wanted me to check out this intel stock cooler that i got gifted to me in a used parts hunt recently that i did here on the channel [Music] and here our pc is all done it is finished and there's two little problems that happened with this pc well they're not really problems because we're gonna fix them right now but the first being the cooler is pretty loud and in order to change that we're going into the bios and just manually set the fan speeds down now this could be bad if the cooler can't saturate all the heat with the fan speed and it overheats but we'll find that out later the second thing is we've got to flash a custom bios onto this x99 board right here in order to do the full turbo unlock now one thing i've just checked for here is you can see here i've got test pilot well i call it testpilot.bin because this board in particular the machine is bought even though it's pretty cheap on aliexpress the one drawback is is that it does have two different versions where one is an eight megabyte version and another is a 16 megabyte version so you can see here the backup file i've made is the eight megabyte version so that's not a problem for us because we can now just move along and we can see here i've got two different biases ready and i downloaded them from a website a russian website and so the russian guys they know what they're doing when it comes to x99 bosses custom biases these guys know their stuff so we've got this custom bus we're going to load this in right now and then boot to windows and see if everything worked out okay [Music] um [Music] now and the results are now in for this gaming pc right here and first thing i'm going to say is the value going forward with building pcs is going to be so much better than it ever was for instance this pc right here the whole pc costs less than a 2080 ti did brand new and we've got half the components in this build which are brand new so i love what the value is bringing at the end of 2020. the second thing i'm going to address of course is people going to say every time i do a video now on xeons there's always people just comment rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and i'm all for ryzen i do budget builds here on the channel with ryzen cpus in fact recently i did a 600 gaming pc with all brand new parts with a ryzen 3 3100 and it was phenomenal value for money and in fact if you can afford ryzen cpus go out and buy a ryzen they are really good but this cpu right here it's coming in at 80 something dollars shipped internationally and this is one of the few zeons that still makes sense and in fact a lot of the times i'm gonna be the first to admit here in 2020 the first gen and even the second and third gen xeons their kind of their value and their appeal is definitely fading away especially with the first gen stuff which doesn't support avx and then the second and third generation not supporting avx2 which is coming into effect in some of these games that we're testing but what we're seeing right here with this cpu is performance that matches pretty well with the 3070 providing you're playing at a higher resolution because the 1080p results here when we look at shadow of the tomb raider it was being limited at 1080p where the 10900k was soaring ahead but if we start stopping it down to 1440p and then 4k we're starting to level out the fps even versus 10 900k moving over next to horizon zero dawn showed that at 1080p this was kind of following a similar trend to shadow of the tomb raider except there was one big difference here and i actually couldn't figure this out because when we undervolted our gpu the fps was a lot better at both 1080p and 1440p and i'll add these numbers in for the graphs for you guys where i was kind of surprised but if we look at the under vaulting on this pc it also dropped the power consumption down from roughly 370 to 380 watts down to 300 to 310 watts so under vaulting this system you're going to be playing games and doing all your workload with pretty much a max power consumption draw of 300 watts which was very impressive and then we move over to warzone and the fps was very good on this game if you had 144 hertz monitor you're going to get an amazing experience playing warzone on this pc and this was all max settings across these games that we tested the ultra settings the last game we tested was the fort nightmares update and here the 10900k especially at 1080p does pull a fair few frames ahead or actually a significant amount at 1080p then 1440p it does start to window out a bit where we can see even with the uh 2678v3 xeon the 1080p to 1440p there's no difference in fps we're pretty much cpu bound at both these resolutions so the 2678 does have a few limitations when it comes to pure gaming where it maxes out at 3.3 gigahertz all cores though the 12 cores 24 threads and we'll show this soon because i'm going to edit the rest of this part of this video out on this pc right behind me here it does start to do very well in things like premiere pro and other applications because we've got 32 gigabytes of ram in this build that'll be able to handle a 4k video edit now i do like to edit with 64 gigabytes of ram personally at 4k i find sometimes especially if you've got a very large amount of clips you can come into some problems with 32 gigabytes it's just my personal experience but for what it's worth we'll go through that experience very soon and keep an update for you guys but really when it comes down to this whole building question nothing was really bad everything worked out a-okay the power consumption was very well controlled even the temperatures weren't too bad where i'll pull up a graph here showing that the 4000d even without undervolting the gpu where i put the fan speeds on 100 and i left the xeon cooler and we'll talk about that soon that maxed out at 72 degrees and then the gpu maxed out 64 degrees with the side panel on taking the side panel off it went down only 2 degrees to 70 degrees and 62 degrees respectively across the cpu and the gpu meaning this case even out of the box with the 2 120mm fans installed does a pretty solid job of cooling and to quickly talk about the 4000d corsair did send this over and they asked me to take a look at it and i was really surprised at not just the aesthetics but also the build quality for 80 bucks really good value for money case the temperatures and the airflow are really good even out of the box where this one see closed off version which is actually not closed off at all there's a lot of room there for air to come in there's also a meshed version too but i found this version of the case to just look super clean and it's funny with corsair it feels like they've got two disciplines within the company one is just full-blown rgb and do whatever it takes to get led lights going on and then there's this other discipline which this is what the 4000d is where everything just is super clean and the build quality and the thoughtful planning in the case it's just flawless and that's what i like about this case right here if you guys are in that market for something that's super easy to build in and just has all the bells and whistles in terms of even like a usb type-c at the front then this case is going to be it i was really impressed with what this case brought to the table now the cooler itself we'll quickly talk about the xeon cooler that you guys asked me to check out i actually wanted to check out this thing too this cooler wasn't that good i mean i got it for free and that's probably why it's not that good but the manual fan speeds when i set it at 25 it just didn't cool this xeon properly at all when i said at 50 it was kind of struggling i could see it creeping up but then i found a happy balance between noise and temperatures at 75 manual fan speeds where it didn't overheat but it did take the cpu to 72 degrees now i was in 28 degree ambience so things are starting to heat up if i do look a little bit sweaty in this video that's because things in good old queensland where i'm living at the moment it's starting to heat up and the rest of you guys right now are probably going into winter soon but that's just things are upside down you guys already know this in australia or is it downside up that is the question [Applause] but to cut things short everything in this build checks out and if you want to go down this route then i can easily recommend it except for maybe the xeon cooler that was ju just made the cut for me personally where i would definitely in hindsight go out and get a snowman cooler and it will do a much better job in terms of cooling and noise and it'll also add a bit of bling especially since it's got the white fan it would match this white 4000 d build perfectly though the last thing to talk about is the cx750m that we use today for the money that we paid for it it's definitely a good buy but it's not the best power supply you can get in fact when we're undervolting the rtx 3070 we didn't have to give it an extra 30 millivolt because the ripple suppression isn't as good as a more expensive power supply so depending on what power supply you get if you get a really high end power supply with low ripple you'll be able to take your under vaulting on your rtx 3070 3080 or if you're getting a 6800 xt you'll be able to take it that bit lower and speaking of the graphics cards the rtx 3070 great value 4.99 if you can get the azus jewel at that price which they should i'm told they're coming into stock by this time you see this video and between the end of the year if you're really hunting for one of these cards you should be able to get one by the end of the year but the 6800 xt i'm looking forward to that a lot as well i think the gravis card market is really shaking things up where those older flagship cards are just not worth it and in hindsight we could see that they were very overpriced compared to what's coming out at the end of this year where the value propositions of these new cards is looking really good so i can't wait to check out the 6800 xt but in the meantime if you get a 3070 you have definitely or you will definitely not be making a bad choice anyways we're going to jump across to this 12 core right here edit this video out and then come back with a question of the day let's see how this thing [Music] performs [Music] so finishing up editing on this pc things were surprisingly better than the last time i edited on the 2678v3 so maybe adobe are finally getting optimizations right and this is something that i have noticed on a particular cpu that's coming out next month but you've got to stay tuned for that review because we'll talk about that later but for what it's worth pc we've got here phenomenal value for money if you can afford a bit more then of course go with a bit more but if you've just got 900 bucks and you want some of the best value for money in terms of a pc that'll double down as a workstation and will play games and it's got a pretty good feature set and it doesn't use up a whole lot of power then this one is definitely going to be one worth considering one more good thing especially about the cpu the ram and the motherboard is that you can get these for worldwide shipped prices that we've mentioned in the video here so that means anyone even living in some place in iceland will wait no probably not iceland but someplace that i guess prices are higher than what they would be in the usa or australia for example you can get a better deal than getting ripped off locally so that's one good thing about the three components here in that bare bones portion one more amazing piece of news is that we've got the rtx 3080 our pre-order has come through so the next video will be the 100 flip up challenge we're going to get that going again and i will say if you're in the market for a 30 70 or a 30 80 or a 30 90 you just have to be on the ball i'd say a lot of the major retailers are all booked out with orders but even then i did see 3090s coming into stock at australian retailers even right now at i guess decent prices in terms of what ebayers are charging versus what the retailers are charging where scorptek had one for 2 700 aussie dollars so that's like you can just buy that right now to get shipped to you so they are getting the stock will get alleviated as time goes on and i got a comment in about a 30 70 someone paying 1500 aussie dollars for it i mean if you're happy with that sure but i just i wouldn't pay that personally for a 30 70 knowing that they will be or at least they are being sold for around a thousand aussie dollars like that's what um the person who i got this pre-order off said that they were getting him in for and selling them and so 1500 doesn't feel a little bit too steep on that 30 70 purchase my man but other than that we've got the question of the day which asks about the logitech g3 now this is a mouse that i used 10 years ago and it's pretty much it was pretty much discontinued and they don't make the g3 anymore then there was this period where they didn't really make a mouse that succeeded it but nowadays if you're in the market for a logitech g3 i would just suggest getting a g102 or a g203 and they can be had for even 20 bucks shipped internationally where they're got a better sensor on them and of course they've been updated so there's no point getting the g3 even though i still have two of them in my studio here today one of them is actually used for the input latency test that i do in the input latency videos which is that bare bones cut down mouse because the shell broke and the main core of the mouse was still okay so i used that for latency testing then the i got another one upstairs which um is just a spare one that i just it honestly the mouse is sentimental to me but there are better models out there so if you are sentimental then you can look for one on the used market but you will be paying quite a bit anyway
