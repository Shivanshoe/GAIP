here we are now in akihabara aka electric city in japan and they also call this place akiba as well and this is essentially if you like computers cameras or anything electronic then this is known as the place to go to to look for electronics in person so what we're going to be doing today is going through a few stores and looking for used pc enthusiast tech hardware since that is what i do around here at tech air city i love it and this place honestly is just a christmas shopping center if you guys want to go shopping at least just for eye candy and looking around and seeing all different devices and gadgets however there's also a really good thing too and that is if you are a tourist you can get 10 percent off the prices here at a lot of different stores all you have to do is show your passport and just if you don't speak much japanese you can just say do you do tax off or if they don't understand english at all then you can just say menze dekimaska and then they'll say hi which means yes or they'll say or moshi waki gozaimasen which means no anyhow with that aside let's go through a few different stores see what bargains are to be had here as well as just detailing a few different things along the way but i unfortunately don't have a whole lot of time as i've got to go to an event in another district in tokyo to film for a company called corsair they want me to film their event they got a new product launching so we're going to be looking at that a little bit later but i do have to keep this as kind of like a compact parts hunt but let's get into it let's see what deals we can find [Music] so we looked through a few different stores and we're looking for mainly pc parts but eventually you'll come into a store that has some used bargains and the first store we ended up getting out of was called jampata which means actually i don't know because it's just japanese for a store name so inside they had a gtx 580 and they were asking 2980 yen which would be around maybe 25 us dollars off the top of my head they said they gave a one week warranty as well so i was like look i'll go buy this and you also get a two dollar discount if i use my passport to get 10 percent off but at the register they said um they can only do the tax off if you're paying 5 000 yen or more or basically 40 40 basically 40 usd or more per item if it's under that they won't do the tax off and i think they said as well also if you're buying bundled parts as long as the total at the one purchase is over that 5 000 yen then you can get the tax off anyhow when i was at the counter there was some really good news and that is that they said they mispriced the gtx 580 and they did it for me for 1980 yen so i actually got a pretty big discount on this item so for i mean for gtx 580 it's an old graphics card but it should still play games i'm actually very curious to see what this card can do in 2022. however let's keep on looking around and see what other deals we can find never pay full price for windows 10 or 11 again today's video sponsor scd keys you can get activated as little as 15 using that coupon bftyc links in description below so the next store that we ended up just coming out of was a place called scumo and they had some really good deals i actually ended up buying uh three different items from this store alone where i was actually looking at the fact that i wanted to buy more graphics cards from here because the prices were pretty decent for instance they had gtx 1080s going for around 240 us dollars maybe a little bit less or around 30 000 yen but what caught my eyes probably the best bargain was the gtx 980 ti they had this for around 150 us dollars which made it a pretty good deal for a 980 ti which will still play games very well on high settings especially at 1080p so we definitely put that in the kitty and we said okay we're going to get this graphics card but then the next deal they had there was the i7 4770k they actually had this on a sale and it was going for 6 000 yen but i managed to get the tax off on both the gravis card and this item and it ended up being i think 40 us dollars so really good deal on a 4770k then they also had raised prism coolers and there's basically they're saying they're junk but they're selling them as junk but they look like they're brand new to me so i decided to buy one of these and try them out especially when you get a raised prism for a shade over 20 us dollars that's definitely a bargain in my opinion so those are the three items we picked up from skoomo and there's actually a few different skoomos in akihabara but what you want to do is if you're looking for the one with the used parts it'll say on the outside uh chew call and i'll put the kanji up on the screen for you guys i'll actually show you the store in the b-roll if you're looking for used pc parts in tokyo akihabara and then you can go to this store and get a really good deal [Music] so after looking high and low at a few different stores we came across a soft map which is similar to sumo in that there's actually a few different soft maps in akihabara alone but the one you're looking for of course is the one that says used parts or used computer parts and i actually even say this one in english so it's very easy to navigate to this store and once you're on the second floor they'll have a heap of different parts to choose from i managed to while i was in here to find a two different motherboards actually a b550 tough gaming from a zeus this was a shade over 50 us dollars and then they also had a z68 motherboard and we picked this up as well for uh around about 35 us dollars so we took the tax off both of these as well so ended up getting a bargain on two motherboards they had a lot of other used parts but i thought the prices weren't that good on some of the other stuff and of course they also had a lot of new parts where you can get the tax off those new parts as well if you're looking to build a new pc especially if you're in a certain country in the world where there's a lot of taxes on pc parts and the prices are ridiculous and especially if you're coming to japan for a short period of time as a holiday you can definitely take advantage of some of the decent prices but as for the graphics card prices they are coming down i did see some rx 6700 xt's coming in at prices that i haven't seen before but i do believe especially with the recent crashing of crypto currencies that you will see gpu prices come down further so i'm getting pretty excited here but i've actually got to rush off now to this event and film this event for corsair so we better get moving and now we are here back at the japan tech yes studio and these are the deals from tokyo with me just looking there for only just a couple of hours and if you contrast that to the last parts hun i did in japan where i was looking around more the countryside this has just been a lot easier so i do recommend if you want to look for used parts and you don't want too much of a hassle then tokyo itself is definitely a lot better to look for used pc parts than in the country which is just funny how bad it's gotten over the years in that when i first started doing used pc parts years and years ago the country was where all the deals were at anyhow we've got all these parts laid out here they all look like they're actually really good quality and i was surprised as well because the b550 i thought they said it didn't come with an i o shield but it actually did so the only thing missing from this b550 tough is the standard brackets but i'm going to look for a cooler for that with the back plate included and that'll fix that problem all together but what we've got right now is me wanting to piece out a gaming pc and i've got the 980 ti and the 4770k and they'll go together perfectly in my opinion so i'll still need a cooler a motherboard ddr3 memory a case and an ssd so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to take off to the local store where i believe i saw a case a 4000 d last month so i might go try and pick that up and maybe see if they've got an ssd or even some ddr3 memory if not we'll then go look on the mailcuddy and yahoo auctions to try and find some more pieces for the puzzle to finish off a gaming pc and also finish off this use pc parts hunt [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we now just finished up at the heart off and we actually before that went to wonder x as well to check out if they have anything back in stock but they had absolutely nothing but then this hard off here looked like they got some more things in stock since the last time i came here however i really only found a case so we got the mb 400l and we got this for 4 000 yen and the good thing about this was they give a 10-day guarantee and besides that was the 4000 d but i decided not to go with that because they said it was junk and basically when you're saying it's junk you cannot get your money back you're probably thinking well bro it's okay surely there's nothing wrong with it but you can sometimes have problems say for instance a power switch or reset switches and working and if you're buying a case that's really nice you don't want it to have any problems you know especially if you're going to flip that pc you don't have to tell the person who's buying it hey look you know just use the reset switch instead of the power switch to turn on your computer they're just going to scratch their head i mean if it's a real budget pc like a hundred dollars sure they might not care but when you're going for something a little bit more i7 ish gtx 980 ti it's probably a better idea to get a case that's got some guarantee on it which this one does the 10 uh 10 day guarantee but also another thing is too i decided to go with the small case in the end another big thing that i haven't really maybe spoke about in the past was the if you're using say some of those used power supplies say the deltas or the fsps sometimes their cpu connectors don't go in a mid-sized tower they're actually more suited to these micro atx towers in that all the cables will also fit flush and you won't have any problems so those two reasons coupled with the fact that we also saved 15 bucks made the cooler master seem like the better choice but do let us know in the comment section below what you think of the tech yes thinking and with that aside we're gonna get on back home now and peace out the rest of these parts by looking on either the yahoo auctions or murakati for the ssd and also the ram and also the power supply and the cooler as well can't forget the cooler but also i did check coolers here too and they only had lga 775 at least one that was in good condition and yeah i can't can't do anything with this cooler because even if i drill new holes in the bracket the actual screws themselves on the cooler won't budge at all so and yeah again we're not zip tying this one fellas [Music] and here we are now back for the second round at tech yes city we got that case that's now ready to go with a build and checking it out it looks like it's in perfect condition but i still wanted to get some more parts to piece out a build essentially for you guys with a budget build so what we did here is we went on the yahoo auctions and i had to pull up an old account i had to resurrect my old yahoo auction account and there's a big reason for that and that is because i have quite a bit of feedback on it i've got over 200 points feedback just like ebay it works in a very similar manner but the problem is if you've got no feedback and you make a new account for yahoo auctions in japan some sellers actually won't sell to you at all and especially in tech products that can be a bit of a pain especially if you see a really good deal come up then you definitely want to have the ability to just buy that deal with no hassles and so i resurrected that account got it working again and i found some pretty good deals in the last part some people recommended i'd go on to the yahoo auctions as there's better deals than maracati and meracadi is essentially an auction site as well that we used in the last parts hunt that we did here in japan and we found some pretty decent deals but yahoo auction definitely had in my opinion a bit more to choose from a bit better deals and we'll start off with the first deal that we got here that was a motherboard is that h81 gigabyte hd3 and we got this for about 20 us dollars and that's delivered as well and they've confirmed that the board works they said it's okay and so that's a pretty good deal in my opinion now you're probably thinking brad this motherboard is not going to handle a 4770k and i've actually tested this in the past if you undervolt the 4770k it'll actually work absolutely fine and especially for 20 that's an absolute bargain for a motherboard delivered the next deal we ended up getting was 1900 yen for a power supply 500 watts now these are usually you can get really good deals on these from either delta or fsp both these brands make phenomenal power supplies and if you get them used you can save a lot of money in the past i've tested out so many and actually bought so many of these power supplies and their absolute bargains in my opinion the only one i've had fail on me was the one it didn't really fail it just started getting like just over time just wear and tear it essentially after i think four or five years of usage it then brought essentially the voltage rail i think it was on the 5 volt started giving out so that's how much usage you can get out of them and that was even after i bought it used where the previous owner probably used it years before that so they last a very long time very good price performance in my opinion and then the next deal we got on the yahoo auctions was the last deal as well but this wasn't so much a deal and it's actually as well as i do these parts hunts for you guys it's more of a learning curve that i'm going through getting back into japan and testing out the market especially seeing the differences between australia and japan what i noticed here was that memory ddr3 and even ddr4 it's actually a bit more expensive than it is in australia in the us especially on the used market so we ended up getting 16 gigabytes of ddr3 memory this is the cheapest i could find uh delivered and that was about 36 so i am used to getting ddr3 memory a lot cheaper so if anything it's something for me to think about especially with the other sort of deals that we're looking for here on ssds where we went to amazon for the next uh few parts to piece out the rest of the build and that was for a 240 gigabyte ssd we got this for 26 and 30 cents delivered that's brand new because the used market for ssds i actually should have bought one in tokyo with the tax off because that would have been a better deal than all the online deals for yahoo auctions and merrill cutty as well as amazon so that was kind of a mistake that i made there but i didn't have enough time to research that and think while i was in tokyo and then the other sort of deal that we got off amazon here was a brand new cpu cooler we got this for just under 10 delivered that's going to be coming in and it works fine up to 95 watt tdp that's what the people are saying in the reviews so that's not a bad option there especially since we'll be undervolting this 4770k getting the most out of it then for our motherboard since that b550 tough gaming was only missing the bracket we ordered a brand new bracket for it with the screws for 3.40 delivered that's absolutely incredible like amazon here in japan can pull off some really good prices and especially the convenience of getting it delivered at that price i'm just like well how do they make any money on this stuff that leaves me scratching my head sometimes so that now ended up being the total deals for the month here i'll put the tally up on the screen for you where it came in at about 460 us dollars for all these parts and in this whole deals hunt we've actually got a whole 980 ti 4770k pc that is going to be built with a decent looking case for around about 350 dollars us so that's going to be actually one price performance pc that i look forward to giving you guys i think it's going to be absolutely awesome so definitely building budget pcs is coming back into play especially while that crypto mining profitability just keeps sinking it's sinking off a cliff to the point where the miners especially the ones that don't produce their own power are pretty much going to have to switch off the lights so to speak very soon so do look forward to gravis card prices coming down more which will sort of reinvigorate and rejuvenate the life that had been sucked out of pc gaming i think in the last couple of years i'm looking forward to being on the front lines giving you guys that energy and that content as soon as it comes back in but this 980 ti pc here i feel will represent one of those rejuvenating factors to come back into the industry but with that aside do let us know in the comments section below what was your favorite deal of the month for me personally i'm looking over this gtx 580 i think for around 15 that's an absolute bargain and also that b550 tough plus gaming motherboard it's a pretty decent quality motherboard and for fifty dollars i think you can't go wrong and then that raised prism i'm just thinking maybe i should go back to tokyo and buy up the rest of those coolers because i thought they were pretty good value as well at least when i check on the local markets in australia i remember these people asking and actually getting at least over 50 dollars for these race prism coolers individually so i think at around the price that we paid here in usd terms which about 21 i think that's a pretty good deal though the final thing to talk about is the ssds and the memory especially the ddr3 memory i'm noticing the prices on the used market here for ddr3 memory ssds it's not good especially compared to australia and possibly even compared to the us at least when i compare prices with my friends in the us i would say that going forward if i'm flipping pcs and it becomes a seamless and pretty much even if it's anything near as successful as it was in australia then i'll be looking at bulk buying uh ssds and memory especially ddr3 memory whether it's from contacts in australia or even getting a contact in over in china getting the stuff brand new because the prices here i'm not really happy with ddr3 pricing or the ssd pricing especially on the used market as opposed to the i'm buying the ssd's new because they're better value buying them new than used which is very weird so that is the biggest difference i'm noticing between the japanese market and the australian market right now and do let us know in the comments section below what your market is like also let us know again what your favorite deal of the month is love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which is actually a very interesting one it comes from beast of burden and they asked did the newest windows update increase the performance hit from spectre in other words did it lower the performance of your older generation cpus that got hit by this patch with the spectrum meltdown updates they say i noticed lower performance specifically maximum fps seems restricted even lowering quality settings doesn't increase max fps so i thought cpu bottleneck but was told even newer i9 users are having similar issues well if you guys want i can look into the spectrum meltdown updates again for you and do some more benchmarks when these patches first came out i was very skeptical of them i thought like the back of my mind i was thinking is this perhaps a ploy to make the older stuff just completely seem obsolete when it actually isn't obsolete and it still works perfectly fine so they can sell the newer stuff off that was one of those things that went in the back of my mind and seeing the performance hits and now hearing about the increased performance hits makes me want to go back and test again and seeing how much more performance you could possibly lose from having these updates enabled as opposed to disabling them which in the past when we tested the spectrum meltdown updates they did hit performance and turning them off gave you better fps especially on the older generation stuff so since we do have the i7 3770 right here at the studio we've also got a 12 900k in our editing rig i can maybe make a video happen like that and test the differences between the two and see what is going on there where actually in the recent benchmarks i have been doing with the 3770 i have been disabling those updates i just do it by default on anything fourth gen and under it's like an automatic thing for me because i know it used to hit performance five to ten percent depending on the game that's a huge drawdown for something that hasn't materialized in the real world to being an actual security risk for end user gamers anyhow guys with that aside i hope you've stayed this far and you've enjoyed today's used pc parts hunt in japan if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us also if you have stayed this far and you want to see the content as soon as it drops be sure to hit that sub button and make sure you ring the bell as well if you want to get the videos definitely in your feed as i do get messages from people who are saying look brian i'm just not getting the videos at all so youtube seems to do some funny buggers to tech yes city so that's just been the way it has been for years but anyway i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
