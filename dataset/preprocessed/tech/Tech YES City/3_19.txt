[Music] [Applause] [Music] right here we have 10 used power supplies that i bought off the yahoo auctions for a really cheap price now the reason i'm buying these power supplies is because the price of a new power supply is almost close to 50 dollars and that's for say a 450 or a 500 watt power supply and in the past i've actually bought these off the yahoo auctions and had a pretty good success rate but this time around i want to see in 2022 if i'm buying a heap of these power supplies for gaming pcs and they're labeled as junk or non-tested how many of them are actually going to pass the first test that i do here and that is the power supply tester and then after that how many of these power supplies are then going to actually work in a gaming pc well in today's video we're going to go through all that and also things to look out for when you're buying use power supplies so let's get straight into it well the act bell i have had one of them goku poof in the past never pay full price for windows 10 or 11 again with today's video sponsor scd keys you can get activated for as little as fifteen dollars using that coupon bftyc links in description below welcome back to tech yes city and amongst these 10 power supplies we have five different brands and we've got five of the power supplies coming from fsp we've then got two of the power supplies coming from delta and then we've also got one from a brand called heck and then one from antec and then one from akbel now i have listed these in the order of quality i feel like akbel's definitely going to be towards the bottom of the list as i again as we said in the intro i have had one of these actually go bang on me before and then after that i've had heck and antec these have been pretty reliable though i have had some noise problems on the fans from both of these then above that i'm going to rank fsp and delta in the same league because i've never had a problem with either of these power supplies in fact the only fsp power supply i've had a problem with was one that pretty much just lasted so long that it's just pretty much simple wear and tear i mean after using a power supply for nine plus years you kind of expect it to drop out on you eventually and it didn't really go out in any fashion it just started the voltage lines started getting low voltage on them so that's pretty much fair use and in fact that's probably the best case scenario if you're buying a power supply however one thing i'll note is buying off these yahoo auctions i'm just absolutely amazed at how clean all these power supplies are like seriously i'm used to buying in australia used parts and them being pretty dirty these look like they've all of them and i've actually bought these from a few different sellers they all look like they've either had a pretty easy life and then they haven't been used much all the sellers have been cleaning them up but also the fact that these power supplies are so clean isn't just related to these power supplies i'm also noticing it with other used parts that i'm buying like this gtx 980 ti for example i got this in akihabara aka electric city in tokyo for a pretty good price and it's funny because i didn't even have to change the thermal paste on this graphics card it's running under 70 degrees on full load and the cleanliness of it it actually looks like it's in really good nick so what i'm going to do on these parts is essentially spray a bit of crc 556 when i finish the build which is great because that now saves me a heap of time and i can for instance just start using that time to uh do some extra ab crunches in a low emf environment oh yeah that low emf that's really really hit in terms so the first power supply we are testing here today is actually going to be the worst of the bunch this is the act bell and we got this hooked up to the power supply tester and what this essentially does is it gives you a voltage readout on the three different voltage rails that's the 12 volt 3.3 and the 5 volt and if they are all close to those levels it'll give you these green lights right here and also give you a power good reading as well which you'd want this to be over 200 milliseconds so look at these voltage levels they actually look absolutely fine the 12 volt line is a little bit under 12 volt the second 12 volt line is a little bit over but they're all within a spec range and that range is usually plus or minus five percent so in other words this 12 volt line i think it's going over 12.3 or under 11.7 then you should be concerned same with the 3.3 if that's say going over 3.4 or the 5 volts going over 5.2 then you might be concerned in terms of okay is this power supply going to be over vaulting my gear or is it going to be under vaulting my gear to the point where things could either shut off or hardware could be getting damaged but this is the first test that's passed here now we're going to hook it up to the 980 ti 12900k test bench system and then just run some benchmarks and see if it can run essentially emulating what a gaming pc would do so what i like to do for a pretty quick and easy test especially with power supplies is run unigene heaven it's so quick to boot up i like to run it on low settings actually that way i can hear how much coil whine there is coming out of both the graphs card and all the other components like the power supply for instance and also i like to load up the cpu just a little bit as opposed to ultra settings the cpu won't get loaded up enough as the gpu will then be taking a lot of the brunt but here we're looking at this power supply it's running absolutely fine the good thing is it's not getting really noisy either and uh the graphics card itself is actually churning out quite a bit of heat it's putting quite a big load on that 12 volt line especially for a 500 watt power supply so so we're now just going to leave that running for a good chunk of time and then if it passes all that i think we've got a pretty solid power supply on our hands that is no longer junk and i can put in a working gaming pc success and next up we've got the antec 650 watt earth watts actually i used these a lot in the past i thought they were great value power supply this one's 80 plus bronze it's got 650 watts apparently available across two separate 12 volt lines but let's turn this thing on and see what the voltages are like and the voltage readings are pretty solid 3.3 volt is right on the mark same with the 5 volt the 12 volt on the first rail is a little bit under and the 12 volt on the second rail is a little bit over both within spec and the power good is reading 280 milliseconds so that's actually some pretty solid numbers at least from the power supply tester let's hook this up now to the next test and see how it goes and the antec is running absolutely fine but one thing you may notice is that both the akbel and the antec the fans are running absolutely fine too so that's something i'm listening for because i have had power supplies in the past especially for some reason these thermaltake budget models they just have this like even as soon as you turn the switch on at the back of the power supply then you have this coil one that starts up so that's another thing that i'm checking for with these power supplies is their coil one when you flip the switch straight away is there coil one when it's running these benchmarks and are the fans do they need to be replaced but we're two for two now we're looking like we're really good with these two first power supplies and another great thing about the antec also has got separate power lines for the graphics card and that's got doesn't piggyback the pci express pins so that's something i really like about these power supplies especially made back in the day they pushed a lot more components in them because inflation wasn't anywhere near as bad as it is now and what you're seeing with inflation with power supplies is that it either comes out two ways and that is the price either goes up or you just get less stuff in the power supply and it starts feeling like you can lift it up with one finger as opposed to these power supplies they're actually very heavy so next up here we've got the heck and i mean heck if the price is right then you can count me in and this one here is showing up the voltage rails the 12 volt line on the first rail because it's got two rails on it the first one is going a little bit under 12 volt but still within spec the second 12v line is going a little bit over then the 5 volt lines a little bit under 3 volt lines a little bit over so ultimately this power supply is looking like it's pretty good and one thing you may notice is like well brian if it's going down to 11.8 couldn't some of the pc components give out or couldn't cause some problems and most pc parts i think practically all pc parts are designed with this five percent variance in mind and so that's why a lot of the times especially if you're into undervaulting for instance you can extract a lot out of your gear if you have really higher end components both on the pcb of your components itself but also with the power supply too but in case of me putting together just budget uh price performance gaming pcs that i'm not really going to be overclocking anyway or under vaulting especially on the lower end of things this really makes perfect sense a lot of these power supplies you're extracting really good value so this one right here let's uh let's run it through the next phase of the test but also one thing i am worried about with this power supply is the motherboard cable is a little bit the 24 pin is a little bit short so i'm going to have to look for a case when i want to use this power supply it's got a top loaded power supply mount and so that's how i get around this problem but other than that it's got two separate pcie cables as well so just like the antec it's looking pretty solid but we won't know until we run the final test [Applause] [Music] so next up we've now got the fsp power supplies that we're going to run through and we've got three of these in the same family this is the 500 watt family two of those are gold rated power supplies and the difference between the two gold rated power supplies in the silver so the silver's got a single 12 volt rail and the golds have two 12 volt rails now one thing i love about the fsp power supplies even with the 500 watt models they're using some very thick wires and the power supplies themselves are just very heavy they're the heaviest of the bunch here that i'm testing here today and when you pick up these power supplies they just feel so well built i've actually personally had the best experience with these power supplies especially running budget gaming rigs it was actually funny a few years ago when i started showing fsp power supplies on the channel some people like whoa what's that brand man stay away from it it's garbage because they're only used to seeing like evga corsair and tech and all these other brands but in fact fsp is the original equipment maker and in fact they even supplied i'm not sure if they supply nowadays a lot of the power supply makers but they definitely used to supply a lot of those brands the parts to make the power supplies so let's get on now with testing all three of these at once but we can already see here just from the power supply tester that the 12 volt line is extremely close to just staying flat on 12 and the 5 volt lines perfectly flat on 5 and then the 3.3 is just humming between 3.2 and 3.3 [Music] [Applause] look at those skeletons down there they had atomic energy but they couldn't control it look the baby's different the other the race was changing by mutation so next up here we've now got the delta electronics and this is the 450 watt model i've actually got another one which is a 550 watt model which will test in tandem just like we did with the fsp power supplies but with the deltas usually you're in for the same thing as fsp thick gauge wire on the power supplies heavy heavy power supplies great build quality and this one it shows with the readings the 5 volts right on that 5 volt the 3.3 is right on that line too the power goods actually giving out a very strong reading the strongest i've seen out of all these power supplies so far and this is on the 450 watt model and then the 12 volt lines we've got a dual 12 volt rail even on a 450 watt power supplies and the funny thing is some people think oh it's just a 450 watt power supply you need more than that but the thing is it's giving out at least on this model here all that 450 watts it's advertising it's delivering it on the 12 volt line which is what you need for your cpu and your graphics card to get those high powered components to work properly without any problems so i'm feeling really good about the fsps let's get through them providing there's no problems [Music] [Music] [Music] and we have tasted absolute success on the eight power supplies so far it actually i had to test the last one with the gtx 970 because it only had two six pin pcie connectors instead of having an eight pin and a six pin which is weird because it was the 550 watt delta and the 450 watt delta had more pci connectivity anyhow this is the 500 watt uh fsp i've saved these two till last because they've got the all black sleeve cabling some people absolutely have to have the all black cables when they buy a power supply and for me personally i'm going to be completely honest i kind of dig the ketchup and mustard look but each to their own but these two fsp power supplies here everything looks okay on the first one with the voltage rail checking out here and they're both 80 plus bronze and i gotta say besides having all black cables they've also got really long cables too though everything looks okay so far let's uh test it on the system [Music] and there we have it guys 10 power supplies that we've gone through here today and all 10 of these used power supplies that were labeled as junk and no claim no return they all work absolutely fine which means one thing for sure and that is i'm going to save all the sellers that i bought these power supplies off on my hot list because clearly they're just getting the power supplies in there's no agenda there they just are saying look these look okay we'll just sell them as junk and i'm getting really good prices on these power supplies especially since i feel like the quality of these units is better than those entry level 500 watts that i can get off amazon for five times the price so i just think this is one of those things that i'm doing to maximize price performance in my upcoming pc builds now another thing we also got is these bonus connectors thrown in as well i actually pulled off two of these connectors off two of the power supplies and one of them is actually perfect because i needed on my gtx 970 gaming pc i actually needed one of these little fan connectors because i was missing one fan connector on the motherboard i didn't have enough and so this is going to allow me now to complete that build and finally flip that because a few people are like when you're going to flip the build and i was just waiting on these fan connectors to come in from aliexpress but they're just taking a little bit of time so usually i get them for like a dollar fifty but this essentially saves me a dollar fifty on the build and that's a good thing considering how cheap the power supplies were so really impressed with all these models we had no hiccups whatsoever none of the fans were whining none of the coils on the power supplies were whining either it was just complete straight success which i am completely over the moon with you guys have seen me in the past i've had a lot of frustrations with used parts and i've certainly had my fair share of bad luck but this is one of those videos where the good luck definitely balances it out and you just get 10 completely beautiful amazing power supplies and as we said before they're already really clean i'm really shocked at how clean all these power supplies are i only have to give them some crc 556 on the final complete build which i know a lot of you guys might be upset about because you love it when i get the brake cleaner out or the ultrasonic cleaner out and start cleaning up the dirty power supplies and getting all the stuff out of them but this is certainly going to save me a lot of time and money so really glad that we just went through all of these here today and they all came out working and another thing via me doing that is that i'm then able to put them on a shelf and know that if i put together a budget used gaming pc in the future it's not going to be the power supply that is at fault and also some of you guys out there if you're buying used power supplies you may be wondering well why didn't i just skip the power supply tester and then just plug it straight up to the cpu and the graphics card and turn the system on the reason for that is is sometimes you can plug these power supplies up to the power supply tester and they just short circuit or the voltage readings are really bad and if that's the case i'm not even going to hook that power supply up to my main rig because that can cause damage and so the power supplies tester is essentially the first level of screening that i do then the next step is to obviously put it through a real world scenario so when it passes those two tests it's absolutely fine and it's good to go though another thing is too if you're buying used power supplies i would personally recommend looking at the power supply itself and the easiest way to tell an absolute garbage power supply out from a decent one is to just look at that 12 volt rail on the details and if that's saying that say for instance the 12 volt lines only got 18 amps and a single rail and the it's saying the 3.3 or the 5 volt has like 25 or 30 amps available then they're saying it's a 500 watt power supply it's actually closer to like a 200 watt power supply and i guarantee you that power supply will not power any high-end components or even mid-range components and it'll blow out on you which you do not want when it comes to not just your own gaming rig but flipping a gaming rig too so that's an important thing when looking for power supplies another thing you can look for too is just simply the thickness of the wire that they use on the power supplies the weight of the power supply and also if it has for instance proper pci connectors on board because i noticed personally a lot of junk and garbage power supplies they just got like really thin wiring they've got no pcie connectors and they've just got really short cables too and they're really lightweight too so hopefully this video has helped you guys out if you're looking for used power supplies i can definitely recommend them as you can save a lot of money but if you're not into used power supplies then i hope you enjoyed the video anyhow do let us know in the comments section with that aside what your thoughts are about some of the brands that we tested here today and have you had similar or different experiences with used power supplies love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day it comes from viva la mayo i hope they're talking about mayonnaise because i definitely vival or mayonnaise and they ask hi i have an acer nitro n50-110 is it possible to upgrade the gravis card and what graphics card can i upgrade to also what ssd can i add to the system so the acer nitro n1 n5110 i'd personally if you're in a position where you want to change things around with it i just take it as the opportunity to sell that pc and try and build your own gaming pc because you're going to get a lot better performance where in the pc i tested when i did an n50 even though it's i think it's different to the one that you're talking about in the question i had to upgrade the memory to dual channel there was also some other things that were worrisome about especially the case but i'd personally if you had to and you just want to stick to the n50 then i'd definitely add in another 8 gigabytes of ddr4 memory make a dual channel you'll also get 16 gigabytes of ram and for graphics cards it is saying on the internet that it's a gtx 1650 i would since it's got a 500 watt power supply the most i would go for would be like an rtx 3060 or an rx 6600 i wouldn't go any higher because pretty sure they didn't use the best 500 watt power supply in that build either but it would be half decent but i wouldn't push it with like an rtx 3060 ti for example or a 6700 xt but in terms of ssds you could add in any 2.5 inch ssd if i remember correctly it does have the mounting there for it if not you can always just use double sided tape and definitely leave the side panel off for future usage with that case it's just going to keep the temperatures a lot lower than they otherwise are when you're playing games anyway with that aside hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far of course and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that like button ring that bell after you hit the sub button and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now [Music]
