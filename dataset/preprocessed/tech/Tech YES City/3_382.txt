so your computer may have fancy RG but it may have a clear side panel with all the bling inside but does it have four USB ports at the front two of those being USB 3 and a nice little blue LED power button probably not even better it's got a Z on inside sticker this is the Z 230 workstation and honestly the Z 200 series from HP is really underrated as budget gaming systems when you repurpose them now the funny thing is about HP systems is they especially in 2nd and 3rd gen their name gets dragged down by their I guess they're terrible pavilions in their small form-factor pcs where a lot of the time they don't even have the secure boot options in the BIOS HP's released no BIOS updates for them to disable this to get modern graphics cards working so those cheaper models bring this model down here but this is literally one of the best models out there and I'm going to explain a few reasons why and it's even better than the optiplex which is one of the most famous budget quick and easy pre-built so you just slap a graphics card into but anyway let's open this quick release side panel here and then check out what makes the HP Z 230 workstation so good [Music] so starting off with the Z 200 series this comes in five different flavors over five different generations starting with the Z 200 which was first gen Zeon's as well as things like the i7 860 after that HP released the z 210 which was just Sandy Bridge Edition something like an i7 2609 e5 12:30 now since the Z 210 used the same socket as Ivybridge this model in particular was bios upgradeable to support the v2 Zeon's and also the i7 3770 which then leads us to the z 220 which is basically the Ivy Bridge version of the Z 210 after this we've got the one on the desk key which is the Z 230 which is your 4th gen Haswell Zeon's as well as your i7 and i-5 then the last of the lineup is the Z 240 which is your 6th gen i7s these are also the rarest on the used market since not only are they newer which means they're gonna be sold less likely than the Z 230 and below but they also didn't come out in as many models as the previous editions did so the Z 200 series was released back in 2010 and they generally started from around 2000 dollars back in this day that's right $2,000 for a system like this and nowadays you can pick them up for as little as $100 some of the ones that I've had come through recently I've had the RAM pulled out and everything pulled out I've got them for as little as 30 Ozzie dollars which is like 20 USD but this one right here it's not to be confused with the small form-factor option and if you see those around I'd probably stay clear of them because I haven't tried them personally but every Z 200 series workstation I've tried these bigger ones here it's worked fine with any modern-day gravis garden we can see right here we have a gtx 1070 inside this thing and it's working absolutely fine now that's the first thing we're gonna get on to what I actually really like about this system is they include a pretty decent and hefty power supply this is a delta electronics and Delta have been making some of the best power supplies in the business for quite a while this one here has a quad rail on the 12 volt line and combined it can support up to 4 what's on that 12 volt line alone which means that you can power gtx 1070 absolutely fine of course going into the realm of a 1080 TI or something like that I'd be very cautious and I wouldn't recommend overclocking but still that power supply bests the one included in the Optiplex by quite a bit where the one in the Optiplex is only around 240 watts max now if we look down at the bottom of the case we've also got ample length here to mount those long gravis cards and we got here the gtx 1070 mounts absolutely fine all the cables as well for the USB 3 and everything like that is out of the way so you won't have any problems mounting the graphics card even if it's really long besides that we've got a SSD bay and then above that 2 extra slots for 3.5 inch hard drives it even supports the old 5 point 2 5 inch DVD writers if you want to put one of them in at the front of the case you get a mono speaker which also gives you your beep codes and errors but functions if you want to listen to a bitter Taylor Swift in Windows 10 and then at the back you've got an exhaust fan which is actually really quiet it's one of the best exhaust fans I've seen in a prebuilt or it also couples very nicely with the CPU cooler which doesn't make a whole lot of noise either there's four round slot bays to which will support up to 32 gigabytes of ddr3 and if you've got a Xeon inside which we do here we've got the 12 70 v3 then you can use ECC unbuffered memory to [Music] like hey tell me something I don't know I gotta find him operators inbound hot single position they'd be good they are [Music] now the old black cabling is a bonus on the power supply but you'll notice here I've got some ketchup and mustard going on and that's because I've had to use the adapters to plug in the eight pin piece a powerful the gravis card so you only get one 6 pin PCI e which is a negative guess that's the only negative of this whole case right here but even at the back when you're mounting your graphics card it's one of the few clips that actually secures the card in very tightly so it doesn't move but with all this talk on how good this Z 200 workstation is still in 2020 it's time to actually put this thing to the test and we've got the gtx 1070 inside with the 1270 v3z on which is basically an i7 4770k it's got ECC memory support but we're going to compare this now to a 5500 XT on a 99 hundred K and also a 1650 supe to see if this budget combo here that I put together on the cheap can compare to something that's the latest and greatest and see what price performance you can get out of this thing [Music] so we've finished benchmarking this z2 30 workstation and we compared it against a 5500 XT and also a 1650 super now not really a fair comparison since the 1070 is most likely going to win in practically every title but it is fair in one sense and that is you can in general pick up at least what I'm finding in my area a gtx 1070 used for around the same price as a 1650 supe and also a 5500 xt are going on the new market so coupling that with the fact this z2 30 workstation here it cost me 230 Aussie dollars I then added $50.00 of RAM inside added a one terabyte hard drive I now have a total build cost of 585 Aussie dollars or in USD terms that's three hundred and seventy five USD for something that's extremely relevant in 2020 but also the perks of the z2 30 workstation we've got all that room inside the builds quiet it's also got a sieve access and the power supply's 92 percent efficient makes this combo right here on the desk something to not overlook if you're looking for use PC parts but basically running over these games here if you're into 1080p high settings even on the latest Call of Duty warzone F 1 2019 shadow of the Tomb Raider and for tonight you're going to be getting really good FPS now two of these titles Shadow the Tomb Raider and also call it Judy they're actually really GPU demanding and the fact that you go that a gigabytes of vram there means if you want to step it up to 1440p and maybe lower the textures or something like that you'll still get really good GPU on this FPS you know what I'm gonna leave that in there that was a beautiful mistake so basically coming out of this video and relating this to the current situation right now if you guys have been watching in the last couple of potato hunter series I've been picking up these workstations I actually picked up four of them so they seem to be circulating in quite a healthy supply at least in the used market where I am at the moment if you're going to ebay you can sometimes snap them up for a good price but in general if you're using the Buy It Now prices they're usually going to be a little bit more expensive than what you can get them for locally especially during these times right now but basically with this workstation in particular the reason I wanted to do a video on it is not only because I've been running into it lately quite a bit but also because it's a good option that beats the optiplex in terms of putting a better GPU inside something like a gtx 1070 that we did here today if you want to go with a new GPU of 5600 xt would most likely couple perfectly with the 1270 v3z on now speaking of the 1270 v3z on it's just like the i7 4770k relevent still in 2020 sure 4 cores 8 threads I do see that going out of fashion in the next few years but at least if you couple this thing with the mid-range graphics card you're really not going to be missing out on much and in fact you're going to be gaining a lot in terms of value for money where the 1270 v3z on actually supports all those latest instruction sets like avx2 so even games coming out in the future will be ok on the cpu as opposed to say sandy and Ivy Bridge and even the first-generation Zeon's they don't carry that instruction set so they can be sometimes at a detriment for some of the latest and greatest titles though other things with this generation and onwards is native USB 3 so you get that official VR support but coming out of this video in terms of the negatives on the HP of course one thing that I always could take about HP even in their earlier generation models as we hinted on before was the BIOS HP seemed to do the most amazing job at locking down the BIOS and that's bad for us and users because we can't change any of the settings or even see them available to change and you can't edit the BIOS and customize it and then load it in because HP do an amazing job of locking that out and the fact that someone is still yet to hack a HP BIOS and get it to work properly is another reason why I do the inspector thing where I disable the spectre and meltdown patches so just putting that out there go get that free performance and with all that out of the way I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below we think of the HP's e200 series workstations I've been using them a lot lately and I've got to say I am pretty impressed with the value for money they can bring to the table in certain situations anyhow that aside we've got the question the day here which comes from skelter ah and they ask what is the power supply tester you use recommendations which one to buy and I've been using the power supply test actually a lot more lately because I'm finding it's pretty accurate when basically all those lights on the side light up green and then you've got a good power good and all your voltages are in the right regulation this thing will basically save you a lot of time and hassle to let you know if that power supply is essentially good to go now the one that I particularly use I just bought it off eBay I think there's heaps of them for sale and they're actually really cheap I'll put a link in the description below but basically once you get one of those plug it all up turn it off and on a few times and if with all the lights light up all five times for instance green then that power supply I have never had a power supply been faulty after that's given me the green light in five times in a row anyway I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you're enjoying this content and you're not yet subscribed you want to see at the moment it drops then that sub button and ring that bell it's down there to get that content as soon as it drops I said drop two times but anyway it doesn't matter we're gonna get on out of here and make another tech video so I'll see you next time peace out for now BAE [Music]
