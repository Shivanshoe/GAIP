if you're on an old and filthy laptop
and you are getting terrible FPS, or your PC has simply broken down and you want to
play the latest Call of Duty warzone which is actually free for the Battle
Royale which is what we're gonna be playing in today's video then you've
come to the right video because we've got six cos 12 threads after Ryzen 5 1600 AF is pretty much the same CPU as the Ryzen 5 2600 only
it's coming in at eighty-five dollars which is a really good deal in my
opinion though for the cooler we're gonna be saving money and just using the
included stock cooler with this CPU and then for the motherboard we're going
with a budget be 450 m motherboard this one here is a gigabyte gaming I just
found the cheapest motherboard I could find on eBay and selected it and I was
lucky because it's got a nice red and black aesthetic which is going to go
well in today's build now if you do want to overclock your eyes and see if you
you want to upgrade to more cause more threads in the future you may invest a
little bit more on a motherboard but for what it's worth this one right here will
do an absolutely fine job for today's build for the graphics card though we're
going with the gtx 1070 this is a used one I picked this up for under 200 USD
and the thing about this card is got a gigabytes of vram and it's still very
quick by today's standards if you want to go with the new graphics card you
might want to consider something like a 1660 supe or a a 5600 XT from AMD then
for the memory we've got 16 gigabytes of Vengeance Pro RGB memory from Corsair
again I picked this up on a sale you don't have to go with this stuff but
it's going to look definitely fancy on this motherboard
right here and then the powders whole build we're using a cool master MWe 450
watt and you may be thinking whoa 450 watt that's not enough juice for today's
build believe it or not I actually tested this power supply in a video I'll
put the link up here with a 39 50 X 16 core and a RT X 28 ETI
that's right the best on both fronts for gaming pcs and this thing held up
absolutely fine it's also got all black sleeve cabling and it's a really good
value for money powers play at the moment though for
drives we've got a 240 gigabyte SSD one terabyte hard drive and then the last
element is the RGB case this is a tempered glass TG 303 it even includes
their remote control so you can change the RGB to make your PC go faster
on-the-fly though speaking of RGB and making things go fast with the jokes
aside we've got a PC that's coming in over the recommended specs where they're
recommending a GTX 970 or better and then on the CPU side they've got a risin
5 1600 X which in this case like we said before this is more like a 2600 so it's
actually better in performance and then on the CPU side for Intel they've got a
2500 K which is nowhere near similar in performance to a risin 5 1600 X anyway
I'm not sure what's going on there but weirdness aside we've got one fast AF PC
to put together and then run some Battle Royale through it so let's get on
[Music] [Applause]

and now we're at the finished product and there is a few things to do before
we boot into call of duty modern warfare and that has to do mainly with the
memory right here and getting that to its XMP profiles this is going to give
you a big performance uplift on rising systems so in order to do this when you
start your computer you just hit the Dell or f2 key and then in the BIOS
there should be the option to load XMP profile we just hit enter put this in
and then we go to save and exit changes now with the CPU I tried overclocking it
a little bit but I found since we're using the included cooler I tried to get
this up to 3.8 gigahertz all core and the problem is is that it started
overheating on the cooler now the good thing about this CPU out of the box is
it runs 3.5 gigahertz all-cause that it also boosts up to 3.7 gigahertz or at
least that's what I'm seeing here in my tests so basically the only thing you
need to do to get this running really smooth out of the box is load those XMP
profiles and of course have an RGB remote if you change this to red you
should also get some more performance as well so the last thing before we jump
into the games is since we're using a brand-new motherboard we're getting that
annoying windows needs activation message in the bottom right hand corner
so the easiest way to get rid of this is to use today's video sponsor in the
description below by clicking that link you can get a Windows 10 Pro license for
as little as $15 when you use the coupon code TYC sk on check out it's easy to do
grab that code whack it in click activate and you're good to go

[Music] and playing war zone ended up being a
mix of absolutely love it and then on the other side absolutely frustrating to
get this game to work properly I've never seen so many errors upon
installing a new game in my life and so what I did was I kept getting these dev
errors and then I had to go in open his administrator in the settings apply it
to both the exe files in the folder but then after that it's sort of half worked
and it kept dropping out and giving me errors and then after that I decided to
update my BIOS and finally it started working at least like probably two in
every three games would work properly sometimes I'd still drop out and in fact
there was this weird thing where my graphics card didn't even not even
overclocked my graphics card was fine the temperatures will find everything
was fine it would just start displaying weird textures so that when they say
this game is still in beta they really mean it's still in beta so if you come
into any problems you're most likely just going to have to wait for an update
for the game itself to update or update the drivers so I did also on top of that
reinstall my drivers completely after I did the BIOS update so things seem to be
working okay but after finally working out all the problems and getting into
the game they've really done something different with this battle royale I
absolutely loved it and it's like a squad mode where you've got two other
teammates and you can res each other but even if you drop off you can then have a
chance to get back into the game so the mechanics of the game automatically in
that feat are really good the circle also closes in a bit faster I believe
than other games so it does get to conclusion time a lot faster which I
personally enjoy and then they've got all the loadouts and mechanics of the
game which I am really digging so far I think it's a lot better in the mechanics
of the game than the previous Call of Duty Battle Royale that they released
this one feels really polished besides all the problems so hopefully they can
iron that out in the next couple of weeks and they're gonna have a really
popular battle royale on their hands I think over 6 million people have
downloaded this game already in the first 24 hours so it is very popular
of being a whopping 175 gigabyte download absolutely huge I'd like to say
that maybe just make a condensed version for the Battle Royale because if I'm
benchmarking this thing and I've got to redownload the game every single time on
different computers that 175 gigabyte limit on my straight internet is going
to get tiring very quickly now let's talk about fps and this game if you
can't get anything to work and it only works in safe mode for now that might be
an option you have to go with so initially we're getting around 160
average FPS 17.1% loads we're really smooth but keep in mind in this mode
you'll be limited to 720p and you can't change any of the graphics settings but
when you reboot the game if you want to go into 1080p and do a mix of settings
which I'll show you guys on the screen what settings I'm using you can get some
really smooth fps and pretty much no dips but also still a good visual
experience I like to leave textures and some other settings on high but then
turn down volumetric lighting and stuff that can cause stuttering and things
that really aren't going to help you spot the enemy I will say one thing
about safe mode I had some problems seeing people from afar especially since
it was at 720p low settings it was very blurry but when we stepped up to 1080p
on a blend of high settings and things turned off we were getting a hundred and
forty average FPS on this setup with our ddr4 XMP profiles at 3200 megahertz and
the gtx 1070 that we had here we decided to leave this on stock and not overclock
it because i was having issues with the game even though i can overclock this
card and get an extra 10 percent performance out of it i decided to leave
it off and even use shadowplay while i was doing these benchmarks so if you
have shadow play off and you turn on the overclocked you'll get over that 144
average sweet spot with these settings which will make it a great combination
for playing competitively and still getting a good visual experience in
terms of the Rison v 1600 AF that cpu is incredible value for money at $85 the
included cooler does a really good job out of the box where in games we're
seeing around 3.6 gigahertz all cause without overclocking but as we said
before overclocking the CPU was a bit difficult on this included cooler it's
about 26 where I live and so it does get a bit
hot but if you're in a cooler climate you may wish to experiment trying to get
a bit more out of this CPU which you can definitely do and with all that out of
the way if you guys are after a gaming PC for a little over 500 bucks then this
combination right here is one to think about well we've even got the bling
thrown in to match the whole build so we've got aesthetics we got performance
and we've also got a pretty good budget I'll leave some links in the description
below but with that aside do let us know in the comment section below where you
think of call of duty war zone and also what you think of this gaming PC love
reading your thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of it being hot
we've got the question of the day which comes from stuntman Ford and they say I
don't want to be rude I love your content and you're awesome but I've
always wondered why it looks like you're sweating in your videos sorry if that's
rude Lowell is it that hot there do you not have air-conditioning and so in some
of my videos I'm going to be honest I do sweat in some of my videos it does get
pretty hot where I'm at in Queensland especially us going through the summer
where the rest of the world is pretty much going through the winter if it gets
that hot I do turn on my air con but most of the time even in like 28 degrees
up to about 30 degrees I do leave my aircon off just because I don't believe
in wasting power just like with you guys watch the used builds I don't believe in
wasting used components too so hope that answers that question for you if you
guys enjoyed this video then be sure to hit that like button for us and if you
say this fart and you're enjoying that content then you know what to do and
I'll catch it in another tech video very soon
please out for now bye [Music]
