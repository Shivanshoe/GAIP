[Music] [Applause] [Music] if you are on an extreme budget but you want to get some of the best value for money when it comes to pc gaming then today's video may be of a little bit of interest to you where we picked up recently on a used pc parts hunt a laptop for a hundred and ten dollars now this laptop has a broken screen the screen even though it still does give out a picture it's got blown leds on the right hand side it's also got blown leds on the left hand side and the whole frame that it's attached to is also broken as well so in order for me to fix this properly i would have to replace the screen i'd have to replace the frame and that can cost a lot of extra money especially when those replacement parts are expensive then you've got to factor in the time involved in fixing a laptop like this when all the parts at least in the base of the laptop that is the cpu the graphics card the hard drive the ram the motherboard they all still work perfectly fine and so this got me thinking if we used a broken laptop an external monitor a keyboard and a mouse and we put that all together to make a laptop gaming pc setup what kind of price performance could we get for under a hundred and fifty dollars and if this does indeed work out then it could be a great option for pc gamers going forward so let's take a look at what we've got and hook everything up are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2 links in description below so the laptop in question is right here we've got a panel that is basically just hanging off only the left hand side hinge and the right hand side hinge is just broken the frame is broken and also we can see here that led is blowing out in the bottom right hand corner it also looks like there's been a just couple of leds in the bottom left-hand corner that are blown out too so basically you wouldn't want to really be gaming on this monitor it would be very distracting but one thing that laptops do have is that they've got an external hdmi port as we can see right down the bottom of the laptop there is an external hdmi here that will at the very least put out a 1080p signal to an external monitor at 60 hertz and so what i decided to do was i decided to add more budget on top of this already cheap laptop and you're probably like what's the specs of this thing well it's actually got an i7 7700 hq now this cpu is actually surprisingly pretty good from what i remember it can boost up to around 3.4 gigahertz on 4 cores eight threads and also there is a gtx 1050 four gigabyte inside this laptop and then we've got eight gigabytes of ddr4 memory and a 120 gigabyte ssd which we can upgrade the memory to 16 gigabytes if we want to and we can also add in a secondary drive if we need more storage so for the money for 110 us dollars even though the screen is broken and it would be a very difficult process to fix this base here the core base of this laptop is actually in pretty good condition and it seems like it will be able to play games quite well though let's get on to some of the other components that we're going to piece on to this laptop to make it a whole gaming pc setup so first of all the keyboard we actually got this for free when we bought the laptop i always ask people when they are selling stuff do you have anything extra that you don't want and if it's usually very cheap in the case of this keyboard they'll just give it away so we've got a free keyboard which we can then use with an external mouse now i picked up this mouse for three dollars down at my local officeworks and then of course the main component to fix this whole setup is a monitor which in this case we've got a dell 1050p monitor i picked this up with no stand for 10 and then i also decided to pick up a stand for it a desk mount stand for an additional ten dollars so in total we've got here under a hundred and fifty dollars for a monitor stand keyboard mouse and then a base system even though it's a laptop i'm gonna call this thing a gaming pc and the benefit of all this is that we didn't have to build any pc or anything like that in the process so we actually saved quite a bit of time putting the setup together so let's go over one critical thing to do in order to get this to work like a desktop gaming pc setup so right here we've got the laptop we've got the screen open and you'll notice that the screen's actually not showing any signal on it and only the screen in the background that's our external monitor is showing a signal and that's because on laptops what we can do is move into the settings and we can show only in windows 10 show only the desktop on the external monitor and that'll essentially turn this monitor here off and that'll also allow us to close the lid on the laptop but before we do this before we close this lid because i i kind of don't want this screen hanging around and potentially busting itself even more which could cause actual permanent damage to the laptop and so if we want to close this lid and not turn off the external monitor what we need to do is then go into windows power options and it's got an option when we close the lid what do we do and essentially just change this to do nothing and so that'll allow us to close this lid right here like this and then essentially still have that external monitor to play games on so the first benchmark we're going to pull up here is the final fantasy 14 end walker benchmarks so this will give you just a simple score after it's done i'm just using the out of the box default settings and we got here over 10 000 points and so if you guys have a high end pc or a low npc mid-range pc you guys can get your own score and actually compare it with mine and then tally up what prices you paid for your pc you sort of get an idea of how much value you're getting versus this setup which i do think this setup is going to definitely be on the higher end of terms of value for money so 10 000 points seems like it's pretty good it said that the score on the screen is pretty good it's high and the good thing about this benchmark as well it's very quick to download it's not that big and you don't have to download the whole game in order to run it though let's move on now to the next benchmark that we've got here and that is the fire strike extreme benchmark where this will give you out a physics score it also gives you out a gpu score and a combined score but i like to just look at them individually and in the case of the physics score it shows that the i7 700 hq is actually not a bad cpu it's getting close to 10 000 physics score which is comparable to some of the i'd say it's comparable to a third gen desktop i7 which for a laptop cpu is actually going to be fine for playing games especially with the gpu that it's coupled with and then the gtx 1050 the four gigabyte version we got here that scored 2 600 points on the gpu score so on fire strike extreme that's actually not that bad of the score but of course you guys probably want to know how does it stack up in actual games so let's move over now to the first title here which is some really good news and that is split gate where we're getting over 140 average fps and also the 1050p resolution that we're using with this monitor we're getting a pretty good a one percent point one percent lows considering this only has one ddr4 stick of memory if we couple that with two sticks of memory this would help alleviate the stuttering definitely not just giving it more system memory but also putting it then in dual channel which would be one of the key upgrades i would do if i had one of these sticks locally that i could find for a very good price i did check around before making this video and there really wasn't anything up for sale that i could just quickly get for a really good price and pop in but that being said the game still plays very smoothly this is on medium settings and it's still giving out a very good experience though what we're going to move over now to is age of empires 4 where in this title we're getting around close to average of 50 average fps depending on what seam we're in if we're heavy in the middle of a battle with lots of units on the screen we drop down to the low 40s but then of course we could even go up to as high as 60 fps at 1050p full screen resolution with medium settings and since age of empires 4 is quite a demanding title this is actually good to see that this budget laptop can pull off a decent experience when it comes to playing this game though of course what about the last title here is the ever popular fortnite chapter three which a lot of people ask me especially when i go to sell things like this on the market if it's a budget pc setup i always get someone asking what fps can it do in fortnite this resolution of 1050p kind of sounds a little bit weird saying it when most people are used to 1080p but at this resolution we've got low settings 100 screen resolution and epic view distance and we're getting uh most of the times the benchmark has shown it's around 90 average fps now the point one percent lows does indicate that you will get a micro starter every now and then but at least in the jewels that i was having with people it was no problems whatsoever i could still play this game perfectly fine so after those performance figures we could see that this laptop actually performed very well and i would say it performed extremely well when we look at the price performance that we're getting now of course the only downside as we said earlier is this screen that's sort of hanging off here and it doesn't work properly but of course if you've got a lot of time and patience and you know what you're doing with laptops you could probably fix this but i've said in previous videos i don't really focus on laptops it's not my specialty and i know for a fact that you can spend so much time with laptops and just end up at the same spot that you're in before you even attempted to do anything but what we've got right here 150 dollars for this whole setup and the performance that we're getting is just absolutely phenomenal now the temperatures of this laptop since it is a gtx 1050 it's not a power consuming gpu but it's still pretty decent for giving out solid fps and so that was uh getting around 80 degrees and then the cpu was boosting to about 3.5 to 3.4 gigahertz in games and that was scoring sometimes it would go up into the 90 degree region but the whole laptop was still actually pretty quiet so one thing that does worry me about laptops is they can get quite loud so even though the temperatures were getting a little high they were still tolerable and also the noise was pretty good so not a bad base laptop to begin with but there's also one benefit that comes out of it that is we've also got speakers that if we put this underneath the monitor we'll get left and right stereo speakers so we don't have to go out and buy a headset or headphones as we've already got speakers built into the laptop which we can still use and of course if you want to save money you can use the keyboard on the laptop itself as well but i like to keep this lid and screen closed because i just feel like it's only going to do damage if i leave it open for too long and i don't want this laptop getting any more damage than it is and i know after this whole setup it works perfectly the way it's set up right now so when it comes to building a budget setup if you guys have already looked around in the market and you've seen videos where there's people buying dell pre-built or hp or lenovo pre-built older systems and then putting gravis cards in them and that still comes up to be too expensive then you may wish to start looking for a broken laptop or at least a laptop with a broken screen and seeing what you can pull off in terms of value for money as in this case right here we ended up coming up very good in terms of the value for the dollar and actually before this video is something that i had never really thought of was buying broken laptops and using them in gaming pc setups so that's definitely one thing that i personally just stumbled onto when i was doing the parts hunt and of course when i buy stuff in the parts hands i'm mainly looking okay what can i do with this stuff in terms of putting it into a gaming pc or building value out and then potentially making it a flip for profit and in this case i've already got someone coming over this arvo picking up this whole setup because they want something very cheap and i'm still able to make a bit of profit in the process that's one of the beauties of looking around for a good deal if it's a really good deal and you can make something work with it then not only can you get a good experience for the time being then you've also created yourself value which you can then put towards an even better setup in the future though i know there's going to be some people in the comments like why don't you try and fix this thing and i just know that rabbit hole with laptops i could buy a new monitor for it a new frame and it's probably going to end up costing me much more money than what i originally paid for the laptop and even then i've got to spend all that time and i don't know if it's going to pay off since locally here there are gaming laptops that are going for around seven hundred dollars so if i then spend an extra 250 and then waste all that time i'm actually probably going to come off in a worse position than i was with the amount of time that i spent putting together this gaming pc setup right here so that's sort of how my brain works when it comes to putting together value you've also got to factor in time which a lot of people sometimes sort of forget about okay how long is this actually going to take me to do would that time be better spent doing something else where building a setup elsewhere or perhaps working somewhere else and making some extra money to do something else anyhow guys with that aside i hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what you think of the budget setup on display here do you think it's a winner do you think it's a meta in terms of the budget gaming pc scene love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from hiroyuda to rocker and they ask is it's that okay washing the motherboard for the cleaning with the water and try the mobo does it gonna or is it going to damage the motherboard of the material from the board and so i get asked this a lot when it comes to washing pc parts i get asked this so much and this is the only thing i can tell you guys is my experience and no it doesn't damage any of the parts i've never damaged parts from washing them and then drying them off and then doing my process and that's putting on multi-purpose spray which then gets rid of any of the residual the extra moisture if there is any on there and then it also protects the components so in the process though i have fixed so many parts cleaning in the map and getting them to work this way so for me the trade-off is just clearly in favor of washing pc parts if they're extremely dirty or of course just cleaning them up like i usually do without washing them so you can go to different people and they can say different things but in the end my opinions that i give out they're backed up by experiences and numbers even though i'm the only one who knows these numbers are right then i'm sure in time there'll be people out there that watch components and they do the these methods that i'm doing and being like yeah if you know what you're doing and you do it properly you're going to get a really good success rate and so that's my experience with it and the fact that i keep on doing it and sort of some of the naysayers that don't do it never really try it should tell you something so i hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content you may wish to hit that sub button ring that bell and
