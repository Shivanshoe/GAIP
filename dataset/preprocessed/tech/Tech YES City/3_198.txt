at the moment in the world of the good old graphics card there is a serious problem and that is to the likes that we are in the dark ages when it comes to trying to buy one of these things right now you can go onto ebay you can log on to your local marketplace and you type in say for instance rtx 3000 i've seen that nvidia they've they've got this great car that's coming out you know better than a 2080 super and it's a 30 60 ti but then you look at the price and you're like whoa scratching your head you're like uh last time i checked i'm not living in venezuela i mean if you are living in venezuela then i feel sorry for you because they're suffering from a thing called hyperinflation that's when the prices of everything is just going out of control and in the world of graves cards the prices of graphics cards have gone out of control especially for rtx 3000 series cards which in tomorrow's video will be taking a close look as to why that is exactly but in the meantime i've said in the past what you can do actually in the recent months i've made a couple of videos i'll put the link up here about what you can do in these dark times if you want to get yourself a gaming graphics card for at least a decent price and still play games but what if you're buying a used card because part of that is buying a used graphics card that's where the best value is going to be even with these overpriced cards out there in the market but if you're buying a used graphics card i've got today a full guide on what you can do and how to make sure you don't get hosed and basically when you get hosed that's when you've been left outside with a tap running all over you're getting hosed down essentially and no one wants to get hosed down especially in the winter so let's look at some ways that you can avoid losing your money and getting completely scammed in the world of used graphics cards if you've got this annoying windows needs activation message and you want to get rid of it for cheap then today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 bucks after you use the coupon code pftyc you can get yourself a legit single end user windows 10 license today links in description below so let's get into tip number one and that is when you're buying a used graphics card check the quality of the actual cooler on board i've got two cards in my hand here to illustrate this point imperfect daylight and that is this card right here the sapphire it's had some serious usage and the way we can tell by that is by looking inside the card and we can see that the fins on the cooler have corrosion now if this corrosion is the likes that you've never seen before it looks absolutely disgusting i would recommend actually staying away from that card because that's an indicator that it's been not only heavily used but the rust itself may drop onto the card and short something out in due time and i've seen this actually with one of these cards here before that's been in much worse condition than this and it hasn't lasted long at all i think it had two months life left in it and then i had to replace it because i guarantee my pcs for three months so this card here on the left we're going to look at this this one looks like it's pretty much brand new in that it hasn't had much usage we can tell by just looking at the general state of the card the fins on the gpu cooler look like they would be like a card that's just come out of the box in other words this card hasn't had much usage so that alone is the first telltale sign of usage but there's also another thing as well and that is if someone lives near the ocean they can get a lot of salt in the air and that can fast forward corrosion very quickly to the point where i've heard of stories from local retailers here where pcs have come back even six months later from someone living right near the beach and the computer has been pretty much corroded and they can't guarantee that because that's not what they call fair wear and tear though in the case of this rx 580 right here this four gigabyte model this is a perfect scenario of a card that with its four gigabytes of vram is no longer desirable for ethereum miners so it's had a medium term usage and of course with that it probably has a medium term left of life left in it so this segues perfectly into point number two with the older the card and the less efficient it is as well as the lower vram count that it has we're mainly looking at four gigabytes and under that card is going to be way less desirable for cryptocurrency miners than the cards like the new rtx 3000 series for example so when we don't have that demand for these gpus from the crypto miners that leaves the prices in the realm of more normal or realistic for someone who just wants the game on it so if you're looking for a gpu right now rx 470s 574 gig models and of course 1050 ti's and even the 1063 gigabyte are going to give you some of the best price performance out there in the market so let's move into the next point and this one is a big one for buying used graphics cards a huge point and that is to make sure the card works especially if you're going to pick this thing up for instance like i do off facebook marketplace or gumtree where the deals are local i can go and meet the person validate that the card works so if anything if you're going to buy a used gpu and you're going to go pick it up or even if you're buying it online and it's a used graphics card get confirmation that it works either a photo of just say a quick heaven benchmark pulled up with the driver displaying that it's installed correctly or seeing it physically in person working and this is one thing that i am not without fail missing when i pick up a used gpu that is getting confirmation of that card working because recently i've been uh hit up with a few messages privately from people saying brian i just bought a gpu and when i install it i'm just not getting a signal once it gets to windows and i said to that person my reply was dude you got hosed and he said well the guy told me it was working when i went to pick it up and that is the most common excuse you are going to hear when you go to pick up a used gpu from someone who knows it doesn't work but they just want to get money and scam you they're going to say to you oh it was working when i last pulled it out of my pc in other words they somehow magically think that a gravis card's going to go faulty from the time that they pulled it out months ago when it was actually faulty and the time that you get it you put in your pc they want you to believe that they want you to be that gullible and trust me i've pulled out a lot of different graphics cards out of systems that have been working and when i put them back in the system a hundred percent of the time they've been working so that excuse is just complete bs do not believe it if you get hosed this is the thing the next point that we're going to pull up if you get hosed on a deal make sure you know where that person is and make sure you can get a refund get that in confirmation say look if this card doesn't work and i get it home can i bring it back and get a refund that's if they're not going to show you the card working and this is the funny thing about going into the latter half of 2020 last year and now coming into 2021 i'm hearing so many more reports of people getting scammed and hosed so don't be that person look for the warning signs if someone's not going to show you that graphics card up and running or they're not going to give you proof that it works or even some kind of guarantee which the good thing about buying off ebay for example if you buy a graphics card and it says that it works and you get it it doesn't work you can at least get your money back you've got that guarantee there but of course you're probably going to pay a higher price due to ebay fees and stuff like that but if we look at that make sure when you're buying these cards you're getting either a guarantee or you're seeing the card physically working that's what i'm doing personally now i recommend heavily doing that coupled with that point of checking out the card itself making sure that there's not too much corrosion on it now another thing you can do is if you quickly look inside sometimes you can see these capacitors here so you can take a look inside the card as well if you see right in the card for instance the top of the capacitors are bulging out of control or things just don't look right as well it's just better to be safe than sorry the last point i'm going to make in relation to seeing the card working this is an important one make sure you're not buying a card where they've just put the graphics card in the computer and it's got the microsoft display adapter driver installed so in other words people say oh yeah the card works and then they'll show you it working but if it doesn't have the proper driver installed there's a risk that that card is faulty and this is probably the most common problem i've seen with gpus that are working but they actually don't and that is once you install the driver the scale is actually faulty or something else on the card is inherently faulty and that causes the screen to just turn black and the card's essentially worthless i mean i have in the past and i'll put the link up here as a last resort put a heat gun or even put gpus in the oven and i find the percentage rate of that working i'd say is in the vicinity of around 10 percent so i get one in every 10 cards back to life and then even out of those 10 percent of cards that come back to life i'd say half of them just pretty much go kabankas five minutes later so the next point when it comes to buying a graphics card is something that i do personally but i know in the world there's a lot of different ways of doing this because it depends on where you live locally and it depends on your culture and that is that i'll only pick up cards locally here when i'm going to someone's house or their address i will not meet someone down at the gas station because i made a parody video on this in the past and it's just something that every time in australia when i've heard of people meeting down at the gas station or the petrol station there's getting sold some sort of junk so it's just something that i do both ways and that is because if there's something wrong you can talk it over and you can help each other out if you meet someone down at the gas station and you get hosed i'm pretty sure they're just going to block you and move on because there's pretty much no recourse for them that's how a lot of people get scammed but at the same time i know there's a lot of people in the united states that's just part of their culture for example that's where people meet usually at the gas station so in that case you want to be getting some video proof on the phone just quickly to make sure that that graphics card works or something like that of course bring your own i've even heard of guys out there who have like a van and they've got a mobile testing station if someone's got a photo of a mobile testing station to test gpus show me that setup i'd love to see that now another important thing and this is point number four that we're going to go on to here and that is something that i've covered in the past and it's a pretty much a rule of thumb when it comes to uh pc hustling in general and finding the best deals and that is if something is too good to be true then it usually is and we took a look at this exact example i made a dedicated video on this with a there was a 1050 ti that came up for sale and people were telling me brian you've got to check this out look at this it's such a good deal and i said it's too good to be true it's a scam and that kind of caused some upheaval in the comments saying people like what if it's legit and i just said guys been there done that seen it all before and then sure enough someone like someone a week later just said yeah i got my money back because it was a scam and especially if the photos match up to looking like that say for instance you've seen a photo of an rtx 3060 ti and it comes up for sale for 300 locally and the photo is just professionally taken it looks amazing that guy knows how to take a photo he knows what the price of that card's really worth why is he selling it for 300 usd when he can easily get 500 for it so always ask yourself that in the back of your head why is this person selling this product if it looks like it's too good to be true that being said you can get some extremely good deals but the ones that i get i always go suss them out in person and make sure that i'm getting a good deal to begin with and i'm not getting hosed because usually and this is a trend with these kinds of scams when someone selling a deal that's too good to be true is that they'll ask you to deposit money into their bank before they send the item to you and then essentially you'll either get a letter in the mail with nothing or you'll get a brick or you just won't get a product at all and this last point is for those guys who do want to ignore the previous advice and meet someone at a gas station this is the last thing i'm going to say is if someone's giving you a graphics card in a box always open the box and make sure you're getting what you're buying because i've heard of in the past people meeting people at public places i haven't seen it myself but they essentially say for instance buy a 2060 super but what's really in that box is like a gt640 and so they've been hosed because they haven't opened up the box and checked the content and the person's even showed him a video of the card working with the device manager so if you're meeting someone at a public place be sure to make sure you're getting the graphics card that you're actually purchasing and believe me this is what i'm saying before these scams they happen sooner or later if you're dealing with used parts consistently you are either going to see it personally or you're going to know someone personally who has been scanned or host and it's a sad thing i hate the practice i just think it's disgusting that it exists but it does exist and you have to navigate your way as always and like i say on the channel you have to navigate your way through the murky waters and now we're getting to the final point and this one is one that i have never said on the channel before but i love sharing every tip and trick with you guys because it's what i do here at tech yeah city you guys support the yes man every time you drop a comment hit the like button and watch the videos so we're going to give you the last one this is the super secret source and that is when you get that graphics card especially if you bought it online this is a really good one if you've got a little bit of time to check this put the card in your pc and then i want you to go with msi afterburner and try and overclock the memory now if the card has been from a minor the most common problem is that the memory is going to fail on that gpu if miners have been using these cards and they've been dropping the call limits they've been dropping the power limits but they've been upping the memory speeds then the most logical point of fail even if they've taken really good care of those cards is the gddr5 or 5x or 6 or even now 6x that memory is going to degrade over time faster than the other components so what you can do is when you get one of these cards say it's an rx 570 or it's an rx 584 gig is you can just load up msi afterburner first of all you can run a benchmark in unigine heaven next thing you can do is start to up the memory clock of the graphics card itself now if that graphics card if you literally just touch the dial and up it a little bit and the whole computer crashes that card probably doesn't have a whole lot of life left in terms of its gddr5 or 5x memory and the speeds that it's offering because when you up it a little bit it means the car's unstable means that the memory is probably degraded a lot faster than you think and i've seen this in the past where i've had an rx470 come through here for example and the memory speeds haven't really worked properly even out of the box but when i've down clocked the memory it's then worked absolutely fine now of course if you're using this for yourself or you're building a mega computer on the cheap you can get away with paying a lot less for these cards but you may just have to manually set in a memory down clock profile for these cards or especially if the card is looking like it's in extremely good condition and the miner has taken really good care of it over its life you can still get an indicator of how long a life left that card realistically has because make no mistake about it if you get one of these cards and it's degraded so hard so fast and for instance it's had a custom bias put on it then that custom bias may work for mining but when you load up the default bios which is needed for pc gaming if you load up that bios after the fact and the card starts crashing if it crashes on boot then that gravis card is almost as good as useless so that's the problem that i've seen in the past with some of these cards that have been heavily mined on so that's my main complaint about buying a card from the miners and that is has the memory been worked so hard for so long that the card doesn't have a whole lot of life left in it so be careful because when you load up those custom biases the card then displays a triangle with an exclamation mark and especially if you want to flip that pc and someone reinstalls if you even if you put on some custom drivers that circumvent that problem and they update their drivers in the future and they reinstall things the car will be faulty and you'll be getting complaints about it so that's one thing about buying a used gpu that i don't think i've shared in the history of the channel so hopefully that tip helps a lot of you guys through those murky waters and with that aside if you've enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button if you have any questions or comments be sure to drop a comment in the comment section below but also let us know your tips and tricks as well if you've got any tips or tricks then do let us know in the comment section below if there's anything that i've missed in this video then be sure to share that and help people out to get into the world of pc gaming especially if you're on a budget and you can't afford much this is what i love i love helping people out and giving them a good advice so they can enjoy pc gaming and get through these dark times with not just the graphics card crypto mining situation but also the world pandemic as well one thing i want to do is help you guys out any way i can anyway that aside with the question of the day here which comes from louis dugal and they ask what spray do you use for cleaning parts this question comes in a lot and i think sometimes we've got to refresh it for the new guys around here i use most the time multi-purpose spray this is my go-to spray gives it that new look shine cleans off especially with a graphics card like this it'll clean off a lot of that corrosion as well especially if you've got a little bit of time and you want to use a brush and brush all that corrosion off it then protects the product as well and the good thing is it's non-capacitive non-conductive it will also not cause any harm to your electronics i do as well if it's a gpu die and it's had a bad application of thermal paste applied i will then use brake clean but be careful with brake cleaner can be capacitive and or conductive and it can cause harm to your pc parts if you don't dry all that off but this stuff right here the multi-purpose spray i think this is in australia only if you're overseas there are some alternatives like wd-40 crc 556 i believe so in terms of getting the spray that you like your mileage may vary this one for me is only three aussie dollars a full massive size can of it lasts me for ages extremely good value and i get it from the discount store locally here and now we're at conclusion time where if you stayed
