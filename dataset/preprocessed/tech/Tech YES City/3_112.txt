Today we're going to be taking a look 
at the b550 riptide edition from ASRock,   which last month we took a look at the x570s 
riptide so today i'm going to keep this review   very short and simple as this board is pretty 
much the same thing vrm wise and also audio wise   as the x570s pg rip type except it does come 
in at a cheaper price point with 160 usd   versus 185 usd now my first critiquing point 
about these refresh boards is of course there's   new stuff coming from both amd and intel 
and it seems like it is going to be coming   sooner than later but that aside let's take a 
look at what you get for a hundred and sixty   dollars and i feel like the b550 here is in 
a tougher position than the x570s was because   there's already b550 boards out 
there with silent heat sinks welcome back to tech yeah city and getting 
straight into the differences between the   b550 riptide and the x570s riptide we've got at 
the rear of the board two additional usb ports   on the b550 version however it does go away with 
that x570 flashback feature and subsequently you   do lose that button up the top of the board now 
there is the option to add an m.2 wi-fi on both   these boards however the location of that port is 
located in a different position on both of these   boards i'll show you the shots for reference 
and continue on with the differences we lose   two 1x slots on the b550 version and we do go away 
with of course that pci gen 4 from the chipset hub   itself but we still of course have that top slot 
being 16x pca gen 4 as well as that top pcie m.2   slot being gen 4. whereas the lower m.2 slot is 
now pci gen 3 versus the x570 which does support   an additional gen 4 m.2 slot the benefit of the 
b550 is that you will get slightly less power draw   in usage but another key difference is the usb 
front out ports you do gain an additional usb   to two front outs on that port down the bottom 
however you do go away with one of the two usb   3 front outsoles so you will get three plus one 
versus two plus two on the x570 and you still on   both the boards get the type c out the final two 
differences between these boards is the clear cmos   button is missing on the b550 version and then 
up the top they have moved one of the fan hubs   from the middle right of the x570 board to the 
top of the b550 board and so other than that i'll   give you a quick recap of the vrm details and the 
results we've got a 10 phase that's an eight plus   two where we're using vichai 50 amp mosfets 
as well as fujitsu 5k caps and magic 60 amp   chokes on this vrm solution with a 5950x it does 
an incredible job of handling the temperatures   and keeping the efficiency up even at these 
higher clock speeds so basically any air or   water overclockers that are keen to use this even 
as a workstation board we'll be delighted to see   that this vrm does hold up then moving on to the 
onboard audio where they're using the realtek   alc897 you may be looking for details on this 
across the internet where this is a chip that   was used on motherboards a few years back and 
then they went over to things like the real tech   alc 1200 but not to be confused with this codec 
because this is only one part of the equation   one thing to never forget with a dac or an adc is 
the implementation of not just the codec itself   but also the amps the tracing and even the pcb 
layer used in that implementation and here's   where asrock have done a really good job where the 
tests show there's practically no base roll off   10 hertz and under where we measured a minus 
1.5 drop off then 2k and over there's a bit of   a roll off there in the treble which honestly 
a coloration like this on your mid-range cans   or even low range cans is going to do a good job 
of giving you a balanced sound and then moving   on to another good thing is the crosstalk we've 
got roughly minus 86 decibels which is a very   good number meaning your left and right channels 
are going to be separated really well so the way   they've implemented this real tech alc897 if 
you've got some hundred dollar headphones that   sound really good on other things they're going 
to sound really good on this motherboard too and   of course if you're an audio file with a thousand 
dollar headphones you're most likely going to have   a much more expensive dedicated dac amp solution 
to power those headphones so for what its purpose   is this on-board audio solution is great when 
we move on to the mic import that has noise   suppression so you won't get the highest quality 
voice work out of this thing but at the same time   people will hear you loud and they'll hear you 
clearly all the way up to the max volume level   so to wrap things up for you guys you've got a 2.5 
g land solution integrated you've got that optical   out on the audio still and you've also got in the 
bios the ability they say on the box the ability   to overclock up to 4 933 megahertz but i doubt 
any pro overclockers are going to be using a b550   anyway when i tested 4 400 megahertz for what it 
was worth it did boot up with that memory and it   was working fine however if you're using a 5950x 
or any ryzen chips for that matter you are going   to want to keep your memory at probably around 
3 800 megahertz or lower to get that infinity   fabric clock to match one to one to one to your 
memory that's an important thing for performance   also if you're wondering about the bios between 
these two they're pretty much identical from what   i'm seeing here you've got that rgb control on 
the b550 just like you have on the x570 you have   no rgb leds on this board you've still got both 
those two headers up the top two headers down the   bottom for 5 and 12 volt control and you've got 
that fan tuning which they call fantastic tuning   so this bios is super easy to navigate and 
setting up overclocks is ridiculously easy so   asrock you don't really have to do anything 
different on the bios except of course   add the internet update feature that you have 
on the intel boards that would be cool to see   if you did that on the amd board so all that 
out of the way it's conclusion time with the   b550 riptide all i'm gonna say is it's a solid 
board it's not something that would blow me away   but it passed all the tests with flying colors 
though i will say i wasn't as wild with the   b550 version as i was by the x570s and you're 
probably sitting there like brian what what's   going on you you've got a cheaper practically 
identical motherboard and for what it's worth   you do get those extra features that x570 unlocks 
as well as the silent heatsink on the x570 version   which a lot more expensive boards carry and they 
carry those premiums so i think the x570s riptide   has more of a purpose than the b550 does where at 
this level with 160 in the b550 realm you've got   a heap of different competitors out there ranging 
from even asrock's own steel legend which for me   personally has a much better aesthetic you've also 
got other boards out there like the aorus elite   going for the very similar price points so it's 
in a very tricky spot where the main point to   come out of this b550 board is that it's got an 
excellent practical implementation of a vrm that   does a really good job and the onboard audio 
is really good too but at least all the b550   motherboards and x570 motherboards i've tested 
they both have really good onboard audio solutions   and the vrms are pretty solid on those boards 
so if what it's worth it is a good board but   not a great board and i hope you guys enjoyed 
this review if you did be sure to hit that like   button and also let us know in the comment section 
below what you think of the riptide series are you   liking what it's about do you have any critiquing 
points of your own for asrock and with that aside   we've got the question of the day here which 
comes from florjon bashar and they ask so i don't   get it you gave away an 80 pc and now you have a 
water cooler power supply and 32 gigabytes of ram   does these three parts cost under 80 that's why 
you're calling it a loss so they're referring to   our ultra clean episode four i'll put the link 
up here where i came into an x79 rampage board   and for me like yes in terms of value i'm still 
up in front but if you guys are into x 58 and x 79   like i am and you come across a rampage board that 
is like the ace of hearts when you catch something   like that and it works so the fact that it didn't 
work and the fact that it was the second rampage   x79 board that came in that didn't work in a row 
in dollar value sure it wasn't a loss but in terms   of my luck it was a big loss and so that's how i 
kind of considered that one it's not always about   the money and in that case it definitely wasn't 
about the money it was about getting that x   79 rampage working hopefully that answers that 
question and i'll catch you guys in another tech   video very soon if you stayed this far as well 
and you're enjoying that techies content then hit   that sub button ring that bell and you'll get the 
content as soon as it drops peace out for now bye you
