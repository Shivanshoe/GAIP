and now we are live with another tech yes live stream on the news the word on the street and connecting you guys in the chat let's have a bit of fun here if you're tuning in early make sure you let us know in chat that you're here it usually takes like a minute for this thing to sort of build up a little bit but uh we got some fresh news coming in and it doesn't spell well for the gamer unfortunately so we've had all sorts of news here we've had news from uh the crypto miners of buying up all the gpus and then to make things worse now we've got car manufacturers coming in as well so this one is going to be a big live stream so yeah you guys are already joining in chat you're far you're quicker than the minute mark welcome i could say welcome in we'll come in we'll come into the techies live stream come and join us we've got elder par in chat too everyone's here welcome back guys and don't worry the used scene in the next six months is going to become very popular very popular do not fear the uscene is going to save us and save our sanity in 21. 2021 let's talk about these uh news articles right here we'll get into the first one here and this is sort of immediate news because it's going to affect people immediately after the midnight launch at least in australia it's midnight i think it's about 9 10 11 hours away for you guys in the us it's coming very soon the nda is going to lift on the 30 60 and video cards already have an article here this card is being basically around that 500 usd price that's where it's getting listed at and it was going to get listed at and i mean the 329 price we're way we're way past that i mean usually you'd expect say some of these custom models to come in at 350 360 but i mean this is where it's pushed it up it's up to 500 bucks and i mean look here's where it sucks because all these other shortages point towards this being one of the few things you can buy like when we look at the 3060 ti price for example that's going over double so the fact that the this is sort of representing that price demand from the crypto miners anymore the crypto miners don't want to buy it they'd rather go buy a 360 ti and get ripped off on that end because then they've only got one gpu to put on their mining bench and make money instead of having to put two on to get the same amount of profit but what we've got right now is a 500 usd and so it's like eh just wait for my review tonight i'll give you guys a bit of a guide but um i think this one's gonna be a little bit more in stock and it's gonna come in a little bit more like you're not gonna have to mortgage your home to get a 30-60 pretty much as opposed to some of the other cards out there it was looking like uh mortgage housing prices when we look when we looked at some of those uh gpus and how much they are so that's the first story that is the first story from video cards and it looks to be like honestly looking at this information and based on just the general demand out there in the world right now i'm thinking this is pretty much uh spot on on what you're gonna see these cards coming in at and uh whether people buy them or not um yeah so 329 on newegg okay so that'll be for the raffle system if you egg have it at 329 then i'm going to say to you guys definitely get that so thanks for you guys this is why i love it when you guys join in on chat so is it 329 on newegg and we can quickly pull that up right now and uh we can check newegg and see if they have it listed or if they're going to have it listed for or if anyone's got a link they can show us rtx 3060. okay but maybe someone's pulled out the metadata from the site and it's like 329 or something i mean it yeah if you've got a screenshot or something but if you can get one for 329 from ua i'd definitely jump on that i'd jump in a raffle system for it because at 329 it's gonna be a good buy i'll just tell you that and uh here's the thing though speaking of big optics we got nvidia's uh this one was just come out on the press here this one is they announced their financial results for the fourth quarter of uh 2020 and it's huge like this is this is nuts like what uh they expect as well in terms of revenue as well so man wow so this is like 5 billion up 63 percent from last year i mean 2020 was a pretty solid year for him in quarter four so that's basically the gist of this is nvidia have skyrocketed in terms of their earnings and how much they're making so i think all the tech companies as well this is not just a video you're going to see amd i mean intel's revenue has been up as well so amd's revenue will be up i guess the tech if you're in the tech scene and you're selling products uh you are in one position to clean up off this and i mean you gotta wonder like when when it comes back down to the average guy who's working and paying his taxes how much of the tax dollar is going towards these tech companies that's what i'd like to really know with all these stimuluses and stuff like that so that's a bit of a a bit of a funny one in the making kind of if anyone if anyone knew some um knew some answers there profits are up like 60 and it's like yeah but uh stimulus is also up 50 as well on all your national debt so so it's it's pretty funny with that one but uh we got we gotta quickly interlude now quick we've got some quick sponsors and then we'll get on to the news for you guys if you want to get a coupon use the coupon tyc bftyc you can get 30 off a windows 10 pro key and that'll bring it down to 14 bucks usd i'm pretty sure okay the music is up okay cool all right i'm bringing down a smidge we are live here we are live we're going live we're real we're real here it's real get yourself 14 14 bucks windows 10 pro key go cop that and this is one of the sponsors that's been consistent here at tech yeah city they're not going to have a shortage of windows well actually i think at one stage sdk did have a shortage of windows 10 keys that they could sell but um and then the next sponsor we got here is the wave 3 elgato this is the bike we use here on the live stream perfect really good if you just want to record audio voice work it's amazing i love this thing one of the best mics you can get out there and not in terms of total voice quality sure but it's an amazing mic in terms of what you can do with it so let's get back to the news now the shortages the big one the shortages this one's like we've got the crypto miners coming in they're still like weighing they're still doing their thing they're still doing their thing right when we look at the price of crypto even though it's dropped which was good news uh the price of ethereum dropped in all this we see here went down from 2500 bucks down to like 2 000 that was good news we need that to go down to like a thousand bucks maybe even 500 bucks if that could happen that's that's going to be a prayer answered to a lot of these uh crypto farms where we can get some cards for gamers but we got here another sort of compounding factor that is coming into play and it's from samsung and they believe the automotive chip shortage uh could impact phones now so it's like okay samsung's worried that all the car manufacturers now like especially the taiwanese government they've put pressure on tsmc to prioritize car manufacturers with their nodes so this is the big problem here is that the nodes are already booked out they're fully booked out like tsmc are just booked out they have no like they can't have any spare like allotments here like okay you guys we've got some spare here just thing it's like they're literally playing musical chairs now with who can um get these uh chips and get the wafers to make their products and so the automotive industry is now gonna barge in and go yep we want some of that and so of course when they come in and barge people out that means the gamer is like i seriously i tell you now the gamer is coming dead last in like a lot of ways and this is not just with the uh products like when we talk about the retail products and stuff like that in terms of they have their server products they have their business grade products they always get prioritized over retail retail like comes dead last already so the fact that this is already happening and eating in and now the car manufacturer's like look we need to get our chips too so car demand apparently they forecasted that car manufacturing was going to go down in 2020 but it's bounced back and it's bounced back hard so they need the demand there for these uh tsmc chips is there so what this means is basically yeah gaming products we could see even more shortages of gpus so that's basically the gist of this article so yeah i mean spews if you do it right yeah cars servers phones gamers yeah pretty much gamers come last and this is what we're starting to realize now we didn't realize how bad it was until all the problems started compounding so now the gamers are just realizing how i guess how much um they get prioritized in the grand scheme of things so this is the thing too amd so i mean we've got to get some good news does anyone got some good news in the comments i'm just like we were just talking about article after article here has just been like man article after article here has just been like one after the other man i've i've got to start focusing on that's why that's why i went to the used parts i went honestly i went to the used parts guys because and i'm gonna focus more on the used parts because this is just like looking at all this news it really makes me just it's not none of it's positive for gamers none of it's positive for the stuff that we're passionate about we're passionate about pc tech and building computers and benchmarking cards and benchmarking cpus and graphics cards and none of this is none of this is positive news man we're gonna get some positive news like let's just start looking like after we're done with the articles if you guys have seen requests we'll get on to those but we're gonna start looking for some new used parts just live so and i mean hey look i'm gonna say this maybe the 14 nanometer intel decision maybe they had a crystal ball that's all i'm gonna that's all i'm gonna say maybe we should change the topic of today's video to intel has a crystal ball realizes there's going to be shortages keeps up 14 nanometer in mass production to alleviate the problem so yeah you'll just start seeing some of these older nodes just being like yep let's just start uh let's start ramping up production again so that's uh this one unfortunately we'll get up we'll get over this news though so basically the tsmc uh prioritizing the chips for cars this is real they're saying shortages on uh chips in general could last now until june they forecasted until april but what we saw with the rtx 3080 for example that was forecasted to be in shelves in february and then that's been pushed back to easily april now so i think june july is probably realistic when you start seeing some sort of normalcy back in tech and even gaming related products but um speaking of tsmc i mean we had this from last year i mean amd imagine like amd i'm gonna say this would have been in a lot more of a shortage had tsmc uh not huawei had huawei not cancelled their orders with tsmc so basically tsmc had massive orders with tsm sorry huawei had massive orders with tmzmc they had to cancel those because of the us sanctions and then that amd pretty much i think amd took up a lot of that spare freed up space on the wafer production line so that was one that came in and so that was kind of a savior for amd where they're already experiencing uh chip shortages so that's pretty much it that's the hot news man we got through that really quick and we got a two dollar donut as well thank you so much we'll get back to the uh get back to the chat here are we going to i hope you're doing all right my dude peace i'm doing pretty good i'm i mean it's true i'm going to tell you guys you guys brian you lost a little bit of weight i did go on the scales i lost about three or four kilo in the last two months um it was funny because my friend i went over i haven't seen him for a few months and he's like dude you lost some weight i'm like yeah everyone's been saying i've been losing weight i mean i feel good feel good feel efficient it's like i dropped down to a yeah like i say before i drop down to like an rtx 30 80 down to a 30 60 ti but you know the 360 ti is kind of like that most efficient card right so i'm running at high efficiency right now so i'm doing doing pretty good doing pretty good but i think in general like i'm going to be honest with you guys i think in general the whole consensus out there like the whole feel out there is that no one knows what what is going on in the world you know like what is really going on in the world there is that thing in the back of your mind where it's like what is going on right now no one's got any answers it's just like here's a jab bang yeah we're gonna everything's gonna be all right it's like well is it because you know things don't look like it's gonna be all right so let's be real but anyway let's get on to chat if you guys have some hot pressing topics we are going to discuss with you guys right now now do be careful i'm going to warn i'm going to keep warning about this on live stream as well do be careful with scams there's so many like i'm getting reports of scams every single day almost coming in like hey brian is this a scam this is a scam and i'm gonna tell you a lot of the stuff out there looks like it's a scam so be careful if it's too good to be true like i saw someone the other day selling a 5700 xt on facebook marketplace and um i didn't include it in the parts on because it just looked too sass i messaged the guys like oh yeah come and have a look here's the address in bold caps letters i'm like oh man i'll just paypal you the money you know you send it down he's like no bank deposit only i'm like okay bank deposit only uh seems a little bit sauce so yeah do be careful guys i'm gonna say do be careful about the scams so we're gonna hit another five dollar donut thank you mr andrew stewart you're gonna keep night shopping now for news parts a big fan from canada yeah thanks i'm definitely going to be starting off parts hunts at night time uh preferably on weekdays it seems like you can get the best deals on a monday or tuesday that's what i'm looking at when uh people just are generally probably hungover from the weekend they're not looking much on the marketplaces and then people are listing the stuff because they're home they've just finished on the weekend they're like i gotta get rid of some stuff so i'm gonna be sticking to like monday and tuesday now night time i really do like what happened this month like honestly i was blown away by we got some really good deals like when you look at that and especially the guys in the states i think you guys over in the us are having a worser time with graphics cards than we are in australia like you for instance you can still get and i'll show you guys right now you can still get a um i think you can still get a gtx like 37 you can still buy one right they're still on they're still in shelves wait oh wow okay the price has gone up see i supposed to say like i think we literally pulled this up on the last live stream the price has gone up 200 though you can still get a 30 70. it's just the price has gone up 200 bucks that's that's crazy man that's crazy that is actually crazy yeah you want to get in 30 30 60 tis of course being the miner's favorite um and we got a 10 donation here from benjamin ford thank you so much hey brian i bought a hp omen desktop rtx 3090 system hp hasn't shipped it yet i used omen systems any good i used moment systems i mean yes yeah i mean generally like i would wouldn't buy an omen system but i have seen was it dell that were doing like decent prices check that out actually i mean i used to it depends on the price right if the i mean yeah i haven't even tried i think i've got one in the history of the channel a used omen system one and it was okay like it's gonna do the job fine just be careful the biggest thing to be careful with pre-built any pre-built for that matter is a single stick of memory it is the worst enemy out there if they they'll just put a single stick of memory and they're untuned and then people be like man my uh my hb omen or whatever my dell desktop is not running right now it's like yeah because you got untuned with single channel memory and it really is affecting your performance so i think it was dealt like dell was actually doing a decent deal on rtx 3070 based systems um i mean i was i wasn't too sure like they had some good sales going on i mean this isn't like dude i don't even work with dell at all oh wait no that's that's terrible 1650 super i mean i did see it somewhere i did see it somewhere there was a 30-70 system alienware as well which are notorious for ripping people off oh yeah i mean yeah alienware yeah i mean i don't even go into alienware really well alienware is dell oh yeah they own them yeah so that was pretty much that so ugh anyway anyway guys just like this is the scary thing like who knows right who knows hit me with some questions hit me with some questions please talk about the amd usb issues that amd admitted officially on reddit there's surprisingly little press coverage pressure for much such a massive issue okay amd uh usb issues yeah this is live this is the live stream guys you tell me the topic i'm going to check it out straight away especially if it's got to do a tech so amd investigating usb issues let's see what they said to that so we're talking about usb ports cutting out because if the gpus what all the usb ports okay you got a five dollar we'll talk about the story right now let's get over there donation from joshua young thank you so much for the five dude uh us us ebay facebook marketplace 30 60 tis for a thousand to 1200 usd oh man that is bad and it's bad with scams yeah oh guys like they'll be look let's just stick to used pc parts from going forward i mean i've got the 3060 review coming out tonight for you guys uh like every time we're talking about new parts it just seems like it's just you know the and this is the thing the more you talk about and i'm gonna tell you guys the more you talk about these these negative issues the more it's gonna like trust me if you if you eat bad food all the time you your body's not going to get energy and all that if you just talk about bad stuff all the time it's just going to get in your mind and it's going to make you negative so let's try to just stick to the positive stuff for me the only positive avenues like literally use parts right now that's what i've i picked i did that parts on as sort of like it was so refreshing to do that and i was just like man i can't wait because we had just finished uh cutting the rtx 3060 review and i was like man i need to go out and get these used part signs because we just finished doing the review and it's like kind of like news flash it's not like the greatest news ever like it's like wow look at the situation right now so yeah that one's uh yeah we'll try like damn anyway uh malcolm foggity 5 donation thank you so much hey brian what would be a good price for a used 1070 ti at the moment 300 aussie dollars 350 is probably what you realistically can expect to get one for um i've seen them go as high as 450 as well so if you can get one in usd terms even for like from judging from those prices i've just seen before 250 usd would be great but again i don't know the us market right now and from what i've seen with the us market it is really bad so i've actually just got to read this story as well because i'm not i haven't been made aware of it sorry guys i so amd is aware of the reports that a small number of users are experiencing intermediate uh usb connectivity problems with 500 series chipsets we have analyzed the cause and at this time would like to ask community for assistance with a small selection of additional hardware configurations in the next few days some slash amd users may be contacted directly by amd through reddit's pm system with a request for more information now something doesn't work properly so you guys are giving it to us um in the comments as well for me it's the usb 2 ports dropping out when pcie 4 is enabled for the gpu that seems to be the most common issue but it's not the only one usb is unstable in general okay so that's generally like usb is off the chip set but the usb usb 2 then usb 2 would be off the chipset wouldn't it would usb can you pull up a diagram for the amd cpu quickly where's like the yeah the usbs are running off the direct cpu i think they are verizon are they man like yeah i gotta jog my memory again let's have a look see if we can sort of like live stream here just look at what the problem could actually be and where it lies try and pull up the dough okay so it's the usb port's going through the chipset yeah okay so we'll try and even pull that up some off cpu okay so this is the thing about it like okay usb gen2 is going through this so four usb gen 2 is going through the cpu eight usb so do we need more data here is it the ones off the chip set so here we go right now so five dollar donate from data queue thank you so much too ever considered a track day with your ring stinger keep up the bargain lots dude yeah uh that's the five dollar aussie i noticed the aussie there i noticed the ring sting uh this thing ran a ring stinger man uh we had the the jalapenos on the pizzas the other night that was that was a ring sting um thanks for the five dollar donation i will once i get around to it i do want to uh take the stinger out on the track that'd be awesome i still i love the stink man this thing is amazing car i think that's that car alone put here on the map that car alone was just absolutely phenomenal but okay so we got the problem here let's pull up this diagram from good old gamers nexus oh yeah that'd be right gn has like the full breakdown of everything of course so we've got um usb uh 3.2 gen 2 ports going through the chipset the x570 chipset so this is x570 it's x570 related and we've got now 12 usb ports potentially going through the x570 chipset and then we've got four usb 3.2 gen 2s going through the cpu so if we can identify where the problem lies is it with the ports on the chipset or with the cpu then you can say okay it's a cpu problem or it's a chipset problem well it runs well it's well i mean yeah well the gen 4 runs off the cpu so inclined to say it's probably the cpu issue rather than a motherboard issue like but it doesn't work that's what i mean then does it but does it do it on but does it do on b550 that's good so you need to start doing like you need to get down to this and do some real heavy testing so find someone who has the issue and then get the cpu that they actually have make sure it's not a faulty cpu here's the funny thing i've had a faulty amd cpu come through here yeah well the power gpu thing's sort of it's the sample size isn't big enough it was a hundred i mean it depends something like i got to talk to him more as well because i do i do follow so power gpu did put out a thing a tweet but he later retracted it and he had a heap of faulty cpus he was saying was dead on arrival but then i'll sleep i got to talk to him more because there was articles saying he wasn't it was it was with four sticks of memory so the 26 66 megahertz speeds are the official limit on four sticks so it might have been that rather than the actual faulty cpu itself which is fair enough like amd do only guarantee their cpus up to certain memory speeds same with intel if you read the fine print even though they do print on the box 3200 megahertz supported that's actually only for two sticks of memory so that's what's going on there so there's the faulty cpu thing i have had a faulty ryzen 3 3100 come through and it the usb ports here's the funny thing it was it was a i think it was the usb ports and the the pc no the pci gen4 wasn't working properly that's right pci gen 4 was faulty on the cpu no because we i put a graph card through the chipset and it worked it was just much lower performance yeah so that was that worked so that's why i like to test that so i i've had a cpu with the faulty pca gen4 so what it could be i mean i'd love to test this out though because after that i haven't really had any issues i have had usb ports like drop out occasionally and that that has happened on like an x570 test bench but it's not a big deal you just plug the mouse back in or something like that so um and so they're saying well it's only if pca 4.0 is enabled so then perhaps it's a voltage issue as well so that's what i mean it could be a voltage issue with the soc or something like that so again you'd have to then give the actual faulty i mean yeah technically it's faulty hardware right if your usb ports are cutting out it's technically faulty hardware so you're either entitled to a refund or you've got to test out what the actual issue is so after looking at this for you guys on live stream i'm going to put my money on it's a cpu just going to say that or potentially the bias voltages aren't high enough so yeah anyway yeah well it's a big deal if you're streaming and your webcam or capture card drops out exactly yes that is very true yeah that's extreme that's i mean i'm i've got an intel i got an intel system streaming you know so that's that's no one it's like hey if you're streaming or you're doing a capture just just go get an intel system but um that's not that's like just get some zeons yeah they'll never fail you just get some zeons but it doesn't take away from the fact that um if there are these issues you have to get to the bottom of them quickly because yes people pay especially on x 570 especially if they're buying the latest ryzen 5000 series chips you have to get on top of this quickly and now i can't i can only just guess what the problem is like literally for you guys looking at this on live stream i can cover this topic for you and make a guess and that's all i can do so my my money's on either faulty cpu or bad could be bias problem or voltage on the actual not being supplied enough to the soc so that would be my three if i had to say it for you guys live but is there a problem yeah if enough people have been reporting on the issue then yeah it definitely is a problem another thing is too here's another kicker if you're using x570 using with a real mediocre power supply and this is what we talked about recently we've went on this whole um to raid uh there's way too many okay so someone's ryona said uh if you read the comments on the official announcement that amd made on reddit you'll see that there is way too many affected users okay i don't think it's faulty hardware because if so holy yeah i mean if it's faulty look if it's faulty hardware yikes that's all going to say but let's not go there let's just hope it's not that um let's really not hope is that like if that's faulty hardware then damn dude damn that's all i'm gonna say really damn um that you're right with that comment so there's way too many affected users on reddit there we go uh we got a piloso ars 100 what currency is ars i have not heard that love your content greetings from uh argentina uh was it argentina argentina sweet we got a viewer in from argentine man thank you so much argentina thank you how you doing in argentina it's one country i really want to go to i really want to go to argentina for some like for some reason i just really want to go there's that place i've i've met people from argentina i think and they're lovely people so that's probably why i want to go there um yeah i don't know why i said argentine initially yeah i don't know i was like i think yeah hey look don't don't ever like um i'm not the best when it comes to uh pronouncing certain words i mean people people took my uh german intros that when i didn't want to do the german intro people took that series i love them when people in the comments like bro it's not this and they're getting so serious about it like guys that's aussie humor it's called stirring the pot so like when i'm making a joke like that uh like this is you know wilcoman brian my name is that's german for my name is brian welcome to the channel but it's not like it's not at all uh so amd amd man okay let's just hope that they've got their um let's just hope that this can be fixed with a bios update but again one thing i was going to before we got like before i got sidetracked and the brain went off in yonder one thing i will say about this whole issue with the x570 stuff right here is that um one thing you can do is if you do do test it with a really high quality power supply and then do test it with a mediocre dumpster dive even a dumpster power supply that'll give you some answers pretty quickly as well whether it's a voltage issue because you put a really bad power supply on that x570 and cpu and stuff like that like not really bad but just one with pretty high ripple and then one that's got like really like good ripple low like low ripple that can give you answers as well so that's one thing like diagnosing problems is actually like it's one thing that i love and do because a lot of it comes down to trial and error and then you're like okay that's the problem we've nailed it there so um uh do you so we got ah bam we got it metamed bam bosnia thanks for the content greetings from bosnia we got we got donated 10 bam thank you yeah that's a man that's a wicked currency acronym that's that's the best i've heard yet hey dude you better pay that yeah give me 100 bam i love it i love it so that's awesome you guys are cool yeah a lot of you guys from like you know the funny thing is like i think one of my biggest viewer bases now is from the philippines that's really cool i was like wow so like i guess as the audience grows we're getting more of like people who are enthusiastic about just the used price performance scene um and it's just awesome you guys are coming in from all parts of the world uh yeah we've got some viewers from venezuela actually in talks with uh someone on email from venezuela because i do want to do a story and a piece on venezuela because i think a lot of the world would like to know just some of the risks that can happen especially with hyperinflation inflation's been a big topic on um and inflation itself has been a big topic i'm sure that's on a lot of people's minds actually inflation a lot of people have been talking about a lot of people don't know what's going to happen i think you just don't know right you just don't know and then the people are talking about hyperinflation and stuff like that and we're seeing it like look wit at the moment i can definitely see like we can go on to quickly i guess at the moment we're going to talk about economics because it's always good to see what's going to happen and you guys in the comments what your thoughts are but um wait isn't the 30 60 isn't better than a 20 70 wait the 36 isn't better than 27 super yeah i mean like like it's yeah yeah well i actually didn't include the 2070 but yeah i mean yeah you'll get an idea of where it is anyway so um [Music] was it the what what am i opening the hold on what is it what is it oh why don't i open it up like why can't i open up live what's that oh yeah you're talking about opening from fake yeah true you don't want to pull up facebook on live stream yeah that's that's right okay okay cool all right we'll pull it up if my internet would actually get around aussie internet guys this we just got some technical difficulties here because uh aussie internet's so slow okay we got it here 329 okay these aren't no i photoshopped think so because there's two other ones as well okay so this is what's going on right now is why am i pulling up like okay guys i just you have to bear with me here i'm a little bit um i'm not going to say the word because you can't even say that word now i'm a little bit ret hey yeah isn't that a word you can't even i'm a little bit slow yeah i'm a little bit slow to i'm a little bit slopped okay anyway slow that's me guys i'm slow right now so um okay so we got the we'll pull up we'll pull up the rest of the images so apparently there's a few images that are here and they're they're showing us these price tags oh man i'm so like okay so guys just just hang with us for a sec while i'm streaming my browsers like okay so we got that one there we've got one more here i'm gonna give up soon dude okay 329 this is my facebook okay facebook's like open so i don't want to touch that otherwise i'll show the contacts and stuff all right so we got here 329 329 out of stock out of stock so this is apparently what came up for the 30 60s i mean yeah like i said earlier if you can get one of these at 329 then definitely do like just no brainer pricing before launch yes there's no stock whatever like sometimes they just put generic prices they don't naturally okay so there's just a generic prices i did hear it was on reddit there was a guy with the 3060 ti from evga he got one for like a good price 410 bucks yeah through like a so kudos to evga like live stream man kudos to evga for taking care of people in that way like manufactured direct like really good prices yeah so kudos to evga for not scalping people that's actually some really good news that's come in um yeah like that that one's awesome so anyway let's get back to the questions guys you make you guys make the live stream so we talked about the amd issues but yeah that one's that one's a that one's a sort of story in the making that one's a story in the making because uh if it's big enough i'll like i'll cover it i mean keep in mind this is one thing about reviewers as well uh we i've i have not bought any 5 000 chips off the shelves yet i will say that i'll be honest i'll say look i've not bought i've only got review sample 5 000 chips now usually with the reviews sample 5000 series chips they are going to be um they are going to be cherry picked like they're going to make sure they work before the reviewers get these things so in the case of the 3 100 that i received perhaps they were like oh yeah it's a 3 100 it's just doesn't matter if it's a review sample or not so maybe i just got like unlucky there but we've got here a question from delton as well why is the lg oled 48 inch so expensive 30 less than the 55 inch i heard it was just in the manufacturing process and the way they um the way they like cut up the oled panels or something like that in that it ends up being more expensive due to the production and it's in the assembly line it just ends up being more pre more expensive like on that note if uh oh wow okay am i is my stream stuttering or something okay because apparently it's in 4k oops uh at least the bit rate okay well at least the bit rates right okay hey as long as the audio is good i'm good as long as as long as the audio is good i'm good so yeah so the um the oled just go for the 55 inch i use the 55 inch cx it's the best thing you can get and at least with inflation it hasn't inflated the oleds yet at least in australia you can still get the 55 inch cxo led for a decent price so that's in 2021 at least you can get something that hasn't just gone through the roof and you know it's a so here we go so it's set to 1440p max okay no starter awesome you guys are loving the 1440p streams or 1440p it is then from here on in we're doing 1440p streams that's uh that's the that's the census from now on so i'm just going through some questions guys we'll pull up some juicy topics i'm just uh brainstorming what the next question is going to be i have a 10 400 with 16 gigabytes of 3200 hertz that's pretty slow memory do you think that would be enough to match with the 3060 uh yeah definitely dude like easy you can put a 360 ti 3070 with a 10 400 10 400 is a solid cpu a very very solid cpu you just got to make sure the motherboard you match it with can support the 3200 megahertz if not go for 20 60 66 tight timings on that memory so that's what you're going to go for so we'll just jump over to chat now and uh unless you guys have any more heartbreaking stories that are in the works then we will cover them live here for you so uh we'll pull up some the chat [Music] what's this also what'd you say [Music] ah 450 okay so yeah they're releasing it for 450. or pounds inside the pounds i don't know because okay all right so ben just state it again if you can what ben jones okay yeah i mean i'm like i'm assuming it's going to be 400 plus 400 usd plus so um so we got donated from five dollars from rc from nyc from new york city hey brian hello chat a first time stream viewer do you think the nvidia p106 cards are worth buying now for the retro gaming hd pc setups uh my opinion on p106 is that they are useless cards for gamers and the reason being is the drivers man like i like i tried the p106 and i got it to work and the problem was is that you need to keep getting a hacked driver and so once they sell all those p106s they just give up on supporting and doing the hacked driver and so when a new game comes out that needs a new driver the game just doesn't work on the p106 but that being said if you can get a p106 cheap enough and you just want to play older titles and you can link it up with the cpu like a intel like 3rd gen or 4th gen or something like that then it can represent some good value for money just know if you want to play like latest multiplayer titles even like fortnite or something gets an update you could be at mercy of it just not working properly at all with the p106 so that's the risk you take with that i i mean i've just seen them i just didn't like and especially for me because i'm flipping pcs i would never flip a pc with a p106 it would just be a nightmare if someone had to reinstall the driver they the config gets lost hey my pc doesn't work anymore you'd just be dealing with issues after issues so that's why like so the p106 yeah just know it's a very acquired sort of niche taste and it will require a bit of headaches to get it to work and stuff like that but once it's working it can work for older stuff that's just my opinion with that one so we got rick sanchez for two uh pounds we got here sup yes man uh what should be i what should i be asking for two seven nine nineties okay so you're selling the cards individually and uh what's up i'm pretty i'm pretty good man what's up pretty good but uh for a seven nine ninety man i haven't dealt with a seven nine ninety in a while i mean you'd probably get like just being real you'd probably get maybe 120 bucks for one now if you're in the us hundred dollars i mean they got a bit of novelty value too so i mean maybe they're going for more in the us that's the thing but i wouldn't pay any more than 100 usd for one because they are a toaster oven seven nine nineties are hot running cards so that's the dual from memory that's the dual 7970s or 7950s was it can you check that out dude yo dude can you check out if 799 799 is it 279 50s or 279 70s justin parish 4.99 don't know have you seen what radiant sevens are going for on ebay sold for parts at original retail and used around 2000 usd oh no we can check that out quickly i haven't seen what radeon sevens have been going for um sorry i just been pulling up the chat on this monitor so it doesn't look like i'm like looking away like over yonder hey guys what's going on we got a live stream right here anyway let's uh let's get this pricing up radeon seven radeon seven radeon seven vr oh wow there is someone selling one for like two there is someone selling one for like 2 000 from canada yeah i mean our completed listings too is a good idea yeah we'll have a look there um more filters show okay guys just bear with me here we'll take a look what's what these sold for so a thousand so one sold for a thousand dollars uh this is on ebay.com another sold for eight hundred dollars on free bid another one did sell for eighteen hundred dollars wow okay two thousand dollars wow okay man that's some discrepancy right there not working so that one wasn't working for parts as is okay so these guys are selling them like potentially not working and they're getting eight hundred to a thousand dollars for them yikes and then the working ones are going for two grand wow not working wow oh jesus oh man that's that the only reason someone's buying a radeon 7 is for crypto mining that's the only reason someone's buying one for again yeah this this cryptos this crypto man like stop printing out money stop printing money stop there we go governments worldwide stop printing god damn money this is what happens people just have money they borrow money with their reckless borrowing reckless spending what the man actually is that the most powerful card that's from that's mac that's what i'm thinking hey is this the most compatible mac okay yeah well i i just think it's a printer like you don't if you're buying for a mac 800 boxes for a dud yeah i'm gonna put this in my mac no i mean like why else would somebody buy a lot of gen cars yeah but not work not working i'm gonna put this dud graphics card in my mud yeah in my mac or in my mud yeah which is called mud it's just like yeah there's no argument there man it's all crypto miners there it is have you ever seen me rant it's about printing money yeah like it's just i think this is yeah i don't know what they want to do with this stuff man with the printer going like how's this the rba governor australia philip lowe he was nervous about quantitative easing now why would you get nervous about something i'll tell you why you get nervous about rolling up the printer i'll tell you why you get nervous about starting the printer up let me tell you philip lowe you get nervous because you don't know what's going to happen in the future that's what that's why you get nervous and yeah this two thousand dollars for a graphics card two thousand dollars yeah the money printed non-stop non-stop and that is the real problem i think that is the root cause of all this crap right now crypto currencies going through the roof everything just going pricing out a whole generation if you guys have kids i feel like like me man the generation these guys have no hope of getting any assets of working for anything like what a joke jeez anyway sorry you won't see me rant you won't see me rant much but man after seeing this like i mean how else do you like it's frustrating right like looking at this stuff you don't have a graphics card go up three hundred percent and it's old yeah yeah i have a son yeah so marcus i do have a son yeah so i know yeah i can't even see him now because of this whole crap going on worldwide and i really do want to see him i guess that's another my frustrations are coming out on live stream they've been painted they have been painted up for a little while so yeah but yeah let's uh like let's just tell the government like why stop here let's just get the money like let's just print out as much money as possible like let's just get this printer out and just non-stop like who cares about economics who cares about productivity let's just start printing printing printing so anyway yeah so why are people buying it yes i'm saying 250 markup or whatever yeah that's crypto minus this is a printed money going into crypto people money mine crypto so they pay no it doesn't mind as bad as good as the radeon seven i'm pretty sure yeah pretty sure the radio 7 is the best amd card for mining and there are like there's miners that are dedicated towards amd graphics cards so there's like team red miner and all this stuff that will give you more hash rates so it's not a it's a good mining because amd's best mining card that's why and it does have good power efficiency too because it's on seven nanometer so yeah anyway yep that's it just like look why stop here governments why stop here let's just get the just get the hell that's what they're saying get the helicopters fill them up with cash and let's just keep dropping cash all over the city that's gonna solve all our problems right fantastic there we go okay anyway guys we um we're gonna get back to this let's get back to some good let's get back to some good news right here oh man so that link on the radio on seven yes sorry that just blew me off the handle that card is not worth anywhere near to uh 10 grand sorry 2 grand so um we got a donation of sack 50 from sweden okay thank you kenny kenny smallman thank you gtx 764 gigabyte any gear any good greetings from sweden the gtx 764 gigabyte will do the job man like if you just want to play starcraft 2 a bit of starcraft 2 get you through some of these a bit of fortnite whatever you whatever your jam is on multiplayer titles the 760 will do a decent job and that's why like lately i'm just suggesting people sort of like don't buy this overpriced crap or maybe go buy it because it might be worth 10 grand at the rate the governments are going to print out money at so at the moment i don't have the answers for you guys but yeah like it's just all cash drops cash drops everywhere and it's like for the guys that work hard and save their money they're getting screwed left right and center that's what's happening right now so thank you governments and it doesn't mean the younger generation they got no hope of getting assets now so that's what i just really like oh anyway we covered this in um what video did we cover this in like it's basically one of those things where the people who get the money first benefit first so institutional banks getting the cheaper money investment firms investment arms yeah investment arms all that stuff they're getting that cheap money first they're the ones that are going to benefit most out of this stimulus and that's exactly what you're seeing crypto farms who have rich investors are buying up all the gpus let's be real here guys let's be real it's they're getting they're getting all that funding that cheat money straight up bang they get it before anyone else you know you want to make a fair system on printing money how about you give the average citizen with an income level under a certain level access to borrow that money before an institution for an investment bank why do the investment banks get first dibs on this money i'll tell you why because the whole system's rigged that's why anyway ugh frustrated sorry guys frustrated yeah give me that i did blew me off the handle the radeon seven price blew me off the handle because i know exactly what's going on with it all ah [Music] yeah anyway finance studying it all let's go with some ques no one's got any questions i think everyone's like damn just dropped a truth bomb on this live stream you know so i want bitcoin to fail i will laugh my ass off when it does i mean bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin i mean it's in one way it's it's a bad thing in one way it's a good thing i mean look it is in ways like what people say is true it is a hedge against what the governments are doing with the printers but in other ways it's a band-aid to a broken system as well that's uh yeah so that tech is here you know inflation is hidden tax yeah definitely it's it isn't it is hidden tax exactly because you you basically the value of your savings is going down and it's going down it depends on how quick the inflation is but it can go down at a rapid rate so they want kind of like that 70s 80s esque inflation back but the thing about the 70s and 80s was you had it was natural it wasn't printed money so uh joshua for the five dollar donut thank you so much uh sub dude i'm yeah i'm doing pretty good besides the rant i have some pcs with i5 6500 msi motherboards and 600 watt power supplies no gpus would you wait for the gpu market to settle or part out the builds now ah just try and get some like try and get some um try and get some high vram if you want to flip the builds try and get some high vram parts in there like a gtx 774 gig you'll be able to flip it and make a little bit of bank right now too because i just think the prices of gpus are through the roof but you can get those gpus especially the four gig cards and you notice i said four gig there four gig and under is definitely your take on getting a gpu for a decent price right now and then flipping it on the used market because it's just that undercurrent system now that's what i'm seeing there's this undercurrent where gamers can actually get decent prices if they target four gigabytes and under so that's um that's that one anyway johnny sims for the uh ron for the ron from romania man we got all sorts of donations this is the this has been the most diverse stream in terms of donations and money i that's i thought i heard a lot of these currencies in the world but then some bam bam was like damn that's pretty cool and then we got ron so you could name your kid ron say hey give me 50 ron he'd be like he'd be confused he's like i'm the only ron i mean i meant the currency dude anyway grades from romania things aren't great here either our search for pc garage and look at prices the average wage is 4 000 ron and we usually pay 20 percent more so what is the average weight like 4 000 ron to usd so how much did the average wage is nine so a thousand dollars a month okay so is that a monthly figure or a thousand dollars so the average wage is a thousand usd a month in romania okay that's and then you got well that's it's it's it's hard for these guys to get pc parts so if they make a thousand bucks a month and there's six hundred dollars for a graphics card now because it's overpriced i feel sorry for them that's this hot that's tough you know this whole situation is just like you see it just makes the rich richer and the poor poor man it's like it's not a system that works for the average person at all it's so broken and it's like it's just marred with crap like mod like i would go down conspiracy avenue but i'll probably save it for later like off the live stream maybe if we'll do it on the patreon vlog or something i'll probably i'll do it on the patreon vlog i will go down conspiracy avenue for you guys because i do see what's going on now and i sort of like i can see what's going it's just sad man like uh anyway kevin burnell thank you

stream tetsu five bucks thanks so much for the donation greetings from the us uh absolutely hate these prices on literally everything right now would an i5 45 90 and an rx 470 be great 1080p computer yeah yeah that'd be solid man great combo right there especially if all you want to do is play those as we said before easy to play title that's going to give you some good fps go with that especially the four gigabyte model you're not going to be getting ripped off at least too much so that is definitely a good way to go right now so johnny winter dkk 50. uh kroner something croner yeah danish current yeah from yeah danish corona dkk thanks for the donation my man there was no question attached or anything like that but amen danish coronel gotta love isn't the sweetest kroner as well the swedish crown of danish chrono is there the norwegian coroner currencies man this is turning into a currency stream yo brian what do you what do you think's gonna happen man i think okay so here's my little like i think what's gonna happen is the swedish uh the swede franc is gonna go down against the um against the aussie dollar i think the aussie dollar right now as well this is another thing too aussie dollar is out of control right now everybody wants an aussie dollar it's like can i get an aussie dollar dude can i get another dollar i heard a straight australia straight straight aussie dollar aussie dollar say going through the roof aussie dollars man everybody wants an aussie dollar right now so johnny sent 10 ron uh search for pc garage and take a look at prices okay we'll do this we'll wind up we'll line up the live stream but we'll take a look at pc garage romania pc garage romania we'll take a look at what is going on dot ro cannot as sorry if i cooler cardu i know that's the cpu cooler i'm guessing i cannot read the rest of this but let's have a look rtx what do we got here i'm not a robot no i'm not a robot man i'll come on pc garage it's probably like this guy's from australia yeah he's a robot my it's just it's locking me out won't let me in try my i'm try mighty i'm trying my i'm trying i'm trying my mind to get okay we got in that the internet look i'm guessing romania to australia is like one of the longest paths of internet you'll ever have to take in your life um so let's have a look rtx hit me carter that's search okay so i've learned two words trimet is accept quarter is search try might quarter accept the search i'm starting to learn language okay so they want for an rtx 37 let's just pull up the azus jewel right here okay let's pull up into zeus jewel right rtx we're in romania now [Laughter] where this live stream is going i have no idea we got 51 sec we got more from kenny smallman he's 51 sacked thank you so much i just wanted to donate more than the potato danish sweden forever we got a bit of a currency war now going on on the live stream oh we got some currency so sweet currently sweden is in top spot guys sweden is the best of the krona currencies apparently we got shampoo time aussie two dollars yo you didn't pick up the 50 70 from me and prince ah i will come and pick that up from you next time brother sorry i did forget actually i'm gonna apologize live stream people locally message me and i i do just completely apologize mind blank blame blank tech i remember mine blank tech my blank tag mine blank tech man i remember mine blank tech what happened to mine blank tech he was like all about the rise and memory he was like rising memory man you get a 3 600 megahertz i was like yeah mine blank deck what happened to my blank tech anyway i i have a mind blank myself anyway so johnny winter dkk 50 uh johnny winter in denmark a 1050 ti goes for over 300 aussie ouch okay uh ken yaza 2021 10 what gpu gives you nostalgia is there one you remember that has a nice design or a memorable box shroud stickers yeah the mast cards yeah mars guards bang that's it mars cards done there it is the gtx mars card man i'm actually gtx 580 mars it was not it was huge man gtx 580 mars yeah okay i'll pull that up but we'll check out how much a gpu costs in romania first five that's about so 509.99 i'm guessing it's like 1300 u.s yeah just judged on what i saw with the average salary okay let's have a look here yeah 1270 for an rtx 3070 man that's from a retailer too i i did okay you guys look the 1200 aussie dollar price tag we've got going on with the rtx 3070 right now is bad but this is worse i do feel sorry for you guys over romania that sucks oh man pc gaming so let's pull up the gtx 580 mars wow you know my gtx 580 miles probably worth like a million dollars at this rate eh here's this paper money brian it's useless give me that gtx 580 mars okay gtx 580 mars here it is right here oh yeah look at that look at that fellas that is the gtx 580 it's a massive graphics card like absolutely huge this thing and this was back in the day when gpus were small like now this thing would well there's there's linus look at linus holding it too i wonder if the linus i hope he still has one of these things because they're a collector's item now that's the gtx 580 mars so i hope he still kept that one three a pin it was legit like it was the first real real massive out of this planet gpu man you held the they used like industrial level fans on it that's how good it was this one's like my before anyone else like i never use that word well look how dense everything is it's huge man yeah like it's this was yeah there's a special card for a few other reasons but yeah that's the one that gives me nostalgia so we're going back to questions here 45 70 uh too much of a bottleneck paired with a 1652 but no it's about right it depends on the game though the 4570 may especially the single thread dependent may come into a little bit issues but for what it's worth it's going to be a decent combo i've tested this in the past i think with a 4440 or something and it has done pretty well uh hey brad what cpu would you recommend for cs go i have a 240hz monitor and 3770k i'm hitting average 200 fps and i'm looking to upgrade the cpu what would you recommend um csgo man i haven't done enough testing but two you want to get 240 right do you want to get 240 you just want to get maximum fps because i think the 5000 series does the best on um cs go i think the 5600 x is gonna be like the cs go king i know the 5800x i tested was the king but that's gonna have a bit of a premium over the 5600x yeah so yeah that's what i thought fifth gen like if you want max fbx you just want to get above 240 fps you can go with like maybe even like a 10 400 f should be able to do it fine uh that's a cheap upgrade so i have a leftover 1660 ti and 1660 super should i hold or sell if you've got them left over sell right now sell into this smell sell into this market man it's a seller's market right now when it's a seller's market you sell like that's just what i know from economics if it's a seller's market you sell that's generally um how you do it so yeah i'd sell you if you got spare cards i mean as well try and like not like if you can try and not like completely rip people off that'd be all right too because it's just yeah i mean yeah you gotta make a premium but like it's just ridiculous i'm like two thousand dollars for a radio on seven man like yeah and we've got a donation here from mendoza zodonam for the php 500 philippine pesos would that be about 25 dollars thank you so much for the donation i tried to build and donate two pcs to small schools to small schools a year 2019 was able to donate four fourth gen i7 pcs due to pandemic i'm only able to build two second gen i5s hopefully everything is good with you much love from philippines you guys are in the philippines are amazing absolutely amazing that's thank you so much for the donation thank you so much for just donating to small schools and stuff like that i gotta get back on my donation game as well it definitely does bring a smile to your face um for me personally i this is a scary thing i had so many troubles just trying to give away pcs to schools in my area it was the regulations here in australia were just like crazy crazy to the point where i um the regulations were just like out of this planet crazy where i was really having a hard time just giving away stuff which was very weird so it's great to hear that news man i've got to get on my giveaway game too and i think like i don't know like in ways i don't like giving away publicly i i do give away and i do show what i do give away publicly like sometimes but like i like giving away just behind the scenes it's really cool like you're just helping your public you know your community where you live and i think you know in the long term it's an investment too you're just helping people out everyone uh gets along you know it's funny because in australia like where i'm at in australia i've had a lot a few people move up from new south wales and they're like man i love it up here on the gold coast i love it in queensland people are just like people can just have a conversation with each other i'm like yeah like when you see me pick up used parts i think a lot of people are surprised because they see what i do on the used part science and they see the atmosphere and like the way things get done where i'm at in southeast queensland and that's how everyone is here people are pretty chill like uh you just go pick up a pc part and you can meet with a person however sometimes i've even had beers with just random people that i pick pc parts off or they come over here and they buy a pc and we're just having beers that's sort of like that culture i want to keep that and the way you keep that where you live is by just being real like if you've got you know if you come and um if you're coming into a good part you're just coming into a good you know a good slice of pie you give some back sort of thing but i think the problem nowadays is that like not many people want to give much of the pie back so um anyway so uh yeah i don't know anyway getting we're finishing off with that's good news we're gonna we're gonna keep on positive training so alan c dash b uh canadian five bucks thanks for the donation hello my uh fellow commonwealth member saying how you doing mate from toronto canada right it's from canada i think
