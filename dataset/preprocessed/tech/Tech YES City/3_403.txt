if you are in the market for a used graphics card should you be considering a GTX 970 or a GTX 780 even or possibly a GTX 1060 and r9 390x or of course the popular rx 580 which is still sold on the new market as good as a value at offers on the used market however that being said use price performance usually beats out new price performance by quite a bit so if you're in the market to save some money which of these five cards is going to represent the best bang for buck let's roll that intro roll some benchmarks for you guys and then come back to the verdict and yes I did shave my head because I had to keep the organic cooling efficiency at a hundred and ten percent [Music] and after benchmarking those cards I can say one thing for certain and that is all five cards that we said in the intro all have a really good purpose they're all kind of competing in the same league except with the exception of the GTX 780 that seems to be falling behind and the first benchmark we'll pull up here to sort of advocate on this is a strange brigade where we can see that this card used to be closer to a 970 until basically a synchronous support on games came out where strange brigade is known to support a Singh computer and so that can lift the numbers up and basically when the 780 doesn't really have that at the base line it's going to fall behind at 1440p and also 1080p but the three gigabyte frame buffer as well also does put a limitation on this card especially when we're pumping the settings up to ultra though for what it's worth I picked this card up for just under 60 US dollars so eighty Australian dollars I mean the way the currency markets going at the moment this will probably be around 40 USD in a couple of months time but who knows but basically this card here is really interesting because I think I should be doing a dedicated video on its own where I'm lowering the settings and overclocking it and then really seeing what it's for but since we've got so many good cards here the GTX 970 the i-93 90 X GTX 1016 the RX 580 those five cards are really the cream of the crop if you're looking to get into use price performance I'd say the exception though we will talk about the r9 390x and roll through some of these numbers we see this performing very close to a 1060 and and rx 580 and fortnight of course being one of the most popular games out there this card's going to do very well the problem with the online 390x currently is is availability I can't really find this Cod consistently at good prices and as current price point for instance in Australia 250 Aussie dollars I'd much rather pick up an RX 580 a gigabyte that's going to use less power and get similar performance because when we pull up these power consumption results for you guys right here we zero the 390x is a power hog despite of getting really good performance and despite is still having an 8 gigabyte framebuffer it's just falling way behind on the power efficiency so this means going to have to have a better case if you're on a budget but a power splay and all those things really do matter especially when we put it in relation to the price performance of these used cards on the bench here moving through shadows of the Tomb Raider at 1080p in 1440p the 780 lightning does fall behind with that three gear by frame buffer again but the GTX 970 we can see here this is starting to become a real champion of the bunch in my opinion and I've put here in the graphs you'll notice 3.5 to 4 gigabytes of vram because you can interpret that how you want it kind of like AMD's FX 8 core some people interpret it as a fork or some interpreted as a 6 core in between and some people like myself when we're advertising a gaming PC still just say no it's gonna be an 8 core but this right here gtx 970 it's an impressive card considering i picked this one up in particular for a hundred and twenty dollars and ice to see them consistently at around these prices and so you're not really paying the nvidia tax with this particular card and in fact it's coming very close to that of the gtx 1066 gigabyte of course you do lose out a bit on the frame buffer but at 1080p it's still a relevant card in 2020 and the power consumption results are actually pretty close to the bunch it's not going too far out of proportion and it's still giving great performance they're going through the rest of these titles we've got a far cry here 1080p and 1440p you guys may notice i like to have a bit of fun with the titles here and there and these numbers are pretty much looking very similar to the other results and the other games and then the last title for honor pretty much sticking to the trend here both 1080p and 1440p showing that all five cards are matching up well to what you can expect to get them from the use market though let's get into a conclusion right here because what I saw is if you go out and buy an rx 580 or a GTX 970 there would be my two cards at the moment if you're looking for raw price performance they're pulling all these gravis cards into the charts here we can see that the 5500 XT specially isn't looking like it's such good value for money anymore especially since we've got a used price performance comparison going on here and that cards currently going on the new market I mean in Australia you can expect to get this thing for 350 Aussie dollars or more and when we look at the price we paid for the 970 on the weekend for instance a hundred and twenty Aussie dollars we see the price performance of used cards is just so much better right now they're going back to the power consumption numbers it is a good thing that cards are getting more power-efficient but I just don't think the value for money is getting a whole lot better there I mean we look at the 970 it's really not drawing a whole lot more power than these newer cards take for instance the 5500 XT but the price difference between this new card and the used 970 is huge that's enough for me to just ignore those power efficiency numbers and just say look if you want the best price performance go for use graphics card but another thing that does concern me is the 970 for example in the r9 390x these were considered basically mid-range cards back when they're released over five years ago so basically five years in the making we really haven't seen a big jump in our mid-range graphics cards and so I would like to see that level especially that 200 us price point really start to bring us more price performance I guess that's the biggest takeaway from this video for me personally though all that aside do let us know in the comment section below what you think is the best use price performance graphics card at the moment I think the 970 and also the rx 580 are my two top picks because they're both pretty much readily available in stock you can always pick up a 970 on the used market generally and you can always pick up an rx 580 in fact they're so readily available you can get them on eBay buy it now usually all the time or if that fails you can go to Aliexpress anyway do let us know in the comments your thoughts also let us know if you enjoy the tech yes ramble but speaking of tech yes ramble we've got the question of the day here for Shampoo time and they asked any plans on increasing your team size I think you're a one-man band with an editor sometimes but anything in the works for a crew and so we're talking about tech yes city in general and it's hard as a one-man band like I'm gonna be honest my Video Editor hasn't actually been in here for a good five months since pax because he's been doing his own thing so I've just been one man banning YouTube in the videos for all that time and it is hard like YouTube's hard and the reason I don't bring on someone else is because it's just not consistent enough if you guys look back on the past even two months on my channel sometimes I'll be getting good views on the videos they'll go up to like 50k a day on every single video release then there's weird it feels like something comes down on my channel and I'll get like 10k views or 20k views so it's just too inconsistent for me to employ someone and with that it's like if I did employ someone that's like hey the views are bad this month we've got to drop your paycheck down and I really don't want to do that at the moment so it's just I'm at that level where if things were a bit more consistent I would bring someone on there because they just rollercoaster at the moment I'm a little bit reluctant to bring someone on because it's unfair for them to give them a job and then a few months later hey YouTube's doing terrible so we got to cut your so that's kind of like the one reason I've just been soloing a YouTube and another and another reason to is in Australia if you want to get someone who's qualified to edit videos like really well and do all the stuff that I do here it's gonna cost me a lot of money to to employ that person hope that answers that question that if you guys enjoyed today's use price-performance GPU roundup then be sure to hit that like button for us also if you stayed
