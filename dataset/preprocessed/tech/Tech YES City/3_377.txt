when Sony first released the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft first released their Xbox one I was scratching my head a little bit because I thought both these consoles back then we're coming out with essentially outdated hardware however when we fast-forward now to 2020 it's looking like it's a much different story for the upcoming PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X and so in today's video we're going to go through these touted spec sheets on both these consoles and see what's going to make this generation of consoles are a lot better than the previous generation but also on that note this is coming from a PC guy who has been playing PC games for most his life in other words I've got a strong bias towards my desktop gaming PC's over console [Music] so starting off with the Xbox series acts this is the console that Microsoft have already essentially confirmed the spec sheet on what's going in this new console and what they're putting in here is eight course 16 threads of Zen to CPU cores and that's right you heard me right there this is the latest CPU cores out available on the market from AMD and not only that this time around AMD has better IPC than Intel and that's instructions per cycle and this is very important because the higher this is essentially for the clock speeds that your CPU is at the more it can do in other words the better it can do for gaming and so the fact that it has these newer CPU cores going into it plus the clock speeds that they're going to be clocked at and this is another very important thing where Microsoft's saying it's gonna be three point eight gigahertz without SMT enabled and three point six gigahertz with SMT enabled and essentially that's just hyper threading so basically you're gonna have eight threads at 3.8 gigahertz and then 16 threads at 3.6 ki Goods this is a massive step up from the previous generation consoles where they were clocked roughly around 1.8 to 2 gigahertz on eight outdated cores at the time and so we can see the massive improvement here we're getting eight core 16 threads of the latest and greatest that has clock speeds clocks similar to that of desktop pcs as opposed to the previous generations which had CPUs that were coming out they're already outdated on old sluggish hardware and so before we even jump into the graphics processors going into these consoles you see that these CPUs are so important in getting smooth FPS but also getting higher fps and so this is a big reason why a lot of PlayStation 4 and also Xbox one users were making the switch to PC because they can play games like fortnight with higher FPS when you CPU cores are only clocked at 1.8 gigahertz and they have an outdated design you're going to get low FPS as a result of that however let's move over now to the PlayStation 5 that's rumored to have the same eight Call of 16 threats of Zen to going into it and this is gonna be clocked at 3.5 gigahertz however in the case of the PlayStation 5 the specs is still not yet 100 and confirmed but for what it's worth it looks like the PlayStation 5 in the Xbox Series X will have very similar CPU processing power potential however that being said that's only half the equation now we're going to move over to the GPU side of things where this is where the two consoles will differ quite a bit where the series X is reported to have a graphics card in it that essentially hasn't even been released on the desktop gaming PC side of things yet so what they've got is a essentially in our DNA - and that's an AMD navvies - solution that will be going into these consoles that will essentially have graphical processing power better than that of a current generation 5700 XT for example which is AMD best desktop gaming graphics card out on the market at the moment and the fact that it's got more compute units of 52 versus 40 of that graphics card not only are you going to see better performance due to that extra Hardware inside but you're also going to have a generational improvement of efficiency and also more processing power and as for the clock speeds on this unseen GPU they're touting it as having eighteen hundred and twenty five megahertz flat which is coming in very similar to that of the current generation rx 5700 for example the move over to the PlayStation 5 side of things they're going with a rDNA to solution as well so that's the same generation of graphics from AMD but their unit is supposedly only going to have 36 compute units so essentially the graphics processing power is going to be a lot more on the Xbox series X then a theoretically could be on the PlayStation of life keep in mind that Sony haven't officially announced the specs just yet but these are the strong rumors coming through the industry that it's not going to be as powerful as the series X solution however on that note it is rumored to be clocked at 2200 megahertz so we'll still go very hard and if we were to compare this to a current generation AMD graphics card it looks like the specs are lining up with an rx 5700 because you got higher clock speeds and also a generational improvement it's going to essentially perform better than an Rx 5700 XT so there's pretty much the specs on the CPU and GPU side now what Sony and Microsoft are both doing is integrating their hybrid at GDD us six memory solution in that they're using dedicated graphics card memory and they're using that for the CPU side of things as well they already did this on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one so it's nothing new to the industry and it's essentially a cost-cutting measure that allows them not to use a standard ddr4 system memory and on top of that both console makers I'll be putting in quite large SSDs in these new consoles so essentially what does this mean for you now as a console game or even if you're a PC gamer and you're thinking about even getting a console and maybe playing games via a mouse and keyboard well to be frank and it does hurt me a little bit to see this the new consoles are going to be similar to high-end gaming PC's they've got relevant and latest and greatest CPU cores that are clocked quite high they've got GPUs going into them that essentially haven't even been released on the desktop market yet so not only you're gonna get a really good visual experience be also going to be able to play competitive multiplayer titles with high FPS which was something that the ps4 and Xbox one could never do judism having really weak CPU cores another thing about the older consoles is when they'll first release not only were the CPU cores out there but the GPU that they were using was estimated to be somewhere in the processing power of a seven seven ninety or a seventy eight seventy and so at the time here on the channel we built a few console killer builds and they were coming in with really good price performance and it does pay me to say this but this time around it's going to be very difficult for me to do a price performance build even if it's used to beat the performance of these new consoles and I'm gonna have to get really just ridiculous one-time deals in order to beat the price performance of this thing but that being said the prices of these new consoles Sony is rumored to be going around the $500 mark and the Series X the price is still undetermined but if I had to make a guesstimate I'd say it'd be anywhere from 600 to 700 dollars when we look at this year Hardware going into both these new consoles that stuff isn't cheap to manufacture so you can definitely expect a higher price tag than that of the original PlayStation 4 and Xbox one lastly in terms of the release dates you can expect these consoles to come out between October and December of this year apparently they were meant to come out earlier but due to the circumstances all around the world right now we really can't blame them if they're getting it out a bit later however I'm sure both these manufacturers will not want to miss the Christmas sales period there lastly in terms of the designs of both these consoles I would like to see them in the flesh before I pass any judgment I mean from what we're seeing so far we've got some new funky designs I really don't care a whole lot again until I see that in person because another thing as well that I'm really concerned about is the cooling on these new consoles where if I had a guest to make power consumption figures it'd be anywhere from 300 to 350 watts on the series X and then on the PlayStation 5 maybe 250 to 300 watts so they are going to consume a bit more power than the original PlayStation 4 and also Xbox one ever did and so when you can shimmy more power from a hardware standpoint you need better cooling so maybe these consoles will in fact be a bigger unit than what you used to and if they're using a smaller design that means smaller fans and what that means is you're gonna have a very loud console while you're gaming and with all that out of the way if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comments section below are you a PC gamer are you a console gamer and if so what do you think about these upcoming consoles as I said earlier in this video I think they're definitely gonna be something to look out for even if you're a PC gamer you've got to admire what Microsoft and Sony are both doing this time around in getting the hardware right so that being said do drop a comment as I love reading your thoughts and opinions just like this question of the day right here which comes from custom PC builder and they asked I heard old low resolution monitors are in demand now because you can get higher fps in games with them and this is mainly a PC gaming question where it comes back down to essentially lowering your resolution and that enables you to get higher FPS and that's because especially if your graphics card isn't fit for the job lowering the resolution will essentially make it less strenuous on the graphics card so essentially you can get high FPS it does work wonders especially if you're playing games like fortnight but that being said that is one good thing about PC is that you can customize all the settings you can customize your hardware but that is a trade off versus the consoles where they do get what's known as console optimization where you'll get yet even more performance so what's coming out of these new consoles I am definitely looking forward to seeing it and without a sight if you guys enjoyed the content you stayed this far and you want to see more of this tech related content and be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye and also as for a PlayStation 5 console killer pc build i'm definitely gonna be trying don't worry [Music]
