whole lot different it's still going to look   really good then you've come to the right video 
because today i'm going to go through each and   every menu for you i'm going to be turning some 
things off and changing things in windows 11   to make it better for power users and also if 
you're gaming as well you can gain a couple of   fps on turning a few of these features off let's 
get right into it but i've got also a sponsor spot   which you guys are going to want to check out

put in the description below but don't forget to   use that coupon code for a big discount let's get 
on with it and now we've installed windows 11 i'm   going to be in the bottom right hand corner during 
this tutorial guiding you guys through the whole   process another thing is too about today's video 
is that everything that we do is also reversible   we're not doing anything that can't be undone 
so if you come into a setting and it's maybe   in the future say for instance you're using a 
projector and you need that service then turned on   well then you can go back and turn it on if you 
then get a projector so the first thing we're   going to do now is just left click on windows 
right here and then just type in settings and   you can also hit the windows key if you've got 
one of those on your keyboard but we left click   on settings get into this menu here now there's 
going to be two menus one on the left here with a   lot of different settings and then one right here 
in the middle with a second lot of settings so   on this first one here system left click on 
this we want to go down to notifications left   click right here and what i'd like to do now 
is just turn off these two little options down   here because these are services that are running 
i like to keep them off then we're just going   to left click on focused assist and then we're 
going to turn off these two right here and leave   on gaming because we want if anything's crazy is 
going on we want to not be getting interrupted   when we're gaming most of these other ones if i'm 
listening to music or whatever and windows just   has to tell me something then that's okay i'll let 
them tell me something but also in focus assist i   like to put this on priority only if you turn 
this off you will get everything notified like   facebook messages and it really makes for me it's 
a lot of clutter so priority really only tells me   for instance when someone's sending a really 
important email i like to leave this one on   because if it's a really important email then you 
want to get it straight away but then after we've   done that we can left click on this top left arrow 
here and we can left-click that twice and that'll   take us back to this menu right here we can then 
go down to storage and we will get onto power   later because this menu here in power is just very 
limited there's not a whole lot here when we can   go via a different method we can unlock some other 
settings but left click on storage right here   and what we want to do here is i'm going to turn 
off storage sense i just find i never use this   i don't want another service turned on when 
it comes to just windows really running in the   background any invasive services so after doing 
that we can then left-click our way back to this   menu again and then scroll down to the bottom here 
and go to the about section left click that and   then we can left-click on system protection and 
what i like to do here is i like to turn this off   i've never found for me personally system restore 
it just doesn't work properly so i like to uh   sorry i'll do that again for you guys left click 
on configure and then left click disable system   protection then i also like to left click delete 
and so what that will do is to free up a bit of   storage on our drive but as well as uh get rid of 
this annoying service that's in the background as   well with system protection and then while we're 
on this little tab here with the system properties   then we've also got a another few tabs that we're 
going to go through so left click on remote here   and what i like to do is i like to click on 
advanced and then i like to turn this off by   just left clicking that left clicking ok then left 
clicking right here clicking ok again you guys   if you've watched some of my other optimization 
tutorials you may be familiar with this tab   and then we left click on advanced and what we're 
going to do here is go to performance settings   left click that and what i like to do is i like 
to go to a custom here and i like to turn off   all these animations and fades as well as these 
slide open combo boxes so we left click that and   that's basically just going to change our windows 
a little bit and it's going to essentially make   it a lot more snappier and it will take a little 
while to do this but once it's done it should be   okay and so you can see here it's like it's 
working it's like oh what's going on brian   and it's like well now it's going to be better 
so you'll notice that things will be a lot more   snappier as well just after doing that one setting 
but after we're done with that we can get back to   this menu right here and then go to startup and 
recovery and left click on settings and it's a   little bit of a bug still but windows 11 still 
recognizes this as windows 10 but what we want to   do here is uh left click this here time to display 
the list of operating systems i like to turn this   off and then left click ok and then left click ok 
once again then after we're done with this menu   right here we can then go to our side menu on the 
left tab here and then left click on bluetooth and   devices now if you guys need to have a bluetooth 
turned on of course if you're streaming music to   different players and whatnot then you can have 
this on i don't this is my work computer so i   like to strictly keep it for work purposes so i 
like to actually turn this off and have as little   devices as possible basically the less that can 
go wrong the less that can go wrong but there is   a section here called cameras i'm going to left 
click on this because i like to if we left click   on camera privacy settings i like to make sure 
that only the apps that i'm going to be using   can get access to my camera so feedback hub i 
don't want microsoft getting feedback from my   camera so i'm going to left click that microsoft 
photos as well i'm going to left click turn that   off as well as xbox game bar because i don't use 
the xbox game bar and uh all these cameras here   so for instance streamlabs that's already using 
the camera same with skype so we're going to   leave those on as well as the camera app say for 
instance you want to take a basic picture then you   can leave that on too but i thought that was an 
important one if you're using a webcam which i'm   sure a lot of you guys are so after we're done 
with the camera settings we can then go to our   personalization tab here just click on the 
left click on this personalization right here   and this has actually got quite a few important 
settings the first of which is going to be a   personal i guess it matches the theme right 
personalization how you like to have windows   looking but i like to left click on the background 
here and make sure it's not a slideshow because   this essentially has again another service in the 
background running and so what i like to do here   is use a picture if you are on a complete potato 
you may wish to just pick a solid uh color which   will again free up a little bit of resources but 
i find a picture and then i use this one right   here as you can see here i like these uh fancy 
colors and the dark background because what i'm   going to be showing you soon is we're going to be 
going for a dark theme in windows right here so   if we go now um just to the so we've done 
pictures there that's fine if we then left   click on our personalization we can then 
left click on colors just under background   and this is where i like to see we choose your 
mode here so this is where i like to go to dark   so left click on this little arrow right here and 
then we go to left click dark and this is going to   change everything so this tutorial is never going 
to be the same again but this is just i find it's   really easy on my eyes especially at night time 
i absolutely love dark mode on windows 11 because   it'll change all your different tabs like when 
you're browsing in google chrome for example   youtube will then go to dark mode then also right 
here transparency effects straight after that   i like to turn this off because what that does is 
then just makes windows uh use it less resources   in general if anyone remembers windows vista 
this was a horrible setting that really back   in the day really put some stress on computers but 
accent color as well automatic i like to actually   change this left click on manual and i like to 
have a red setting here you know red goes faster   and so we're going to put the red for that theme 
now in terms of the extra contrast themes if you   want to mess around with that you can but 
personally this is just in a nutshell how i   like to have windows running just from a personal 
standpoint and how it looks now after this we can   left click on the personalization tab again and go 
down to the lock screen right here left click that   and what i like to do here is i like to turn off 
again so we want as least crap running as possible   i like to show the lock screen background 
picture on signing i like to turn this off   and also while we're at it i like to left click 
this one right here windows spotlight and then   left click picture and just have it consistent 
with my windows theme and then also left click   this right here get fun facts tips and tricks i 
don't want any fun facts i got enough fun facts   uh to deal with irl without having windows to 
tell me what's fun and what's not so often the   personalization tab we can then left click on apps 
and then left click on apps and features and what   i like to do here is i like to uninstall any of 
just the baked in crap that i'm never going to use   in windows in general and for instance feedback 
hub i like to get rid of this i don't really care   for it too much films and tv i already use other 
programs so i don't need these i mean get help if   you need some help right now microsoft may be 
able to give it to you i don't know if that's   your way of getting help then uh so be it but 
uh moving through here you'll just notice that   mail and calendar another thing that i don't 
really need because i use outlook express maps   they won't let you uninstall some of these things 
same with microsoft edge and microsoft edge update   going through i'll just quickly move through and 
i'll show you the ones that i'm keeping through   and the ones that i'm uninstalling too so i'll 
probably just speed it up from here on in and just and now the last thing to do on the 
personalization tab is to left click on the   taskbar here and there's some important settings 
here because i like to turn off this task view   because alt tab still works as well as windows 
the key tab that will bring up everything   if you want to you can see here you've got a 
different kind of tabbing that's available too   so i don't really need this task view bar because 
i hotkey and widgets as well it's another thing   and you'll see them disappearing on the bottom 
here while we're doing that but you can also   go down left click on taskbar behaviors 
and what i like to do here is i like to   left click right here and go to left so i like 
to have my taskbar where it was a lot of apple   users might prefer it in the center but i also 
like to show taskbar on all my displays and what   this is going to do is it's then going to put the 
taskbar on both or if you've got three monitors   for example it's going to have all those taskbars 
on all those windows next up here we can go down   to time and language and left click on date and 
time zone and what i like to do here is i like to   turn this off this is set the time automatically 
basically that's another service in the background   that we don't need running of course if you 
don't have your time set to your time zone you   can actually turn this on as well as select your 
time zone and then after that turn it off then   after that we can move through with the gaming tab 
and what i like to do here is i like to make this   minimized as much as possible so if you're using 
an xbox controller on pc you manage to leave this   on but i have to turn this off for example and 
then left clicking on gaming getting back to   captures i like to again not have microsoft doing 
the capturing as you can see here i'm using stream   labs and sometimes i also use nvidia geforce 
experience of a hotkey so this sort of stuff   here doesn't really work for me but again going 
through game mode as well if you leave game mode   on this can be a good thing especially if you're 
playing a lot of games on the microsoft store   but personally i just i turn this off because i 
haven't really found in the past that it makes   much of a difference at all and in fact what i've 
seen is doing other optimizations outside of game   mode actually brings your performance up a little 
bit better than this otherwise would and after the   gaming tab we can then left click on privacy and 
security now there's quite a few settings here   that we're going to change i'm mainly going to 
start off with the left click on windows security   and we're going to bring up here we just left 
click on this for example the virus and threat   protection then we want to go to left-click manage 
settings and so what this is going to do is bring   up a heap of different menus here where personally 
i like to turn off cloud delivered protection as   well as automatic sample submission and tamper 
protection then after we're done with this tab we   can left click and close it down at the top right 
there and then go back to the privacy and security   tab left click that and go down to the diagnostics 
and feedback tab and left click this right here   and what i like to do is i like to turn this 
off so this is the send optional diagnostic data   and i like to turn this off and then i also 
like to delete the diagnostic data so once we've   cleared it we've turned it off we're clearing it 
out and then there's the feedback frequency and   so i like to left click this and never so this is 
going to turn off two settings that sometimes will   poll your pc for telemetry and then we'll also 
soon we'll double down on that and turn some other   settings off but let's just keep going through 
this privacy and security tab here and activity   history and you can show my activity history on 
this device you can turn this off if you want to   uh i'd like to keep this off personally some 
people like to turn it on but it's essentially   an extra service that's running in the background 
yet again and here's your activity history i like   to clear this if you've got also someone else 
using your computer and they don't really know   what they're doing and you want to backtrack their 
steps this can be a good thing to keep on as well   so once we're done with this tab we can left click 
on the settings get back to this menu right here   and then what i like to do is make sure some 
of these settings right here are turned off   especially location i don't use this if you 
use it you might want to keep it on but i   make sure that's turned off then a camera we've 
already set this up so camera should be limited   in that we did that optimization before but then 
microphone i want to make sure that only programs   that i use are using micros uh my microphone 
for instance microsoft photos they don't need to   use my microphone as well as a cortana i don't 
use cortana but camera might be able to use it   xbox game bar i don't use so i don't need that 
off xbox game bar but then you can see here all   the other programs that use my microphone i like 
to leave them on because they need to use my   microphone so it's basically just minimalizing the 
programs here if we go down left click on contacts   contact access i don't use microsoft 
contacts so i like to turn that off   and keep that off then as we go through the 
list here i'm just going to be turning off the   ones that i personally don't use so that would be 
phone calls call history i don't use my microsoft   windows desktop pc with anything to do with 
my phone as well as the emails i already use   outlook express then continuing through with 
messaging we turned that off and then just really   just going through each of them that you don't 
use and turning these things off so radios is off   other devices communicate with unpaired devices 
i don't really again projectors xbox ones i   don't sync them to my pc so i don't need these 
services uh music library i like to turn this off   with groov i like to keep this on but i like to 
turn it off with groove music because i don't use   groove music so after we're done with that we 
can then left click on the windows update here   and what i like to do is left click on advanced 
options and then go to i think it's the delivery   optimization so we left click on this and what 
we want to do here is we want to turn this off so   allow downloads from other pc so what this is 
going to do if you leave this on by default   which microsoft windows 11 does especially going 
to make you a bit torrent for seating all the new   updates and everything on windows 11 and since if 
you're playing a game for example and if you're in   australia like me and your internet's terrible 
then this might not be the best thing to do so   turn this off and i mean if you've got really 
good internet you might want to leave it on but   again it's another service that just 
interrupts with the way windows works   so now we close that menu down we can then left 
click on our windows button here or we can hit it   on the keyboard either way is fine and we can just 
type in control panel and we should see it right   there we can left click on that and what i like to 
do now is go to view by and we go to small icons   and so right here i like to go to the programs 
so there's also the power options which we'll   go into later but we go into programs and 
features and what i like to do here is   turn windows features on or off and so this one 
you can turn off a windows media player right   here and i like to left click that little arrow 
go yes okay and then what this is going to do   is going to get rid of windows media player so 
i um what i use is i use vlc there's also other   really good ones that are much more efficient 
than windows media player so we can restart   our pc later too but if we left-click now control 
panel home we can then left-click on power options   and what we want to do here is balanced 
recommended so i actually been using the balance   setting i find it works really well windows 11 
with the hibernation setting actually turns my   computer off and on and i've never had one problem 
with it so your mileage may vary you might want to   put this on a high performance especially if 
you're playing games competitively but you'll   notice if we left click on our um sorry i'll get 
back to that change advance power settings left   click on that you'll notice here in the turn hard 
drive after never so i never turn my hard drives   off i like to keep them running all the time 
because i find that that can cause issues if they   do turn off and on especially if you're using your 
computer 10 minutes at a time 20 minutes at a time   and what not so also another thing is we can go 
to slideshow make sure that's paused and then some   people also like to leave the processor state on a 
hundred percent here so if you are hardcore gaming   i would put this on 100 but since i do like to 
uh take advantage of the power savings in windows   11 which i think work really well they've been 
updated from that of windows 10. they've actually   done a little bit of secret source here where i 
found it's working a lot more stable i like to   keep this on now we click ok there and then we can 
left click back here on this little arrow and then   if you guys are got a pc where you hit the power 
button for example or you go to turn it off and it   just won't turn off there's also another setting 
you can do here where you can left click on choose   what the power buttons do and now this 
is a funny one because a lot of people   like when i sell because i sell a few pcs you 
can go left click this change settings that are   currently unavailable and you can turn all these 
off but if that's if you're having a problem   with your pc turning off if you're not having 
any problems you can just leave these all on   but that's a little uh update that i'd add in 
to my videos that i've found really can help you   if you press the power button and the computer 
just stays on 24 7. so now we're done with that   menu we can then left click right here and close 
that down and we're now back at the main menu   again where we can then left click our windows key 
and then type in here services.msc and left click   and what we're going to do is we're going to turn 
off two settings here so how i like to do this is   i like to left click name and then i also like to 
left-click running until we've got all the names   in order and then we've got them all in running 
order and that way i can just find the services   that i'm looking for which i'm looking for two in 
particular and that is connected user experiences   and telemetry we're going to right click this and 
then we're going to left-click properties and then   we're going to disable that click apply click 
ok and then i'm going to go down to distributed   link tracking client and do the exact same thing 
right click left click properties and then cleft   click and go disabled click ok and then that will 
basically the next time we restart our computer   which we're going to restart it after we finish 
all these optimizations we'll then get these two   invasive services won't be running anymore and 
now we're on the final furlong of this windows   11 optimization guide this is going to be the 
hard drive optimizations as well as turning off   the defrag automatic servicing setting so we're 
going to left click again our windows tab and then   we're going to go type in defrag so i typed in 
drag just type in defrag and it should bring this   one up here defragment and optimize drives and 
so what you want to do is you can optimize your   drives say once a week manually because what it 
has here if we look here scheduled optimization on   left click that and that's a service that's 
essentially running so i like to turn that off   just left click that off click ok and then i can 
just manually optimize my drives even while i'm   doing a tutorial which i probably shouldn't have 
done would just let that get trimmed and optimized   and and you can see here my mlc scratch is 
also a raid 0 array so windows can't really   do anything about that i'll have to optimize that 
through the separate raid app with intel and then   the final optimization for the hard drives is to 
left-click that windows tab type in file explorer   but you'll notice here that i've got it in the 
windows tabs here so these are all my tabs these   are all the programs that i regularly use here 
on this desktop but if you guys want to have   that like me you can right-click file explorer 
and then you can also pin it to the taskbar   so that's one thing i like to do because i always 
use that so we can just left-click file explorer   and then we can bring it over here and what 
we're going to do here is both these drives on   our computer we're going to right click them and 
then we're going to optimize them so essentially   we can right click on our c drive left click 
properties and then we go to hardware so we're   going to left click this to brand rocket queue 
right here and then we're going to left click   properties and then we're going to left click on 
change settings and what we're going to do here is   now left click on the policies tab and we're going 
to turn this on here turn off windows right cache   buffer flashing on the device so what this will do 
is it'll speed up your drive especially if you're   using it for video editing this is an important 
one to have on as a scratch drive because it just   makes it that much more snappier now i believe if 
you've got for instance we've got an intel raid 0   here i believe they do it by default on the if 
you've installed the uh intel raid manager so   yeah and so that's already installed that so you 
can go through your main drives here and just make   sure that settings turned on and it'll essentially 
speed up those drives if you're using them for uh   performance now the final little optimization to 
do here is left click on these three little dots   and then go to left click options and we go 
to view left click on the view tab right here   and we're just going to a show sync provider 
notifications we're going to left click that   and turn that off and also use sharing wizard and 
we're going to left-click that and turn that off   too even though they recommend it i don't need the 
sharing wizard because i personally never use it   and there it is with windows 11 it should be 
running a lot snappier a lot smoother and so what   we've done behind the scenes is we've turned off 
a lot of services a bit of bloat that i otherwise   especially me personally i otherwise wouldn't 
use especially my workflow that's going to make   things a lot better in the long run and of course 
save me time and possibly even frustration when   it comes to some of those things if you're on a 
potato could get overloaded and before i get out   of here some of you guys may have some questions 
about windows 11 for instance brian why don't you   just upload a pre-built windows 11 file with all 
these changes made i will do that once the windows   11 retail hits the streets i'll make a video 
on it with all the changes i'm also hoping that   windows 11 will change a few things and bring back 
especially the drag and drop through the taskbar   feature that was in windows 10. for some reason 
they took it away but it's a really good feature   that i use a lot when i'm video editing or if i'm 
using photoshop for example it's an absolute must   have so i'd love microsoft to bring that back but 
also some other things you can do on windows 11   is make sure that your monitors are at their max 
refresh rates for their resolution you can do   this in the display tab on the advanced settings 
and another little feature that i've noticed in   windows 11 that's pretty cool is in the speakers 
you can get if you select your speakers and you'll   find a little option there called enhanced audio 
i like to turn this on as i find it just gives   you that your audio and everything that you do in 
windows just that little bit of a crispier edge   and i personally like the little bit of color that 
they've introduced in the audio on this setting   also other than that on the desktop you may notice 
that i've got some programs that are a little   bit different to that of windows 11's default 
install so i'll put in some of the must haves   in the description below but also on that note 
don't forget to check out today's video sponsor   scd keys if you want to get a very cheap 
and single end user license for windows 10   and you can use that on windows 11 that'll 
activate absolutely fine it's what i'm using   at the moment you've also got the option 
there for office 2019 as well as the combo   links will all be in the description and as 
always if you guys have stayed this far and   you're enjoying that content then be sure to hit 
that like button and smash that sub ring the bell   and i'll catch you in another video very soon but 
also let us know in the comment section below if   there's some other tips and tricks that you've 
got for making windows 11 just that bit better   then i'd love hearing them as well and i'm sure 
other people would love to check them out but   in terms of regedit hacks i have a tried one 
already that was meant to bring back the drag   and drop function in windows 11 from windows 
10 but unfortunately it just took away the time   in the bottom right hand corner and the windows 
start menu no longer worked properly after that   so that was a weird one anyhow guys i'll see 
you in the next one peace out for now bye you
