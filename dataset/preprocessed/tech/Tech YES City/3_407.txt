over a week ago I made a video where it was the first time I was getting into experimenting flipping laptops and I'll put the link to that video up here for you guys haven't seen it where I picked up all the components for pretty cheap where I got the laptop itself for 70 Aussie dollars then I got a charger and also a battery and it ended up totaling about a hundred and twenty Aussie dollars for everything and then I tried to flip it with an asking price of three hundred and eighty posi dollars now the first bit of news which coming back on this experiment was really good I got an offer of 360 $80 and I took it however there's much more to the story with laptops than I realized and it comes in the form of these batteries right here so exactly what happened with this e 70 240 and is flipping laptops a good idea let's discuss [Music] so looking at this e 7240 laptop it had everything that a lot of people would want for something mobile it was small 12.5 inch screen had a gigabytes of RAM and SSD and also an i7 even though that i7 was only 2 cores 4 threads but for some reason I found when selling used product people always loved that I 7 branding even if it's slower than a new or i-5 that much rather get something used and pay more for it on an i7 that's older than a newer i5 or an i3 so that's the power of that marketing right there however the problems with this e 70 240 laptop start to spend in the form of these batteries right here I got this one off eBay it was brand new it said it was a good replacement battery for this laptop however upon installing it everything seemed ok initially where I was getting a charge out of it however when I went to flip it the person then said this battery doesn't work so that unplugged the power cord and then the laptop would just switch off and I said to them wow that's pretty bad because I always guarantee my stuff when I sell it and so I just told him to bring it back to me and then when I got back to the studio here I indeed found that this battery here was just absolute garbage and then I spoke to a few people who have done laptop repairs and also other people who flip laptops and they told me yes you always have to make sure especially with a Dell laptop that you get either a replacement OEM battery or an OEM certified battery and that the people who are mass producing these batteries have tested them extensively with Dell laptops because for some reason even back in 2013 or 2014 when this laptop was released they put software actually in the BIOS chip that checked for a genuine OEM battery and if you didn't have a genuine OEM battery it would then block that battery from charging properly and cause all sorts of issues it's even a problem if you don't have a genuine adapter apparently so what I then set out doing was I immediately put open a return for this battery right here and it's actually funny cuz after I do this video I'm actually going to run down to the post office and return it because it's crap and in the meantime I got a genuine Oh M battery that was in very good condition for 35 ozzy dollars and I got that in put it in and it charged all the way to a hundred percent absolutely fine and then I then reflect the laptop the three hundred and forty Aussie dollars so the experiment ended up working out really well to the point where I do want to experiment more with laptops but it does make me wonder what other potential problems are out there so if you are getting into this laptop game or you do want to buy a used laptop some things to look out for are definitely with that battery and charger make sure they're either OAM replacements certified or there are actually om parts themselves and those use parts especially if they are used they haven't got a swollen battery on them and they're not used heavily because even if it is a genuine battery if it's been used for an extensively long time then most likely the integrity of the cells inside that battery are really bad to the point where you're not going to get much real-world usage out of it so what I have now been told with laptop batteries is they are very important to get the right pot you'll see a lot of these cheap Chinese ones that even though they come in 10 20 dollars cheaper than the ones that actually work they're just going to be wasting you and if you potentially sell like I did just a lot of headaches and time wasted so from here on in I learned a big lesson and that was just to go from a reputable seller that's got really good feedback selling these batteries right here another thing I noticed through about this battery versus the one that I replaced it with because the laptops already sold it's already done the person who bought it now the second person is now really happy but one thing I noticed was this battery here was a lot lighter and it felt just a lot flimsier and cheaper than the genuine Dell OAM replacement that I got so the experiment did end up being a success and apparently there are some workarounds if you do get one of these batteries and it doesn't work properly like you can go into Windows and disable like the battery options in there and try and go into the BIOS and change them settings but I realized in the long run that's probably not going to be a good thing because Dell and I especially found with things like HP and stuff they really know what they're doing when it comes you are locking down a bios or even stuff like this that 7 or 6 years old has really good protections in place to the point where it hasn't been cracked so from here on in me personally I'm only going to be going with proper replacement parts if I do get laptops in and another thing you guys told me to do was I missed out in the first video was to replace the thermal paste so I did do that it did give it a good clean down take it off replace the thermal paste even though I don't have any b-roll footage Shakers the laptop was gone I had a short turnaround time because when I put it off the sale again the person came and bought it pretty much instantly so that must have meant in the grand scheme of things the price I was asking for it in its condition was pretty much fair and then after I sold it I did go on eBay and one thing you can do if you want to get a rough estimate of how much your stuff is worth is just go on eBay and click on completed listings and then you'll see the average price some of those things are selling for so these laptops were selling actually for around about 380 dollars I think someone even got like $500 for it but I think that was a better model another thing that came out of this experiment too especially compared to use gaming pcs was I got so many inquiries in like a week it was just insane the amount of increase I got but a lot of people did not follow through like they just message you hey is this available is this available and I got spammed with that and then actually it was like probably 1 in 20 people wanted to follow through so I in total think I got around 40 inquiries and I got the initial sale and they returned it and then I got the second sale and that went through so one thing that I was happy about the first sale that came back the person was actually really grateful that I was able just to refund them and help them out straightaway because I guess maybe they've been hosed on use marketplaces before and so when I just said sure bring it back I've got no qualms with that they're actually really happy so that transaction even though I'd ended up in a negative sort of time-wasting position for me the person ended up saying look if you get these laptops in the future let me know so they're keen because they know that I was genuine as a seller and I was willing to help them out so that's why I guarantee always if you're on the marketplace and you've got a good feedback profile and you offer guarantees it's always gonna help people in the long run anyway with that aside I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button also if you've got any more tips or tricks with laptops then drop them in the comment section below because I love reading your thoughts and opinions on this topic for me personally I think it's warranted a second try to get into it and try selling a few more laptops because it was a little bit of fun I got to admit I love trying new things and experimenting and seeing where it goes and this was one of those things that in the end came out to be a positive experience there speaking of comments we've got the question of the day which comes from random corner and they asked is snowman T for RGB single fan enough for risin 5 2600 and they're referring to the Snowman cooler that's off Aliexpress we'll put the link up for that video here and basically yes this cooler is great for a risin five twenty six hundred thirty six hundred even something like a 3,700 X for overclocking - it does a phenomenal job not just in its cooling in its noise but its price performance as well though I will warn one thing shipping delays from Aliexpress are real right now so depending on where you live you may be waiting a long time I'm still waiting over a good month and a half for that 12 core Xeon to come through and some of those motherboards for the v3 has wells so delays are real right now just keep that in mind but yes the Snowman T 4 even the RGB version is good before that 6 core and hope that answers that question and I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon as always if you stayed this bone you're enjoying that content you want to see at the moment it drops then you know what to do and also hit that like button for us and I'll catch you in an another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
