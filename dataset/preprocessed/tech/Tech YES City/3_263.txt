i think we should be live miss the tech deals i've hit the internet so we are back with the tech something live stream for you guys and i am joined by mr tech deals it's been a long time since we've done a live stream it's been a couple of years i think it has been very long indeed so how you been first of all i have been wonderful in fact i can i can see myself on the internet on your channel it's pretty cool yeah awesome the live stream's actually working yes although i think i have my lights turned up too uh brightly but i can fix okay yeah so basically uh tech deals has the whole skype backgrounds thing going on so it actually looks pretty good so let us know in the chat if you guys think uh if he should just take it off it's just gonna be a white background if he does it so it's it's really blue technically but it probably shows up as white on the camera so anyway it's been a long time uh i guess in the meantime i we both just been working on youtube i think it does consume you youtube's like becomes your life in ways um and i i for me personally it's just like okay this time of the year has been honestly the busiest time of the year ever like we've got new gpus from nvidia new gpu is now from amd which we're going to discuss today then we've got new cpus and it's just like wow there are so many new products coming out and the thing is is like the there's like the stock right this is the biggest thing all these new exciting products but this is the biggest question i guess we'll start off the live stream first is are these rx 6000 series going to have same stock problems that nvidia is having because what they're showing here looks really good and at the end of the day they can only produce so much based on say for instance if they made all these new factories to produce these gpus everyone bought them day one who's going to buy them after the fact right so they've got to weigh up the investment over time for making the gpus and it just so happens to be that the demand is through the roof for this stuff so i think i honestly think just like the rtx 3000 series there will be some stock problems on these gpus and uh yeah so yeah we got techdeal city this is what it is today techdeal city so do you like that name um that they you know amd has had the benefit of producing on seven nanometer for a year and a half now and they've got a good relationship with tsmc which nvidia doesn't um here's what puzzles me the dye size of these new rdna 2 chips is much larger than the die size of the chiplets for the rod for the z2 and z3 chips and you would think that they would want i mean if they could make three ryzen sevens in the same die space as a single 6800 xt they'd make more money selling three ryzens but maybe there's not enough demand for that and they've got the competitive console deal right that's the biggest thing like there's that seven nanometers getting shipped out to consoles as well and so i i just think like even if you've got a great relationship there's i think there's still going to be some stock problems that's all um so i mean that's just based on what they've shown us right 649 bucks so we'll move on to the specs and the pricing here this looks really good this i'm calling the 6800 xt and the 6900 xt we'll talk about the 6800 a little bit as well because it's a little bit that one's like i honestly don't see why you'd want to buy a 6800 if you can get a 6800 xt just based on what i've seen so far because you're going to have a 3080 competitor and then a 3090 competitor at the top and i will say the 6900 xt for me personally looks like the best deal sort of so to speak like you're getting that flagship performance from amd and it's competing with a 30 90 and from what they showed the frame rates so we've got all the numbers in this this is like all the numbers are going to be here so we'll just switch back you provided me with this uh this was great this just shows everyone the numbers so we've got 150 right 150 on uh do maternal now do maternal's a very good game to look at because it's so well optimized for both cpu and gpu it's on vulkan as well which uh amd's architecture is very well made for geared up for and you can see here 150 fps on ultra nightmare settings the 3090 they're showing would probably be like 155 or something and then if we move up to the 6800 xt hopefully that's that was like they did like a i did a couple of slides up yeah they did a bass and treble like you know what i mean they upped the bass and they upped the treble on the uh equalizer and the um in the presentation so you got the good stuff on both sides and then you got the 6800 in the middle so 6800 xt is where's 4k yeah 138 so it's coming pretty close to the 6900 xt actually now look at that okay i thought it was 118. sorry i misread the doom internal numbers 138 okay the 6800 xt is the deal there you go yeah for hundred and fifty dollars the three hundred and fifty dollars more of a 6900 xt um i actually had somebody asked me on our live stream earlier today why i was so down on the 6900 xt and i basically said during the live stream i said look there's one video card here there's the 6800 xt because the 6800 non-xt loses 12 compute units and it loses clock speed for 80 dollars and if you're going to spend 580 on a 6800 non-xt another 80. to get 12 more compute units another 100 megahertz of boost speed is that seems to me to be pretty reasonable but then it's 350 dollars and only adds eight more compute units you go from 72 to 80. and somebody on our live stream earlier was like why are you sit down on the 6900 xt because after all the 30 90 is 1500 at least in the us obviously prices vary around the world but it's 1500 and it's 500 less for the 6900 xt and my simple response was this in a vacuum you're correct if the only two products are the flagships from the two companies if you're if you're only comparing rtx 3090 to 6900 xt absolutely 100 the 6900 xt wins it's not even a contest but there's a 650 6800 xt which is what eight percent slower yeah i'm 850 less well what i'm seeing is well i okay so i think i know where you're coming from here right i think so like i'm not upset right i'm not upset at all because i think nvidia and amd they need to make money right and so these cards are existing like they should just charge you know even if they were charging two grand for it i wouldn't really care as long as they've got that 3080 and they've got now the 6800 xt as long as they've got these two cards that people can buy and they're going to get you know near high end like near flagship performance but at good value so i think this is going back to the older ways that both these companies used to operate they used to operate with these flagship models that were only that little bit better but they cost a lot more like i'm thinking back to the cpu days of what was fx like 55 i forgot the names but anyway they had those flagship cpus that cost a lot more and that's the fx 95 90 they tried to sell for no no that's we're going back to the days where they're actually good like you know not the bulldozer days but um before that when they're on top and now that it looks like you know i'm not going to say anything too much but it looks like they're going to be on top with zen 3 again so what i'm trying to say is here is i don't i'm not upset when these companies release like the 30 90s and the 6900 xt's because they've got to make money man and there's guys out there with money who want that little bit more and they want to pay that more and in turn we should actually be like think of this as a little bit of a different way of thinking but us average guys should be thankful for that because that funds future r d development so it's kind of like if you think of it in a robin hood sense 6900 xt's existing and 39 existing is fantastic for the average guy who wants the value option and that's how i see it now in terms of the 39 uh sorry in terms of 3090 the difference here between the 39 and the 6900 xt is that they put 24 gigabytes of vram and differentiated it from the 3080 in quite a few ways so you i mean mainly the vram but you did get a massive massive cooler from what i'm told is the 6900 xt is going to have the same cooler as the 6800 xt it's also gonna have the same vram and so it's basically the same card you're just paying three they're both 300 it's just bit it's just better binning the they're both 300 watts of total board power um it's basically a 6800 xt is just a cut down 6900 xt for binning purposes but they're both 300 watts so i imagine they'll just take the top few percentage of chips that are cherry and and make them 6900 xt's i don't mind them selling it either but that doesn't mean i have to recommend it i mean i'm lots of lots of products exist because there's people out there who are not price sensitive i made the comment earlier today i said there's there's there's there's a market of people to whom they ask the question what's the best and they don't really care what it costs it's not a huge market but it exists and amd does need that money yeah i guess my point would be to anybody who is value oriented or looking for performance for the money just pretend that the 3090 and the 6900xt don't exist and just look at the 80 series cards because you know there's people who buy expensive watches and purses and cars that doesn't mean they're good value no no exactly yeah yeah so i mean i'm just i'm actually but that's the thing i'm happy these products exist though when you say like when people start bashing like 30 90 and if people start bashing a 6900 xt i'll be like guys we kind of need them like you know even if you're looking at it from an individual standpoint it's actually good that they exist so yeah anyway i'm i'm pretty excited like after sorry i thought it was 118 fps i will say that i don't know why i got that in my head i thought there was a much bigger gap between 50 6900 xt but when i just checked the numbers here it's like yeah you're looking at not even 10 percent yeah so i think my camera is out of focus i actually posted earlier and i thought well that's probably just me it could just be skype quality too dude i look i'm in australia too australian internet is that bad so yeah there is a big like there is a big though but let's go over what is really good about their announcement and also i guess a few shaking points there are a few critiquing points that i have personally uh first thing is is the performance for the price 6800 xt looks like the winner yeah i'll um i'll try and pull up some of the just so we can see the stats so we'll pull up the stats here of the cards side by side so this is a good i'm i'm not surprised that zoom is winning the streaming wars considering oh yeah you look better actually really is you look you do look better now so yeah yeah you do you do look a bit bitter guys that's right that's all right you're fine you're fine um but let's we got the stats side by side here chat was complaining yeah so available from november 18 that would be u.s so uh where you guys are so november 19 in australia december 8th for the big one the 6900 xt so the performance like what you're getting here is 16 gigabytes across all cards so the 6800 xt again is looking like the value king based on the same amount of vram across all the stacks here and yeah that's there's the stats guys same game clocks same boost clocks 6800 xt is the deal tech deals have said it yeah somebody somebody in chat earlier commented that uh they you know it's funny i mean i have this i have this problem on my channel too people get this perception of what you're a fan of and what you're not a fan of and uh you know ironically one week i'll get called an nvidia shield the next week i'll get called an amd shell or you know whatever and if i'm not promoting somebody's favorite thing that week then i must obviously be you know biased um yeah you've been in it too long like i'm surprised like you even care like i just don't care like i see a few guys like yeah you i see you guys on twitter man you're like oh people call us an nvidia shield an amd shield or an intel shield it's like man why do you even respond to that crap it's like i didn't even bother like the bottom line is is you look at me right i'll go pick up used use deals use bangers i do not care what's in that thing as long as the price is good i think you should be at price shill which you know doesn't make any sense right so yeah i'm a price shill price performance shill doesn't make any there you go guys just set it so well here's the fun thought um just just to just to interrupt everybody's what what the best deal is um has has anybody considered that the 6800 xt benchmark results which amd provided which are at 4k and obviously at 4k you need lots of performance um i don't know what they're going for in the land down under in oz but right now rx 5700 xts are going for about 360 ish here in the us yep which is just over half the price of a 6800 xt now it's true that a 6800 xt has ray tracing and it has 16 gigs of vram and that's all cool but at 1440p if you want the deal in terms of dollars per frames per second how many people are gonna rush out and buy a 6800 series card and ignore the fact that the 5700 xts are now actually a pretty good deal that's true too so will they will they continue to make the 5000 series cards being on seven nanometer as well so well they're i mean they're here they might be gone next month but they're here today so i mean it's just it's an option yeah so especially if the 6800 xt sell out in three seconds they will the 6800xt will sell out and you'll see the same like i reckon they'll sell out so that's i okay so going forward i think one thing that i will say is a little bit different from this launch for me i i'm firstly i just woke up i might not seem as excited as i do about the nvidia launch and that's because like this i'm waiting for both nvidia and amd to launch the cheaper cards too like the real like you know gtx 1060 rx 570 i really want this is not there's been nothing for years and i'd love to see even a hint of that too like hey guys we've got this coming in six months even if it's like six months okay we need something small an entry level because when we look at it right 500 us for an rtx 3070 and now you got 580 for a 6800 these are the newest cards and that's the cheapest entry point and we will talk about the um we'll talk about the gt rtx 3060 ti soon as well but i want to see like a 200 card like really want to see a 200 card come out that just smokes the whole gpu market and really run and disrupts it that's what i want to see right and it just seems like you know there's my excitement sort of like you know when it looks when when zen 3 comes out look the excitement's going to be through the roof um i can't say too much with it but it's you know excitement's definitely there but on the gpu side i want to see like the 55 of 6600 xt and on nvidia i want to see the 30 50. i want to see these little gpus and really shake up the the cheaper market right but it seems like they both amd and nvidia just don't want to compete with the consoles coming out and the consoles like after seeing this presentation the console the series x will be big the new one the xbox that'll be that'll be huge because that's got the 5120 that's got the 80 compute units doesn't it yeah the consoles are better this time around than the than they were last time the p when the ps4 and the xbox one launched they were fairly weak relative to what the pcs were at the time the con the last generation of consoles weren't amazing ps5 and xbox series x are monsters that for 500 bucks we did a live stream yesterday on a 500 budget build which essentially was a ryzen 3 3 100 with a um 1650 super yeah and somebody in our live chat said so is this competitive compared to the consoles and i laughed and i said are you kidding no not even close well what does it take to get competitive for the consoles i said well our last build was a fifteen hundred dollar eight core 16 thread machine with decent hardware in it uh it had a 5700 xt in it and they're like but that's three times the price of the consoles i'm like yeah well how do i get console performance on the pc you spend a lot more yeah and the reality of course what they're not saying is but but but i don't want to well okay but these consoles are ridiculous levels of perform usually consoles aren't that impressive but i'm genuine i wish we could just i wish we could use these consoles as pcs i mean the thing is i like look last time when ps4 and xbox released i was down playing like that that was they were garbage you could see that they were weak before they even came out this time around like man i'm seeing these other youtube videos that people like why don't you make a console killer tech yes man come on you got to make a console killer i'm like guys i i can't like i cannot make an xbox series x with rtx 3090 like performance for 500 bucks you just can't get it done you can't even do it for i mean if you can do it for a thousand i'll be i guess if you went cheap on everything maybe i mean at some point you know you can use a cardboard box for a computer case but is that really the same thing yeah i mean the bottom line is there's new con like xbox microsoft's going hard man they're going so hard like after seeing because it's got our dna too right it's got the 80 compute units they're really going to make it work so i mean yeah it's going to be a huge that's all and like when i i'll do a series s is it the weaker one i'll try and do a console killer for that but that's gonna be extremely difficult even then three three hundred dollars are you kidding that's what i mean the graphics card alone is that much money but that's what i mean like you look at the 100 flip up challenge how i'm gonna do it is okay guys this is how we kill the console you basically start flipping pcs for a couple of months then you can do it which i'm already doing so anyway this is the rdna2 stuff's exciting what the one thing we got to talk about though with the rdna 2 is this infinity fabric yeah one of the most interesting things is they sort of they started talking about infinity fabric infinity cache is how they is what they're referring to here yep um i'm just trying to pull up this the fact that the fact that the cards are faster on a 500 series motherboard with a 5000 series cpu is traditionally when somebody says does it matter what motherboard i buy it doesn't matter what cpu i have so long as i have a modern cpu generally if you have a modern cpu and if you have a modern motherboard it doesn't make any difference but this time around there's up to a 13 difference between having it with a 5000 series chip on a 500 series motherboard versus not because the cpu will have direct access to the vram without having to use the pci express's buffer and sorry chat corrected me on the xbox series x i thought it had the same stream processes five thousand or something okay so it has less remember what it has it has a lot okay i'll have to it has 52 okay all right sorry i messed up i thought it had the same stream processes as the 5000 going in the yeah it might be it has nearly as many stream processors as the 6800 does thank you and it costs less yes the 6800 okay all right my bad that's my bad i messed up oops yeah but it's here's the thing a 6800 is 580. for 60 compute units and an xbox series x is 52 compute units for 500 yep and for that 500 you get a complete working machine with a 4k blu-ray drive and a controller and and an 8 core 16 thread zen 2 cpu and 16 gigs of gddr6 and if you buy the video card you you have a video card yeah the compute units are interesting eh because we're seeing yeah i've got to check this out after stream sorry i didn't research the stream processors to compute unit relation man okay my memory must be a bit like look i know things are a bit upside down in australia but look i got a legit excuse here i swear i've seen different stream processor ratios to compute units on the new consoles as opposed to these new cards anyway i'll go check it all out after stream and make sure my numbers are right and stuff like that but the bottom line is the value is going to be really good on the consoles but i'm looking forward to seeing the 6800xt when that releases that's definitely going to be one that's going to shake things up for you guys and shake things up in the gpu market now i would honestly love it if in this presentation if we saw like i will give props to like the video they did show like the actual people locking in the settings didn't they and then showing the fps on the gameplay all we've seen so far is just graphs rather than actual like okay here's the fps get excited about it sort of thing do you know what i mean well you know i don't want to pull you away from the idea you're trying to express my brain is actually still stuck about three paragraphs ago because you made a comment saying that you're upset that we don't have like a two or three hundred dollar budget graphics card yeah and you know you're not wrong because four years ago when i started my channel on youtube there were lots of those options the um when the 10 series launch you had the 1050 and the 1050 ti and then the three and the six gig 1060 and you had options between like 120 to 250 there was like four cards between 120 and 250 dollars when the rx 500 series launched you had the 5 55 65 70 and 580 and you had cards between 100 and 230 dollars there were all kinds of interesting options in those price points and the rumors that i've seen of course they're just rumors i mean i nothing official but i saw a thing two days ago that the 3060 ti will launch in december at 450 and i'm like 50 bucks less than the 30 70 okay big really okay sure i guess um where's the where's the 200 card where's the 300 card and i suspect that they want to just sell the older cards at those price points because stock well look at amd they've spent how many years now selling 200 cards they haven't had a 500 card their average selling prices are terrible um they suffered terribly for having nothing to sell for 500 and so they're overcompensating by going 580 is our entry level card but look at zen zen 3 the cheapest zen 3 is 300 the lowest price zen 3 is about the same price as the highest priced zen plus was the the 2700x the previous ryzen lines had 150 options and now the entry level is 300 i mean i mean you see how everything has just gone yeah expensive yeah it feels like it almost feels like they're just going to let the budget stuff go to the consoles all right just go buy a console here's this elite pc gaming experience almost like i if if we don't look if in another six months if we don't see any budget cards out some real good budget options then it feels like yeah they're just gonna all right here's the old stuff if you want a real cheap pc but you gotta get the new stuff and it's a lot more expensive so i mean and that's the problem like the used market's been a mess for the last like ever since uh good old covert dropped these markets has been a mess and it's like we need that's what i mean really like for me personally i really need this because i want to be excited again on the used market but all i do is i jump on good old gumtree and facebook i just see the same overpriced stuff up for sale like some dude selling a gtx 950 for 150 bucks like aussie which would be like 100 and something us yeah exactly it makes you scratch your head yeah no yeah okay face palm even just that's a good dollar card maybe exactly right exactly that's what it should be worth but this is like and i even heard it's hardly worth that it's kind of it's it's almost retro yeah and this is the thing even if you know some of the stories that i hear from the computer shops too they're like people come into them to upgrade their pc and they're like what did you pay for this gtx 964 gig and they're like oh 200 bucks and it's and when did you buy it oh two months ago and it's like what you bought a gtx 964 gig for 200 in 2020 and they're like yeah and it's like you not have sources of rx 570s and 580s in australia range but people see the green logo bro people see the green logo and they want it but the rx 570 and 580 are awesome cards yeah they have mature drivers they've got lots of vram they run everything okay so this is like just picture this right you're a 10 year old kid you jump on twitch tv you see your favorite streamer saying guys look at the menu on the settings we've got nvidia reflex io oh and then he starts fragging some people and then that kid has to get an nvidia card now because he's seen his favorite streamer dropping that stuff on stream like i gotta say video out of the intel amd nvidia nvidia's like the marketing geniuses man they are really good like they know how to spin so this is like this is what i'm saying and look i'm i'm a one man band i can't change the nation even like even like like you look at linus was slightly negative on his wasn't he slightly negative on his 3080 review that didn't stop like the pre-order through the roof man like that's what i mean us as youtubers we're more of a we can only be reactionary based rather than changing linus is fully aware of the fact that it doesn't make any difference what he says and he's discovered that he can say positive or negative um exposures exposure and he talks about it and people he's the biggest fish people hear what they want to hear i can say something point blank to my audience i can be reading live chat and i'll say i said today during the live stream this is the first amd uh graphics card launch that i've been excited about at launch i i was not excited about navi and ultimately i had good reason to be because from my point of view you might disagree with me um navi drivers suck for the first six months um i i had poor results in 2019 with them they're great now i don't have any problem recommending navi now but it took a while for them to sort out their mess the last graphics card launch that i was excited about from amd was the 580 in early 2017 and that was a 230 dollar card but this looks like navi cleaned up and refreshed if they've got the drivers ironed out which obviously we have to test but they've got the directx 12 product stack they've got ray tracing for whatever it's worth i'm not expecting it to beat nvidia's ray tracing but at least it's there it's a it's a feature check box that lets people go okay it's got it not that very much uses it at the moment it's got um fidelity effects and a few other things the 16 gigs of vram strangely enough has me more excited than anything else because i'm seeing eight gigs of vram during testing load up horizon zero dawn um even on a six gig card it's not enough really no i i actually uh tweeted some pictures i've been talking about six gig sorry you said six gig yeah sorry i've only been tested on eight gig cards recently no one's on six gigs if you put it up at high detail you get texture pop oh yeah yeah texture popping yeah it actually uses eight gigs of eram well it's seven and a half it's that that game is designed for eight gigs of vram yeah um it will run on a six gig car all you have to do is turn textures to medium and it'll run on a six gig card but horizon zero dawn is not a brand new game if you're buying a new car today and you're buying an 8 gig card how long is it gonna last before that eight gig starts to be a oh i gotta turn textures down yeah i mean that's a good argument so but where's like like from white like i don't know like yeah okay so you got to weigh it up right is it you look at 24 gigabytes on the 3090 it's it's way too much right way too much then you look at 10 gigabytes on the 30 80. i think they kind of it was okay like it depends if these games are coming out and they're going to utilize all that vram like you can pick out one game like horizon zero dawn and you can say okay that's but if you're looking at the mass amount of games and they're all using say the caps eight gigabytes which it seems like eight gigabytes is where it's at right now two gigabytes gives you a little bit more so like i i don't know like i've never been like if you go back through the history i've never been really sold on vram too much like i've always liked the lower vram options because i feel like you bash the textures on max your fps is going to suck anyway but you're going to be getting a choppy like usually a lot of the times you drop those textures on max and the difference between ultra and high settings is that vram limit but also at the same time the fps jump is not even worth it on dropping it to ultra so it just depends on which school of like train of thought you're on do you like getting a car and just going yep maxing the dial on everything is that your sort of no um i actually do most of my benchmarks at high detail i think i actually have a saying that i use a lot which is um ultra is for screenshots and high is for gaming because ultra can just some games you turn it up to ultra and the performance just is silly it it crushes it you can lose 30 percent of your performance but one thing that you can do is you can turn detail to high but turn textures up a notch and it's not the same performance penalty like so long as shadows and um you know some of the other effects aren't turned up lighting effects etc because texture details are just larger details but a lot of games i mean look at call of duty modern warfare which is ridiculous with its size but you know it's shipping with these huge 4k textures as games shipped with larger textures 4k being naturally four times as much as 1080p if we needed four gigs of vram for 1080p gaming well we needed two for a while but that sort of started creeping into four uh gta 5 will use three gigs of vram at 1080p high so two's not really enough but four wasn't quite needed but it's nice to have but if you go to 4k and you go to textures at 4k what's 4 times 4 gigs of vram 16 yeah if the next three years is the transition to mainstream normal person 4k gaming meaning not 30 90 but like normal people cards 400 500 cards if those become 4k cards i am of the opinion that with these new consoles being aimed at 4k and they have 16 gigs of gddr6 you're going to want a video card with 16 gigs of gddr6 to enable 4k textures so have you seen the unreal engine 5 demo yeah i've seen it but i haven't really focused on it i mean i was going to ask you well what about 3.5 3.5 what gigabytes of vram where does that fall like where does that where does that where does that lie in the whole discussion [Laughter] he got it i'll be honest i always thought that i actually got my 30 credit rebate whatever from the lawsuit from from the from the 970 from from nvidia um i got a check in the mail from them believe it or not that's definitely i'm going to say one thing that's never going to get old that's never gonna get old yeah but it took me a second to think about because here's the thing when the 970 was cool when the 970 was a current card it still is like it still is on the used market man i like that's the thing about the 970 i can pick these up for 100 aussie that's like 70 usd they still go hard for that money man like they're a real banger like they're still a pretty good banger and and they've got the you know they're supporting the problem with the 970 for 100 that's that's that's not bad usd 70 so 70 usd you're you're called 70 oh yeah here's the thing though if you buy a 970 today you have to be realistic about what it can do if you buy an in 70 you can't say great i'm gonna play call of duty black ops cold war at 1440p max detail no you're not um oh the guys in the ads will sell it to you like that though gtx 970 max any game at 1080p no it isn't that's what oh man you should see like some of the stuff here on marketplace is amazing i tweeted a picture last night on a 970. i actually just finished doing some 970 testing um on my twitter is a picture of horizon zero dawn at high detail on a 970 and it's completely broken all the solutions are hidden it's the the the la it's it's insane it's running at like 22 frames per second yep um at 1080p i it wouldn't matter what right now it really wasn't but it wouldn't matter it doesn't have enough vram it it four gigs of it doesn't at high detail you need more than four gigs of vram it actually runs okay in fairness at low detail but here's what's interesting it doesn't run bad at 1440p low detail on a 970. it um not quite 60 frames a second 50 55. okay i mean it's a nice card like it's really nice but it looks terrible i mean it's it looks terrible what's the point in buying brand new games to run them at low detail ah dude people do that on fortnight to get the best fps so that's different that's that's a competitive shooter i completely understand why people do look i would understand why somebody would buy an rtx 3080 and run it at low detail they're they're a competitive gamer they care about their win loss ratio that's that's cool i mean it's look people buy expensive cards and play cs go at 500 frames per second i i think that's kind of weird but you know rock on but i'm saying story games like horizon zero dawn or ghost recon break point or the division two why run this at low detail i'm on live stream mate what's up oh okay cool i'll get it um old man's made us a bowl of soup hell yeah all right thanks do you want to say hello to the viewers quickly yeah come on come on quickly just say hello just quit come in the shot i just got dadman quick people people love dab man just you got to look at the camera there come in yeah just say hey tech citizens yes citizens hey citizens yes all right thanks devin i'll be off on a second all right oh yeah so um that's just dad manny so he's just uh he loves his soup so he's like dude you want a soup and i'm like yeah i'll have a soup and i was like oh i got a live stream soon though so we like spicy soup in the morning so we'll just like max the chili in there and then like all of a sudden our mouth is just like dragon breath it gets you started in the morning though that's that's probably what i should have had before the live stream then it would have been like this amd stuff is so hot guys like going to get it and yeah i'm trying to figure how i can hype the 6800xt more because when you have competition right when you have competition it's so good for the market because this is what i'm loving right this is what i'm loving right now is that the gpu market is getting really competitive and you're seeing 6800 xt hitting so hard where it's going to force nvidia to sort of think about how much vram they're putting on their future cards so will you see a 20 gigabyte 3080 yeah you will but when will you see it that's the question too so anyway all all hail competition but i don't know sorry dadman just distracted me off the stream so i've got to get back into it again sorry i look i love the old boy you know what i mean like the old boy is such a character we were just talking about the 970 and the thing is in terms of value i can get on board with older or used parts in terms of money spent for enjoyment to be had playing a one or two or three year old game at medium detail on incredibly inexpensive components adds a lot of value not everybody has the money to buy a 650 xt and you know i know you're really big into that into the u stuff the used market in the states right now is terrible it's terrible here too yes it's it's not mean i'm into the used market heavily but it's terrible that's what i mean i i'm the first to admit it dude and it does look it hurts my pride man when i see the used market in the situation it's in but that's because and this is the thing that's because we don't have these new products coming out we don't have a 200 gpu coming out dude we don't have another ryzen 5100 on launch we've got a 3100 great great cpu 10 100 f is going to be pretty good too if you can actually buy it but yeah this is the reason the used market is the way it is it's just you've got none of these new products that are hitting at the budget points and so i'm sitting here like with these used parts like guys what do we do i can't magically cook up a new supply of used parts has it occurred to you that amd doesn't want to be in the 100 cpu business oh it occurs to me that every like no one wants to be not making that much money because the margins on the cheaper stuffs where no like they're making much more money on the higher end stuff than they are on the cheaper stuff jim do you remember when the um 1600 af deal was going on yeah that didn't last i mean i didn't really talk about it too much because i knew it wasn't it was just going to be a thing that quickly came and went well here in the states it was it was on and off again on amazon for i don't know it wasn't continuously available but it was on and off for a couple of months anyway and for a while for those for those of you viewers who aren't familiar in the us on amazon you could buy a brand new 1600 ryzen 5 1600 af six score 12 thread which was actually a zen plus not a zen even though it said 1600 is a weird chip for 85 with a cooler in the box brand new yeah that's if i was a computer builder i'd be like can can uh i would like to order some yes how many would you like to order yes how many would you like to order all of them that's crazy how many computers could you build with a cheap b350 motherboard and an 85.6 core cpu i did a decent a320 you'll do it too so or well yeah sure that too but yeah i love my toys aren't very popular here in the states okay that's it's weird because like i'm trying to i'm even talking to some of the board partners i'm like yo can you give us a custom bios for the a320 so i can get this new amd stuff working on it just i want to do a video i love that kind of stuff man and just see the performance differences on an a320 versus an x570 with the new zen3 stuff so i'm like hitting him on the dealer i'm like yo a320 is where it's at uh and that's what i mean i'm surprised you guys don't take the a320 in with a little bit more positivity like it's dude you can pick these boards up half the price of a b450 in australia man and not in the us that's weird okay so if you get a micro center can you get an a320 because i've heard people getting them for like 30 bucks a320s and they're decent like say well they'll be from a zeus or whatever or or gigabyte or azeroth or something they're decent a320s well you can't use microcenter as an example because the motherboard cpu deals with microcenter are in-store only they're loss leaders designed to drive you into the store and they only have 25 stores in the country people talk about micro center a lot but unless you live next to one it doesn't mean anything yeah but if they're in major cities though like in australia we've got like pc case gear um m wave these guys are in major cities so like for me i have to drive maybe 10 minutes down the road and i'm at a big australian computer store and so if they've got like at the moment believe it or not the 10700 f in australia is very cheap eight cores 16 threads and it's like 450 aussie dollars it's not bad and amd's cpus i i don't know if i can talk about pricing of the news oh yeah we can in australia i don't know if that's nda the australian pricing of the 5600x but anyway put it this way it seems like the rolls are going to be reversed a little bit where you're going to be getting intel trying to push out the cheaper cause cheaper thread counts and amd's going to be pushing out the higher before it's going to be like mind-blowing this whole like next year in the cpus is going to be crazy but yeah interesting i'm i'm i'm looking on newegg as you're talking because i'm i i wanted to see what the current i look at things at points in time but i don't look at them every three days because at some point you know i have work to do you know there's these things called youtube videos that have to be made um i thought they just get made out of thin air oh you know my favorite thing is when everybody goes come on man uh why don't you make more videos or i think your channel would be better if you made more videos yeah you think yeah thank you for that brilliant insight i appreciate you know what i i was lost without that i'll just whip it up guys whip it up i'm looking at a320s new on newegg right now okay uh because i wanted to see what the current going price was because i'm going off of memory but memory can be fun i mean we're all human memory can be funny and right now there are some a320s available for 50 55 with free shipping on newegg okay 72 bucks so yeah you've only got a 20 usd differential there okay see that's kind of like yeah i get i okay i get why you guys are pushing b450 so much harder there's actually a biostar b450 for 65. oh i mean personally dude i just wouldn't touch by a star that's all well all i'm saying is there's literally a 10 difference between the cheapest a320 and b450 on newegg i hear you with biostar but it's just it's an example okay if there's 10 difference between like here's an asrock a520 not that there's a huge difference between an a320 and a520 but at least it's a 500 series board and it's 60 dollars yeah okay well i mean okay i can show you i don't know i'll just pull up quickly australian site so you got a320 let's have a look uh my keyboard mr key on live stream man and yeah it's aussie websites guys you probably have to wait five years for this to come up i was serious man like it's funny newegg gives us faster response times on the servers so okay so we got 75 aussie dot 69 aussie dollars man i think that's cheaper than i can go pick that up as well that's bang i can pick that up hold on i don't know if it's sort of okay sorry it's live stream stuff so let's just zoom that out i think we got it there nope it's all gone hey why this is why live streaming so i'm not that good at live streaming dude so should be able to see the 69 option here there it is there 69 box aussie for an a320 right now we can go to b450 and we can do the same thing and the cheapest b 450 is 85 okay all right maybe i haven't checked prices recently but yeah i'd go for the b flat b 450 in a straight usually that's not the case usually the a320 is like 69 aussie the b450 is like 105 120 but the b450s have come down in price quite a bit recently so yeah definitely go pick up a b450 right now over an a320 um and actually speaking of how much how much of the cheapest b550s there yeah so we i just saw one for 85 aussie which is cheaper than the us so i think so it's pretty good so also guys quick plug for today's video sponsor i forgot to do it earlier we got uh scd keys grab yourself windows 10 pro key 14.50 use the coupon as i just did there tyc get yourself a beautiful discount links will be in description below that was pretty smooth wasn't it wait you know that was that smooth or not yes okay thanks all right so okay so that was amazing hang on whoa i'm i am in awe by the smoothness that's exactly what i was looking for so anyhow b450 we just researched it for you guys on livestream b450 is the way to go over an a320 right now the a520 i wouldn't go for because it doesn't even have pcie 4.0 which i was disappointed about you don't get pca 4.0 with a3 a520 do you you know i don't remember because i wouldn't buy an a520 so i i mean if it had pcie 4 i would that's all i'm saying because you know what my audience would say if i recommended an a520 what you can't overclock man you don't want to with like a lot of the cpus out of the box they run perfectly man like they're i know that you know that but people uh look i love for example the intel non k chips the i3 10 100 the um the i7 10 700 for example non-k-chip i think they could be a great value but all i get is complaining from people going but you can't overclock it yeah what is another 200 megahertz gonna change your life yeah well this is the thing i think this is the thing with tech right a lot of people buy products a lot of people buy products and then they like they just want the options there a lot of people buy stuff and they just won't even use the extras it's kind of like think of it as like buying this car exhaust that can change from silent mode low performance to high performance take it out these guys will buy these exhausts and just leave them on this out of the box setting which is the silence mode and they'll never change it to the high performance mode and it's like why did you buy that exhaust if you're just going to leave it as the cheaper one so like that's what i always tell people just buy what you need save the money for another day save the money because tech there's a there's a trend the obvious trend with tech is the most obvious this is the easiest trend to see with tech and that is as time goes forward as time progresses things get better things get cheaper you get better value for money versus this point in time so the naturally when you think about that angle when you take that angle out you're like well what's your goal right now if you want to use something find out what your usage case is and then get the cheapest parts for that usage scenario now cheapest can be defined in a few other things you can say okay go out don't go out and get a good power supply like still get quality parts that are going to last you the like go the mile that's why i recommend a lot of the cooler master mwe power supplies they're very good value here in australia they're like 50 aussie dollars or something for the 450 watt and it goes extremely hard man that's why i'm like my i'm on the train of thought of get the best value right now for only what you need and then save that money for a future a later date but this is the thing people people want the best now i i don't know i'm actually i'm i'm thinking about what you're saying and it's it's it's interesting how easy it is to get in a bubble of your own thinking my initial mental thought when you talk about these a320 or b450 motherboards and when you talk about you know 50 or 75 dollars for motherboard my my instinct my gut reaction is to say that the kind of computer your you know your thoughts on these things are so i'm a drifter bro i'm a drifter like i'll go whatever's hot at the moment i'm on that you know what i mean that's why i said now get the b450 it's better value right now grab it it's only ten dollars more but if a320 suddenly came down in price next month i'd be like go get the a320 i don't like there's no loyalty towards these companies and what they sell and what popular opinion is i don't care about popular opinion dude like you know well no what i meant was is you're on a different it's ironic because my channel's name is tech deals and yet your price structure is so different from mine because i i wouldn't buy a a 50 motherboard if you threw it at me um i've used them i think back to all of my experiences of building computers i mean i've been building computers for decades uh i rarely regret buying a more expensive motherboard um i have regretted many cheap motherboard purchases over the years i've i when i think back to amd k6 builds when i think back to my first pentium 2 build uh back in the 90s and i think about how i saved 25 bucks on a motherboard or i bought uh i actually saw in your chat several of your users have like an asus p6t deluxe or one of the premium asus boards from the x570 generation i still have my x570 asus p6t from um what'd i say you said x570 that's like the new am4 that that ain't old x50 there's too many freaking names yes x58 i'm sorry yeah because is which i've owned since new 12 years ago and it's a great board but i saved this much money back then to not get the deluxe version instead i got the plain version but in all the years i've had that machine and i recently rebuilt it with a six core chip what's the cost difference of having bought the deluxe version of that board 12 years ago and then enjoying the deluxe features for 12 years i don't even remember what i paid for it back then i'm of the i've sort of developed this mindset the funny thing is three years ago i did videos on 50 motherboards actually did a an h310 uh video on a 50 uh el cheapo motherboard and i built a machine with it and the thing is they have no features they're just so stripped and they're so bare and if you want to grow upgrade if you want to put a faster cpu or if you want to add a better video card your core machine is a really cheap motherboard and so i've sort of developed this mindset maybe in the past 18 months where my minimum purchase my minimum build recommendation for a motherboard is a lot higher than it used to be the 500 build that we did yesterday has a 95 motherboard in it and i'm willing to bet your 500 build would probably not have a 95 motherboard in it well this is the thing right so this is my thinking right i'm looking at the average guy right when you look at the average guy i would say that there is a um i would say that there's a two okay so just a sec guys just a sec sorry i just had a technical difficulty there um personal diff personal difficulty okay so when we're looking at a3 like motherboards right i'm looking at the span of a lifetime of a user right so most guys would use a computer for two to three years then they'll sell it and they'll want something new and so i'm looking at the sense of okay save what you can now two three years time you're gonna be upgrading your pc and you're gonna be re-flipping that old pc so that no one i'm going to say no one no one had the foresight to know that an x58 deluxe board 10 years later would still be relevant i don't think anyone would have seen that intel would have stagnated so much on the cpu market that an x58 cpu would still be relevant like that was that was the scariest thing for me so yes your motherboard argument holds up if if these companies aren't innovating but now what we're seeing is me i'm changing gears like x58 is getting phased out though because ryzen 3 3100 is a really good deal and that's because you've got the new stuff coming in that's really bringing the competition in it's huge now the competition's real and it's finally good that intel's now got amd just really just throwing them hay makers and it's keeping them busy and they didn't have that but yeah at the time if you bought that x58 deluxe you probably made the best investment on a motherboard you ever made in your life just saying but i mean hey should you make that same investment in a x 570 i'm gonna be on the fence of well what do you do what do you do do you just play games if you just play games which i'm telling you now the majority of people like pretty much everyone who buys a pc office they're coming in dude they're just playing warzone or they're playing uh fortnite they don't they don't do what we do with computers they don't edit 4k videos they don't you know some of them will live stream but yeah that's what i'm saying so buy this buy just what you need for what you need now and save the money and when you upgrade in the future you can get the x oh no sorry the a720 motherboard with the ddr5 and the cheaper cpu then and just keep you know striding like that's what i mean my method is look stride around because now is more relevant than the past do you think it's important i guess when i look at a motherboard and i and i think about people are probably coming in sorry just people probably coming into the live stream like yo where's the 6900xt chat uh sorry guys me and tech deals are just going down this i i love this dude this tangent we're going down is actually great so yeah let's keep going sorry the um when i think about motherboards i mean i certainly i understand the average person doesn't need a super expensive x570 motherboard in fact i think the x570s are kind of pointless for most people now the b550s are a better deal it's got gen pci express gen 4 on the first slot of the the first m.2 and the first graphics card which is all most people need um and it doesn't have a chipset fan which is nice which means you're not going to get wine from a chipset fan but i look at ancillary features that you can't easily replace what land does it have on board what audio chip does it have on board how many usb ports does it have how many m.2 ports does it have the 79 board will have one m.2 slot it'll have real tech 887 15 year old crappy audio it'll have real tech lan it'll have four usb ports and it'll have two memory slots and no vrm cooling the hundred and twenty dollar board for forty dollars more will have two m.2 slots real tech alc 1220 audio um intel gigabit lam eight usb ports four memory slots here's my thinking if you're gonna build a pc today which lasts longer than they used to if you want to be able to go through one round of upgrades let's say you want to build a ryzen 3 3100 most people probably would not put a ryzen 3 3 100 on a 120 b550 board because they'll think well it's a 100 ish dollar cpu the cpu motherboard of the same price i'll save money on the motherboard buy a better video card but my thought is if you buy the 120 b550 you can upgrade to a used ryzen 7 3700x or 5800x three or four years from now when they're cheap on ebay when am5 is out and everybody's dumping them and you'll have better audio you'll have a second m.2 slot you can drop a cheap nvme drive in the future you'll have better land more ports here's the question if forty dollars breaks you you can buy a better video card in a year you can add more ram you can add more storage you can you can see there's a lot of good argument yeah it's a good argument you can't change your motherboard without ripping your computer apart and rewind your motherboard is a royal pain to change it's it's the if you get a good board you can kind of keep upgrading and playing with your system for years but if you get the cheapest motherboard they've got you may end up buying another one it isn't cheap if you end up replacing the board because you wanted another m.2 slot or better features that's all yes that's what i meant how do you do cars like if you do yeah i do my cars kind of the same way i do my tech just buy it uh thrash it and then just sell it a couple of years later let's get the next thing in so like that's what i'm saying like buy the so and you'll have the car argument car arguments just help people conceptualize what i'm just where i'm coming from where you're coming from you're like okay get the upgraded model that allows you to do this add-on that add-on this you can put a roof racks on it if you want more expandability and where you want to go on trips if you find out you're going to need that in the future but i'm on the argument of okay this is what you need right now this is what you're doing save as much money as possible and if you need something two years time just sell the car you got get the car you need that's pretty that's just to sum it up but it's just the argument how much is your average new build that you recommend would you say like total total system price if you're speccing out a new build with like an a320 or b450 board what's the total box price um like a thousand aussie dollars you would put 700 usd dollar 8320 into a thousand dollar machine oh yeah see if you can get the better gpu like if that means you're getting the better gpu wow yeah see that's what i mean bro and that's what i mean we'll do it man we see the world very differently i know and this is the thing dude this is the thing we'll stack up we've got it that's why i love doing competitions with people just show them possibilities right showing people possibilities right you get the 3600 a320 32 gigabytes of ram and now you can suddenly afford the better gpu you can afford that 30 70 in that build or whatever or the 6800 xt over the 6800 if that's your budget so like i'm all about cutting the cookie that's what i do i cut the cookie so hard but it's still an enjoyable dude it's like you're cutting off all the burnt out bits of the cookie and you're just eating the cream which let's face it some people like to cut the crust off their toast and just eat the the middle part some people love the crust i'm on the fence of it depends on how the crust has been cooked you see what i mean i am okay to cut the crust off like if we're doing a 500 build i'm on board with cutting everything to the bone because every 20 dollars matters in a 500 build the danger and i'm guilty of it i am i i am sure many viewers would harp on me for this because you can 20 yourself to a new price point it's like well here's a 500 build but this motherboard is 10 or 20 dollars more it's better it's got more features okay now we're at 520. oh this video card is 20 more but it has a better cooler and it's factory overclock that's another 20. oh this better ram is only another ten dollars this ssd is a better deal and how did we end up at an 800 computer um yeah so that's not hard to do that yeah it's hard to lose it's hard to lose i mean it's easy to lose focus sometimes and then suddenly year five like dude i've seen these builds on marketplace right there's this guy selling some pc with nine rgb fans in it for four thousand six hundred aussie dollars now he showed the receipts he paid like 5500 for this build but you know what it's still at the end of the day you can build that same pc for two and a half grand and it's like what are you doing dude like i i'm thinking to myself i would never do that i'd never recommend someone do that because all they're getting is all this extra stuff that they most people don't need so i mean at the same time like that's what i mean you're not wrong here i'm not wrong it's just different trains of thought and it's i just that's what that's the beauty of youtube and the beauty of uh having different opinions who do you relate to more you know what i mean i'm on the fence of okay let's just save as much money as we can because then we can have a residual income on an investment and we save up for that investment which will be building us b b450 mother better motherboards every week so it depends on the train of thought like i'm all about that you know i'm all about hustle hard sort of get what's good for you and i'll relate a lot of viewers will relate to us and a lot of viewers will relate to you too man at the same time never never lose track like if you want the b4 if you want the x570 motherboard then go get the x570 motherboard too i'm all for that like if you want it and you can afford it go get it too i'm not i'm never going to stop people from stop you know i'm not going to say hey don't do that like well and yeah and i i i try to remind people that custom pcs are custom it's your money you you don't have to ask my permission to build it any way you want i mean it's you know at the end of the day when i go on with my life and a viewer goes on with their life they have to live with their purchase and if they're not going to be happy following my advice don't um do what you feel is right for you the one thing that i think you and i would have a difference of view on and as you say it's not a matter of right or wrong it's a difference of view and i would offer this to the viewers take this as two points of view and let them make up their own mind if if i'm specking out a thousand dollar bill my thousand dollar bill would probably not benchmark as well as your thousand r build because i would rather sacrifice one level of the graphics card and put in nicer components i would put in a better motherboard a better power supply and a better case and i would take i would take a hundred dollars out of the video card which i realized that gaming a lot of gamers would say why are you why are you cutting the video card down your case isn't going to give you more frame rate i said no it isn't but the video card is forever a five minute swamp new video cards come out every year there's gonna be something faster than any the extra hundred dollars you spend today will buy you a little bit better video card let's say just for the sake of discussion a 5600 xt which has six gigs of vram and a 5700 x 5700 x2 which has eight in the us right now there's about a hundred ish dollars difference between those two cards the 5700 xt is of course objectively faster in all respects it has more vram it's a better card i don't disagree if you've got the budget for it get it it will last longer it's great but if you take it to 700 xt and you put it in an el cheapo budget no name case and you put it on a cheap motherboard and a cheap bronze power supply that's not modular with a three-year warranty and if you put it on a cheap cpu cooler yes your your video card's great but you ended up with a very cheap box if you take that hundred dollars and you upgrade the case a bit and upgrade the motherboard a bit you might have to turn the details down a little bit for a year but next year a faster video card's gonna come out and it will literally take you five minutes to change video cards but if you want to change your case power supply motherboard you might as well build a new computer that's exactly that's right that's what i said before just sell a thing just sell it then we're going onto another build that's what i mean i'm on the fence of see for me i've never really enjoyed upgrading i'm going to be honest i've always enjoyed building something new because now you got a new case you've got a new design you've got a new mod like i i just think like you know what i mean it's like it's the reason why i like changing cars because you got a whole new car a whole new experience right i i i'm on that that's that there's that other augmented benefit that you don't think about and it's like okay i get to build a whole new pc now and it's honestly one of the funnest things man that's why i got into used price performance so hard because i just enjoyed building a different pc every couple of weeks and so yeah interesting interesting uh argument there man i think we could probably go on on about it for days um it's this is why i think the viewers love having you on the channel just you gotta not ghost me [Laughter] well yeah i'm sorry somebody in chat just said brian's in car debt hey man hey hey we're not going to talk about personal finances on the channel here that's a it's a yeah the stinger was man when i took the stinger for a test drive have you taken a stinger for a test drive have you taken it out okay yeah you gotta go take one for a test drive man like i took one for a test drive i was like whoa i'm because you can't you can't express your emotions in the car you can't express your emotions when you're driving the test drive because the deal is going to see that and the deal is going to be oh i'll be able to you know fleece this guy for a couple more g and so i'm like dude this was the hardest i took the stinger for a test drive and i'm trying to contain the emotions like oh man this is so freaking nice and um just like my friend was with me i looked at my friend he's looked at me and he knew exactly what was going through my head i'm like damn i i need this thing you know put my foot down i was like damn it's so smooth so yeah and so i i knew i had to get that right so stinger skier sold me on a car that was such good value in its range right it was like the 6800 xt of cars that's how you can think of the kia stinger anyway back to uh back to pc you have to understand you're talking to somebody in texas yeah if you want to get me excited you have to talk about a truck uh okay uh what yeah okay so like four by four pickup truck that you kind of what i really i can't justify it it's too much money but what i really want i mean if i just if i won the lottery tomorrow i would own a ford raptor the next day is that that's a wow we don't get that in australia i don't think what's a ford raptor no you don't it's um it's there some of the audience will know what it is but um it's basically ford's fact built off-road rugged truck with 35-inch tires and a foot suspension travel system and every feature in the world and 450 horsepower um man that thing looks like type in ford raptor and pull up this thing looks like it would send you broke on the gas bill dude yeah this thing looks like it would chug a lot of petrol that's what i'm thinking straight away like damn you'd be putting your foot down and watching your gas dial just like literally real time just drop that's that's a that's a mean looking car though man like if i saw one of them coming at me i'd be like damn i'd just be running for the hills get out of that get out of the way kind of thing is that thing bulletproof no it's it's a nice truck it's very popular um but they're not they're not inexpensive um you'll spend about some u.s on and uh something's happening to your internet uh-oh just as the okay yeah you're back now you're back you're like doing a ding-dong i mean yeah maybe you're internet it shouldn't be my internet should be okay i don't know but you've got really like you hear me that's all that matters yeah we can hear you just before i was like ding ding ding ding that's all right it's good now so anyway cars we can talk about that too but let's go to the audience we'll go to a q a because i got asked there was a question that came up before that was really good and it was should i cancel my 3080 pre-order and this is one of those things of i mean it depends on what you pre-ordered and how much you pre-ordered it for if you got one around msrp you're not like it's going to be a good car the 38 is going to be good is the 6800 xt going to be they're going to be pretty much from what we're seeing and they're going to be much of the same and so basically you've got to ask yourself okay which which do you want to get they're both going to be pretty good you're not going to see like it's not going to be a life-changing choice going from a 30 80 to a 6800 xt and vice versa so i would say honestly if i had a pre-order for a 38 which i do i actually got to pick up my 30 80 for the 100 flip up challenge pretty soon i'm keep of course i'm keeping that because i want to get this card in as soon as possible and do the next video but i wouldn't be canceling my 80 preorder if it was a good 3080 pre-order to begin with so um yeah but uh yeah that's my answer would you would you cancel a 30-80 preorder if you had one on pre-order that depends on what you want um do you hear do you want a 6800 xt there's a market for both i think i think you're right i think they're the same performance or you know there'll be some games where we'll win and there'll be some games where a 6800x win and different resolutions they'll be different but as you said we've got competition on the high end which we have not had the last time we have okay petition and a video yep uh you just started yeah something's going on man this is probably aussie internet dude you're breaking up here but it's weird if my okay yeah you're cutting out dude isn't it yeah your audio is cutting out too yeah that's right i'll figure it out you seem to be okay now yeah anyway so anyway what's uh you should be okay now so let's keep going sorry um well he's not the most reliable the texas internet joke was pretty funny someone just dropped a joke they're like ah you sound normal mate just texas [Laughter] sounds like you guys in texas have a similar sense of humor as us in queensland man i i do love it hey you guys are awesome just keep tuning in for the the jokes and the lols i look it could be dead man he might have jumped on facebook um and he could be like my you know old man he jumps on facebook and he watches all these uh like just you know he gets plastered with all those random videos you see like oh this car can do a zero to a thousand kilometers in point one second and he's like clicking on and he's like really how how does this work and he's like he's gullible like that and it's it's funny as but that's probably might be my end if it's not your end it's my end but if it was my end then my audio would be cutting out to the dealers to the to the techies citizens as well which it doesn't sound like it is it's just your audio so it's probably just skype anyway go now talk now you want second generation ray train test envy and encoder and the 30 series want 16 gig gddr6 um okay so i just yeah so you you got okay do you want ray tracing nvidia driver suite or do you want and or do you want 16 gigabytes of vram so i've got to like translate this to the viewer do you want do you on the thing yeah just restart the call man that's probably better um let me hang up yeah yeah okay that's a different camera okay are you good now you just what did i just do now you're still your audio still uh owl look guys it happened in q a i don't know what happened this happened in q a it's probably like some dude is doing like uh i don't know anyway this is uh okay it's all right dude we'll fix it next time it happened in q a it's all good if it happened in the mainstream people would have just been like damn dude damn there he is there's his background he's real background we get to see your real background this time but it's all good it's all good uh we'll close off we'll close off the live stream and we'll do another live stream soon okay promise me that uh you everyone's like yo use discord we'll just it's it's the live stream sort of like coming to a crux anyway so we're all good it'll be we'll figure it out next

thanks for tuning in so much also let us know in the comments section of this live stream uh what topics you want us to talk about because we as we see here we just went off tangent on the 6800 xt and it just became this cool discussion and i love going down these tangents uh tech deals loves going down these tangents and you guys love it too because this is like the highest viewership we've ever had on the live stream here at tech yes city which is insane i think so it's like it's crazy um so yeah there we go we'll catch you guys we'll catch you guys in the next one thanks for tuning in a lot

cutting out so yeah we'll just we'll close it off and the 6800 xt me and tech deals both agree it's the one to get from the uh rd a2 announcement the 6800 xt all eyes on that do wait the benchmarks are going to be very interesting do wait for it i think we're both excited about that card in particular the other two don't shine as hard as that which is interesting because i thought the 3080 was the same thing i think the 3080 was the best out of the 30 70 and 3090 but yeah 6800 xt looks like the best price performance in that category and yeah get an a320 over b450 tech deals or disagree and he'll tell you otherwise love each and every one of you oh good yeah and sorry guys i don't know what's happened with the chat sorry about that but yeah it's tech deals is awesome go subscribe to his channel too and uh we'll catch you guys in the next live stream we'll figure out what happened here and we'll make sure it happened it doesn't happen again and we'll catch you guys in the next one do you want to say peace out for now with like a bing bing ding dong all i heard was a but all right guys peace out for now we'll catch you next time bye
