christmas is a season of giving in a tech yes city today we're certainly going to be giving with a z690 system with older lake i9 12900k installed this is going to be the biggest giveaway we have done on the channel here so this system it features the e core and the p cores on the 12 900k you get eight of each and the performance cores as we've seen in the recent review we've done these have a lot of performance where the cpu itself can clog up to over five gigahertz and then those little e cores they can help manage things in the background which helps free up the performance on those main eight p cores so you get eight of each making this a 16 core cpu in total now there's two great points about today's video first is you won't have to pay anything for this pc and the second point is i also don't have to pay anything either where today's build is sponsored by asrock and intel and also deepcool and corsair have also thrown in some parts as well so let's go over the components in today's system and the build process and then we'll also show you how you can enter with a chance to win this thing right here so for the components in today's build of course we've got that i-912 900k which we spoke a little bit about before which is supported on the z690 taichi straight out of the box we just installed the cpu and we're good to go and this motherboard also features 20 phases of direct mosfet power design as well as supporting up to ddr5 megahertz of speed now you've also got two pcie 5.0 x 16 slots as well as a pcie 4.0 x 16 slot and a pci 3.0 x one in the middle now we've already done a review of this motherboard here at techya city and it is a very solid board and for the memory we're going with two ddr5 16 gigabyte sticks to make 32 gigabytes in total and the xmp 3.0 profiles on this ram allows it to go up to 5200 megahertz cl 40 timing now look at the power supply we're going with an rm850i from corsair extremely solid power supply gold rated as well and modular as well as having all black cables to keep this system looking sleek then for the ssd we've got a two terabyte m.2 mp600 pci gen 4.0 ssd which is supported by this motherboard out of the get-go allowing you to get very fast transfer speeds then onto the case and also the cpu cooler we're going with the deepcool cg560 which has three argb fans at the front which you can control via a button on the top of the case and then for the cooler we've got the ck 920 which is one of the if not the best air cooler ever released to date so as for the final component we've got the tai chi 6800 xt 16 gigabyte gravis card this thing is one of the best looking gpus i have seen and of course the performance is better than out of a standard 6800 xt so it's going to give you absolutely phenomenal performance all the way up to 4k 120 hertz gaming so enough talk sit back relax let's roll some music and see how this thing got built [Music] trade unions are grasping who of us isn't and there's no doubt that the consumer is a spendthrift but none of them produce inflation for the very simple reason that neither the businessman nor the trade union has a printing press in their basement on which they can turn out those green pieces of paper we call money only washington has that printing press and therefore only washington can produce inflation [Music] so we just finished up a fire strike extreme score and these numbers are absolutely poppin with a physics score of 41 328 and a graphic score of 26 275. and next up is the ever famous cinebench r23 where this scores close to 27 000 points with this kingston memory and also on the single core performance gets over 1850 points so with the synthetic stress test out of the way i decided to play my favorite game at the moment and that is age of empires four where we're playing just the ai hardest just to benchmark the fps and we scored pretty much over 200 average fps at a starting area and then even in battles we're getting all the time over 150 average fps so this thing is going to give you a bought a smooth stutter free gaming experience to one lucky person out there now it's time to talk about how you can get in with

like this a reality and i want to take the time now to thank each and every one of you guys for supporting us through 2021 has been a very difficult year for me personally and i'm sure it's been a difficult year for a lot of you guys out there but as always the motto around tech yeah city is just keep on keep on but now it's time to give this pc a quick conclusion of my own and i absolutely love it it's very quiet and it's also looking very sleek with just the right amount of rgb so i think this one personally is a winner do let us know what you guys think down below and also let us know what would be your dream pc love reading those thoughts and opinions just like this special request that we got here which is the question of the day and this comes from srt dain and they asked just a quick question how many pcs do you think on average get returned back to you claiming there was something wrong with it so as you guys may know with the used pc parts a lot of that i do put into gaming pcs and sell so when it comes to selling a pc and even someone thinking about getting a return you have to be clear that i don't return for buyer's remorse and if people are just making up bs excuses and wanting to get a return because they don't like the pc anymore then that's on them that's not on you in terms of faulty hardware it does happen i'd say one in 20 pcs that i sell have something go wrong with them whether it's the power supply or the memory or the motherboard and god forbid the graphics card which really hurts when that goes faulty but again one in 20 pcs something goes wrong i fix it for the person and they're still happy in terms of returning a pc i have returned i believe one or two pcs i do remember one example when this person wanted a return but they were just straight up honest and they said look i bought this pc but i actually i don't want it anymore and i really need the money i've come into a pinch and i just said well actually you're being honest come back i'll give you the money back and so for me it was when they were honest about something rather than trying to pull through a different excuse so i would say when it comes to selling pcs you do have to be pretty firm in your terms and conditions when you're selling that pc so for instance when i'm selling a pc i'll say look i give three months warranty on the pc itself from defects and also i do make sure the system is running 100 do a few cold boots as well before you do sell that pc also run benchmarks and stress tests my favorite is unigene having low settings watching the temperatures especially on the gpu and you should be good to go from there anyhow guys hope that answers that question and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon so if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content well you should already be subbed because that's the condition of this giveaway but if you haven't already hit that sub button ring that bell get the videos as soon as they drop and also we've got a live stream coming up very soon so stay tuned for that there's going to be even more giveaways over christmas love each and every one of you guys and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] you
