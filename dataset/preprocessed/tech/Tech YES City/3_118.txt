So Ii decided to do today's review of the rx 
6600 XT a little bit later than the launch date,   and the reason i did that was because i wanted 
to see the street pricing of these cards where   AMD told me that they were going to come in 
from 379 usd or if you're in australia from $589   aussie dollars but upon speaking to some people 
who are getting these products in the shelves   they're telling me in australia you can expect 
this thing to come in at around about 750 aussie   dollars and then if you're in the united states 
i'm guessing that you're probably going to expect   to pay around $500 usd plus and there's a few 
reasons for this as well so let's get all those   gaming benchmark numbers out of the way and then 
talk about everything that the 6600xt is and isn't so those gaming benchmark numbers aside it's 
going to be very hard to get excited about   the 6600 xt where the performance falls pretty 
much similar to that of an rtx 3060 or a 5700 xt   but of course as you go up to 4k the 
performance does scale off a little   bit and that's because they're using a 128 
bit memory bus on this graphics card even   though you get 8 gigabytes of vram it does 
start to scale off at higher resolutions so   i wouldn't particularly recommend this card for 4k 
gaming but that being said at 1080p and also 1440p   it does give out an okay experience considering 
you could get it for 379 usd or in australia 589   because this is where the biggest problem comes 
in and that of course is the mining profitability   where even though the ethereum 
mining profitability dropped   per the absolute value was hoping the value of 
ethereum as a gamer would have stayed the same   or come down coupled with the profitability that 
would have really helped out the graphics card   prices for gamers but unfortunately the mining 
profitability dropped but the price of ethereum   went up right around this time and so that's 
pretty much left that profitability for everyday   24-hour earnings for miners still pretty much the 
same and so what this means with a card like the   6600 xt at least from the calculations i did hear 
even after you're paying 10 cents a kilowatt hour   it's still going to earn a minor 2.50 a day usd 
and those 32 mega hashes especially if you're   going to undervolt the card just means that the 
card is pretty much going to have a price floor   when it comes from what miners are prepared to pay 
versus what gamers are prepared to pay and we've   seen this with the rtx 3060 ti for example with 
the low hash rate models that have been released   on the market versus the normal models which are 
selling for higher prices so what this means is   that the miners are always going to be there and 
they're willing to pay a certain price floor which   i believe is well above that of the gamers which 
are already angry that this card is costing 379   usd or in australia 589 aussie dollars even though 
i feel like if these cards hit the market at that   price the miners will soon buy them up with the 
current profitability levels but continuing on   that note of pricing there's obviously going 
to be a lot of people scratching their head   at the 5600 xt which was a sub 300 card versus 
the sub 400 card the 6600 xt where the price   performance of these cards is pretty much going 
to level out which is very bizarre considering   this is a generational improvement going to rdna 
2 from the original rdna and the scariest thing   about this is ever since i've been looking at 
graphics cards as an enthusiast i've never seen   a trend like this in the graphics card industry 
in that every time we've had a new generational   improvement the price performance has improved 
from the previous generation and it's not like a   refresh for example we had the 600 series to the 
700 series from nvidia back in the gtx days and   then amd they had the rx 470 going to the rx 570 
pricing remained relatively the same even though   you've got a little bit more performance out of 
the cards so technically even on refresh series   you got better value for money so then what gives 
why are these cards coming out with higher prices   and people think well it's just amd and nvidia 
being greedy they can simply charge those prices   and it's actually got to do with another 
factor a big factor which we'll go into   in this review we y as well and that is inflation 
and i've been talking about this in the last six   months on the channel recently in the fomc minutes 
conversations from the federal reserve themselves   they've said that inflation is going to be 
essentially permanently transitory and that   if you had a 25 increase in tech prices they're 
going to remain at a 25 increase forever and then   inflation after that is going to be a lot lower 
than that initial surge of inflation which quite   simply means that if you had a dollar in 2019 it's 
probably in the tech scene lost about 25 percent   of its purchasing power unfortunately so in 2019 
if you had a dollar then you would need a dollar   and 25 in 2021 to get the same amount of tech that 
you got back in 2019 if that makes any sense but   unfortunately here is where the worst part of all 
the pricing comes in and that is since 2019 to   2021 i would guess that most industries and most 
people especially working class people on average   are not earning 25 percent more money than they 
were in 2019 and so essentially what we have is   a lot of average gamers being priced out of the 
market due to inflation and then to compound   on that problem the cryptocurrency miners are 
adding to the price because they are creating   artificially more demand for gaming graphics cards 
so at the moment the gamers are at their worst   point in history for especially buying a pc gaming 
graphics card so my advice in the last few months   has just been simply to wait it out especially 
when these cards are coming well above their msrps   so hopefully after all that information you 
guys are still with me and we're going to talk   about the red devil card itself i'll put up the 
weight and also the dimensions of the card up on   the screen for you but one thing about this card 
was itself if you're looking to get one of these   cards if they come back closer to that msrp is 
that the red devil model i was very impressed   with what this had to offer not only was the 
noise and temperatures really well controlled   i was also really impressed with the aesthetic 
of the card i quite simply thought the way that   they've implemented the leds on the back plate 
the side and also the front plate as well as the   lighting up of all the input output ports if you 
guys are into building a bling pc which let's face   it a lot of people are this card is going to look 
phenomenal especially if you decide to vertically   mount it in your build though the red devil card 
has two modes and that is a silent and also a bias   oc mode i left it on the bios oc mode because 
the silent mode wasn't even necessary out of   the box we're talking about these fan speeds and 
temperatures out of the box this car went up to 40   fan speeds which was whisper quiet and also did 
a very good job of keeping temperatures extremely   low and then going up to 60 percent does increase 
the noise but does drop the temperatures more   i would suggest this if you want to overclock the 
card a little bit more than that of the default   spec the 80 and 100 fan speeds i wouldn't 
recommend these as the fan noises got simply   ridiculously loud and the diminishing returns 
of noise versus temperatures increased heavily   when we did this but speaking of overclocks 
i simply wouldn't bother if you were getting   this card to overclock it and in fact i would 
recommend the opposite where in my opinion this   was easily the most impressive part about the 6600 
xt where i might do a low power consumption build   for you guys here on the channel where when 
i undervolted this card roughly 100 millivolt   as well as drop the clock speeds down to just 
over that of 2000 megahertz as well as upping   the vram speeds i got performance in the shadow 
of the tomb raider 4k benchmark very similar to   that of the default settings however the wattage 
went from roughly 140 watts down to under 80 watts   so quite simply seeing the wattage numbers for 
the fps you're getting this card right here is   got the best power efficiency that i've seen from 
any gravis card coming through the studio to date   at least in terms of raw rasterization performance 
though on the flip side if you're looking to get   this card for ray tracing then i wouldn't bother 
at this point in time i thought the ray tracing   performance just isn't there for the rx 6000 
series in general the 6600 xt being no different   now the last thing on overclocking and under 
vaulting was the power limits out of the box and   i don't know if this is limited to the red devil 
xt or if it's a thing that's going to affect all   6600 xt's but the power limit out of the default 
settings did cause some very rare stuttering   on games and i alleviated this and this is not 
introduced in today's numbers where i manually   upped the power limit in the radeon software so 
this is a problem across all 6600 xts then you   may see either a v bios update or a driver update 
implemented to alleviate this problem and then   the last point to talk about with this card is 
the inputs and outputs where you get a hdmi 2.1   as well as three display port outs and having a 
metal back plate and front plate really makes this   card feel like a high quality item where i feel 
like power color are doing a very impressive job   with the 6600 xt in the way they've implemented 
it so now it's time to conclude the rx 6600 xt   review for you guys and who is this card going 
to be for well at its current street pricing   it's not going to be for many gamers let's put it 
that way because as we said earlier in this review   the crypto miners are going to soak these cards 
up with a price floor that i feel is going to be   higher than that of msrp and so that's the first 
problem and as long as this problem exists then   miners are simply going to be taking away cards 
that gamers would otherwise purchase and put in   a gaming pc and that's why the whole industry 
especially in the new part of the segment just   sucks to be in right now because of this crypto 
problem and demand from miners and at least when   it comes to inflation as well we won't know the 
true effect of that until the crypto demand goes   away and we can get back to some sort of normalcy 
with graphics cards so until then the gamers are   essentially getting worse value on these gravis 
cards at least at their street pricing and then   only once we get back to that phase can i give 
you an accurate recommendation of if 379 usd is   a good deal or not in 2021 but hey that's why i'm 
hoping the crypto rug pool comes sooner than later   and if you guys enjoyed today's review 
then be sure to hit that like button for us   also let us know in the comments section below 
what you think of the 6600 xt launch i just think   it's another lackluster gpu launch in 2021 due to 
the crypto miners pretty much raising the prices   on the street pricing that's out there in the 
market though i love reading your thoughts and   opinions as always just like this question of the 
day here which comes from graphics card and they   ask can you do a video on installing this os on 
unsupported hardware and they talk about windows   11 where we did an optimization guide yesterday 
but we've also already installed windows 11 on   unsupported hardware and the way you do it is 
you get a windows 10 usb install and then you   put the windows 11. esd file on there or the wim 
file and then you can get around that i've also   done a video on that i'll put the link up here 
for you but with that aside i'm going to get on   out of here and if you've enjoyed this tech yes 
content you want to see at the moment it drops   then be sure to hit that sub button ring 
that bell and also give us a like if you can   appreciate it very much and i'll catch 
you in the next one peace out for now bye you
