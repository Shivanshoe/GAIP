[Music] if you guys are on a budget and you're looking to save some money this right here might represent the best price performance that you can get for a gaming pc in 2021 so what we have here has a poweredge server rack that when i was on a recent parts hunt someone was going to throw this away and they said brian do you want this thing i'm going to chuck it out and i had to look at it i said sure why not let's take a look at what's inside and it had a 1220 v5 xeon and that's a four core four threaded cpu i also noticed the power supply was only 250 watts however that would be good enough to support something like a 1050 ti so i searched high and low on facebook marketplace and good old gametree and i found myself a gtx 1050 ti for 120 and then from the same person that was going to give away this server rack i got 32 gigabytes of ddr4 ecc memory for 80 however we only have to use half the memory in today's build and then the last component here is an ssd a 256 gigabyte ssd that i picked up for a little over 20 in a parts hunt so all up we've got a pc here that's coming in under 200 but we're gonna see what price performance we can get but first things first we've got to boot this thing up and see if we can even get it to work properly before we go all out and make it a decent gaming pc if you've got this annoying windows needs activation message and you want to get rid of it for cheap then today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 bucks after you use the coupon code pftyc you can get yourself a legit single end user windows 10 license today links in description below so the pc is now booting up but you may notice a problem and that is that it is very noisy however the concept is working and it looks like it's going to work absolutely fine here after of course we give it some tech yes loving and that's where we're going to clean up all the dirt but while i'm at it i wish well replace these fans here with something a bit quieter for my ears and there's also some other really good news and that is the graphics card driver initially it didn't work but then after we booted it up and got windows installed and used the vga port first we were then able to get into windows install the graphics card driver and now we are able to play games on this amazing budget gaming pc so what we're going to do right now is we are going to bring the power back to power edge [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] and after all that cleaning we now have a pc of the likes you've probably never seen before that is running absolutely fine and we've even hacked in that new fan there to give ourselves lower noise and better temps on that cpu cooler so in terms of tuning though we don't really have to tune anything on this pc because the bios on these are extremely limited in terms of tuning ram speeds and also in terms of tuning the cpu but the good thing is is that these particular xeons they're made for single cpu socket boards and they generally have higher clock speeds so i'm hoping we'll get to around i think these cpus from memory get to around 3.3 gigahertz all core which on four cores four threads of skylake ipc that isn't that bad so tuning aside we can uh technically overclock the gravis car but since it's on a sata one dollar connector and also it's a 1050 ti there's not a whole lot of extra performance that we're going to get out of this thing though that aside let's get on to the numbers now and see what this thing can pull off in games [Music] so after gaming on this thing for a few hours i was left actually impressed and surprised because someone gave away this server rack they just didn't want it anymore they thought they couldn't do anything with it and that's the opportunities that i love to take up and the challenges that i love to get on board here at tech city and make them into something that someone especially if you're on a budget and you've got a bit of time on your hands can turn into an epic gaming pc and that's what we saw here today and we'll talk about the performance of the games very soon the problems that we had to overcome here are very important to point out because this could or problems essentially could pertain to different models of server racks out there and this is important when i'm going to make a recommendation here today because what we saw here today i had to pull out four of those little fans because they were way too loud for anyone putting this in the same room that they're gonna game in i then had to use that dell proprietary connector for the fan and then solder that to a regular fan and change the wiring and then put that on the cpu heatsink for better temps and also lower noise and speaking of the temperatures i was very impressed because we're here in summer in australia and the ambient temperatures are pretty hot especially where i'm at and i was actually impressed with the 50 degrees on the gpu and also the 50 degrees on the cpu so temperatures were really fine this open-air gaming system it was a server rack but now it's an open-air gaming system it's running absolutely fine in terms of temperatures but then after that i did have to tape down that sensor for the side panel since we cannot use that side panel anymore due to the gpu sticking out and then the final two things that we did was we did use the solder power to leech off that for the 1050 ti gravis card and we had to take out a little metal pole that was sticking out that would otherwise block the gpu and we had to just take that off completely then once we got that all up and running we had to go into the bios and change a few settings so there was a lot of hurdles to overcome but the gaming performance was really on point that 1220 v5 zeon that's four cores four threads of skylake ipc and that ended up handling the games absolutely fine when it came to csgo and fortnite we were getting over 150 average fps on both these games at 1080p and i was actually surprised to see that historically cs go has always been a lot easier to run than fortnite but this time around when i was benchmarking i was actually getting slightly higher fps on fortnite which was weird but it does go to show that the developers at fortnite are working on getting their game to run on pretty much any hardware with better fps as opposed to with cs go i believe they've made improvements to the engine well in the sense that they make graphical improvements and that is a bit more strenuous on your hardware although i ran cs go on a blend of high and low settings i did leave off things like msaa which tank performance as well as shadows which do tank performance on the cpu side of things so i was surprised to see that cs go usually gets a bit higher fps but lately the fps is coming under that of fortnite which i was running that at competitive settings with epic view distance and then low with 100 screen res and then the last title was cyberpunk 2077 and this thing just does not like budget at all you really do want to get something like an rtx 3060 ti or a 6800 from amd's side if you want to play this game with a good graphical experience and relatively smooth fps and even on the higher end systems you don't get that high fps what we saw here today with the 1050 ti was we booted it in and we're getting around 30 fps on average and i couldn't even lock in 1080p on this system that's how bad this game is in terms of running on hardware and i thought they had bug patched cyberpunk 2077 but as soon as i jumped in i jumped into a load game and my bike that i was riding was just suspended in midair like it was just floating there so i jumped into a game that was bricked and i mean the game was actually running better on when i first played it on first release than it is with these latest patches but apparently these patches have meant to fix a heap of bugs so i'm not sure what's going on with cyberpunk but there's no dlss either to lock in so we're pretty much stuck with 30fps at close to 1080p here with low custom presets so it doesn't really get any worse but at the same time i guess you kind of could play this game at 30fps i mean me personally i do like at least 60fps and i think if you're a pc gamer i'm playing fast action paced games like if i'm playing starcraft 2 i could probably do that on 30 fps but when it comes to like fps or anything that's first person i do need that 60 fps so those gaming numbers aside this now leads us to a straight recommendation with the dell poweredge and should you think about using a server rack for a gaming pc and here's what i'm going to say if you can at least borrow this or if you get one for free especially if you get one for free someone's chucking one out then why not give it a go you've got pretty much nothing to lose then but if you're gonna go out and buy one and if we look on ebay some of the prices of these are very cheap i saw one listing where a guy was selling a heap of them for around 75 dollars each if you get one of these you may come into some complications like we saw here today but if you can mount that graphics card in the pcie slot then i'm pretty sure you'll be able to get this thing working like we did here today so keep in mind you will want to use a low powered gpu something like we used here today gtx 1050 ti or maybe a 1650 or an rx 470 will do perfectly and if you need a six pin then you can leach it off the solder power and that should be fine because we've only got a 250 watt power supply and so if we put a high powered gpu on the system will just simply cut out now some of these server racks will support 350 watt models so you may be able to step it up to maybe a gtx 1066 gigabyte or maybe an rx 570 instead of a 470 but keep in mind you will be limited in your choice of gpus on a low rated power supply which in this case we have to use that power supply because it's pretty much all proprietary the cpu and motherboard connectors and even the data transfer from the sata drives to the motherboard itself are all proprietary even those fan connectors so pretty much stuck with using what dell has given us and we can't really change anything unless of course you maybe have a week's time on hand and you love soldering that might be a choice for you but in this case going with the server rack mount in 2021 if prices are way too high on all the other components where you are then these can present a decent choice and i'm going to say that because you get the power supply you get the motherboard you get the case you get the cooler you get the cpu sometimes you even get the ram thrown in the whole deal and if it's that cheap all you have to do is get that gpu get that ssd or hard drive smack it in and you've got yourself now a gaming pc and that's what it's all about here at tech yes city and that is having fun trying out new things so it's kind of like we hit the pc gaming meta jackpot here today and we came up with something fun that i hope you guys enjoyed if you did then be sure to hit that like button and let us know in the comment section below have you tried using a server rack for gaming before or have you got any other ideas of your own on how to get away in 2021 on a budget and still get some good fps though speaking of price performance and fps we've got here a question of the day which comes from zaril and they asked i've been seeing some local three gigabyte gtx 1060s going for 100 to 125 euro do y'all think it's worth it to buy it at this price and to answer that question i'm gonna say at the moment i've been seeing a lot of 1063 gigabytes come up for pretty decent prices and now since the crypto miners don't want these gpus and since a lot of the popular titles out there do take advantage of this price performance of this gpu i can say if you're on a budget and you want to play 1080p games like cs go rainbow 6 and dota 2 and even fortnite this is going to be a great gpu for getting good fps and i recently asked people on my discord what they liked doing with their pcs whether it's high end or low end and even a lot of the guys with high-end hardware were still playing games like cs go and dota 2 and stuff like that so i think a lot of people who get the real latest and greatest hardware like really high fps of course but they also play the new titles and they don't play them for that long but then they revert back to all these really popular titles because they have a lot of playability in their multiplayer so if you want to get into pc gaming and play what a lot of other people are playing then at 100 euro the 1063 gigabyte is gonna be a pretty good buy i hope that answers that question and if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that
