welcome back to tech yeah city and this is the 11400f and i'm gonna be explaining why i think you should be buying one of these cpus sooner and a lot sooner rather than later especially if you're looking to upgrade or if you're looking to build a new pc because all my research and analysis as well as speaking to retailers directly points towards buying sooner than later so let's get into those explanations right after this sponsor spot if you want to get rid of this annoying activate windows message then today's video sponsor scdkeys has you covered for as little as 12 us dollars after you enter that coupon code bftyc you can cop yourself a legit single end user license today links in description below so currently you can get the 11400f for 175 dollars and in fact i saw the price go up three dollars when i was initially uh doing work with the 11400 f cpu so it's already technically increased in price based on street values now there are some indicators and some strong indicators based on what intel's told me and based on the fact that you should purchase an 11400 f and one of those big reasons was i was told that the 11700f and subsequently the 11 1100 f and all the b560 and h510 motherboards would be available on day one and yet when i look around i am not seeing all these cpus and all these motherboards available on day one and in fact australia i'd say that the 11400f is one of the better buy cpus that really is only in stock compared to 11700f but if we take the 11700 which is currently available with the 11700f isn't we can then look at the value proposition there and we can see that it's nowhere near as good as a value proposition as the 10 400 f versus the 11400 f but let's go through these gaming benchmark numbers 1080p with an rtx 3090 and i did use the best motherboards for all the cpus here the ryzens and the intel cpus but i will make note that i also have tested the 11400 f on a h510 motherboard we will talk about that a little bit later but going through some of the numbers here we can see the 11400f is in front of the 10400f and the ryzen 5 3600 and i do highlight these cpus in red because i believe they are the two direct competitors to this cpu especially when we're looking at a pure value for money standpoint moving over to f1 2020 shows the exact same trend and scenario forming however the 10700f don't overlook this cpu because as we get into the productivity numbers later you'll see exactly why and it does score a victory here over the 11700f as well as having the i7 branding attached to it which is a powerful thing if you wish to resell in the future but going to dota 2 showed that the 11400f and the 10400f relatively similar cpus here i mean 1fps is really nothing especially when you're getting over 200 fps in this particular title and same with the ryzen 5 3600 absolutely fine in this game call of duty cold war showing again the same similar trend that we've been seeing before and then lastly cs go showing that the 11400f is no joke indeed however the 5600x you'll notice that that's pretty much chart topping numbers in a lot of the titles and that cpu itself amd do like to put a price tag on that and it's much higher than the other three cpus that we're going to be taking a look at in terms of value for money now before we move on to the productivity numbers i'm actually going to pull up a graph here which i think is one of the most important graphs and that is the productivity value based on the street pricing based off a geekbench 5 multi-test score which will give you a value of how good the 11400f is in terms of value for money especially at the current price point of 175 dollars this one is an absolute no-brainer and as i said before if you are thinking about getting an upgrade from say a four-core previous 4th gen i7 4 core or if you're looking to build a new gaming pc very soon even if you can't purchase the graphics card right now i wouldn't be concerned about that because if you wait for the graphics card to be in stock the prices of this cpu and motherboard could easily go up but i will explain that very soon let's just move through this adobe premiere pro numbers if you're into editing videos especially at 4k the 11400f will suffice it will do an absolutely fine job just keep in mind if you are 4k video editing one of the most important things you can get for yourself is more memory as well as a decent graphics card which either supports cuda or opencl over to another multi-threaded rendering benchmark here the 11400f doing absolutely fine beating that of the 3600 and the 10400f then the geekbench five numbers for you guys to see directly we can see the 11400f single core performance is also just as impressive as its multi-core performance and then showing the 7-zip numbers here's where the ryzen 5 3600 does pull ahead so if you have a zip rendering farm if you're one of those unique people that does this then you may wish to look at a ryzen cpu over an intel cpu even the latest 11th gen but then v-ray reverts back to the norm of the 11400f continuing to be a better performer as well as better value for money than the ryzen 5 3600 and 10 400 f and then lastly we've got the cinebench results up here for you guys just like v-ray shows the exact same thing you're probably thinking up until this point brian the 11400 f is too good value for money what is going on there's got to be some kind of drawback here and the only drawback i could see within my testing that i've done recently is when you couple it with a h510 or even a b560 you could come into some i guess hurdles and that involves the power limits so the cpu here does run a little bit higher especially over that of the 3600 and 10 400 f where in the cinebench r20 results i did measure power consumption that did go up to around 107 watts as opposed to the 3600 scoring just over 80 and the 10 400 f in the mid 70s this does correlate to to the gaming performance as well whilst i was playing games i did notice the power consumption was pretty much in perfect correlation to these maximum power consumption numbers too and that the 11400f will use up considerably more power while you're gaming to the point of around 75 watts versus that of the 3600 and the 10400 f which actually come in under 50 watts on both the cpus and the 10 400 f believe it or not having the best efficiency when it comes to gaming at least from the test that i've done of all these cpus in this graph right here so that's the only drawback i can see with the 11400f and the fact that if you buy a cheaper motherboard you may have to go into the bios and disable some of the power limits or up them to the maximum lengths and times and wattage limits so you can get more performance out of your cpu whilst you're even gaming and that can affect your gaming performance just as much as it can affect the productivity performance of this cpu but the last question you may have is why is the power consumption higher and that's because the 11400 f is on still on 14 nanometer and it's clocked 200 megahertz higher where you've got a 4.2 gigahertz all core speed versus the 10 400 f which has a 4 gigahertz all core speed so you've got i guess a more power hungry architecture on the same node and you've got a 200 megahertz higher so that will explain why it's using more power so now it's time for the part that you've probably been waiting for and that is the economics part and everything to do with the 11400 f and why you should definitely be buying one of these cpus now rather than later and the biggest reason for that is simply the amount of money printing going on with central banks and it's one of the themes that i'm going to keep i guess emphasizing here the importance of buying now rather than later and the later just points towards not just inflation i've heard people say this oh brian inflation's normal inflation's a normal thing and stable relatively low inflation is a normal thing and it can be decent for a society to implement i guess stable inflation of two percent but i'm seeing and what i'm seeing is anything but stable inflation i'm only seeing high inflation in regards to a lot of goods out there and a lot of services so when you have high inflation it destroys economies and it destroys pricing and this is one thing that you can talk to people in venezuela about argentina's another one these guys come out in the comments section and they say yes this does indeed destroy pricing and economies so we look at the i5 and we look at the fact that it's still under 200 and it's carrying six cores 12 threads as opposed to traditionally carrying four cores four threads then you can see that you're actually getting a very good deal in terms of the pricing of 175 dollars now where 175 dollars back when a 2400 was released would have probably been maybe 250 dollars now so you are getting a better deal coupled with the fact that we are seeing a trend of shortages or so-called shortages out there in the market i mean what comes next after ddr4 is there going to be a shortage on sata controllers on motherboards is it going to be a shortage of usb 3 controllers is there going to be a shortage of i guess hd audio so there's a lot of risks that you take by not buying now rather than later and holding on in the hope that prices will get cheaper because it's my belief that prices will not get cheaper and that's because if we look at the ryzen cpus they're already higher than they were the ryzen 5 3600 for example that used to be around a hundred and eighty dollars you could even see it for 160 dollars at times now it's up to 240 dollars so when we look at the i5 11 400 if we can see that it's in stock or at least it's coming in stock if i look at amazon it's coming in stock in about a week's time at this price point the motherboards that you can still pick up a h510 motherboard for just a little over seventy dollars this is representing extremely good value for money and i would not hesitate to go buy this right now based on its pricing if i needed to go get a cpu on motherboard i would have no qualms in fact i went and bought this because i liked the value proposition it was giving and i wanted to do some content around it and i was really surprised at how good the value for money is there was a few caveats that did make it a good buy as opposed to a great buyer a great buyer in my opinion has no flaws and the power consumption in my opinion was a floor but i think the most important thing is to go back on this shortages topic because what we're seeing here is a trend in the tech industry and that is there's shortages right there's shortages on chips that are being produced for cars there's shortages of chips that are being produced for now they're saying that ddr4 is going to be in shortage and there's obviously a shortage of graphics cards especially when it comes to meeting the demand and when i speak to when people like nvidia for example that's they're telling me that there is no essentially supply shortage with rtx 3000 cards they've actually ramped up production and making more rtx 3000 cards than they made rtx 2000 cards so now it becomes a demand problem where demand is over that of previous demand in the industry and one can only wonder why this demand is a lot higher than it's previously been and i mean i think i know the answer and that is the central banks of pretty much every country in the world right now is just doing what they call money printing and that is the creation of money when you create money out of thin air it essentially has a lot less value than it did before so in other words your dollar's purchasing power is going to be eroded by the fact that money is being handed out a lot freer than it ever was you don't have to work for that money anymore it's going to have less value to you and so when people get these stimulus checks and they borrow this money where the banks have now relaxed regulations and they can borrow that money easier they now have a less value placed on the money itself because it's easier to obtain that's just natural in ways of any goods and services the more scarce it is the more desirable it's going to be all other things being equal of course now of course there are people out there that are going to get stimulus checks and they need those stimulus checks they needed to get food they needed to pay for bills but there's also a great portion of people out there that get those stimulus checks and they just go on twitter for example and they go literally bragging about dropping their stemi check on anything and even just dropping it on crypto currencies i mean that in itself is just not really helping the economy at all it's a consumption-based stimulus check in that regard it's not helping productivity it's not helping survival of people it's just really adding to inflation that's the only thing that sense of money is being spent in and so when we look at the trends where money's never been cheaper essentially that just means that there's never been such a big supply of dollars and when you have an oversupply of something its value becomes less so i'm talking about the actual value of a dollar going down and that's why you're seeing the higher prices and you're seeing them rise substantially quickly in a lot of different industries especially when we are artificially creating more demand for tech products due to the nature of the coronavirus and so it's based on this research and these beliefs that you should go out and buy an 11400f sooner rather than later and don't be one of those people i mean in this case i wouldn't be one of those people that just goes out and buys one and then tries to reflip it two months later because you could have bought those goods with that money say for instance you wanted to get a bicycle the price of the bicycle is probably going to go up in two months anyway so even if you buy the cpu now and you make a nominal profit of 80 dollars on it you re-flip it for 240 dollars in two months time the price of your buy school might have gone up as well and so that's what inflation does it raises the prices of everything and even if you think you're making a nominal profit you're actually not making a true or real realized profit so with all that said if you envision yourself in the next week or next few months needing a cpu then go out and buy an 11400f sooner rather than later and subsequently a motherboard and also ddr4 memory before the media and news sites spit out shortage that's what they're going to tell you there's a shortage of everything when in essence as we've explained in this video i don't think it's a shortage i just think it's an oversupply of dollars and so with that in mind it's better to go get something sooner and later and actually we'll answer the question the day while we're on this topic because it relates to other things you can do too which is smart to look at if you're in the market for purchasing a cpu right now this comes from winnie zong and they ask 150 bucks for a 10 600 great deal and yes this was a 150 aussie dollars too which 120 something usd so a great deal if you can look on the used market and go grab an i5 10 600 or a 10 400 f and also even looking at things like a 10 700 f which if you want a better motherboard you can still get z490 motherboards for really good prices so the 10900f i like the look of that as well 10 cores 20 threads especially when we contrast and compare that to the new ryzen 5th gen cpus and now even the ryzen 3rd gen cpus where their prices are going up a lot faster than the intel cpus so i mean when i look at that a little bit closer there's definitely the brand loyalty of amd over intel that would be making people want to purchase the amd side of things more but when it really comes down to it these brands they've proven time and time again that they are not loyal to use so i don't know why in turn people repay these companies with the inverse and they give them all their loyalty i think in my opinion it's one of the weirdest things i see in tech especially when the evidence is there and it points to anything but and with that aside i hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did and be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comment section below what you think of the 11400f and also all the tech shortages that are going on at the moment love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tacky ass content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll see you next time peace out for now are going to bye [Music] a different world
