september 2021 is already bringing us some magical deals but this one's got a little bit of a catch we've got here a 3770 motherboard 16 gig of ram untested with a power supply i got this for 100 aussie dollars and then it seems like the person who was selling it to me had some other parts as well which is all untested but i decided i would take the gamble and this is another 2500k here 16 giga ram and a z68 motherboard and then we've got finally up here a lenovo special which they said they got in from a trade-in from another computer and they had they just couldn't fix it so they said they reckon the rams a little bit faulty but i'm going to take a look at it since i saw a gtx 950 i'm like okay 100 i'll take the gamble with that so we've got three untested pcs and then while they're at it they said look here's a gtx 980 ti that doesn't work and a gtx 1080 ti that doesn't work would you know how to fix these and i said sure i'll take a look at them if i manage to fix them then we can work out some kind of a deal so this month is already looking like it's starting to look pretty good but i've got to head up to brisbane where i've put in a heap of different offers on ryzen intel i7 intel i5 ddr3 ddr4 gpus as well you name it i'm on it so let's go hit the road and see what unfolds this month in the used pc part sign of the month are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro two links in description below welcome back to tech yes city and if you're tuning in from any place in the world right now hope you're smiling hope you're staying healthy and if not then hopefully this video will bring a smile to your face and we've already got the deals we already got three deals in the boot even though that was from one contact it ended up being awesome and a great way to start the month but i've also been hooking up and i've been scouring for graphics cards uh ryzen all the cpus you name it and i've come across a potential deal that could lead to more deals in that there's a gtx 1063 gigabyte now they're asking 250 i dropped in an offer of 200 aussie dollars and then he replied he said 200 sounds fair and he also had a few more pc parts on hand now this guy with the gtx 1060 he is located in brisbane and brisbane is a city in australia where les who is a regular here on the channel he does me pretty decent deals on used paths so we're going to go hit up les first then we're going to check out this graphics card then there's also and some really good news there's also another potential deal with 1050 ti's and i do say that in plural because apparently the person's got i think 11 of them they told me and i'm looking to get all of them especially with christmas coming up people are going to need some budget pcs because i found at the moment in the used scene that budget anything that's coming in with a low price point is selling really well anything with a higher price points kind of taken a little while to move anyhow guys we're going to go grab this canon camera that i got in my hands we're gonna check out what is on the front lines and keep you guys posted so here we are live on the floor at leisure's beautiful place and this is an x 99 motherboard that was 80. so you want to do a 70 on that no way you always got to try and shave off a tenor but what we've got right now is x9 x79 with an i7 48 2016 gig of ram uh this is my favorite piece that les has got right now because you know me x 79 x 99 x 58 this is my bread and butter so pick this one up for 150 aussie and i hopefully that this cooler lights up with an led too that'd be really cool to see if it does have that led now over here some replacements as well i had a 900 watt i think it was an antec high current game mode it's a rare problem it passed the power supply tester but when you boot up the pc uh the power supply started cutting out so less just chucked us some just replacement stuff and in lieu of that and then we've got over here uh some other stuff there that i'm not kind of too keen on more business grade stuff but then we got over here a same a z 220 workstation the same one that we're pulling that deal on say giga ram 3470 and uh no hard drive yeah 70 bucks so take it and put it in the truck then the last deal we're picking up right here is two terabyte hard drives and one terabyte hard drive so managed to score all these drives here for 350. and that so far about wraps it up i'm going to see if les has any monitors but if not no biggie so after negotiating with les he's got some monitor arms here and he said he'd do them at 25 bucks a piece and they look like they're really good ones with the tension mounts and everything so i mean look when you got the product on display you can see it in actions i was like yeah i'll take four of them so hopefully the studio will be getting a bit of a redec now with some budget used monitor stands and that's what it's all about and look at that les has an azito this is the drive this is a screwdriver that i used to put together pcs i knew les was watching the channel he's a secret admirer so we just finished up picking up 750 aussie dollars in total of complete used goodness from les but we're gonna go see what is cracker lacking now with this gtx 1060. fingers crossed because i need graphics cards desperately [Music] so we just picked up the gtx 1060 three gigabyte now i know it's three gigabyte not the six gigabyte but we still only paid two hundred thousand dollars for it in this market i'd say it's pretty good deal considering i desperately need those gravis cards the person was really nice and they have their own like data recovery business so i took their card if you guys are on on the coast or in brisbane and you need data recovery then be sure to hit up dejan for those services and in terms of what other pc parts they had um they had a mini itx system they wanted 650 aussie dollars for it but i just said to myself well it's minus the gpu and so that's the hardest thing to get right now so i decided to pass up on that but i think it was like an nzxt case small form factor power supply 2600x and a motherboard and ram and also an ssd so it wasn't too bad but i'm just not in the market for that in particular i'm more in the market for bare bones and um drives on there like more bulk discount sort of stuff where i can put together my own gaming pcs but speaking of a bulk discount we might have something special coming up right now so we're going to hit the road and i might actually grab a feed on the way as well i'm starving [Music] deeper [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] so now we're back at the tech yeah studio just recouping and i gotta say i mean i was just gonna say we are back diddly dak with the deals this month and i mean this amount of gpus is what it's all about i've been really hanging for something to come through in the last couple of months and this tvti hookup was definitely the way to go so basically there was one of them advertised for 200 and i came in i said you know would you take 160 and then they're like well yeah and then they said they had 11 of these 1050 ti so that was an absolute score we got that 1060 as well and then we got this gtx 950 with this combo here so this is looking really nice so far i'll put a tally up on the screen on what this parts hunt is about so far but there's also an i7 47 90 with 16 gigs of ram they uh get they got back to me pretty late because it's 10 p.m right now so i'm getting a little bit tired but they came back and they said they would accept the 150 and they're not too far from me so i might go pick that up tomorrow i'd say if i find some other good deals that are out and about them will continue tomorrow's parts hunt and then of course we got these two pcs from les here they are just the third gen i5 z220 220 towers and all the hard drives here however what i'm going to do now since i did pick up these three boards in that gpu for a pretty solid deal i'm just going to test out those graphics cards and just report back and see if i can get either of them working quickly uh usually the best way to do this without you know washing them or doing any heat guns or anything like that is just to actually take the back plate off both of them since they both got back plates i'll just quickly run through and see what i can muster up [Music] so it's now 6 p.m the next day and this is gonna be one of the shortest parts hunts i've done because we came up kind of empty-handed today we did have a few feelers that we put out there one of them has come back with the potential yes it just depends if someone else picks up the deal so this was for a gtx 960 2 gigabyte where they're asking 150. i put an offer of 90 and then they came back and said well if this person who said they were picking it up a day ago doesn't come pick it up tonight that's for 110 so they put an offer of 110 they said that they'll let me have it for 90. so fingers crossed i can get that one then there's also the i7 47 90 and 16 giga ram that i talked about yesterday and but it's actually storming and raining outside so i kind of don't want to go out just for one deal and it's sort of mediocre at that i'd like to actually hear your guys your thoughts on what you think an i7 47 90 and 16 gigabytes of ram is worth 150 is kind of like fair value it's not a great deal and early in the month i picked up an i7 4790 alone just for 80 dollars on itself and i'm kind of thinking well eight dollars for the chip 50 for the ram it's kind of like 130 would be a better deal in my opinion the one thing that's come back completely empty-handed is all the gumtree offers that i put out have come back empty-handed where they're just coming back with those price points that are a little bit higher than what i'm prepared to pay and the market right now is so weird where things are moving and they're not moving and i'd say anything with a budget price point on it especially if you're flipping gaming pcs on a budget price point they're moving really well i'd say in australia right now anything under say a thousand aussie dollars or in usd terms 700 usd is moving extremely fast but then once you go over that sort of psychological price point of a thousand dollars it is so slow to move this stuff and that's what i'm finding personally here where i'm at is under a thousand bucks moving really fast over a thousand dollars just sitting there you're pretty much not even getting any interest either so i think what's happening on the higher end is even if those gravity cards are moving it's either crypto miners buying them the majority or it's people who are replacing their graphics cards in their already built systems but on that note picking up those 1050 ti's was easily my favorite deal of the month so far but one thing we'll quickly touch on now we'll also talk about when we do the live stream for pc parts price watch is the actual market itself is giving off some of the weirdest signals i've ever seen to this date we've got deflationary pressures and we've got inflationary pressures and it seems like for instance those deals that i put out on those offers that i've put out for all those parts none of them have moved and it's been over a day so none of them are really hot none of them are really moving i've seen ads on marketplace that have been sitting there for months now and they haven't moved and so that in ways is like a deflationary pressure if we look at the macro environment right now in the world there's a massive amount of global debt but then on the other side of the fence we've got governments printing money at an unprecedented amount and pace but then to top that all off their supply chains actually being cut off when it comes to thing like i think in the uk recently there's uh talks of gas stations just being overloaded with people trying to get gas which is really reminiscent of the 1970s and that was just a huge massive inflationary period for pretty much the whole world so at this point in time it just feels like i remember researching a while ago that we're going into what would be called as an inflationary depression and that seems to be where we are heading and so relating this to pc parts it seems like going forward these two pressures will fight each other and what you'll experience is massive volatility you may even see some months pc parts will be very cheap whether it's used or new and then some months you'll see them be very expensive and so all i can say is going forward is just be quick on your toes when there's a good deal and it's a really good deal snap it up and then of course if prices are high just wait it out for those periods because i feel like this jet coaster is only just getting started and with that aside i hope you guys enjoyed this used pc parts hunt of september 2021 if you did and be sure to hit that like button and we've also got the question of the day here and this comes from van dankholm and they ask is pci gen 3x8 the same as pcie gen2 x16 and in terms of maximum bandwidth and throughput then technically yes but in terms of the way pci gen 3 polls it's actually polls more times per second than pcie gen 2 but for real world intents and purposes you'll basically see no difference between these two hope that answers that question if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that like button smash the sub ring the bell and also let us know in the comments what was your favorite deal of the month and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now [Music] world [Music]
