this right here is an lcd upgrade kit for the corsair elite capel x series in that they've recently launched an elite capelex lcd kit on its own however if you have bought the original elite cappellax coolers with the standard rgb header pumps then you can buy this separately and then at the same time upgrade your existing capel x cooler to one with now a fancy lcd screen and speaking of fancy screens this one right here has a 480 by 480 pixel ips display and now it is customizable in that you can add either images or even moving gifs to the unit itself so i decided here at the studio to test out a few cat images because for some reason i've always been fascinated by standing cats i actually haven't seen it in person but i've seen some of these on the internet so i decided to load in a few standing cat gifts and sure enough it just made my all-in-one cooler look that much better but if you're wondering what else this screen can do then we'll take a look at how easy it is to install some of the problems you might come into then look at the other features it has to offer but i will say first of all corsair did send this out for me to take a look at but they are a channel sponsor and i have been using their products for quite some time and especially they're all in one coolers i do think they're some of if not the best all-in-one coolers on the market so let's roll that intro and then dive right into this product here [Music] welcome back to tech yes city and this little screen upgrade kit right here if you're in the us will set you back 99 us dollars or in australia 159 including gst so i would consider this one of those all pun intended elite upgrades if you are a pc enthusiast now installing this is very straightforward if you've got an existing capel x cooler all you have to do is unscrew the four bolts connecting the pump face to the actual pump itself and you'll notice once you disconnect that there will be two cables coming from that original face plate and there'll also be a connector that it's disconnected from that has four magnetic tips here's where you then replace that with the lcd upgrade kit and then plug that in via the usb 2 to your motherboard now there is an additional usb 2 header here and within the kit itself corsair have included a usb 2 splitter so you don't have to worry about running out of usb 2 front outs in order to program this monitor separate from the commander however the last step in this puzzle is to then connect the faceplate to the commander itself and also the fan header to let the pump know when it should be turning on however as i was installing this piece of hardware i noticed that it started flashing red and there was an exclamation mark coming out and this also was reflected on the included fans on the cooler itself and so to get around this i just downloaded the latest iq software from the website so you may have to if these steps don't work for you you may have to uninstall your existing iq software and then install the latest iq from the website and once i downloaded and installed this program it then asked me if i wanted to update the firmware of the h115i elite capelix that we're using in today's video and as soon as i updated that the lcd screen then came completely to life and that's when we can now dig into the software where we just have so many different choices of patterns and customizations that we can do within the iq itself and since i am using this on my test system i don't have a whole lot of rgb connected but the rgb connected that i do have on board i was able to for instance program the dominator memory to read out the gpu temperatures then i was able to program the two fans on the radiator to watch for the pump temperatures the water inside the pump and then after that i was able to program the main head to the actual cpu the 12 900k temperatures so you can get a lot of functionality out of this little lcd screen coupled with some of the other rgb so it's not just fancy looks but also allows you to give out warnings say for instance if you're using a very cpu intense program and you've overclocked the cpu and you're just worried about temperatures whilst using that program then you can watch them on the fly and the colors will give you a warning so continuing through some of the other options it's almost like this software is the photoshop of rgb where you can add in different layers of rgb so you can have many different effects going on at the same time so the customization is definitely there with the iq software though as we said earlier in the video you can add in your own images and also moving gifs and you can customize the size of those but do keep in mind they will be then cut in a circular image as opposed to a square on the 2.1 inch screen anyhow guys that's all for today's video it is a short one but that's because the product itself just speaks for itself it's a very simple install there was really no problems in getting this thing to work it was all straightforward the software the iq that works flawlessly and also on top of that i mean the amount of patterns and things you can do with this was quite impressive my favorite ended up in the end being the dual display so you can set two different temp sensors on the lcd screen itself and since your cpu and gpu are the most important things i actually ended up enjoying watching both the cpu and gpu temperatures being displayed at the same time anyhow guys do let us know in the comment section below what do you think of the elite capel cappellax series and also this lcd upgrade kit right here love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from dman pc1 and they ask a hundred dollar flip up season two so we are definitely going to make that happen that was actually on my mind this question came in at the perfect time so in season one we actually made it we started with a hundred dollars we made it to the rtx 3080 gaming pc but then this whole crypto thing came in and really distorted the whole market but lately i've actually been starting to get my ground and my bearings back so i'm definitely going to make that happen very soon so stay tuned and without aside if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you on the next one very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
