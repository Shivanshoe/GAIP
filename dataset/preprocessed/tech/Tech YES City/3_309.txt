hey bro thanks for this amazing opportunity for me to pick up
this pc bro thanks so much is it like what's this all about
oh yeah mate i'm actually dropping this off for my
friend um i'll just quickly let you talk to him on the phone
hey buddy how's it going nice meetup here's a pc here man
um tested about two years ago he was an absolute ripper
if you have any drama's then I am just down the street buddy oh hey guys i'm going to take this thing
back home right now and play some games on it in nature when the hoser takes advantage
of the hosie the hosie will then the hosed will then just type
in gg well played so you've just met someone at your local
gas station you've come home you've started to test
those used pc parts that you've bought from the said person but nothing's
working this is what i call a classical hosing
that is when you're promised something that would work
and it doesn't work or you just got scammed pretty much
this has happened to me in the past and when i've
asked for the money back i've just been ignored it's actually happened to me two
times in australia in 2016 when i got back
home and never again am i doing it ever again for
me once shame on you for me twice shame on me
and i guess the second time it was shame on me however
before we get into this video before we get into story time i'm gonna say
that there are some comments where people have had great experiences with
meeting someone down at the gas station and it works for them
aka down under the petrol station so uh part of tech yes city is a big part
of this channel is doing what works for you i'm only doing
what works for me and i'd say we're having a dandy old
time here with especially with the tech guests loving
around the channel here but straight away doing what works best for you is
always something i recommend i'm just here to
uh i guess elaborate on a piece of information that i said in one of my
recent videos where i said i no longer meet people at
the gas station and i don't recommend doing so
so let's roll that intro and let's go story mode around tech yeah city are you
ready let's go um excuse me but i'm in the market for a
b550 motherboard really if so azeroth's b550 itx phantom
gaming has you covered with the vrm capable of handling the latest 3950x
solid on-board audio from nahimic and also pcie gen
4 readily available links in description below to find out more
so in 2016 when i returned from japan i had already got hosed in japan over
the yahoo auctions which in ways yahoo auctions is
known in japan for basically just having no claim no return they're just
like a lot of the guys will just be selling out even a lot of time just
untested stuff so i wasn't really angry about getting
hosed in japan because it goes with the territory you're getting this stuff
super cheap a lot of the times even if the seller
says it works you're getting it for a ridiculously cheap price but
when i got back from japan there was two instances in 2016 when i had met
young guys as well young guys two young guys at the gas station
both times i got hosed and you know they look in the eyes
they i don't even know if these guys are just they think the stuff is
semi-faulty but someone can just bring it magically back to life
but the first time was an r9 280 and i bought this
from a guy at the gas station and i mean we did get a signal out of it the
problem was is when you tried to install a driver
the card was just it's gone it's not a working card so i messaged
the guy i said look can i get my money back dude
and he basically gave me that rundown of no the card was working when it left my
place so i'm not going to give you a refund
and so at this point in time you're just wasting your money on a 120
part that you most likely not going to get your money back from
so that's why the guy met me at the gas station the first time
the second time was actually a cpu it was like i think it was an i3
2120 i got off at 10 bucks but i mean it was just it was like i didn't care at
all but i met a guy at the gas station he said yeah this little i3 is going to
be great for a little pc put it out of a pc and it was working absolutely fine
got home tested out the i3 just kept shutting the whole system like the
motherboard just kept shutting off and that's generally it's rare like it's
actually a rare thing to get a faulty cpu but one that's
completely gone so that can happen especially if it's
been exposed to a bad switchboard a power supply is blown out or a lightning
storm but at the same time it was 10 bucks so
i just didn't even care but that was the second time i'd met someone down the
good old station and it was the second time that i'd got
hosed now here's where things get a little bit worse because this is only
my two experiences of being hosed down the good old station but i've had
people in australia message me personally and they said
brian i've been hosed for say an rtx 2060. i met someone down
the the gas station and they handed me an
rtx 2060 box quickly took my money when i got home
there was like a gtx 650 in the box or something like so they got completely
hosed on these deals and i mean in ways i
guess it's partially their own fault that they
didn't check over the whole product before they got it
but what's there to stop someone from putting in say a faulty rtx 2060 in that
box anyhow so it's very hard first of all to
validate parts when you're meeting someone down the good old station so
that's the reason i just don't do it when i'm going over to someone's place
to buy the part i'm going to go either check the part or
i know where they live so if i want a refund if i get the part
home and it just clearly doesn't work then i can take it back and get a refund
and so this is another story where i have been over to someone's place
before and they sold me i grabbed they actually came to me they messaged
me personally and they said brian i've got a deal for you an r9 270
and i was like cool like how much do you want for it they said 110 bucks
initially i said dude that's way too much for an r9 270. so
then they came back to me and they said look i'll do it for 70. i said okay it's
a fair price and this was i think it was like during a time when
graphics cards were getting sort of depleted they were
hard in stock so this guy was just around the corner from me about 10
minute drive so i quickly drove down to his place
and i was talking to him and i said dude like you know these parts work right
they're fine he's like yeah man they're all good old swear to god they
work they're fine and i said well when did you last test
them and they said oh like i tested them over six months ago so
when someone tells you that they tested parts
over a long time ago i would start really raising some suspicions on
whether that pc part works or not so straight away those alarm bells ringing
in my head i'm like okay well maybe this pc part doesn't
work at all and so i like okay like i said to him
look i know where you live so it's not going to be a problem basically
that's in the back of my mind so i took the pc part i gave him the
cash and then i got home and i didn't test it
that like i think it was like a little bit late at night like 8 p.m or
something and hey don't worry like the tech yes uh hustle
it's sort of like 24 7 kind of thing but i i got it home
the next day i i put it in a system just to i've got my test bench quickly booted
it up bang no signal got that b2 error
this card was just gone skis and so i messaged the guy and i said mate
you just sold me a dud card and he said i don't do he straight away his reply
was i don't do refunds sorry and i said to him what
like that's a weird reply to get from someone i don't
do refunds straight away i said this card i said this card doesn't work
you sold me a dud it wasn't anything else just like i
don't do refunds so basically what i said after that was i was like okay i'm
going to be returning this graphics card either the good way
or the bad way so i just rocked up at their place had the graphics card ready
to go and they came out they gave me a refund
so it was all fine and so that's the difference between meeting up at the gas
station and meeting at someone's place now did
the person intended the last case that last scenario did that person
intentionally hose me i don't know but all three cases where
i've had faulty parts being sold as parts that were working
all the time it's been young dudes maybe they're hungry for cash but that's
not the right way to get your cash you don't just completely hose people down
it's the wrong way to do it so i mean even if he didn't know if the part was
working properly or not he could have sold it as untested and
recouped some of his money so coming out of all this what's the
moral of the story basically it is if you can't validate
someone's credentials you either don't know where they live or you don't know
who they are or whatever then there's a high chance
that this person is going to hose you down so now we're going to go on to the
next reason though this one's an important one because i live down under
in australia and this one is the fact that australia
was basically a nation of convicts a couple of hundred years ago so those
grass roots are still within aussie to this
day so you've just got to uh learn how to sort of navigate your way
through the murky waters and now continuing on with the next
couple of stories these are even worse than what i've said before
but one of these just came in this morning a guy was looking for a gaming
pc from us he just told me that he had deposited 500 down
on an rtx 2070 super build that was on gumtree
and i said to the guys like whoa okay what happened and
he basically told me that he deposited money for this bill the guy was then
going to post it but then a few days later he's there's
no replies or anything he tried calling him
and he'd realized his number had been blocked he'd try calling on another
number the guy picks up the phone and then realizes it's him and then
blocks that second number so this is a scenario that i've heard in
the past as well and that is depositing money to people
who you don't know over the internet for say
goods that look legitimate i mean this guy might have this pc but he has
no intention of selling it and so i asked him about this the person selling
it and he said that the seller had no reputation or like no feedback and i was
like whoa okay take a step back there so
you're giving money to someone you don't know
and they've got no feedback so that straight away was
a recipe for disaster and i've heard this as well from
a guy that i bought two pcs off who when he he actually like this other guy
actually got these pcs but they were completely different and they just
didn't both of them didn't turn on at all
this was uh back over two videos that i've done over the last couple of months
poor guy said he bought him from a guy up north and even in the recent um
the 100 flip up challenge we looked at what had gone on with one of those pcs
where one of the hard drives have even been like raid petitioned
half its size it was just insane like what some people who are very
knowledgeable even people who are very knowledgeable in tech
will do to hose people down so after i saw that i was kind of like
bottom line is nothing's going to surprise me anymore when it comes to
people getting hosed but there are precautions
that you need to take and the reasons being is because
as i said in the gtx i made some video about this
there was this this video we made on the channel here where i was like don't buy
this graphics card and i just said like this is obviously a
scam and people like people were in the comments
and they were saying brian what if it's not a scam and it's like it's that
same line of thinking that gets you scammed in the first place
there's just simple protocol and that's what i'm following when i say i don't
want to meet people at the gas station it's all back to protocol because
there's no recourse there's no way for you to get your money back so same
with the bank deposit once you put that money in that person's account
there's generally no way of getting that money back i mean he the guy who spoke
to me this morning he did tell me that he was filing a thing with his bank
so hopefully in 2020 they've made some kind of
fair dispute round where he can hopefully get his 500 bucks back but i
said to him i was like dude there's little chance that you're going
to be getting your money back so just understand that even though you
and i think a certain way and we won't hose
people down there are people out there that won't
hesitate to hose people down and that's what
you've got to like coming out of this you've got to understand
that every human being on this planet is different and with that difference
comes a different way of thinking and so once you like
once you do that you'll understand that there's just protocol
ways of doing things that's going to stop you from getting host
anyhow guys that video as well that gtx whatever it was i think it was like a
1050 ti for 50 bucks that was uh that ended up being a scam
like people messaged me a few days later like yeah dude
um apparently this i think i think they might have saw the video like the
retailer might have saw the video and then crack down on it
on behalf of the customers so i think if you guys got your money back for that
like please let us know in the comments anyway other than that that's the story
of the gas station uh the worst i have been hosed for on a
pc part is that 120 bucks that was and that's
never coming back that 120 men it's gone forever
it's circulating out there in the economy somewhere someone's spending
those two 50s and a 20 that i put out there and i got nothing
for it i just got like actually i did get something for it
it was a negative too that's the thing not only are you getting hosed you're
getting hosed for your time too you wasted all that time so
you got double whammied when you get that so-called deal
so anyhow guys i'm going to be signing off with this video if you enjoyed this
one then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section
below your experiences with the gas station
getting hosed what not love reading those thoughts and
opinions as always well in this case i'm not going to really love reading these
thoughts and opinions they're not really good stories to be had
but at least if people can see what's going on out there they can
realize just even based off the comments uh to take these precautions and not get
scammed because one thing is for certain i love each and every one of you guys
out there especially if you're a tech yes citizen and you've hit that sub
button and rang that bell though with that aside we've got the
question of the day here which comes from a user called chaotic and they ask
i'm curious about what you do when you make multiple
offers like this video you made three offers on three gpus if
they all accepted do you get them all use the other two in
your pc parts hunts or only the best deal and use it for this series
um this is actually like really interesting because
usually like i'll just buy like if i've made offers down these gpus and they all
came back i just buy them all and that's because
i'm making offers that i know are sticking to that code of
discipline i guess this is that protocol thing we talked
about it's even coming into pricing and everything
you got to be disciplined and it's the most important thing it's the same with
prices so when i offer all that on those gpus i'm prepared to pay that
and so i'm going to stick to that and that's why you won't see me go on
cannonball and go on um stupid on prices like i won't overpay
for stuff because you're finding this actually i might
even have to make another follow-up video on this
is that locally here now i made a video saying prices were going to come down on
pc parts and at the time like people are like really really kind of
staying high but now we're seeing it it's coming down
and a lot of people are messaging me saying they can't sell their gaming pcs
and i said well it's it's all about balance it's all
about balance there's so much demand that demand's
going to go down and that's what's happening so
um basically the tying that all back is if you
don't get the good deals if you overpay for stuff
it's going to come back to bite you where you may even lose money on your
gaming pcs if you can't hold or of course if
something like rtx 3000 series is right around
the corner which it is and we don't exactly know what that's going to bring
100 yet but we already know that rtx 2000 series has
completely stopped production there's no more of those cards being
made which is tells you a lot base even if we're just
looking at on nvidia's behalf as a business that
should tell you a lot of uh what's going what's going to go on
anyhow guys i'll catch you another tech video very
soon peace out for now [Music] bye
