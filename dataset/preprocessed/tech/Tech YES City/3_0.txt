[Music] today we are going to try and sell some gaming pcs at a car boot sale in japan now this is also known as the free market or free market in nihongo or japanese and uh we've got four gaming pcs that i've built up where one of those gaming pcs are built up in 2019 and then three of them we built up this year and so i'm going to try and make a little bit of profit on them but uh this is going to be a first for me because the last time i went to a car boot sale was over a decade ago and most the time people are just selling t-shirts for 10 or fun packs for 20 and we're gonna be pulling out the real mccoy right here the gaming pc and then uh trying to sell it for some big bucks but you may also notice i'm wearing a blue shirt as well because blue signifies the color of trust and i mean buying a gaming pc from someone at a car boot sale i think trust would be right up there on the things that you're going to definitely need so uh we're going to document this process for you guys and see if we can get a sale today's video is brought to you by scd keys if you guys are looking for a legitimate single end user windows 10 or even windows 11 pro license key then it's as easy as clicking the link in the description below putting in that coupon code bftyc and you can get these keys for as little as 14 after that discount and once you get the key all you have to do is then copy it and then put it into your windows activation hit activate and you should be getting rid of that annoying watermark in the bottom right hand corner of the screen as well as unlocking more features within windows itself so i'll put those links in the description below let's get back to the video and here is our pcs right here i've made up spec sheets before i came to this event and you see here the prices as well i am pretty much asking around either ichiman or ichimon gorsen which would be around 100 us profit on each of these builds also this one right here since we did build it three years ago i'm not entirely sure if we're gonna make a profit on it or whatnot i mean i'm actually more so surprised that my ex didn't sell it that's actually surprising because the other pc for my boy that that got hocked [Music] [Music] so we've been doing this for a couple of hours now and there is some bad news on the gaming pcs and that is not one person has showed any interest in my gaming pcs on display here uh everyone seems to be buying just cheaper stuff here i mean the the ex and the boy they're they're doing really well they're selling off toys and and camping stuff and doing deals and i mean i'm helping them with that stuff because i think a lot of the people that have come to buy some of this stuff they uh it's it's funny because a lot of the people buy they speak english too so i was kind of doing a bit of support i was playing a bit of support on these deals and i i'm feeling kind of important even though i'm useless really when it comes to selling these gaming pcs no one wants a gaming pc so it's kind of like it's exciting but at the same time it's a bit of a downer so i definitely look like i'll have to find another avenue to sell these pcs uh even if someone's not even offering me a cost price but uh let's give it another few hours i mean we're here for another few hours but judging on the momentum already it ain't looking good fellas it ain't looking good this tech yes ship it is a sinking it's going down we're going down we're going down are we going down we're going down we're going down fellas the tech yes ship is sinking [Applause] [Music] and we're coming back with a bit of an update here it is now 15 minutes past two so there's another two hours and 45 minutes so we've been here for kind of about four over four hours now and i just haven't had one person not even look at the gaming pcs or even ask about them and i've kind of been like hey who wants a gaming pc like make an offer so what i'm doing now is just to see what's going on here i'm going to be like literally just putting these up for sale at a loss like so i've dropped i've dropped the prices down now uh literally like i think i'll be losing like a hundred dollars on each now nearly so i've just dropped the prices down to see if i can sell them and see if it's just anyone notices because yeah like this is my first time doing a free market and when it comes to selling gaming pcs it'll definitely be the last time so we've got a bit of a good news update there is about an hour and a half left before this whole place closes but there was one person who was interested with the price down so now he's said he's going to go away and think about it and he's interested in the smaller pc so the bigger one he was interested in that because the price was lower but then he said the other one was better the one we've got for about 200 and something 260 usd and he's interested in that because it's smaller so this is like crazy because this whole day we've only this is the first person who's like genuinely been interested in this pc we've had another two people an old man walked by and he was kind of like just looked at it and didn't really know what he was looking at and then a kid walked in and he kind of knew what he was looking at and then he went to his mom and his mom's just like no way i'm not buying you a gaming pc especially from a dude selling it at a free market that's probably like that's that's the feeling i got when i i was watching the kid talking to his mom that's uh that's the body language that that's the vibe i was getting the fingers crossed we can get one cell even at a loss [Music] and now we're coming back to you guys the next day with the results and that is it was a big fail for the free market in terms of selling gaming pcs and i do stress gaming pcs because even though we spent 15 dollars to set up this booth which was about two by two meters we had actually probably over thousands of people walking by our little stand and when it came down to me selling the gaming pcs i only really had four genuine inquiries the whole day so the conversion for gaming pcs was absolutely terrible if we were to sort of talk about this and say in terms of a youtube video it's like my video being exposed to say 2 000 people or 3 000 people and then only getting four clicks not even people starting to watch the video just people clicking on the video and so the conversion rates for that day were absolutely terrible but in terms of my boy and the ex they were selling quite a few things like they actually did quite well and they converted a lot of the stuff that otherwise if it went too hard off they would have got literally pennies on the dollar as opposed to them saying getting 25 or 50 percent for what they paid for that stuff so it can be really good for selling cheaper items but in terms of gaming pcs it's a complete miss so i'm not going to be trying it again and in terms of people out there probably say well brian you've wasted your time and money and this is where i'm going to counter and say try not to think about that in that way what i did was today i paid 15 to learn and if we were to say be a little bit harsh to a uni student they would be losing money to learn so that's kind of what i did here today even though i was kind of on the fence of making this video in the first place i wanted to share the journey with you guys because you guys said you wanted to see it in the comments and what i'll share with you guys is what i learned from yesterday's endeavor and that was if you want to go to a free market as a customer i would either go there first thing in the morning as soon as people open their shops or later in the afternoon before they're closing their shops i wouldn't go in the midday or the middle of the day because it's just the probably the most useless time to go so if you go there straight away you're going to be essentially picking up the cream of the crop all the best items that people may be selling at a really heavy discount and that's what i noticed there was a rush of people who came as soon as the place opened and actually picked a lot of things from not just our little booth but also all the other booths that were getting picked really hard but then during the midday it was just total silence people were going to the destination clothes stores they were going to the hairdresser or they were going somewhere else and they just weren't really looking at these free market booths that were selling stuff and this is when i decided to drop the prices of my gaming pcs because i just was getting no interest in the morning and i kind of wanted to see okay if i drop these prices to ridiculous levels would people be interested in buying them and this is where i was close to getting two conversions and it just didn't happen in the end the first person they weren't interested in the end of the day they didn't need the pc they wanted to get the smaller one but they said uh salman gorsan was just too expensive for that pc and so they flaked out and then the next person they offered only knee my end or 150 usd for that whole gtx 970 pc and i just said well i'm already losing money and at this price i'm just going to be losing more money and it's actually a really good deal at its price of niemann gorsan so i just said to them sorry i can't go that low and then they flaked out and they weren't interested so we had two really close sales but we didn't get there then the other two enquiries they're actually looking for more office pcs and i think actually of these four inquiries they were all looking for decent looking pcs that were reliable fast but they weren't really for gaming and so what i noticed was the four people the kid was different he was i didn't include him in an inquiry so maybe i got five people interested in terms of total interest so what this taught me was that people who go to these free markets are perhaps from older generations and they're sort of more looking for just items in general but their price ceiling is still there and so if i was to do this in the future i would definitely go with office pcs good looking office pcs say an i7 32 gigabytes of ram and maybe say stuff that i can't put into a gaming pc which is what i usually do in australia with say a second gen hp motherboard that doesn't support gravis cards but it still works absolutely fine and so this is a great opportunity to maybe bring your office pcs to these car boot sales and actually convert some sales because if i was to do this again that would be the one thing that i would try but i don't have any office pcs ready in japan they're getting back down to the story of going in the morning or afternoon as opposed to the tech yes deals which they started popping from midday so i was probably the only anomaly there the afternoon was what i noticed was a lot of stores were just starting to discount their stuff and actually discount it heavily to the point where i saw some people just like even their already low prices on stuff they were just dropping prices by 70 so they brought a lot of stuff to these free markets maybe personal items from their homes or factories or wherever they get the stuff from and they brought it there and they probably don't want to lug it back home and so they probably think okay i just want to get rid of this stuff at this point and i'm still going to make more money than going to a heart off and getting rid of my staff and so i thought there was actually some really good deals to be had at the later phase of the day just like there was in the early morning and with all that aside i hope you guys enjoyed today and yesterday's vlog of this free market sale i hope you guys did you definitely requested that you wanted to see it even though it was a fail for gaming pcs and you may be wondering would you do it again and definitely yes but i just wouldn't be selling gaming pcs that's all though the definite yes part comes from the fact that i just had a lot of fun the whole day just trying to talk to people trying to get sales and ultimately spending time with my son and the ex and we were just the whole day it was just laughs and giggles even though i was feeling a bit insecure that no one was looking at my gaming pcs but all that aside you win some you lose some at the channel here i always love to show you guys the fails just as much as i love showing off the successes that we have here at tech yes city and i think that in a nutshell just sums up life in general it's always going to have your ups and downs and it actually just i don't know maybe it wasn't actually a down for me because i had a lot of fun in the process and so even if you make mistakes in life and you're losing money from those mistakes as long as you're learning something from them then i don't feel like it's perhaps a mistake it might just be a lesson that you're learning and i definitely learned quite a few lessons from this free market sale and hopefully you guys enjoyed it in the process and do let us know in the comment section below have you been to a free market sale or a car boot sale before what was your experience like or do you want to go to one and haven't been to one or do you not want to go to one at all love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from demo fighter and they asked do you think they'll continue to build the desk mini and they're talking about asrock's desk meet video that we did yesterday i'll put the link up here and the desk mini is a real compact pc from asrock where you just add in your cpu your ram and some other components and you can make a really small form factor pc and i think azeroth will definitely continue the desk mini as i actually like it a lot more than the desk meet even though the desk meet is good value i think the desk mini is more of my favorite because it just has that real compact size and if you put in say an apu for example you can have a real small compact entry level gaming piece anyhow hope that answers that question if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll see you in the next tech video very soon peace out for now
