cyberpunk 2077 has finally been released and with everyone wanting to go online and play this game only one thing can come to my mind and that is i want to start building some pcs and stocking people up for this game and in the meantime we're going to be making a bit of money while we do this with the 100 flip up challenge and you guys are telling me this is one of your favorite things here at tech yes city so let's go through all the details on what has unfolded since the last episode because i've got to be honest with you guys straight away there has been a lot of new stuff coming through the channel here i've had to cover a lot of different products being super flat out busy and in the meantime i sold a second rtx 3080 pc so let's get into the budget and the juicy details of what unfolded today's video is brought to you by scd keys delivering you that retail single and user license key for only 12 bucks after you use the coupon code bftyc that's right this month only you can get a 30 discount using that coupon and link in the description below so recapping from the last episode here we came in with three pcs we had a 3080 pc a mid-range pc with a 90-70 and then a budget banger on the low end and we ended up selling all these pcs in the case of the 3080 we got three and a half thousand aud for that pc we've got 600 for the 970 pc so i got a little bit more than i intended with that one and then we got 400 for the budget one but we did have to add in a monitor and a keyboard and mouse and that cost us 45 to get that combo sold and we had 330 left over from the kitty but it was 285 after we spent that on the monitoring keyboard mouse and so that left us now with a total of 4 785 dollars and now i got my hookup in ipswich for the graphics cards and he messaged me out of the blue he said look i've got two 30 70s and one 30 80. i'll only sell you the 3080 if you buy the two 30 70s and i said to myself straight away i've got to go up there cop this 38 because rtx 3080s and then subsequently rtx 3080 gaming pcs are in real hot demand at the moment and so we picked up those three cards and i accidentally left my ad up on gumtree and i took it down on facebook for the 30 80 pc and i got another sale off the back of that add-on gumtree where i had it listed for 3 800 aussie dollars and then someone came in and paid asking price and they said look i'm keen on a 3080pc i want it right now i needed asap and i said to him well look i can't get the same nzxt case for you but i can get this case with good airflow and these are the cases that we've used in the past the gamdius athena's they're actually got four fans pre-installed but i decided to put a liquid cooler on the i7 10 700 f and the person that picked it up was absolutely over the moon with the pc not just in the performance but how it looked the noise etc and it really goes to show that if you do pick your parts with pcs really carefully you can put together some really good value and still get something that looks amazing and performs amazing and so that's what part of the series is is about getting that discipline and then essentially giving the best value to people but still making money in the process and so what that left us with was the cost of those graphics cards were 3250 aud for the 230 70s and the 3080 these were the colorful advanced models i got two advanced models and also one eye game in white aesthetic and then i still had to go out and outlay the costs for that bill because we had 1535 aussie dollars left over i then use 1258 of that to then build that 3080 pc out and sell it and i had to add a windows 10 key pro on that so that left us with 277 and we got that 3800 and we still had two 30 70s so we now have a budget of four thousand and sixty one dollars and two rtx 3070. so we're in such a good place where i then got out the components that are on the table here which then comes to five 2500 and thirty two dollars and we've got a double scd keys windows 10 pro key that we can buy and that brings us up to two thousand five hundred and sixty aussie dollars for the costs which leaves us now with two rtx 3070 pcs on the table and 1481 aussie dollars so with that tally aside let's build up our 30-70 pcs and then look at the specs and then look at how much we intend to flip these pcs for going into christmas now in terms of the giveaway the 3080 giveaway that's coming in another couple of days as well don't worry i've managed to secure a 3080 giveaway pc and it's going to be awesome so stay tuned and you're going to see how i did it as well this is what we call tech yes hustle baby bye put your hands up in the air [Music] and the two pcs are now complete and i've listed the first one and it's got all the rgb bling i've also run it through a heap of stress testing in cyberpunk and made sure that it's actually good to go and play this game and one thing that i'm surprised about and i will be doing a full dedicated guide towards cyberpunk and the best settings and all the different quality settings in fps but one thing i found is that dlss 2.0 does work really well on the quality setting on this game and that's now a draw card that i can use in the advert when i go to sell this pc and also wanted to test the temperatures out on this case as well as the noise and surprisingly the gamdius athena ram 1 case i've been using this in some of my flips in the past it does a really good job in terms of balancing out the temperatures and the noise from the get-go and so i found that my parts weren't going over 70 degrees c both the gpu and the cpu and as you guys probably know and like the 20 other videos we've done recently i have been stressing that my ambient temperatures are a little bit warmer than you're probably used to seeing on most channels so in other words this 70 degrees is actually a really good number in relation to this build those cyberpunk aside and fps aside you guys are probably wondering brian how much are you going to flip these things for and what are you going to do going forward and this game actually came out at a perfect time because i had just finished all this backlog of stuff that we had to get through here on the channel and then this game came out and i've got these pcs ready to build it's like a perfect combo now one thing you're going to see with the flip up challenge is always take advantage of what the trend is going through jump on that and if you can make a dollar to make your own gaming pc better or make a dollar to save some money for yourself and do other things outside of pc gaming then definitely go do that so this is cyberpunk 2077 this is the latest trend coming through and i'm definitely going to be selling pcs based around that because i think a lot of people at least from what i'm seeing they're going to be buying a pc and even at 1080p not getting the fps they want and after that they're gonna like well i've got to upgrade my pc and then they've got an rtx 3000 system waiting the adverts got ready to go you're beating the retailers as well this is one thing people come with my comments they're like brian you're making profit and they're hating on me for making profits like man i'm saving the person money as opposed to them going out to a retailer especially some of the local ones that are renowned for ripping people off i'm saving them money and in the process i'm making money so that transaction for me i'm happy with that but a lot of you guys out there already know what this series is about it's about making magic happen you're probably wondering what's the magic plan so i'm going to test the waters with these 30 70 pcs we built them for about 2 thousand two hundred dollars because the graphics cards costed about eight hundred and ninety dollars each for the 30 70s and then we outlaid a little bit over twelve hundred dollars for the rest of the system and so what i think with the pc and because it looks so good and the photos came out so well and the build and the temperatures and everything else is really good to go and the specs are very high i think i can go for around 2 900 on each of these pcs so hopefully we can make around 700 profit on each of these flips and then that'll give us a very strong position going forward into the next episode we've already got 1400 left over in the kitty but because of the way the market's moving right now i'm finding that for instance those other two builds in the last episode they took me a long time to flip and the 3080 build was actually quite quick and i even sold a second 3080 build and so i'm just seeing i'm constantly gauging the market and seeing where the demand is and so there's actually quite a bit of demand on the high end right now and so i'm going to be trying to work my magic there but that is based on one factor and that is actually getting the cards now the 3080s they're in really hot demand i'm going to talk to my guy up at ipswich and see what i can do or see what he can do me he has been getting the colorful cards in and pretty much only those because the rest of the models are going through traditional retail channels and they're pretty much booked out so him having this avenue where he's getting these colorful cards in and a lot of people in australia are like oh like they've got a kind of like a brand phobia thing going on they're like oh i don't want to i don't know what a colorful card is i don't want to touch it me i've tested these cards out they're absolutely fine i'm like yeah let's start moving this stuff we've got warranty on it and that's the main thing right these pcs with the new side i've also got warranty on them so with some of the used parts i did get hosed recently the 7850 that i got on parts hunt that was separate to this challenge but that was like that's what's happening with the used market and actually a few months ago i said in the gas station video that we did i'll put the link up here i did warn this and i should have taken my own advice but i did warn that as times get tougher in the economy there's going to be a lot more of this hosing and scamming going on so from now on i'm pretty much i'm getting verification of if i'm buying used parts now i'm getting verification that they work if i don't get verification they work i'm not going to buy them i'm just going to leave them sitting there because the amount of hosing i'm just seeing it the amount of hosing that's going to start happening in the next year especially on used parts is only going to go up but the last thing i want to talk about right now is jumping into cyberpunk first impressions man this game is really exciting it's a huge world i'm getting into the story as well i did have one critiquing point but i'm not going to spoil it if you guys haven't played it yet it's a really good game and i'm loving it so far but keep in mind it is one of those games that i feel does require very heavy hardware to run it's not a game that'll run on the usual hundred dollar potatoes that we do here on the channel so if anything hopefully this series is helping you guys out in your own lives and you can say hey if i put this together i can make a little bit of money here build myself up a better gaming pc because that's one thing i've always loved doing around tech yeah city is showing you guys how you can make a buck on the side or use your knowledge and your talent to make some gaming pcs up and make a better profit and i know some people out there will
