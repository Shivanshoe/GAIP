in times of uncertainty you can be certain about one thing and that is a cheap Windows 10 Pro key licensed for as little as 15 bucks using the coupon code TYC SK you can quickly and easily get rid of that annoying Windows needs activation message in a few simple steps links in description below in the world at the moment there is a lot of uncertainty going around to the point where at least in Australia here people are buying out of all things toilet people that's right if you are in a apparently a zombie apocalypse where you need supplies the first thing people can think of is a toilet roll not canned food or stuff that lasts a long time on the shelves toilet paper that's right because the most important thing you can do in a recession is wipe your bum this is right in Australia here we have sold out of toilet paper even before things like canned food which are still readily available on the shelves people are buying our toilet paper frantically and desperately now apparently this originated from Japan due to a false rumor on social media but this comes back to one thing and an important thing before we go forward with this video and that is do your own research even though this video today I'm going to be presenting my research I always employ you guys whenever you make big decisions I mean not that buying toilet paper is a big decision but always do your own research I did my research and I found out toilet paper supply is going to be absolutely fine here in Australia that's not really going to be affected a whole lot so I didn't rush out to the stores and go by frantically but now this all ties back to one question I've been getting asked a lot lately and that is should I buy a gaming PC or basically should I wait out and will things get better however in order to answer this question we're going to go through a few different scenarios with you guys here today but make no mistake this is the first time we have been in a situation like this and sure we have seen other illnesses in the past that do have similarities to the virus that we're talking about today but none have had the economic impact that this virus has already had and so one thing that we can draw from this already is that consumer behavior is one thing that can be unpredictable in an unpredictable event I don't know how people are going to respond to this just like we saw with toilet paper I would have never have imagined for example the people would have thought of all things toilet paper at least over long shelf-life canned food however that was a scenario that happened so the first thing we can ascertain is we don't know how people will react to buying gaming pcs in this current scenario however I will say one thing and add to that and that is the gaming PC market itself at least building one is still quite a niche at least when we compare it to the likes of a tablet or a smartphone or a laptop I would say those other three products I just mentioned are more likely to suffer from panic buying than gaming PC components to build a PC however that being said we're going to look at now two of the most important things we're actually the most two important things with trading and buying products and that is supply and demand now with supply we know for a fact that production has come to a halt in some areas of China it slowed down drastically in other areas and it seems like at least the good news coming out of that now is at least from an article I'm reading here is that Foxconn which is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer they're pushing to bring back full production by the end of March and so if they do that then hopefully all the other manufacturers will start following suit and do the same though that being said there's already that damage that's been done in the mean time where that's going to flow through to the whole world economy essentially because everybody in every part of the world pretty much relies on Chinese imports for their economy to keep going at a hundred percent so the supply of PC components we know at least in the best case scenario has already been affected quite substantially however we don't know going forward is that going to be disrupted again because it seems like China has shifted their stance from closing borders down interstate to opening them up and getting their economy running up to full speed again however if the particular virus does get worse will they then close borders again nobody knows that answer so going forward we know for a fact that supply has been affected in the world of electronics if you guys don't know who Foxconn are a quick example would be those sockets on motherboards Foxconn pretty much make the majority of those so if they stop production of things like motherboards sockets for example then motherboards just simply aren't going to be shipped period and now we're going to move on to the most controversial part in today's video or at least in my opinion and that is demand and so we look at demand basically what we've got here is a market that we don't know what's going to happen in however my argument is that demand is at least or at the very least going to remain constant and the reason for this being is because if we look at the worst case scenario in the world right now that would be a zombie apocalypse right that would be the worst case scenario people just need to get food they just need to survive and things are very limited the economies come to a complete halt but that is also at the same time the most unlikely scenario what we're looking at is a full working normal economy worst-case scenario we're looking at something in between now anywhere in between that people are most likely going to stay home more and we're already seeing this in pretty much everywhere in the world events are being canceled markets have a lot less follow-through traffic a lot less customers in general so basically more people are staying home and so when people stay home they're going to need entertainment at least above that worst case scenario which is the zombie apocalypse so in that case they're going to need things like TVs smartphones laptops and of course you guessed it a gaming PC and so the question you have to ask yourself now is do you have a good gaming PC and are you happy with your gaming PC and I'd say most of you guys probably are or do you have intentions to build a gaming PC very soon if you have the intention to build a gaming PC very soon then you may wish to build now because things are going to be uncertain going forward and now another thing we can look at too to add into this demand debate is also the prices of products right now they haven't really gone up a whole lot I believe looking at the price trends here SSDs have gone up slightly but Ram graphics cards all that other stuff CPUs and motherboards they all still have pretty good price tags on them that are at pretty much historical lows so from what I can see here is that we've got a supply that has been disrupted and so that means we're going to basically have lower supply at the very least in the next few months best-case scenario demand we're looking at either a constant level of demand or an elevated level of demand due to more people wanting to stay home so with those two powers combined even Captain Planet could tell you that the prices will go up though the last thing now is to throw a curveball into this whole equation that's right this camera right here whenever I record on this one it is known as the curveball camera and so the curveball argument here is that what if people lose jobs and then they can't afford a gaming PC will that in turn bring the prices of components for gaming pcs down and to answer that one that is a possible scenario definitely especially some of the companies that sell components that have heavy amounts of loans and debts where they need to constantly sell products otherwise they'll go bankrupt however that being said most retailers and businesses will want to keep making a profit and at the moment with the current prices of gaming PC components the prices are already very competitive and I know this because I do speak to quite a few industry contacts so I guess banking on the fact that prices would come down wouldn't be as likely as the previous scenario that we discussed in today's video and on top of all that if you live in a country like Australia where prices are tied to US dollar even though we trade in Aussie dollars when the Aussie dollar gets we car that means prices usually go up as wealth so we're also faced with an additional factor that could make prices go up as opposed to people in the US if the US dollar gets stronger that could actually make components come down for you folks over in the US of A so coming out of this video I can only tell you with a hundred percent certainty that no one will be certain on what the prices and what the market will be like in two months time however we can just basically make some calculated guesses to say that well if prices are decent right now and you can afford to upgrade your PC or of course you want to build a new gaming PC then doing it now may be a better choice than facing the uncertainty that is to come and with all that out of the way we're going to now relate all that back to the main question and that is should you go out and buy a gaming PC right now and that basically comes down to the question of do you need a better gaming PC but at the same time I've even said this in the past I can have a lot of fun even on something that's like a 60 Hertz monitor and a hundred to two hundred dollar gaming PC and I guess in point that is why I do a lot of use price performance here on the channel and so if you're looking to build a new PC and the prices are too high always consider what you can get on the use market for instance in the previous video we did a roundup of used GPUs to get right now and you can save a lot of money and get the best price performance for your dollar if you go down the used route the one thing I know for certain is that PC gamers we're pretty smart and we're pretty switched on we already survived the GPU cryptocurrency mining craze where that sent the GPU prices up through the roof we came out of that one relatively unscathed and will come out of this one without too much scuffing in the process and without a side I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comments section below what do you think about the future going forward in relation to gaming PC parts or even just in relation to the future going forward in general love reading those thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of thoughts and opinions we go the question of the day which comes from Noah Zhang and this ties in perfectly with today's video because they're talking about a use graphics card and they asked get a gtx 1070 or a 1070 TI and compare it to these if it's really worth paying 250 to $100 more and they're speaking about yesterday's video where we looked at five different used GPUs and they're all good price performance but they want to know is the 1070 a better buy only use market then say for instance an rx 580 gtx 1070 or a gtx 970 or an i-9 390 x and we were going to do a dedicated video on the 1070 because they are readily available they are actually a very popular card on the used market because a lot of people bought them up when they were first release so mass sold on the new market also means it will be mass sold on the used market and this card could offer some seriously good price performance so stay tuned for that video and also if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content around tech yes City then you know what to do and I'll catch you in the next Tech video very soon peace out for now bye
