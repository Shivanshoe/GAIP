Here I am guys welcome to my new studio
here, and I'm actually at the rocket jump ninja studio and we are going to be testing
out budget eBay and Aliexpress gaming mice (under $10) because over the last Lake every
time I collaborate with rocket jumping in G you guys request hey please take a
look at cheap mice like are they any good
can we actually get some frags with these things and this is the thing here
today we are like legit going to try use these things tell you the pros and cons
of each of them I mean that's if they have any pros and tell you if they're
worth buying or not so pretty much let's get into the contestants here we've got
the g10 raster Pro gaming mouse kind of looks like it's a ripoff of fanatic sort
of like fan tech or something and then this one here red dragon this one I've
actually got some hope and promise for because it looks like they're using
decent gear in there like a vago red dragon keyboards as well I know for a
fact they're really good and you got Omron switches in there so it looks like
it's got quality from the get-go but then we've got this one here I don't
even like some of these I have to pull up the listings and show you what they
were because they just like no-name brands that look half decent so I bought
them up this one is like literally like aji 203 ripoff and it came in a generic
white box here and same with this one this is like a razor kind of like a
death out of rip off in a generic box and then this one here is actually a
budget keyboard mouse combo that I actually sell with a keyboard mouse
monitor combos so it's really basic but I've used this already and I can say
it's like actually a half decent little entry Mouse and here we are now with the
king of mice reviews rocketjump ninja aka zai and what do you think going into
this comparison about cheap gaming mice okay we're gonna be completely serious
about this I'll just take you down here I'll give you a bit of a come with me
cameraman down here but looking at the must now alright quick to it this one is
Auto garbage this one all say garbage this one
garbage this one still garbage and I won garbage
so I've tested them out thoroughly and that is my conclusion we haven't even
tried them yet to be actually need to well yes we've got to give them a proper
fair go because it's just I don't know maybe people will like look I don't want
any brand tax because there's always gonna be brand tax with Logitech or
razor etc what if there is a guy who gets access say for instance gets access
to whatever the pots load you check it getting and implements something very
similar but so you're asking me whether this cheap knockoff yes it's actually
gonna be good at all could be like like and you're not doing it as like a joke
earning this is Sarah yeah I like I'm serious you really think this might be
okay people have hounded us for years like we
have to try this and give it a proper wrong that's all okay see if they can
see if we can change our minds I will try to be open-minded yeah it's not a
norris mouse after further consideration there's still garbage
you still haven't tried them though fine let's try them now
[Music] so the first order of business is we're
going to try these Mouse out in a quake live its quake live yep and that's gonna
basically tell us because rocketjump ninja has a lot of experience of quake
is it what over 55 years now okay 56 years of experience in quake and he's
gonna be able to tell you if these mice like if he can actually hit shots in
them and I'm gonna be versing him as well I'm gonna be the guy putting him to
the test so if I'm being any good on the eBay gaming mice then you know they're
[Laughter] so here it is here first up explore a
2000 SL the cable doesn't even reach I mean that's like what do you expect uh
five bucks on the cable so it's not really grating yes it's
moving after I remove it facets lagging yeah so yeah we've got a laggy Mouse the
first the five-dollar Mouse is free input lag like you're getting it as a
bonus added into your mouse so like basically the input lag is gonna stop
you from using this properly anyway regard so but I mean can you frag
with it that's the thing this first Mouse I can frag with
anything like I mean okay so like if you're if you've only got 5 bucks and
you want to know if you PC gaming is for you like let's yeah Wow ok so you can
still aim with us like you can actually still aim ok with it so maybe all she
needs a bit of input lag as if like if it's a stepping stone is the main focus
I mean not really you don't really want to get used to a mouse it's not going to
perform at a decent level even for 5 dollars I mean unless you're really
desperate you can't really see it maybe on the footage but there's a lot of
stutter in the sensor there's also an input delay and actual lag on the sensor
so yeah look I can hit shots and we'll get to that in a second but rocket
jumping is a chore it's really hard to actually get a proper movement proper
flick but it's not impossible so yeah look you can use pretty much any
Mouse but should you and do you really want to probably not let's see if I get
around see the thing is I think this guy's name
he doesn't realize where the actual guys who a clown let's head shops completely plain listen
quick kind of just preparing right so your recommendation with this one
basically is save your firebox like save up definitely save up for at least a $10
Mouse so let's let's get under the $10 [Music]
so next up here we've got the what is this thing called home pong Sund and
yeah it's gonna play around with this I think this one is 10 bucks around that
price point so let's see if the $10 Mouse does any better than the $5 mil so this one's gonna be much better it's
very much to death out of shape but in the medium size range so smaller
DeathAdder they've had a V - actually they've got the shape of the mob on the
side on the right some people will know what I mean by that it's notice there's
some tracking issues the sense is not amazing only thing it is usable at 60
Hertz which I assume people would be using if they're buying these mice they
probably wouldn't really notice it but on 240 Hertz like I am right now it's
definitely noticeable the good thing is that the sensor seems to be holding up I
can actually rock a jump unlike the last one so this is this could be the
until they're ready didn't say fire audio $50 Mouse yeah I am actually
feeling pretty comfortable with this one other than you know obviously the
weights the cables not very flexible and all the modern advancements that I'm
very much history I am missing but that said like I can still give this suit
silver try I can move around properly I can actually hit shots I mean it's jump
right at him I mean it is but it's no complete cabo okay so the last mouse was garbage that
was thrown out a week ago this was thrown out about two days ago still
garbage just how long has it been rotting no it said it's two garbage all
garbage is bad just some is not as rotten as the other
garbage I mean if I can hit another shot yeah
I ain't Ricky he's actually solid cement here boys work it okay
take that so even with the input latency on the mouse which I'm sure is that
nowhere near as bad as the other one you can still hit some decent shots and
actually plow right so there you have it with the Hong Suns that like honestly it
didn't do too bad I mean for rocketjump to say that's like not bad I guess it's
a really good thing for budget enthusiasts so our friend a clown mode
he left unfortunately due to technical difficulties we've now got goatee Botti
and he's our subject like we need a player against Zeiss as I can get some
practice and stuff anyway we've got the g1 o to rip off here what's this called
yes the s900 has got doesn't even look like
'srgb it just was like lights placed in particular spots in the mouse which I
guess you couldn't call it RGB maybe but anyway let's get onto this mouse and see
if it passed any chest now I think this one is around the same price as the Hong
Son as well things around 10 bucks so we're going to get into this and see
what sayest thoughts are on mouse number three it is I mean this sensor is very
much similar to the last one but on this one I feel like there's some delay and
we're never going to check this because it's not worth the investment of time
but yeah I mean compared to the first one this is way better like compared to
the second one not so much pretty much every problem you can think
of with mice these have but they're usable so the feet are not going to be
as good the cable is not gonna be as long or as good as flexible soft etc
these sensors are not going to perform as smoothly so even just turning like
this right there you see that it's kind of
jerky you won't be able to see it on the footage you can definitely see it on 240
Hertz but as I said 60 Hertz you probably won't care there's also going
to be latency as I was talking about that's a beautiful shot step into my crosshair I don't have to
move the mouse oh yeah so the delay on this I can definitely feel something
wrong with it the weight doesn't feel right first kind of unbalance - so just
a lot of little issues it's not that they're unusable and yeah if you're good
enough you can play with pretty much anything but I mean once you get used to
good gaming loss you're not going to go back to these things you'll sell your
kidney before you go back to these things [Music]
so this next one we've got it's called a fan tag now you even get an authentic
unboxing experience right here like wow it doesn't look half bad
this is the nicest of the lot it's called the g10 yeah wait can we the G
the raster g10 okay this one I think honestly quite just by the looks if
we're going by judging a book by it's cover we're gonna say this one's order
number four is looking like the lucky score for those people on a budget that
we'll see and our friend gotee bo t he is still around as well
he's not leaving he's like look we're gonna help you test these myself so
thank you mister gotee bo t okay so this one is actually pretty interesting the
shape is quite good it's a SteelSeries sensei shape but a bit smaller so i
guess more like the team 3 mini but a bit bigger than that the cable is long
enough as we said which is great it's a different sensor and you can make this
one spin up very easily as you see that it cannot track fast movements it
doesn't feel like it has to delay like the last one though so I'm happy to play
with it in that sense I just have to slow my game down because since I'm in
for fast it's not gonna track someone get a kill here the weight is
still pretty high he's gonna kill me here he goes so again not unusable but also not
something I'm going to recommend I mean how much one how much was this one so
you're saying that number two is still the Hong Son still if you had to pick
one of these four so far I would still be picking that first I mean that second
one yeah say the Hong Son whatever it is for my set up there obviously I need the
longer cable so but I was record jumping with the Hong Hong and despite the
sensor issues at least it wasn't spinning out like this one was other is
I should say I should hit I'm pretty sure there's some pretty bad input delay
on the buttons too in quick life can be pretty annoying boats so basically in a
nutshell this rat g10 raster it it looks good cables good old decent by the end
the day the sense is kind of letting it down I think that's the main issue that
I'm pretty sure there's going to be some other issues too with the input delay I
would say maybe 20 milliseconds that I guess there's something that just
definitely doesn't feel right what I'm trying to eat Chuck's like that but
somehow here - anyway like I said you can play with pretty much anything if
you're me so you're saying you can play with the
Microsoft Apple you know those bricks like absolutely
I thought the Hobby was good never tried one next collaboration we're doing we're
putting that you guys aren't enough you've seen this Mouser heard of this
mouse this thing was made like and it was over ten years ago and it was like I
seriously tried playing arts yes was at one time I could not move like this
thing was just losing games for me so I'm gonna put rocket jump to the test
next time we do use this mouse like do do a collaboration
[Music] it's in there are their weights in the
yeah we want to get it does it tell you how maybe just rattle it
so here's mouse number five this is the red dragon which by default has weights
in it but we can't like we're trying to get the thing open to take the weights
out but you twist it and it doesn't like come off you have a screwdriver we'll
just pry it off okay so first thoughts on this mess the actual buttons like
it's got thousands of extras and they're bound to really silly things by default
unless someone's changed them so one is show desktop which is really annoying
another one I think it's tab I mean a might be okay in some situations but not
really so first of all the buttons are just too easy to hit they're not well
positioned it's a massive like this thing is huge
taking up my entire palm so I can exceed that all right back to game it's like an
extended Death Adder and in no good ways I think Brian just said it was a laser
sensor and the good thing about that is laser sensors don't spin out
well not easily so that's making a cheaper Mouse you probably do want a
laser sensor but in a more expensive Mouse then you definitely want optical
because the problem with the laser one is they pretty much all have issues like
delay and if not delay then bad jitter and all kinds of things but it's
playable I'll give it that I don't mind the sensor so much it's just obviously
the weight is bad with all the weights in it's just massive it feels like my
like my channel is all about finding a narrow grip width and this is just as
wide as wide can be so even for a larger hand it's not going to be great for
aiming unless your hand is super massive in which case you'll be hitting all
these extra buttons by accident constantly so this mask pretty much not
made for anyone maybe a kid who doesn't know any better but other than that I
can't imagine anyone wanting this Mouse at all so basically what you're saying
is the Hong Son at a cheaper price point is still winning yeah it actually is day
the five the five like eBay and Aliexpress gave me - right there like
that's we try to eat them out it looks like we've got a champion of the gun the
garbage - yeah yeah I agree with that verdict but we do have a special
contender because then me being on my channel I do focus on use price
performance and stuff like that we've got a special guest that's gonna come in
to this comparison which I believe this mouse is like 13 years old now the g9x
now I got this mouse from the viewer who's sending the red dragon actually
sent us in this old mouse that said you know try and clean off some of the mice
and this was filthy to the point where I had to literally chuck out the whole
outer shell on it and and that was okay because this is what the pur Starcraft 2
players use in their competitions without the shell and everything but I
did need to get some new feet for it which is like three dollars so let's
take a look at this used g9x can do well hey I mean it just may be an option for
those on a budget we want to get the best so now we've revived the g9x it is
back in business with some new mouse feet and those mouths feet are working
fine yeah sorry okay let's give him some time quality time with I mean coming
into this this would be my pick it that the shape does feel really nice on the
g9x so this might look cool but it's
actually not and I'll show you why in a moment
that's just that's a flick it spun out very easily it snowed Mouse I guess we
can't expect too much and Brian said he liked the shape I mean I get the appeal
but this has really bad boating side something Logitech and known for and I
would definitely change the sides on this mouse and I think I can feel just
there I don't think that's a good place for the left-click sorry
it's cool that they were trying new ideas and I really don't want to judge
the mouse too harshly because it is so old and it takes time to actually figure
these things out but I mean if you think about this in the year 2021 beyond
I would say definitely not they're way better my
but even similar to this that will outperform it in every possible way
except maybe the extra buttons not you can get better ones is the home is the
home sunbathing the g9x yes it is sorry if you noticed I didn't really spin that
other Mouse out this one I'm feeling like I have to be really careful and the
sense is just so jittery and I think it's a laser sensor so old laser senses
really not great actually even new laser senses really not great but this
definitely look great you can actually play with the new a
laser senses I just got input delay because they got smoothing on them but
this one yeah it's just I would never use this in a game I was even remotely
competitive in it's so Chaturthi so I can't get smooth
motion look at that that's terrible your contrast that's a new sensor laser
sensor old laser sensor versus new so it's just smooth slow movement all over
the place and now we have an actual game going great anyway verdict on this one
not good definitely some things to like about the mouse I can see why it had
such a fan club at the same time I mean it's just too old now we've had so many
good advancements with mice you just wouldn't use this I mean that was a
spinner just there and it wasn't even that extreme [Music] so I finished up playing on the g10
roster and also the Hong Son and I think one are basically with the shape one
suited more towards a palm group but that would be the Hong Son and then the
GTN roster suited more towards a claw or fingertip grip off and then it's a bit
smaller so naturally I gravitated towards the g10 roster admittedly I
don't play quake like never so it's a different sort of game I notice things I
as really he does a lot of quick major movements so having a sensor that
performs is really important to him but regardless I've been watching him I
thought both the mice work okay I mean I did notice a little bit of input lag on
both of them but other than that I thought like the buttons like the clicks
were okay the shape was decent for me personally I'd say for 10 bucks they'd
both be goers out of the 5 Mouse that we had here off eBay and I'll Express so
basically gonna say that the g10 raster in the Hong Sun there okay
I definitely personally step it up to like aji 203 or aji 102 which can be had
for 20 bucks if you can afford it or step it up to a Razer DeathAdder which
can be had for around $20 as well there there BMO my pics for entry level gaming
mice because I guess there's always something that's being skimped out with
these mice at $10 whether it's the sensor or the the chip you know the
micro controller they're using on board something's always gonna give at this
price point and so at least a twenty bucks you're getting something that's a
great entry-level mouse that will still may even be your final choice so the
verdict is these ones are so terrible in too many ways that I just can't even
bring myself to recommend them these two on the other hand somewhat possible I
mean for $10 I guess you can get away with it but I would also recommend you
saving up double that $20 you can actually get a Logitech g10 - of
sometimes when it's on special especially and that's actually a top
tier Mouse so if you just save your money for a little longer you don't need
to deal with the problems that these print you can actually get a proper
Mouse for a great price so there it is guys with cheap no-name
branded eBay and Aliexpress mice you guys have been hounding me for years now
to get something like this done with rocketjump inja and it's finally here
and the verdict I guess is that two of the five mice were possible but really
just save up that little bit extra and get something that is properly made from
the sensor to the chip to the build quality and you'll just be having no
like problems or not knowing if you need to do more if something's skipping out
is rocketjump demonstrated in a lot of these mice in quake remember you your
gaming mouse when it comes to PC gaming there are two really important things
and that is your monitor and also your mouse and you want to make sure that the
both of them are pretty good for instance if you've got to monitor with
huge input lag that's going to be costing you games if you've got a mouse
it's crap that's going to be costing you the W as well so that aside we are going
to get on out of here we've got a mouse pad as well video coming up a lot of
people have been requesting that too so we'll be looking at especially a brand
called artisan where I bought as i some artisan mouse pads when i was in japan
and so that video will be coming soon so stay tuned for that you can hit the sub
button ring the bell T at the moment the videos drop also if you're seeing this
on my channel take your city and go check out as I over at rocketjump ninja
the YouTube channel and subscribe to him if you are interested in gaming mice big
thanks to him for letting me come over and do this collaboration too and
basically in terms of the question of the day this video was pretty much one
big question so hopefully that answered that and I'll catch you guys in another
tech view very soon don't forget to hit that like button on the way out and also
let us know in the comment section below what you think of cheap gaming mice
isn't your thing or would you rather spend the extra Lovering if those
opinions as always and we'll see next time peace out for now buddy
