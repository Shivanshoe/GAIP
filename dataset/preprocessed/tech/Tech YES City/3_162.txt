live testing one two we'll just wait for someone to come and chat and be like yo the live stream's working that could also be one of you guys as well so are you live now yeah it should be live now so all right let me try and find it everything works out we are we have a special for you guys today this is uh upcoming australian pro gamer rainbow six siege we're joined by rayne aka digital and i've always uh yeah so introduce yourself to the audience um my name's digital um in-game and my name's rayne wright out of game and yeah i'm a professional player for chiefs uh in rainbow six siege awesome uh and then we're joined by also corey from designs by ifr and i think you guys know who he is if you've been watching recently but we'll let corey uh take away with his own intro here what's going on guys make sure you like make sure you subscribe by the way we're from the designs wi-fi channel we build custom pcs let's get it so carry live stream for you as well four weeks yeah yeah so people are joining chat it's all good as long as the audio is out of whack uh-oh that's not good so i tested the audio beforehand so it should have been good so if the audio isn't good then something's off so if we listen back it should be okay hopefully the audio isn't working out of whack hopefully it's all good because we got a big stream here which is surrounded by the recent video we did on the nvidia reflex where i noticed the biggest difference was on the 60 hertz monitors and then uh we got the opportunity to to hook up with with rain and ask him some questions about the ah is it repeating it have you muted your screen uh yeah i'll just check make sure i mute it oh i yeah i have that's okay that's bizarre okay so it's yeah it is if it's a repeating problem then we've got to fix that up so is it just the one person that has that problem or is it everyone i mean no so what happens is it reverbs back through the stream so i've got to make sure that that doesn't happen uh it seems perfect for me okay oh you're listening back and it's yeah yeah okay yeah that's good for myself okay now people want the audience oh yeah i mean something might have happened there i think i fixed it i did mute the actual stream stream so should be all good so it's all good we can yeah hopefully there's no more technical difficulties because we've got to get down to the juicy details here and that is the pro gamer so the story that i'm always interested in with the pro gamer is not the uh okay so you're the pro right you're making the plays now you've got all the good gear uh but i'm interested in more so the the beginnings the the grass roots you're starting out and you you i guess you just started playing rainbow six siege what mouse do you have what keyboard do you have what monitor do you have and what specs are in your pc uh just enlighten us so suspects now what special i have now no when you started out oh when i started out so i had a um pretty bad pc when i first um got into gaming i didn't like splurge all my money i had like a an i5 uh 4440 um and just like literally like ddr3 ram like eight gigs um a 660 ti and i was playing on a sixty hertz one and uh because i used to play on playstation so um my hurts my um specs are really bad um and and trying to to like play competitively as well um obviously all those people that have like better specs have a bit of an advantage over you um so yeah like um what we're talking today like the nvidia reflex something like that can um really help out those uh i don't know uh on a low end pc yeah well i i mean that's the thing so we're talking about the nvidia reflex and that's what i noticed from the video where nvidia sent you over an rtx 3060 now is that right yeah yeah okay so big thanks to nvidia for doing that i mean look i've had my i've had some problems with nvidia recently and we will talk about that later on in the stream but i wanted to bring attention to the reflex thing when we talked about in the video where the 60 hertz it made the biggest difference now a lot of the viewers want to say okay brian test it against the anti-lag against the uh amd's anti-lag solution also test fast sync test a heap of other stuff so we've got another upcoming video that will follow suit in terms of testing but this is where i think the most important thing is and i want to stress this on a live stream and that is for the guys who are starting out that probably see all the pros using a 360 hertz monitor and maybe a final mouse ultra light 2 or some you know some ridiculously expensive mouse and they've got you know maybe a 200 set of headphones to go with it they don't need that gear to know if they're going to be good at the game right that's it so that's what i was thinking so for me it's it's about getting the guys uh especially in my audience getting the guys the best gear with what they've got and what they can afford and so i think your story that you're showing to him we're actually going to quickly show we'll quickly show some clips now of what rayne was doing he managed to take some clips on his potato uh i i said to him i was like he's like oh i said i want some clips and he's like okay what do you want i said i want clips on your potato so do you have any he's like yeah i got some stuff saved from a little bit back yeah so we'll play the quick potato clips now and uh we'll show what's going on with these skills so let's just tune out let's just do this right now hopefully there's audio as well okay dead what's up [Music] is i mean look as far as i'm concerned that's some pretty good plane like right there that was some pretty good stuff not yet yeah i was i was actually impressed so i was like wow that's that's the joke now that's the the gist of it is is that when when we're looking so when we're looking at this the 60 hertz monitor do you remember how much you paid for that um yeah somewhere from i think 250 300 has been q1 oh okay so back in the day you got the band q monitor you paid a little bit extra okay and yeah because okay awesome okay well so so we've established that you can be good on potato gear 100 yeah now corey is going to come in because he recently built this rainbow six siege pc and this is where the contrast comes in uh corey did you get to play some rainbow six siege on that pc the rtx 3080 and i9 uh yeah i actually did but i can tell you it wasn't as good as that game yes so your kdr how was his how was he how was your katie i see i was i was noticing that rain was on top digital was on top he was on top of the scoreboard were you on the bottom of the scoreboard in the team and i'm always on the bottom and so when we look at the contrast there we've got someone with the best gear you know high refresh rate monitor how much was that rainbow six siege pc how much was it um wait it took it to me oh sorry cool because yeah cory always puts in the title like ten twelve thousand hundred thousand dollar pc uh i think we'll go for a one million dollar pc and put some diamonds i'll be interested in a minute and it won't even happen just quickly look it up for you i've got it here uh oh 3500 so okay and so and also guys if you have any if you guys have any uh questions as well for for digital then be sure to drop them in in the um in the comments section because i've been i mean there's some questions i've got so he started out humble humble beginning started out on on basically you know budget gear became good but what made you so after you started getting good how did you get scouted or how did you get to that transition from playing decent or playing well on low end gear or playing well on low in gear and then how did you transition into the pro gaming scene to chiefs and uh um so when i had transitioned to um pc on my um lower end pc that is at the start uh i had like transferred like over to pc like from a team on playstation uh we all decided to get pcs and um uh so through competing with that team um we got pretty good and um when you're when you when you know when you're a good team um all these other you know pro teams and they're looking at you because we were under 18 team at the time so to become a to compete in pro league you need to be over 18. so um being in this under 18 team um and and making sort of a name for ourselves um that's how you know our name sort of got out there and we qualified for a um a land a land tournament in sydney um while we were that under 18 team and um i think that was the biggest sort of um biggest step in sort of getting our names out there and um yeah that really put us on the map i guess is there is there a reason why you have to be over 18 and whatever like is there a reason for that i mean i think it's it's something to do with um like the tournament organizers but having said that um if you're under 18 you can still there's so many tournaments you can compete in um like grassroots levels um graduate level tournaments you can still compete in and um you can still use that time to sort of make a name for yourself and um still be scattered and people will look out for you and and wait to turn 18. okay so after you turned 18 and you got then chief saw you they liked you they took you guys on as a team or because they weren't chased at the time they were um a different under under a different name um but that roster yeah picked me up okay so if you guys don't know chiefs are are they the biggest australian program i would say so yeah i would say so yeah okay australian chiefs okay it's pulled up a different business here i'll just um we'll see if we can get it so you you started on uh playstation did you yeah how did you find the transition from playstation to pc did you notice like a big change in game play did you have to get used to that transition at all or how was that for you um so 100 obviously like aiming with the mouse was completely different using your keyboard was completely different um but over time you just get sort of used to it and the transition was was hard at first but i was uh so you sort of you so you sort of you took that game sense with you but you just had to sort of learn the keyboard and mouse oh yeah oh yeah yeah cause i did play rainbow six siege on playstation and and yeah that's what i um so yeah got into got into the pc gaming um continued the rainbow six siege uh just on a mouse and keyboard this time though and so were you naturally were you naturally good at the game from the beginning or did it take a lot of learning for you um like would you say you were better than the average player when you first started rainbow six no i was i was shocking um on playstation i was i was like yeah like we have this ranks in rainbow six siege and i was like copper bronze um and i was shocking but i just sort of played where i am now to be honest sorry the boys in the chat i think we started like this is uh they're right we've got a new thing going on here where if you can like here's the challenge for the pros out there if you can be a pro at your best on a potato you are then a pro tato that's i like that you know so you play with the crappiest mouse and you play with the crappiest monitor even turn it down have you ever tried turning it down to 30 hertz just to give your opponents an advantage have a bit of fun have a bit of fun um is there any sort of like okay so when we talk about rainbow six siege right there's one aspect that always annoys me with pro gaming and uh gaming in general that is cheats how what does rainbow six siege do to weed out the cheats and how do you spot them and what's the things to look out for because i've seen like when i watch back some of these clips and i'm not going to name any names you can see the sensitivity is way too high but they hit these pinpoint shots consistently and i'm like man whenever i used to play i used to know that some of the pro cs go plays and that was never the case especially at tournaments so what's some of the ways you can spot out cheats and and how does the rainbow six siege community deal with that um definitely an element of game sense and knowing um what's what's suspect and what's not um like for for up-and-coming players i don't want to like to my own horn but like looking at my clips they might think oh he's snapping onto their heads that's like cheating um i didn't see anything out of your classes i didn't see anything that was sus no no yeah like that's just like um just like aimed at good aim over time um what like when you like notice sheets like when people like wool banging you through walls and and they're like tracing you um through a wall and then like pre-firing so that's how you like sort of can notice the cheats when they're looking at you through walls and and definitely like an element through game sense where like he shouldn't know i was there or or he had no information that i was there um is a big thing as well so but what sage does to combat that is um they've got like an anti-check in the game which is it's just good it's it's gotten better i feel over time and a combination of that they've also got you can upload clips to their support um sports stuff on on their website and they can manually ban people as well um but in terms of pro play as well you have to like um run a program before you before you go play your official matches and that's another element of um another anti-cheat software so they've got like you know all these like um different ways to combat it um so yeah yeah that's just funny it's such a different contrast now with the world of pro game believe it or not i used to play starcraft brood war i went to the wcg the world cyber games is that still a thing now this world cyber games is it still uh i haven't i personally haven't heard of it world cyber games wg no okay wcg so that was the big thing back when starcraft was a thing now i was only 14 15 years old at the time and that's when there was no money in pro gaming so at one stage i was number one and brewed wars in starcraft war in australia yeah so like but there was no money no you you went to samsung hey can i get sponsored maybe even 100 bucks a month they just laughed at you there was just no money in it um and so like there was a couple of other guys in australia that that went on to korea to try and pursue a career now the funny thing was is about the koreans where they were just on another level when it came to starcraft you could not you know the the sort of like the pre-pro the guy who was transitioning to pro would just wipe the floor with any aussie in starcraft so it was a completely different field but how when it comes to pro gaming with rainbow six siege uh do the koreans dominate or what's what's the go there um so uh the like asian um teams or asian players tend to dominate more um in uh what's the name of it like dota 2 league of legends those type of games yeah i think it's called mma i don't don't correct me on that oh yeah oh yeah mmorpg or what so yeah they dominate those sort of games um and then the fps sort of games um just tend to be dominated but more like europe n a um and latin america um regions um and that's like a lot to do with that it's just sort of population and like in in in who's playing what because these asian um like players are more playing these um like moba games yep thank you kanye that's the one moba um yeah they're playing those since they're playing more of those moba games then brian actually naturally they're just going to be better at it because they've got more players playing it so um yeah well one thing i noticed as well is i never laughed so hard i remember the aussie pro team for overwatch they went up against the korean pro team for overwatch and they literally couldn't even kill one of their players i'd never seen something so funny it was just like they came in and they just wiped the team like it was just a wipe and i remember i saw that clip and i was like wow like like you know so the funny thing is though one thing i've been thinking so at the moment right we've gone through okay so you you you can get good on the gear but one thing i want to touch on as well as the thing for pro gamers that one all aspiring pro gamers i think the diet is super important one thing i've noticed about korea right believe it or not south korea when i went there the diet was so healthy right these guys were eating steamed vegetables like every day yakult in between the diet there was so good and i'm like well no wonder you have a good diet you're going to play games really well and i dare i'd say that the brain in progress in programming you've got to feed your brain really well and then you can make good moves uh so i noticed that korean diet was one of the best in the world and so what at the moment what's your diet like let's just go through your diet in an average um uh so my hey what do i eat so i'll just my my my mom used to be a chef so she i i'm fortunate enough to get some good home-cooked meals um during dinner and that can be ranging from a lot of things i can't really pin it down yeah um but and yeah lunch as well like my favorite lunch is just having like a ham salad sandwich like or um i don't know i can't really think of what i would have but no definitely healthy food um and not junk food all the time it's is i like even for myself when we decided this season um i'd like tap back into like eating a bit junky food like eating that junk food and then i just noticed i was like playing bad and as soon as i um like got back into my gym routine and started eating actually healthy um i noticed i was playing better and i'm not sure if that's placebo or me it's not placebo man you got a whole nation of you've got a whole nation of koreans that i think will prove that and so i think it's for the important because i've i've been to some of these tournaments in australia and i'm like well sometimes i i scratch my head and i'm like well no wonder the aussies aren't winning the pro gaming tournaments worldwide these kids have got red bulls mcdonald's on the table screaming shouting no discipline how are you going to get good if that's your base you know what i mean so it's it's a motto of crap in crap out but if you start fueling yourself you know it's like running a car you run a car on 98 if it's a high octane needs high octane the engine is going to run nice you start putting crap fuel on it and water down the fuel you can have problems so absolutely so that's what i've been trying to write home and about all this uh stuff that's important just outside of having the natural skill there you've got to also have all the uh augmented things running right and if you don't then you can pretty much kiss your pro gaming career goodbye or your prospects so it's good to hear that you have the like i didn't even know before the stream i didn't have any of these questions planned i didn't even know but i wanted to sort of bring them up on the spot but it's good to hear that your diet is good you're exercising all these things as i guess if there's guys out there that want to be a pro they can sort of watch this stream and watch this interview and say okay i should be eating healthy i should be doing my exercise do my due diligence in order to become a pro and so same with corey i mean look me and corey when we were building the custom pc we did cheat a little bit we were getting menu log and uh eating eating a lot of junk food um it's got some veggies on it right yeah yeah yeah actually we did we did hey look for half the night for half the time in there we did get uh one time we got we got chinese vegetables and then we got the uh thai as well pad thai and stuff like that really healthy stuff but yeah you know so overall though yeah you want to be eating healthy you want to be exercising you also want to be that that'll enable you to play well now in terms of finding your teammates is there any sort of in rainbow six siege right because it's a game it's a five verse five is it yep so is there any sort of like different roles you guys have and what's the roles and do they match your personalities and whatnot because i know in dota for instance you've got the carry now a lot of the time the carry his personality is sort of he's the one who's flashy is the standout he's like the he's like the frontman for the rock band and then you've got the support it'll be the quiet one actually in real life too i found like the personalities actually match the roles so what's the roles in rainbow six and which how would which role do you identify with there um so i think in rainbow six siege it's it's definitely similar so you've got your like your support roles um but however in siege the support roles um tend to correlate more with the people that are are more talkative because um they're the ones using their drones they're the ones sort of directing their teammates um and helping them in that sort of aspect so they're more talkative and then our flashy players can maybe be more um on the silent side of things so more quiet um but yeah like these our flash like we call them entry fraggers um they're the ones sort of going in first um and sort of being being droned in and sort of um entering the building first essentially um getting the kills and then you've got like other like roles like flex where um you do a little bunch of things it's hard to pinpoint it so we just got flex like for sure flexible and then um yeah so it's pretty much entry fragger and then you've got support and flex um they're the main main three and uh do you play multiple roles or do you mainly play yeah frag or what what's your name more of a support um flex i play um okay yeah my team okay and who's who would be the who would be the entry on your team so on your screen now um god legions god legend and vast era entry fragrance okay and do you ever rotate do you ever rotate these um yeah enough like uh worthy was our support um support sort of flex but he's i think entered more into a just flex role now um he's still he's still on a sport of roll but again sort of rotations like during different maps um will rotate that role i guess um uh to what what um fits best and then main arm flex um and support on some maps and so if your shows just support on most okay well cool well anyway uh that's about in terms of the pro stuff guys we'll be uh sort of closing off this interview pretty soon so if you've got any questions for rain be sure to drop them in the comment section below but basically before we uh move on where do you see yourself in uh five years time or where do you want to see yourself um i'm currently at university um bouncing that and sort of um programming so um something to do with my um degree in marketing and advertising and maybe even link that with anything to do with esports would be pretty cool um so in five years time yeah something something to do with that we'll keep it pretty broad well you got a good attitude my man you got a good attitude right attitude for the job and uh i'm glad you've sort of um yeah you're in this scene and you're making a good name for yourself you're also in ways it's really good to have someone on who's humble and just uh sort of guiding the guys who say for instance the young guys who want to give it a crack and i want to get into it i do have one more question though what mouse style do you use as a palm grip or is it a claw grip or a fingertip grip or definitely a bit of a hybrid i like to keep the back of my palm on the mouse um because i'm more of a wrist um more wrist slash arm aimer and then um my fingertips yeah i sort of claw my um at my mouse it's a bit of a hybrid i like to say yeah i think that that's sort of like is the claw grip uh and uh corey what about you mate what what do you do for a mouse grip there man i'll just put my hand on there whatever happens happens you just you just you know you get it yeah you like to get a good grip on things yeah that way yeah yeah um one question for you as well which i think a lot of people might be interested in um um how often do you guys practice and like how many hours a week do you think you put into rainbow six um so off season now we we just as you guys know we just came off the back of um bouncing two leagues so we're in a in sort of a holiday break i guess you could sort of say um for two weeks we got two weeks off now but if it's if it's sort of the pre-season so um anywhere from like five days a week um three hours a night so um like more than three hours because you've got before and after we talk about a bit um but if it's like during the season it can be yeah six days a week um and um you know five hours during those days five six hours during those days but um it's flexible so if we're busy on a day and we've got something on um teams understandable so yeah so you guys have dedicated time for actual gameplay do you have dedicated time for like reviewing past um past games or anything like that yeah called they're called vod reviewing so um we'll like review vods um on ourselves and other teams as well um if it's during um the season so uh yeah no there's def it's not just um like gaming like um practicing in screen we call them scrimmages scrims so it's not just scrims it's um you know vod reviewing and and dry running so hopping into a custom game which is like like a sandbox mode of siege um and just like coming up with strategy there and and yeah so yeah okay so i think it sounds like well it sounds like in ways it's similar like i think a lot of people they look at the end result and they're like oh that's so easy like they'll look at my youtube channel for reason and same with cory's and they'll be like oh just he gets sent this stuff in and then he gets just made it's a 10 minute video it's like they don't understand that there's days that go in just that 10 minute video there's sometimes there's days go into it in order to make the video whether it's the b-roll the testing and all the other stuff and i know corey for instance he spends about a week on his builds like that's on the average turnover would be a week just day in day out making these custom pcs and yeah sure you see the 15-minute end result that all the work and the hard work that goes behind that you kind of don't see that so it sounds like it's similar with the rainbow six siege thing you've got going on right you've got to do all this other stuff and then sure the tournaments is going to be all the flash plays happen but there's a lot of other things that contribute to being that skill level in order to do that so for sure okay cool man well that sounds about it people want to know now the specs of your pc now right at this very moment chat was like look what's his what's his current special current specs yeah so i've got a amd ryzen uh 2700 uh seven i think i'm missing something that and then 2700x yeah yeah yeah um 16 gig um ddr4 ram and then i've just got that 3060 um which i'm going to put in um and then just a terabyte ssd is there anything i'm leaving out i don't think so and you well i think there was one thing you wanted to talk about was the the reflex i think corey was as well you guys are telling me look we're going to eat on this live stream and talk about reflex i'm all right well i mean these guys like i think they i said to them like look for me the biggest difference with reflex was the potato side of things which is what i liked i liked that aspect so sure let's talk about reflex but i think the best thing for it is that it's actually helping out people who are on a budget rather than helping out the the flashy pro and giving them more of a pay-to-win advantage but what's your experience so have you tried reflex on rainbow six siege and what's your experience with it um so tried out this morning and a couple days ago um and just in the short time that i've been using it um definitely like things just snappier um i think it's the best way to describe it the response time is quicker and yeah just in general just feels snappy and the fact that it's i'm just it's a setting it's not something i went out into the shops and paid for just a setting i just turned it on and instantly um my game just felt yeah better overall okay cool and uh what about you corey felt no difference didn't notice anything look i'm not really you know we could i reckon what i'm gonna do next time i'm gonna be missing his head all right it's gonna be so what you're trying to say is look reflex could actually be making you play bad because you're you see the guy earlier you're clicking the button but you're used to missing so you're actually you know i mean you're missing [Laughter] practice then we might be able to so what we'll do is i just thought of another video idea what we're gonna do is i'll do that other testing that people wanted all the different other testing that we missed out in the budget and also the reflex videos so we did a budget video as well where i tested some budget monitors i'm also going to do another video i figured where i'm going to turn reflex on and off placebo and we will test it with a pro and then we'll test it with corey but that's when i meet up with these guys at an event in yonder so i can't guarantee when that video will be coming but i mean hopefully with um this you know whatever the the rona going around hopefully when that's finished we can all get back to normal but or at least have an event where we can meet up and uh and do something again and uh yeah i'd like to put that to the test and then we'll just put reflex on and off and um which one did you did you notice a difference guys you know it'd be tricky to it will be tricky test too i'm going to put it on you guys a oh like i'll put i'll do like five tests and you know two of them will be exactly the same and then three will be you know different so yeah i reckon i'll get it i can't get it that's done you'll notice differently i don't think i'll get it yeah so here we go last question as well is uh did you buy siege on steam or uh yeah i bought mine on steam um uh just so it's with my other games but um i i think actually one thing i will say i think i recommend buying the same i think the downloads um it's a smaller file so if you're looking to sort of optimize your space and your hard drive yeah go for a steam download for sure okay cool and uh have you activated your windows 10 yes okay well i was just going to say if you haven't we've got today's you know sponsor here 1430 uh 14 30 cents i haven't i haven't activated oh really okay we'll put link links in description mate you got the coupon code there bftyc you get a 30 discount and uh also you look you guys your mics aren't sounding that great as well so if you need to get a good mic elgato wave three okay fellas that that's so easy yeah what michael you're using there what what mike are you using there corey yeah road you know one of the best in the industry the thing doesn't sound that good [Laughter] all right guys well thanks for joining in uh thanks very much and we will i'm just i'll be going back to the chat we'll be talking about some big news uh with other things tech related i mean if you guys want you can stay around i mean we can just chat and hang out um that's if you've got time or if you guys have to go that's fine but i'm going to be talking about nvidia and a bit of leading off yesterday's video people you know he'll be leading off so do you guys want to stay or what what's the go uh obviously more than happy to yeah okay so basically the gist is we've got this nvidia now i spoke to nvidia behind the scenes and i was i was like look guys you guys made me look like a total idiot and that was because they they released the mining limiter on their on their gpus and it was working like for what it's worth they had this mining limiter and people weren't buying the rtx 3060s like they were the other graph scouts it was proof of concept and it was working as far as i was concerned but then they went and accidentally released the driver that would have unlocked the mining limits and sure enough people went out and bought all the 360s up so but now nvidia are saying okay guys we made a mistake we know the gamers majority of gamers who want to get their hands on a card just to play games i mean who would have thought you want to buy a gaming graphics card just to play games on it we we can now put in a new hash rate limiter and basically what they're saying is there's going to be a whole new series of lhr versions of these graphics cards coming out that are going to have these mining limiters in place and this time they're not going to mess around and they're not going to unlock the mining limiters so this this i mean look i'm i'm sitting on the fence here i'm not like look after last time's episode where i was like hey i in video i believe in this and my like the viewers told me i was a total idiot they were they were proven right now i'm trying to change my ways i look this looks good but again we've got i've got to see it to believe it because this will add in so yesterday i made a video we're talking about crypto prices and how i thought the profitability was going down i thought uh eventually we'll come into a crunch with cryptocurrency and you can see here this is basically what's happening now the price of this stuff is starting to flat line out and so profitabilities go down you've got asic miners coming in there's a lot of things coming in that point towards uh basically somewhat possibly better gpu availability at least in the sense of what it is compared to now which is it's it's i think it's hit the worse right now when you go on ebay and people are you know even in australia two and a half thousand dollars for an rtx 3080 it's really difficult it's absolutely ridiculous so i think this is a good thing right i think the the the level that we're seeing here right the ridiculous nature of the price hikes is just it's based on pure greed right people buying these cards for mining they're doing it for pure profitability and it's it's one thing i don't think nvidia would have ever intended for this to happen sure i think they would have intended for some mining sales to happen crypto to keep going on but i don't think anyone anticipated for crypto to be at the level that it's at now this this massive like you've got did you know like did you know for a fact uh i think it was ethereum sold back in 2014 for 30 cents apiece did you know that 30 cents yes yes 30 cents a piece that's how much they were selling the coins for in that those values i think that was 30 cents for for one ethereum now it's three and a half thousand dollars yes so you can see the you can see i mean sure one could say okay ethereum was just grossly undervalued when it was first launched yes i would agree but is it grossly overvalued now and i do think yes i think correct i think crypto i think crypto's in a massive massive bubble and the reason my theory is behind uh one one particular well it's actually two i mean but one's just playing a joke i think the reason behind this is the one called feta tv this one's in this one's in the top 20 i believe in crypto currencies but you go you go to the website theta tv theta dot tv and it's like there's 500 live viewers on there you're telling me that eco you're telling me that ecosystem is worth 10 10 billion you know this is ridiculous the evaluations here are extremely overvalued i mean for instance justin.tv back in the day if you guys remember when that was now twitch i think that's that's crazy yeah that was i think they sold that for half a million dollars that was back in 2008 or something like that this was valued at half a million dollars and that had i would say that had more viewers than theta had back in those days i'd say having actually a much healthier data much healthier base so you're looking at this like 11 billion dollars for 500 like this right here is everything's pointing to a bubble even if we have 10 20 year-on-year inflation this is going to be overvalued for decades so it either has to have two things right the price either has to come down or you have to have uh the theta tv itself grow at exponential rates and now i haven't seen the exponential growth there because i don't think the product is anywhere near as good as twitch for example so you're now at a crux where okay i just think this is overvalued based on the current research that i've done so when you look at one cryptocurrency like this and you know that it's grossly overvalued when you go to other cryptocurrencies how overvalued are they when that just basically comes down to what metrics you're going to apply but at least when i judge on fair value this thing is i would say this thing shouldn't even be anywhere near even a billion dollars so there's there's a thousand percent overvalued so you're looking at cryptos is that one thousand percent a general indication of how all cryptos are overvalued well possibly so there's a big there's a big thing out there at the moment and so i'm just telling i've been telling people just be careful if you're into crypto and you've made some money definitely take your profits take your profits and um i've been saying this in previous live streams get some real assets because at the end of the day real assets hold their value and uh things like you know a set of tv coin if this all crashes down you're going to be left with a theta tv coin but it's going to be maybe 50 cents so just saying just putting that out there but anyway there's the i don't know how we went from a gpu hash rate limit i guess it's all tied in right so that's why i've said okay guys if you if you're buying these cards if you're buying an rtx 3080 for two and a half thousand dollars and you're doing it for profitability just be very careful going forward do your research especially do your own research and that's that's one thing i always tell the viewers here at tech yes city is just to do your own research make an informed decision don't i mean there's there's a big culture right now especially when you look at dogecoin there's a big culture out there to just go gung-ho and go yolo and uh go you know put all your money down on dogecoin i mean that's the thing right i mean but where's that money coming from at the end of the day if it is yolo money going in to prop the price up then it's probably yolo money that's coming from the taxpayer anyway when we really look at the source of that so i mean there's lots of lots of different things with crypto but uh just be be very careful my advice is and i think once sort of things like this come into place where we can circumvent mining with a rate with a hash rate limit and i think it's a good thing now one one thing is i've noticed as well i've noticed a little trend where i think in the next few months in the next six months i think the roles will change i think amd believe it or not will open themselves up to more crypto optimized drivers and nvidia will do the opposite because they want to i guess maintain their gaming audience as opposed to amd like we're seeing a lot of 6700 xt's for instance in australia are still in stock they have to move these things right so if you want to move these cards you open them up to miners that seems to be a formula that's working so i predict in the next six months we'll actually see amd be a lot more minor friendly because they've got to move these in stock cards and then nvidia will put the hash rate limiters on and try to get them into the hands of gamers so anyway there's predictions out the way what are you guys seeing like have you tried to buy a graphics card lately or what's the go what's uh that's impossible man yeah it's impossible yeah i've just said the same really then it's really hard to um i haven't tried myself but i just heard from other mates and friends that yeah it's pretty much it's really hard to yeah so that's uh that's the that's the gist out there it's it's basically a yeah and so one thing i've been i've been talking about i've been going into the economics of everything right now and they it does look man we're going into it i reckon the next 10 years we're going into a period that the any none of us have seen none of us know what the what the goal is none of us have seen so i've been doing a lot of research trying to figure out which way the ship's going to steer you know or is it just going to capsize or is it going to go in reverse so no one seems to have those answers but you can look at trends and when you look at trends you can see where you where that ship will be hauling in the long term so everything points towards what's known as believe it or not a lot of things are pointing towards uh an inflationary depression which is actually a scary thing so just be careful out there guys make sure you uh stay you know just stay focused and um yeah but anyway we've got to get back to good news because i want to make sure the viewers are cheered up like hey guys i can't wait for this can't wait for this inflationary depression it's gonna be so good i'll be able to get some deals at higher prices um but no but one guy was telling me look brian you got to go out to the bushland and start learning how to hunt start learning how to grow your own veggies and all this stuff and i'm like yeah that sounds like a good idea you know become self-sufficient and go off the grid and i was thinking to myself you know that might be maybe good for a youtube series i need this there's guys out there that are doing that they're they're going out there and they're um they're going off the grid completely and then they're making videos on it i saw one recommended to me the other day and i was like hey that seems like a good idea you know just connect with nature to turn the mainstream media off like i can't stand them i can't stand uh mainstream media anymore i've about had it had it to had it to here with with mainstream media and that's the problem so this is the thing right lately i've been going on this tangent of trying to tell everyone question everything and teach yourself how to think rather than what to think and i think nowadays more than ever we're just getting taught what to think that's it they're just getting pummeled pummeled all this stuff this is how you should think and it's like what really i thought i was an individual so anyway anyway guys um that's the hash rate limiting news uh i've been i've explained explained the crypto bubble and i've explained the graphics card situation quite a little bit more in depth on yesterday's video yeah thanks man yeah thanks i mean it was a different it was a different take uh it was good because i always loved discussion but i do think um yeah you always look at momentum one thing you should look at as well as momentum right so for instance last year pc sales were extremely good this year pc sales have slowed down so you can see momentum there basically going forward is that things are slowing down in general i'm not i mean at least what i do so i mean what have you noticed if you look at momentum of things have you noticed say for instance in pro gaming is there less tournaments is there less prize money with rain is that something that's happening or um it's like the opposite like i feel like the momentum is it's going up so um there is momentum there i guess um yeah especially within um anz um compared to like a couple years ago so there's momentum there i guess yeah esports is huge i mean esports is only ever growing i mean that's why i pulled up at the start of the start of the stream set over 70 million players on rainbow six siege now so that was a that was a really good thing what about you corey uh what about you with the custom builds uh i mean i i just i keep i love them man i love when you do these uh special special i am waiting for the uh msi what is it the collab with menu log so hopefully that can handle yeah yeah so if you guys don't know corey posted a thing up on twitter where he said he was like oh what do you want me to do guys with this custom msi build and i was like make a menu log pc you know red it gets there faster you know the menu log's going to get there faster it's going to red goes faster naturally so i was like well this just seems like a natural thing and then menu log replied themselves and they were like yeah let's just make this happen of course you've got to make it happen now so is there any progress on that well uh actually i'm thinking that you and i should um get something happening maybe i'll come up to the gold coast or whatever absolutely any longer menu log on board and we'll make something like that we'd love to see that we'd love to see that so yeah but uh anyway guys that's about mainly the main news i saw the main use was the nvidia hashrate limiters are coming out so there's gonna be various models there has been rumors of the 3080 ti as well as the 3070 ti coming out i think there is truth behind the 30 adti seems about right in terms of the time frame and the schedule of releasing this and you've got to remember with the 3080 ti people like why are they releasing a 3080ti when you can't even build an art or you can't even buy an rtx 3080 the reason being is because this stuff would have been taped out even before the rtx 3080 was launched they would know that like nvidia have a schedule of release and so if there is a 3080ti which i highly think there is just by looking at all the stuff out there um it's already been taped out from last year so that's uh that's what i think so there is a 3080i 3070 ti that one remains up in the air i'd like to see if that one's got a bit of truth to it but if that does come it'll come after the 3080 ti i think so that's some good news though i mean more gpus the better the more silicon they can get out but yeah hopefully hopefully we will see this mining hash rate limit to bring in some gpus for people to buy even if it's even if it's somewhere in between msrp and now i think a lot of people all right say for instance in australia if it goes down from two thousand dollars to fifteen hundred msrp was like eleven hundred fifty people would be happy to pay that for a thirty eight there yeah okay cool i've seen the worst it can get to i'd be happy to pay a little bit more and you're still coming under that of a 2080 ti and you're still accounting for the um that what what are they calling it transitory inflation that's a i'm sorry i have to laugh at that you know the transit guys we're just gonna have a quick bump of inflation nothing to worry about you know just yeah just nothing to worry about here fellas prices of everything it's just gonna go up um don't have to worry though don't have to worry and it's like why don't you have to worry is is the government going to guarantee the difference lost to inflation if my savings get eroded away nope and that's that's the biggest thing right a lot of people out there it's just funny because i started talking about a bit of this stuff and people are calling me behind the scenes and they're asking bro well what do i do man what do i do one guy called me had 300 grand and i was like dude that's a lot of money you saved up a lot of money it's like what do i do with it and i said to him well this is what i'm doing i'm buying some platinum i'm buying this i'm buying you know and so they're like oh okay cool so i think a lot of people don't want to be caught out by the basically it's a net positive thing going forward too with inflation and whether you know how hard it applies to graphics cards right we've seen an inflation figure on gravis cards at 200 percent plus um that's it's huge inflation i mean that's not reflected in the broad economy just yet but i think when you've got transitory inflation like they're saying is going to happen you want to protect yourself because it's in your net it was in your best interest to protect yourself based on the net value of cash basically if you buy real assets at a set value right now and say for instance it is transitory the things go away the value of the dollar gets stronger for whatever reason then you've still preserved your wealth you still the if your price of your assets drops then you can still sell that and that value of that dollar will still buy what it could buy six months ago however on the flip side if you hold on to that cash and inflation comes that value the government isn't going to guarantee that that value of your asset that's never coming back you've lost that forever and that's what i think people need to switch on to and realize if you're sitting on cash right now you might be the biggest loser in history so that's what i've been warning people behind the scenes i'll warn them on live stream i've got nothing to hide um i think if you've worked hard especially for your money over the last x amount of years i know for me personally i'm like i said in the past i'm more of a type of guy who saves money you know it's a big thing you've had to research and i mean that's why the content in ways on my channel has been over the last few months has been less because i've been educating myself quite a lot outside of my i would call it my basically practically useless university education uh seriously man i went to university and all they taught me was one set of thinking and i'm looking around and that set of thinking isn't applying to anything that i'm looking at right now and there's you know you start to sort of take a seat back and look at things logically and you're like well how do i you know how do i apply this type of thinking that i learnt it's not making any sense so then i've started doing a heap of research came across various different economists and different people and their opinions on things and i was like then now that's starting to make sense and so yeah i've been uh lately i've been sort of getting into the groove of things and i think it's important to um uh you know so freak you know freak in the comments says 300 grand buy something disappear and quickly like land on the gold coast yeah yeah yeah dude you know you know the stuff sad the sad thing about the gold coast so i live on the gold coast guys if you don't know it's a place in queensland australia and the gold coast i think it was the number one most searched place worldwide like in 2020 yeah 2020 yeah so it's been absolutely insane here the prices of property has grown like 50 percent i think in a year um yeah so i mean well and you can't blame these people right they've got the government's telling them that inflation is is doesn't exist yet they're they want to protect their assets because they know when interest rates are like zero percent and anyone you know and this is the worst thing about it is the the borrowing standards i think in australia have gotten even lower so they'll basically you go to a bank and i i heard i was at the store the other day i was at a i was at my friend's computer store and there was this chick that came along and she was just like literally bloating about how she got a half a million dollar mortgage and she only had before that she was unemployed and only had three pay slips and i'm just scratching my head i'm like what what yeah i mean when you look at that why is that happening i thought you had to be yeah that's pretty bad yeah three pay slips like what that's it sounds like the um pre-gfc conditions all over again except it's happening in australia because i know the banks weren't as reckless as they were in the u.s pre-2008 but now it's just like okay yeah what's your credentials oh you've got a you've got a macbook pro we'll borrow your half a million dollars what's your credentials yeah oh okay you've been unemployed let's give this man half a million dollars so like i just i am and you know and that's where the price rises are coming from right when you start flooding the system with money what's going to happen prices are going to go up because it's actually believe it or not a lot of a lot of the inflation doesn't come um from uh just the fact that governments have quantitative easing comes from the fact that those are then realized in the form of a loan and especially if that loan is realized for consumption and asset purchases and not productivity then that's where you'll get inflation and that's there's three types of mortgages that happen so or three types of loans and that's the the third one the productivity loan that is what contributes to a productive economy because someone is then borrowing money and they're producing something that wouldn't be produced otherwise if they hadn't have got that loan but from what i everyone i ask everyone i know no one has a business loan right now and is that scary that's a scary thing when everyone asks most people have a home loan i mean everyone yeah pretty much everyone's got a home loan or a consumption loan or they've refinanced their mortgage to go consume things and so that can only really um lead to higher prices and so when people say okay is inflation going to happen i believe it will happen and so i've been warning my viewers i've been warning everyone i know just just be careful look for the early warning signs but i believe the early warning signs are already here so that's the that's sort of like the scariest thing to that's the scariest thing to look at so yeah i mean there oh it's all like um you know at the end of the day we'll find out in like i said the next in the in the previous video yesterday i think we'll find out very soon in the next three to six months we'll have a very broader look at what is going on and um then we'll be able to come back and evaluate whether whether my cause for concern was was worth it or not but the problem is if you in hindsight it's like you know in hindsight right if you bought x product x and you look back in hindsight and it's it's worth nothing now you can't really go back in time and say oh i wish i never bought that well same with the graphics card right when the 360 ti first released they were going in australia they were going for 700 dollars i bought a couple of them i actually bought two of them so i was like hey that's pretty good price had i had known that the 30 60 ti would go up to 1200 australian i would have bought the whole damn thing obviously i would have loaded the card up yeah i would have kept loading up the cart because that's what all the miners that's what all that's all that's what all the crypto miners were doing and i could have just been like no i'm going to be you know just putting him gaming pcs making you know making a bit of profit but i guess no one knew that but now the that's the hindsight that's the problem with hindsight is that you can't go back you can only basically make decisions on what you've got and the best thing is to make educated and informed decisions so anyway but yeah like jb says in the chat investing in yourself that's exactly right and that's what i say the best thing you can do is invest in yourself educate yourself make sure you educate yourself that's the most important thing and i will say right now right at this very point in time i think in australia at least and i probably are because i know teachers i know a lot of different teachers at schools the quality of education in australia is going down it has gone down and it's going down and that's the problem we need to and that's the thing how do you then do that because you then start getting into debate of politics but overall the quality of education is going down in australia and that's a worry concern i don't know about the guys in the u.s because i haven't been to a united states school before but what about the quality of education in the united states if you have say for instance if you're in your 20s 20 years ago and you've gone back to university can you speak on behalf of the quality of education because i think the quality of education has gone down to a level where it's at an all-time low and that does concern me right when people aren't getting educated they're not making the right decision they're not bettering society they're not bettering an economy anyhow uh man i think these live streams you just go off on these tangents and you sort of talk about things that yeah i don't even know how we got here but look you guys are just sitting there listening and i guess maybe it's a good conversation to have but um sooner or later we need to have the conversation you know anyway but i like the fact that both of you guys are disciplined you both eat healthy you both exercise that is the that's one thing i keep laying into my viewers as well i made a three video series on that was a little bit of a while ago on healthy yeah yeah healthy gamer educate yourself guys the the best thing about the internet is that you can get the best quality education for the price of your internet bill and i think that is such a good thing where you can you you're free to choose the information out there question things learn and just learn keep learning and then stay healthy and i really want to drive that home with my viewers so you know wake up in the morning drink a green tea get a bit of sunlight into your body vitamin d these are things that i don't see and this is the biggest thing that concerns me is that you've got all these uh especially this is my biggest jive with mainstream media is that you've got the mainstream media and they don't push this home they don't tell people hey these are the benefits of green tea these are the benefits of having a healthy and they need to drive this home to people but of course all they care about is ratings and views and and ads yeah money and it's it's like well that's all you care about then really you just it's in the long term it's self-destructive to society and so i think that we're at that turning point now where i think things have to change and if they don't change for the better where that's a better society in general and things needed to make a better society like a better diet and in educating people on a better education and how to make people healthier in general and trying to encourage that then you're going to have surrender a society that's just full of i mean for better lack of the word full of so literal and both metaphorical so anyway yeah so that's and that's one thing you don't want so anyway guys i mean we're going to get back to um are we witnessing the imminent creation of the tech yes channel uh people have uh people have told us that they want an alternative channel um i i would like to make an alternative channel yeah maybe finance and health i think there are two yeah they're the two yeah you've got you've got three things in life this is how i break it down in life there's three main things you've got your health wealth and happiness and i think the two contribute to the latter more important so if you've got your health and you've got your wealth you're going to be pretty happy i think if you've got those two now of course wealth is a very subjective thing and i don't think however on the other hand i don't think health is so health is a very objective thing health is a very objective thing you eat healthy you exercise you're going to remain healthy as opposed to wealth very subjective so some people just might like to have enough money to get by they might just enjoy maybe for them wealth is having friends and and going out every weekend so that's a very subjective thing but i think those two together will lead to happiness and that's the most important thing so i think when those two erode around in society then you're not going to have a happy society so anyway there we go deep deep learning deep learning we don't need we don't need ai for this sorry nvidia we don't need the uh deep learning ai or amd or the we need some names for brian's new channel yeah we need some names guys we need some we need some names so that's it so there you go so there you go banging yep anyway guys uh yeah we've uh we've gone how long's this uh like the the the chat is a very i like it you guys are i kind of i i want some questions and let's just anything change the subject because i'll keep going down this tangent um who's got some questions for brian yeah so i mean i just i yeah i think the bottom line is though the the main gist of tech yes city and the main audience that's around here very open-minded people and like i said i haven't had um i've had a few drive-by critics recently but besides that i haven't had many like there's the amount of hateful comments that have come in in the last year i could count them on a hand and i think that's at the end of the day i think people know that okay um my audience knows that hey i care about i care about my audience and they you know in turn they can they care about me so it's a good thing we want to keep that dynamic going so we'll just we'll get on to some questions here we've got double chat so i'll put chat so how good is an r9 nano these days r9 nano is actually one of the better gpus to get because of the four gigabyte frame buffer you're going to get good value in the and so four gigabyte nunder they're the vram cards you want to get and basically back to that ethereum thing as we saw before people are mainly buying up gpus for ethereum mining that's pretty much the granddaddy you look at the top 10 cryptocurrencies below that that come in terms of profitability not only is the profitability lower but you've got a market cap of one not even one percent versus ethereums at a hundred percent so yeah basically an r9 nano is one of the greatest cards to look out for today in terms of demand in terms of price because the demand is really only going to come from a gamer as opposed to the other cards out there that go over four gigabytes of vram the demand and even look at 1660 super people are going to be grabbing those popping them on a mining bench to try and make profits so aren't i nano love it i would go for it of course make sure it's in good condition um marco asked can i send product to you for a vid designs by file that's for you corey for me yeah who wants to say what oh my so marco's a zeus two marco's like uh he's been hanging around for tech yes for ages man he's a good friend i met him in taiwan uh two years in a row um yeah he's a good friend and he's actually been lately he's been showing videos in taiwan of all the gpu that are in stock entirely you go around with in taiwan yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so he works for a zeus tour he works for the nas company of zeus tour and um yeah so he loves the zeus tour um me i think azusa are great i i like that their nasa's been just super easy to use yeah really good like if you want a nas that's just set up set and forget a zeus tour do a great job with that but he um yeah so he's got the taiwan he wants to i'm guessing he probably wants to send you a nas yeah i can read marco between the lines marco wants to send you a mass and he wants you to tell your viewers how amazing the azus tournament is yeah see yeah but um we've got the uh thing with taiwan the gpu situation there if we look at taiwan uh they've implemented some good rules so you look at marco's channel there's gpus in stock you've got rtx 3080s you've got uh and they're coming in at good prices i'd say i think when i checked the prices converted to australian dollars and rtx 3080 in taiwan was about i think was the thirteen hundred dollars which is a great price for a you know rtx 38 is here are going for two thousand after the gpus yeah yeah yeah but the thing is you have to you have to buy it with a whole pc so you can't have these guys come in and buy 10 of them at a time and put them on a mining bench because the stores just simply won't sell them so there's that i like that rule that was one of the smartest rules implemented that taiwan did properly another thing is too is is that i think the culture in taiwan and i'd probably be speaking on behalf of japan but i know there'd be a lot of foreigners in japan who would be just buying up the gpus if they're cheap enough um the asian cultures are very conservative so they like they'll look okay you can make money on mining but do i need to make money on mining and i'm guessing a lot of taiwanese would probably say nah don't really care too much for it you know life's good and so there's you know but if we go to for instance australia or you go to uh us or uk profitability you'll sign me up where can i get profits easy profits yep bang and then you get a swarm of people yeah just i gotta get that money gotta get that bread mang and so it's just a flood of people so i think taiwan's culture also promotes the current lower prices of gpus as opposed to the us and um and the uk and australia so i've got kaymeon who asks retailers holding back stock to inflate price uh that story no they're not the retailers have flogged it off for whatever they can get for it that's the real news there um it's not the retailers too like i know for australia i know quite a few retailers in australia the problem is is the middlemen and the distributors and i know this for a fact and i've been asking for instance i've been in talks with asrock i told azerok behind the scenes i said guys is there a way you can start ship so they're i'm they're in the process of asking their distribution chains right now so for instance if i can buy a hundred gpus and sell them to people locally here uh a tad above msrp so just to cover my code yeah and so i'd like to start doing that for people in australia where they can get gpus at better prices because i just think you know it's one thing to have crypto miners and scalpers already hurting the prices it's another thing to have just complete you know then the distributor is just completely taking advantage of that and just yeah yeah these are things that you know and people like oh this is this is the nature of this is just how things are nowadays it's like no that's how things shouldn't be that's just there's a difference between having no competition and having competition and so these weighed in ways was oligopoly sort of thing you've got these three main distributors in australia all just uh leading lending way to each other for price fixing and so that price fixing is not part of a capitalist society at all price fixings crony capitalism and or you know it shouldn't exist and so that's one thing we're seeing right now it's like okay how can we circumvent this well we can have people who um we can have people in the community that want to do better for the community so yeah anyway uh if quarantine so we've got a good a good question from zeo sign hypothetically if quarantine ended do you think gpu availability will be affected and if so how if quarantine ends a lot of the problems will go away if current if they end this quarantine um if they end quarantine then yeah things will get back to normal very quickly and that's my that's my opinion i i mean yeah it's one of those things where there's so many differing opinions on this and um i just yeah i mean it's you know i don't want to get flagged for conspiracy or anything like that that so i can't really talk too much on the subject yeah but i mean i've got my opinions on all this and i think in ways i i just think the i'm going to raise one question i'll ask i shall ask an open-ended question um before before all this happened uh there was there was deflationary pressures on all western societies there was actually deflationary pressures that were coming into play and there was also if you look at the repo rates in 2000 was it 2019 the repo rent uh rates went up to 10 or something like that there was a problem with the liquidity in the system before this all happened in the banking system there was there was liquidity there was problems with liquidity so isn't it just i mean isn't it just a i guess an ironic thing that all this money printing and liquidity is getting pushed out into the system uh and this and this virus has come along at the same time so isn't that isn't that a funny uh i mean what would you call it coincidence that's all isn't it just an ironic coincidence that the two happen around the same time that's all i'm going to say and another thing as well is i believe what was the first case was in australia is the first the first case was in january so we had the first case here in january yet we only went into lockdown in march mid-march so you know you kind of question that and you're like okay what we had two months of this stuff and why was there not higher numbers in those two months there are things that i do question and i want answers to which i haven't been provided answers to so i think you know and that's what i'm telling i'm telling everyone to question things and sort of have an open mind and and see what's in front of you so anyway at the moment we're just we're all dealing with this chaos especially if you're in the land of tech i think i think it hits more home for people who are into pc tech and gaming because we're seeing prices of things going ridiculously high um i think we're we're seeing all this in motion as opposed to people who say just watch tv every day go get a go get it go you know go over the bar go light up the barbecue on the weekend i think they're not really noticing much of it at all even though you know price of meat's going up too but there's yeah there's a lot of things that i like to discuss and maybe you know i just want to keep discussing with my audience and having open conversations but yeah it is a bit concerning going forward and i would like i think all governments to be much more transparent than they currently are because all i'm getting fed on the news is reactions rather than education which you know i think from the news itself i've never seen one big piece on how to get healthy which is really concerning why is the news not telling all the australian public here's how you can get really healthy you know you should be getting about 30 minutes of sun every day on your chest and back because your chest and your back absorbs vitamin d a lot better than your arms and your legs do and vitamin d is crucial uh crucial for a healthy immune system why why do they not tell people that on the news why do they not help the australian public and there's things that you sit back and you're like you look at this you're like man this is reality but why don't we help our people out because that's what i'm seeing at the moment i'm just like growing up from 1985 to 2020 i just think overall the standard of living is going down and it concerns me when the standard the living drops all the people around you their happiness drops their health drops their wealth drops as well these are all things you don't want in society so anyway uh it's a yeah i to get off this top it just it brings me down yeah so that's uh anyway our ram price is going to increase so basically we've seen a trend um we'll get back to ddr3 remember ddr3 ddr4 ram prices uh i think are going to hopefully just stay the same right now we have seen the prices of ddr3 memory go up that's gone up about 50 percent in a year that's ddr3 that's the old stuff if you want to buy that brand new ssds have stayed relatively the same they've gone up a little bit ddr4 has gone up a bit as well but i haven't seen anything that points towards huge price increases and i think that's due to gpu demand holding back the other industries now if there is pressure from say for instance if there if there is pressure from um say for instance other industries on the gpu business they're like look man no pcs are selling cpus aren't selling rams not selling ssds aren't selling because the gpus aren't selling there may be pressure from the other industries to push nvidia and amd to put these mining limiters in so they can start selling graphics cards again so hopefully um i don't think as long as the gpu supply keeps going to crypto miners then i think the other prices of ddr3 ram and ssds and things like that will be suppressed i think they will be suppressed and they won't go too high because yeah i mean if you if you're selling one ddr4 ram stick at twice the price but you're only selling 25 of what you're selling then you're your company's at a loss these companies have to pay back big loans they have to have revenue if they're not getting revenue then they're going to go out of business regardless of the nature of the economic conditions so ah anyway yeah so all right guys um yeah cool anyone i've been i've been chatting on this stream i've been just chatting chatting away this is like honestly this is one of the weirdest streams like finance podcast channel well i just i you know i'm starting to see what's going around me and i just want the people in australia to to have better than what they got now that's for sure i mean i'm everyone i speak i mean i go out on the street and everyone i speak to man it's all the same opinions you know they're all the same opinions people think the quality of life's gone down and you have to talk about these things i mean sooner or later from a tech channel or whatever you have to talk about these things you have to have open conversations about them because it's worrying people man we're all like i'm worried about i think a lot of people are worried about it you know when the future is as uncertain as it is people need to have reassurance and they're not getting it at the moment from from the powers to be that's all i'm going to say yeah so it's it's very concerning so yeah and i care about my viewers man they're the they're the guys who stuck with me from some of the worst times in my life you know these viewers the viewers out there they when i got divorced men they were all there for me had so many people helping me out behind the scenes um so yeah i care about them and so i want to you know if i can use my platform to help bring people's spirits up and say hey whatever's going through your head right now you're not alone if i can reassure people that and say hey we can just go on and pretend everything's the normal everything's the same when it's not it's clearly not and we want to have some reassurance or something or at least a plan hey have we been given have we been given a plan no there's no plan there's nothing just it's just you know it's like all these issues just keep getting ignored and it's like we're watching all our quality of lives just go down the hill so it's it's just very concerning what's going on now so i'm very concerned and so anyway um yeah so so yeah i mean it's like yeah so do you watch uh russell brand on youtube he's talking about the same problems you're talking about okay that's the guy who was married to katy perry wasn't it russell brandt yeah yeah okay he's on youtube is he making videos on youtube wow okay so so he's talking about the same problems we're talking about here well then he must be concerned well that's that's interesting he must be concerned about he must be concerned about people's well-being in general and that's exactly right we you know we should be competing at the end of the day at the end of the day if society's not running properly then what society you were living in you know what i mean so i think it's in your best even if you are a selfish person you are greedy it's in your best interest in ways to be at least a little bit uh selfless to be a little bit selfless because that's going to better society and then that in turn will better your local community your area um and that's why i like it i've actually been thinking of a series i want to do where i want to um instead you know i see all these fancy um for instance tech saw so i'll pull him up he's he goes and does his setup makeover you know like he'll go to someone's house and give them a whole new setup like just blinged out you know just crazy i want to do like a budget version of that you know where i micro and and put together something and give it away to someone i think that would be really good you know because that in ways i like giving away things locally because it's where i live it's my community and i want to better it so that's one thing i've been sort of working on but anyway anyway guys very concerning i mean i don't know how i go on this tangent it's the end of the month it's the weekend starting soon we should all be happy we should all be gonna get it all out before yeah you gotta get you gotta get it all out so this should just be my own therapy on a live stream um so i'm sure you and i will be on the phone chatting about it all again soon anyway yeah yeah so yeah that's it we'll have a chat any time so yeah anyway yeah that's what i mean that's what robin gray says it's so depressing it shouldn't be no we should cheer up i've never been the type to um to you know for me it's not it's not depressing like for me it's not depressing it's just things that we we kind of have to talk about i think you can go on and ignore it for so long you can keep ignoring it but sooner or later you're going to have to talk about it man um so yeah you know i think it's good but it's good that you boys come on you're also you're all awesome um and it's just yeah good stream so yeah so that's it yeah all right boys so yeah cheer up brian yeah i'll cheer myself up i'm already cheering you yeah well i mean i just yeah i mean venting is healthy so yeah maybe this is the venting um maybe this is the venting live stream but you know i just want to i want to let some i got a lot of some of my viewers out there if they have been having you know like if they've been worried in ways and don't worry you're not alone that's all so you know that's the main point so yeah everyone's uh here for each other if we're all here as a community then um yeah we can pick each other up in this in this weird weird 2021 so yeah anyway fellas uh stay uh hopefully have you got a tournament this weekend i don't we're on off season so we won't have one for a while but um we're just going to be practicing so yeah it's back on the relax a bit yeah yeah i think june 18th is our next one so not for a while okay so you're um so basically you're gonna have a bit of pizza this weekend a bit of you know yeah have some good times man good times um yeah and corey what about you what's what's the plan for the weekend uh building more pcs i think to be honest i'm um i think i'm going to be putting a 5950x in an a3 a520 actually because gigabyte on their website man they were they were touting this a520 is seven phases man they all like look this thing's ready to go so i'm like girl i'll shove it yeah i'll shove the 5950x on there and we'll see how hard she goes so that's um yeah so have a bit of fun but yeah i think yeah i think i will probably branch out to another channel as well and and start making a different channel with different topics because i love discussing it i think if we were more open about discussing things like this and if i'd you know use the platform i guess at the end of the day i've never been shy to do vlogs and talk about uh things that have been on my mind uh you know and things that concern me i think that's a good thing i think and you should always be transparent with your viewers as well like uh don't don't hide anything from them i mean it's okay to be you know it's okay to show emotion and whatnot and talk about things that do concern you so yeah anyway guys uh thanks for tuning in thanks for it was an awesome live stream and um yeah i guess uh you know the nvidia reflex is hopefully that it helps you out in your tournament so hopefully let's see yeah so hopefully that everything goes well for you man i wish you all the best in the uh tournaments and uh yeah well we'll hopefully we can meet at um the packs this year we'll go to pax and we'll meet up and and it'll be cool have a brewski and then yeah hopefully cory's there as well so i'll be there and we'll get some menu logs so there you go that's it yeah all right guys well uh all the best and uh thanks so much we're going to close off this stream and um yeah that was that was interesting thanks for thanks so thank you all for tuning in any closing statements oh hang on hang on hang on before we all go come on pitch and make sure you like make sure you subscribe guys make sure you like even if inflation's 50 guys doesn't matter make sure you hit that like hit that subscribe even if the gpus go up double the prices now make sure you subscribe hit that like be positive that's it let's be let's be positive guys this one if you if you didn't enjoy hit that subscribe button twice oh thanks kevin burnell five bucks thanks brother thanks for the five so awesome all right that was um yeah that was a good live stream thanks for tuning in guys uh thanks everyone for tuning in and uh we'll be back with another video very shortly and uh also thanks boys for i guess um at the start of the stream we're all chatting and then it was just uh i took a took the solo yes so kanye kanye 985 says auto-tune brian so the trick to auto-tuning is to sound terrible and then you auto-tune it yeah so like you have the tones deliberately in there like when i did that eiffel 65 bit in the previous video it was too much of heaven you got the deliberate [Music] yeah and it literally like it literally makes it sound like what they did in the song like i was like wow that kind of sounds pretty similar like yeah so so we'll more auto tune okay so for the a520 video that we'll drop we will put um we will do a bit of auto tune there so that's what it like 2021 it's about bring an auto tune back to the people that's what's going to happen so auto tune we're going to be bringing that power back to the people get your auto tune on i'll teach you guys if you want to auto tune for your viewers i'll teach you how to deal with it okay yeah so i can take a like and subscribe oh yeah right you love it make sure i'll actually i'll get that all right i'll do that on the next video i'll record my voice for you and then you can just chuck it in the auto tune okay yeah done all right you're you're on with the deal so i hope everyone out there has an amazing weekend as well and all the best guys and we've got this cracker lacking um and yeah i'm actually and also the other channel i'm waiting to see if i'm right about i've made some predictions but if i'm right about those predictions then you'll get the other channel that's all so there you go i gotta brush your city that's it gotta prove myself first always gotta always gotta prove yourself that's the main thing right if you just like in your in your rainbow six seeds you gotta prove yourself man people don't wanna follow the guy who doesn't have the the goods doesn't have the experience talk the talk that's it you've got to walk the wall too exactly so if i walk the walk in the next few months and so be it i'll make that other channel it'll be coming so all right guys love you all love everyone out there thanks for tuning in brothers and we will catch you guys in your videos as well peace out for now bye-bye okay look at that straight up straight up guys we're now back to solo look i was ready to crack it i was ready to get a lack and we're back to solo now oh man how we all doing before we get on out of here we'll have a little one to one little heart to heart here guys thank you so much for tuning in guys and um it's been awesome so basically corey and uh rain is also good with the the main thing with the pro gaming i i was very curious about the pro gaming so this was kind of like an off stream i i'm always curious about the young guys coming up i i love the fact that the young guys are getting into pro gaming i liked the especially the reigns attitude that was really good i like to see a guy that's 19 years old with a head on him like that that's amazing and i think this is the kind of guys i want to support myself and i want to watch and i want to back because as much as i like watching the game play i want to watch the guy behind the camera i want to know that he's awesome as well so that's the main one and also thanks for corey corey's actually a really good friend of mine we've become friends ever since we met up in uh pax in 2019 we met up and we had dinner and we just got along like a house on fire so uh that's the main thing guys corey i'm always happy to have him on chat and if um yeah i hope you guys will be back in the next live stream we'll be going back to soly tech it'll be awesome we'll go back to soul tech and talking tech again and um uh we got oh five dollar notion for mike g i bought a hd 7970 for 125 cid what do you think a good buy in today's market i think it's so so uh 125 canadian should be about um should be about sorry sorry we'll better close this one off don't don't don't no more donations okay so i mean i feel bad if i don't answer your question but 100 uh cad to aud so we should be about 100 okay about the same yeah about the same in terms of value um so 125 in value so i think it's okay i mean usually i like to pick them up for a hundred aussie dollars for a 79.70 that's the main thing so if you can get one for around 100 bucks i think you overpaid a little bit and considering against under that four gigabytes three gigabytes it's a perfect sweet spot for value you can get these for around 100 or less at least where i'm at locally so that's the one so anyway that's that one guys so thanks for the donation brother anyway guys uh we got [Music] how's the c9 situation did you get a pass yet ah not yet not yet so there's a there's another reason you know i want to go see my boy over in japan also you guys are requesting i get over to japan and do some content there as well so i'm i'm applying i'm applying i'm trying to get an exemption to go over there to see my son that's one thing that's on my mind so you know my little boy want to go see him over in japan and also do some parts hunts over there see what the situation is i guess i guess a lot of people are you know yeah thank you keep donating peeps make it a marathon stream ugh i do want to get some i don't want to get some lunch soon but yeah thanks awesome guys um uh and so do you think an e3 12 40 v2 is good yeah a very good cpu i mean it depends on what you define as good right if you think uh for me that would be good i could play uh dota 2 i could play starcraft 2. i could play um i could play starcraft 2 i could play cs go i could play all the games that are popular games i think like for me i'm not like when it comes to gaming i like the aaa titles but i think some of the aaa titles have been a big letdown lately um i mean look when i looked at cyberpunk i enjoyed cyberpunk but the fact that they didn't optimize it for like hardware that could even run like even mediocre hardware was running this game so bad so that was a that was a that was a big problem for me so i was like okay no like i'm not doing this guys so uh sorry the chat as well is also uh busted away so um we can just uh oh wait up the chat went on this window but i gotta i gotta close this live stream off soon but i could actually like make the chat come alive again during the live stream that's pretty funny so anyhow anyhow guys anyhow what okay so like i go back to i was about to close off the stream you guys just keep the questions coming in um does it support all core boost i don't know what motherboard to get so it's a third gen a v2 should be a z77 and it should be a third gen iv bridge in terms of the boost the boost is locked on the third gen i believe with the fourth gen xeons so the v3s even though it's v3 it's fourth gen um if we were to compare it to i5 or i7 the v3s were able to get the full turbo unlock on the um on particular boards with the biases so i have seen this firsthand and i know it works and you get some very good value out of that and so do you think i should get a pre-built or custom pc for 500 bucks depends on the specs depends on what's in it mainly look at the graphics card of course if you can get like a even a gtx 1660 which i don't think will happen for 500 bucks but even like a 1060 and they should be good we've also got what do you think of the 11400f love the 11400f i think it's a good value cpu go get a h510 absolutely beautiful the cooler as well will do the job even though they've intel have downgraded the cooler it'll still do the job is defi a bubble um i think all at the moment crypto's in a massive bubble i would compare it to the likes of the dot-com boom if you guys read the stories about the dot-com boom go back and read those stories go back and read the mania surrounding the dot-com boom go back and read some of the companies that were getting pumped it's nothing new it's just history repeating itself all hype and a lot of these cryptocurrencies just don't have the uh the backings to make it a function i mean a lot of these cryptocurrencies are just garbage put it simple and it was like some of these companies like well actually a lot of these companies coming out in the dot-com boom there was just companies that were just going for ridiculous valuations people had to get in they were like oh i've got to get this company and then of course the music stopped and it just went crashing down the floor just came from out from underneath it so do be very careful with any cryptocurrency right now i do think s um ethereum is the one cryptocurrency that has real use it's a functional cryptocurrency now whether that's overvalued i'd say yeah sure um and they they do have to make some improvements on the earth to make it scale better and that's from the research and look i'm sitting on the sidelines with crypto i'm watching it very carefully there is a lot of merit to it i just think there's a lot at the moment it's pretty much very similar to the dot-com bubble right now and of course there's going to be companies like if we look back at the dot-com boom there's going to be your microsoft's your amazons uh your you know your cream of the crops going to be in there somewhere but of course once that bubble bursts then you'll start seeing which ones are still functioning properly and which ones people are getting behind because at the moment it's just a speculative frenzy uh you can see that with some of the you know 10x people people are just joking about too hey man 10x bagger got a 10x background at the end of the day that 10x bagger you've had to take that money from someone else to get that 10x bagger so just keep in mind that nothing is ever for free there's no free lunch so if you've got your 10x bagger take your profits because and then go buy some i would honestly go buy something that has a buffer against real work so anyway anyway we've got a two dollar donation my g our market is really bad r9 290 is 200 damn okay that is really bad right now brian do you see gpu prices going down a 1660 ti is going for 600 last year was 200 yeah so that's i mean yesterday's video we made um i talked about an alternative look at the gpu prices i think if anything when we look at australia if you look at japan you're going to have going forward america itself if we look at the usa there's going to be a very um i think there's going to be a bit of a i'd say a disjoint happening between what's going on in america and other countries because america has some extremely extremely aggressive government printing programs going on and so you might want to look at that and look at what's going on with in terms of shipping containers and products coming in the trade deficits but things could get um input in america things could get worse that's all in terms of australia it relates to again all of it relates to how much money the governments are printing and who's getting that money so if people are getting free money and basically in the form of like things like stemi checks uh the good old stimmy check if you get in the stemi then uh what are you spending it on and i think in america a lot of people are getting these stemi checks and who knows it could be another stimmy check coming around the corner because they just want to keep pumping out money and that will make gpu prices go up even more in america so you've got to look at what's going on now i'd say if we look at going if we look at in terms of focusing on what's going on on an individual country then you'll be able to make an informed decision if we look at taiwan now if you look at the taiwan another thing that i forgot to speak about before with taiwan that was very interesting was their m1 and m2 money supplies the taiwanese government hasn't done the anywhere near the amount of stimulus that in terms of proportion or gdp per capita that other countries have been doing especially the us so isn't it also another surprise or is it also no surprise that gpu prices are the real prices of gpus are subdued in taiwan that's an interesting observation too so there you go but um yeah so marco is like tech yes taiwan so uh um so anyway it's uh let's say uh i i 7 900 k i'm done 28 is super water cooled 20 25. yeah you probably like you'll see um basically what happens when when we've got situations like this uh innovation will will stagnate as well so uh that's why you've already seen up until when we really look at it up until 2020 if we look at 2015 or 2020 really when we look at it uh innovation in ways had stagnated a lot uh we had massive growth of innovation from the 1950s all the way to 2010 i'd say but then things started tappering off big time uh innovation in waze started tabbing off but i just got the gtx 960 for 60 usd does that count as a good deal yeah that's actually a pretty good deal from what i've seen in the us that would be a really good deal in your current environment always look for those cards again four gigabytes of vram or under and you will find a good deal um that's all that's all folks anyway questions let's uh let's get on out of here i have a good weekend everyone i thought i'd just uh talk about the two guests that came on and uh just how sort of uh if you're not sort of if you're only here for the tech as well and not sort of the the whole other thing uh then uh do apologize for that um and uh yeah i look forward to but do let us know also let us know hit the like button also let us know in the comments do you enjoy these conversations again i'm not claiming to have a crystal ball or anything like that but i'm just starting to um i'm just starting to really just think for myself and starting to look at all these trends that are happening and uh never forget the trend is your friend that's the most important thing so uh why six intel six gen's so expensive uh it's because a lot of times six the last question final question six gen would be so expensive because especially the i7 because people still want them believe it or not the i7s people like oh wow i've got this i7 here and it's i want to use it i actually in in ways the why is because people will see the i7 and they'll want to overpay for it so that's why 6gen would be so expensive just because people are willing to overpay for it is a good value hell no i think it's terrible value the 6th gen cpus in their prices right now so do you think it's a good time to upgrade all pc parts except gpus i think it's a good time to have especially if you're in the united states i think it's a good time to get a lot of your pc built while prices are still cheap and then if gpus have a dip get your gpu that's all anyway anyway guys hope that has answered all the questions and i will catch you in the next tech video we'll even get dadman on the next live stream who knows we'll even get dab in on the next live stream so also i had to wear these headphones um just because i had to get hear the conversations without having it creep into the mic and i only had one usb cable so i couldn't use my um i couldn't use my virtuosos anyway q a baby wearing in this live stream i'll even throw out a us accent for you for you guys before i get on out of here basically it's been a tough time in the last few months and uh especially if you're in the market for a gpu and especially if you're in the market for a gpu not the market the the market and like someone's going to come on in and they're going to ask me another question on like brian i3 10 100 or a ryzen 5 2600 and like dude straight up man you've got six cores versus uh four cores but i would look at the other factors like uh can you get the the motherboard for cheap like the h410 versus the b450 so it's like when you weigh all that in which is going to be the overall cheaper platform and i would say potentially they're going to become a rough they're going to work out roughly the same so get whichever is cheapest in your area in terms of performance the 10 100 will probably be better in the games and then the ryzen 5 2600 will do better when it comes to to video editing and that's just you got to look at the market anyway guys i'll catch you in another live stream very soon just remember always watch the market and uh gtx 1060 for 200 should i go for it if you're in the us then i actually would if you need a graphics card desperately are you doing some video editing yeah all right guys i'll catch you in the next one i love each and every one of you hope you enjoy these live streams it will go down we'll go down any tangent i don't care but i'll address the issues that nobody else is addressing because i don't care peace out for now
