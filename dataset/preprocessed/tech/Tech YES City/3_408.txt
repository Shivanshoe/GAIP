it is approaching the end of the month glorious check yes citizens and that can only mean one thing that's right they used PC parts on of the month where this time we have to look out for graphics cards or aka gravis cards I am in a serious need for GPUs where the prices of new GPUs that's including like 16 60 supers 20 60 s and 5600 X T's and stuff those prices have gone up a little bit in Australia and that's because of you guys should know what by now but the use markets kind of getting dry and it has been in the last couple of months where they use GPUs were pretty overpriced so we're gonna try the best we can to sift through deals and of course my eye is always on the market for risin as well as i7 so we're gonna be tell you a quick look for that stuff as well plus we're going up to Brisbane to go see less and see what deals he's got for us which is kind of becoming a monthly thing anyway but one thing is for sure is you've got to be quick on your toes just like that wallaby and that butcher bird out in the back though Before we jump in the yes 'mobile and hit the streets let's check out what we can find and see what deals are available on marketplace and good old gam tree [Music] [Applause] [Music] so going from the first deal to the last deal here we've got a B for 50m ds3 H multiplied now usually these go for about $100 brand-new but I'm gonna offer in 60 they've got an asking price of 70 so hopefully they take that it should be on the way to Brisbane - so not far out of the way now this is a decent board if you aren't into overclocking if you're just going to whack in say a rise at seven twenty seven hundred not overclock that this will do an okay job now moving over to to ten fifty TI offerings we're going to place our offers of a hundred and thirty Ozzie on both see if we can snag them up and then after that we've got a GTX 1060 which will put down an offer of a hundred and forty because we said before this climate even though it's a three gigabyte model and I've picked these up for cheaper in the past the climate is dictating the prices and unfortunately this one here it's giving me an error message so I'm guessing that it's already sold in the time that I'd pull up this listing and I'm putting in the offer making the video content for you guys yeah that's that's exactly what happened but move over now we've got a GTX 1080 and they're asking for hundred Aussie which is right around kind of fair so considering again that climate and what the market is like GPU prices are going up on the new end which is going to flow down to the used end I'm gonna drop in the four hundred asking on this which I don't usually do but they're getting back on March seventh so that's over a week away like eight or nine days so I'm guessing by the time that happens they'll have a few offers in their inbox though a move on X will go to GTX 970 they're asking 150 owner drop in an offer of 120 a little bit over what I usually like to get them for but again it's a g1 gaming edition so it goes pretty hard and yeah I need GPUs though moving over to Verizon an i7 I really came up empty-handed here except for that motherboard at the start and I also found someone selling a 4770 for pretty cheap so I put down an offer of that but in terms of everything else like rising CPUs in I sevens like doesn't even matter what generation there's really nothing available on marketplace or Gumtree at the moment so hopefully liz is able to solve that problem for us but speaking of marketplace we've got here in our x4 I have 70 available for a hundred and twenty-five bucks I may offer them just a smooth 100 even or even a little bit low we'll go for ninety just to see if they take that off law next up there's a GTX 750 - you can buy twin a drop-in and offer 40 Ozzie on that and then last up there is a 1050 TI again with that hundred and thirty AUD price point we're gonna see if they take it though this may be the same one on gumtree however they are asking $25 less so it might actually be a different model so we're in a bit of a rush because I've got to beat primetime traffic on the highway because we go on to Brisbane now but the person with the 1050 TI one of them the low-profile version they got back to me and said 130 Ozzie was ok I've got to go pick it up before 5:00 p.m. and I was like look I'm leaving now so it just came through and picked this up which is the good thing is it's pretty close to the highway so this is only like 10 or 15 minutes out of my way so this is the first deal snapped it up really good let's hit that highway and see what else we can get [Music] ha to call up the boy there's no food enjoy my [Music] so we just finished up at Lisa's place and behind me you'll see some new cases and that's because there's a weird story behind that I used to go get some like cheap RGB cases that you see on the channel there was a local supplier for that Robina they'll called msy but they closed their shop down at Robina and apparently they've been closing their shops down at other suburbs near where I live and there's only like one left I believe and that's in a bet half way from where I come from and where I went to lezzies house today so we stopped off there on the way got some cases but there's a pretty good thing anyway let's really only had three systems that I was interested in one was x58 so I know a lot of you guys will get excited I didn't really check out too much of the other specs in there so we will analyze them once we get back to the tech yes studio but from here on in we're going to go pick up the 4770 we looked at that i7 deal and they said they already sold one but they had another one for 60 bucks and I said yeah I'll take that straightaway so we're going to pick up that 47 70 now the good news was - there was a 1050 TI that we picked up but there was also another temperature and they got back to me yeah but they're like they're like right up north Brisbane so I might give that a Miss just because you gotta go all this way through dense traffic and it is pretty busy now in traffic then we get it all the way back and it's just such a waste of time so we're gonna give that one a pass anyway let's go pick up the rest of these deals and get back to the headquarters [Music] and we just picked up this 47 7460 isay and then I asked him if he had any more he said he had one more so I picked that up as well so 120 in total for two pretty good CPUs that do have good resale especially that's what I'm most concerned with and the person that picked it up beforehand apparently was a techie from Southport so what's up ad you got to make sure when you get PC parts you could always ask him if they've got more and here we are back at base and before we get into the mystery boxes I did get a reply on the RX 570 on the marketplace they said they already sold it for asking price that's 125 ozzie dollars which is in ways reflecting the current situation of the GPU market so one can only hope that like the RT X 3000 series comes as soon as possible so please I'm begging you gents and I've never begged you in the past before but please bring these GPUs as soon as possible but besides that we've got a gtx 1080 guy he did reply and said he would take the 400 ozzie for his 1080 when he gets back but then again who knows and when he gets back if he's ready to do the deal or not so that's looking like it's pretty good but that's for the other 1050 TI guy end up being too fast so we skipped that one he did want to post it to us for an extra $12 so I'll weigh up the options but 130 s kind of like the max I'm prepared to pay for a 1050 t I even given the current situation the GPU market where I will do another search tomorrow morning because I do want to get a little bit more than what we've got so far on the desk even though it's a decent chunk I still am looking for more GPUs and we've only got one so far that's a low profile 1050 Ti which is cool and all but considering I started out looking for GPUs really I've ended up with three more desktops and seven hard drives and two i7 4770k here we've got the three systems on the desk and I recorded this last night but unfortunately the mic wasn't plugged in properly I didn't notice until this morning but let's go through each and every one of these rigs and the first one here being the most impressive to me and that is x58 and it's got an i7 920 in it and I'm not sure if this motherboard will take a 6 cores eon because some of the older msi boards especially on x58 here they weren't that good to begin with but some of them on top of that didn't take the 6 cores eons because they didn't have support for the qpi link of 2 and even the W 3680 for example wouldn't work either because the support just wasn't there but this one's got 12 gigabytes of RAM one terabyte hard drive and also a GT 1030 which I can take out and put in a real budget rig maybe even one of these two here and sell it as a budget fortnight gaming rig because it is a gddr5 version so it can play fortnight 1080p lowest settings absolutely fine we've also got a 500 watt power supply which makes this one the grand prize of these three rigs where I've got all these three rigs here for 280 Ozzie in total so that was a pretty good deal even though let's put some different prices on the list I mean for example he wanted 144 this system here with an FX 4100 I said dude you just like you're dreaming at that price he said I don't know what's it worth thinks he didn't really know the older FX series and this is the four core version I mean if it was the eight core version he could probably get a little bit more but this one's packed with a one terabyte hard drive eight gigabytes of RAM basic cooler basic motherboard and some random graphics card but it's also got a decent power supply in there so chucking something like a 1050 Ti and this would make for a decent build even in 2020 then the last one here is an i-5 at 2500 8 gig of ram some again random graphs got 1 terabyte hard drive and a half decent power supply that will just like this one take a 1050 Ti or something like that absolutely fine though this is one of those cases where I did a build with this one in the white version with an i3 you guys may remember a while ago and this is like these upside-down components inside the HP mate then people make those jokes about it's perfect for Australia being upside down anyhow we also got seven hard drives for those being one tear bite and three of those been two terabyte for two hundred dollars in total 247 70s for 120 and a 1050 TI for a hundred and 30 so that brings the whole total here to I believe around 745 Aussie dollars which is a little under 500 USD at current market rates so do let us know in the comments section below what you guys think was the best deal amongst the mix of parts here we've got so far but anyway let's get on gumtree and Facebook and see if we can find some last-minute deals and here we are all freshened up for the next day and there's not a whole lot fresh on the marketplace except this 1080 TI that I saw her available for three hundred and sixty-five Aussie now I looked at this and there was already like six other offers and I've put in asking price but I'm pretty sure that's already gone even though it's about a five hour drive I do have a friend who lives at that location it's called coffs harbor so I'm seeing if I can tee up that purchase because that would be one of the best deals if I could land that that I've gotten in a long time other than that I checked out RX graphics cards from AMD even like 290 and 390 X's and stuff there was just nothing available GTX and video we've already hit that up and the good news is that 1050 Ti the low profile that we got that's working absolutely fine I tested it out also all the computers from les he always pre-tests all his stuff before he sells it so I know that they're all good as well though yeah this month has just been pretty different and we're gonna talk about that right now because it feels like with things going on out there at the moment at least in Australia it's coming to like a very big slow down I feel and so the only way to go through these rainy days is to of course be diligent disciplined and stick to your prices and just wait it out because I noticed I've told you a lot of people behind the scenes and PC sales are slowing down as well me personally I've experienced a big slowdown in the latter half of this mom it's pretty crazy like how quick things can change they just go from great to like down so there's that element that you've got to look out for and if you're looking for parts at the moment I feel like GPUs are starting to become back in big demand that's one thing I'm definitely noticing with a lot of used I sevens and stuff like that especially fourth gen stuff that's starting to flow through in Mass because businesses are getting rid of that stuff and upgrading and then there's rising to compete with that so basically what you'll see from here I feel is a trend to where motherboards older I sevens and ddr3 will be in pretty mass supply so you'll be able to pick that stuff up cheap but then on the flip side you'll have to still get a good power supply case SSDs have gone up in price hard drives which is why I snapped up hard drives from less here they're going to be pretty pricey as well so the bare-bones kit is going cheap but everything else is going up in price so that's one thing I am worried about at the moment and also speaking of people who did and didn't get back to me the GTX 970 guy replied and they said 120 was a fair offer but he was hoping to get a little bit more so keep my offer in mind the other people would like the motherboards and some of the other stuff that I mentioned before they just didn't get back to me so basically were gonna forget that those offers existed but I've also been calling around and seeing what else I can get and there is a potential deal coming up where I can get 5 GTX 1060 s for about a hundred and fifty ozzie a pop so I'm I'm really hoping that goes through because that'll sort of give me a bit of an alleviation for graphics cards in the immediate short-term so I'm gonna be keeping my eyes out for especially things like GTX 10 60s and 10 70s because prices like these on Ice Evans when you get up to 60 hours a pop that's really good play and with all that out of the way I hope you enjoyed February's used PC parts on of the month if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comments section below what you think of the current situation in the use and the new scene in the tech market at the moment as well as that particular thing that's causing havoc even stretching as far as stock markets now so it's a weird outlook for the future adds a down time kind of at the for me especially and you probably thinking how do you remain so positive through that and that's the only thing you can do through anything really is just remain focus for the bad and the good times however before I get on out of here we've got the question of the day which comes from sky strobe and they asked did no one try to overclock this CPU and they're referring to this video out up here the 9900 T where it's essentially a locked CPU on 9th gen and Intel have been locking CPUs since 2nd gen and there's pretty much no way you can get around overclocking them unless a BIOS manufacturer puts in a certain work around which they cracked down pretty much after fourth gen on that and in terms of a 9910 overclocking you may be able to get it on a really good motherboard a few hundred megahertz higher with a big clock overclock but that's the best you're going to be able to do it's a locked multiply you're not really getting any serious overclock stay out of that thing and actually did try taking it above that three point three you get Hertz level manually it just didn't take the old cause anywhere after that so it's actually manually locked in the firmware on the CPU itself anyway I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying the content around take a city then you know what to do and I'll see you next time peace out for now bye [Music] you
