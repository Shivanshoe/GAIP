um excuse me mate but what exactly are you doing slithering you say slithering for what graphics card yeah i'm going to eat you miners now wait that's impossible i thought free money was here to stay forever if you want to get rid of this annoying activating windows message then today's video sponsors cd keys has you covered as little as 12 us dollars after you enter that coupon code bftyc you can copy yourself a legit single user license today leave the description below what is solitalytherin tech yes citizens today we have graphics cards and this was a deal that someone contacted me about they're clearing out their shed and i was like well let's have a look at what's going on because later on in the afternoon there's also more graphics cards that are coming up for sale this was on a different ad that i checked out so it seems like maybe people are starting to sell these graphics cards because they know perhaps what's to come and they're getting out early but regardless i do have to sell pcs and it's always good to have gpus which i'm pretty low on at the moment now the person who's selling me these cards they have said they have been used for mining and since four gigabyte cards have run out in terms of their usage for ethereum mining that means we can come in and swoop up a deal now there is a few things i'm going to test there's also some negotiation that has to happen since i did kind of pre-negotiate 120 aussie dollars per card but that does depend on the condition and if any of the fans are broken as well as me also trying to test out one of the cards so let's get straight into the tech guest mobile and be a slytherin snake but we're going to be like a good snake not one of those snakes that are in the grass we're going to be a transparent and open snake that's going to catch the prey and that is my haircut [Music] huh [Music] minor [Music] boy after this deal we're going to get back to the studio and talk about this because this was a lot more than i expected and uh from here on in i'm i guarantee you my phone's going to be going off the hook with so-called mates they're going to be ringing me up like rhino you got marx 574 gigabyte bro that's probably after they asked me like oh man been a long time how are you doing brad how you doing bro [Music] and we're now back at the tech yes studio where we've got a lot to talk about with this deal because this was literally like a whole parts hunt in one pickup i've got so much stuff here which i've got to talk about segregate but of course we'll get the pricing done on what i managed to negotiate at the said person's house now these here were six cards in a rig he said that most of this stuff should work but he's going to sell them and i inspected the cards i mean look these cards look like they haven't seen much usage like when we're talking mining if people have been mining on them for years you'll see grime and little bits of dirt where it just has made its way over years of mining these look like they're mined on like you said for around about six months and so that means that they've got a lot of life left in them and so what we're looking at here now is when i did negotiating on the spot i was like okay well there might be room for one or two of these to fail when he was using him for mining but the rest should be okay so we ended up doing the whole cards uh 16 in total there's also one in the box for eighteen hundred dollars aussie and so i was pretty happy with that he was happy with that as well and then this one since it was attached to a mining bench he was just like look there's a cpu in there a motherboard and a 1200 watt power supply and i was like well how much do you want for that he just said you can take all that for a hundred dollars i said sure thing let's do that let's hook that deal up because i mean there's other things like four fans right here on the mining rig so there's a lot of gear here that's worth good money now when we move on to this right here there's two power supplies uh gold rated power supplies i said how much do you want for them since they are gold rated and they're modular he did know that they're worth a little bit more i offered him 50 each but he said look 150 for the pair but then i turned around and said because he i did go through he took me through his place and showed me everything he had and he said like these monitors man i really just want to get rid of them i'd ask like even just five bucks and i'm like okay well i'll do you 150 for the power supplies and you chuck in these monitors so i've got four monitors here and two of these gold rated power supply 750 watts for 150 aussie then we've got this magical box right here which is just i've got to segregate this and then i'll show you guys what's inside because i actually gotta because i'm not gonna some of these cases are just really old and banged up where i'll have to separate the good parts out of these as well but i ended up after that getting a whole box about 10 hard drives and an ssd for a hundred dollars and then i ended up getting a heap of ddr3 cpu motherboards just untested and for fifty dollars so that was 150 and then he just said on top of that uh what would you do um for these other cases here they've got like ddr3 computers in them and stuff like that and i just said look i'll give you another 50 bucks so we ended up getting like a whole box just full of pc parts all these uh ddr3 systems untested for an additional 200 so we ended up just like literally just cleaning up here i have to tally it up in my head 1800 100 150 200 so that leaves us with 350 to 250. so 2250 aussie dollars we picked up all this for i'll put the usd pricing up on the screen for you guys but now what i'm going to do is actually pull this stuff apart segregate it into what i want and what i don't want but all i'm going to say is honestly is that this just feels like i don't know probably you can hear it in my voice just like a sign of relief it's kind of like i needed a fix to be honest i it's been a while since i've been able to pick up a bulk deal that's just had so much goodness in it because the market for a long time now for at least six months has been in this state of depravity and i'm just like now i'm feeling the turning point i'm seeing the light it's coming through not just for the hustlers it's coming through for the gamers so this is the pass-on effect that happens when we get in these bubbles gamers and hustlers alike we just don't buy the overpriced stuff it just sits there and so it gets to the stage where they want to sell it and then they see okay maybe the profits are falling because he just said to me these cards are no longer profitable at all so he wants to get rid of them and so you're going to see that effect if people are buying up four gigabyte graphics cards and they can't really make profit on them they're going to start selling them but let's see what we got here in all its glory [Music] and here it all is on the table after decoupling everything and organizing it we've now got uh two gigabyte sticks of ram four gigabyte sticks of ram and then eight gigabytes six sticks of ram here so you know in total i'd say we got nearly a hundred gigabytes of ddr3 memory which was absolutely awesome and we've got 11 hard drives and also some ssds five effect five ssds and an additional uh laptop hard drive there too where they did have some laptop memory so maybe they pulled apart a laptop or something like that but in total we did pull out three potatoes on top of the rx 570s and then i've got assorted motherboards here with just different cpus i actually haven't checked out the cpus yet but when i go to build budget gaming rigs i will then take a look at what cpus they have because i do have a heap of i5s for instance second third and fourth gens in my stack so it doesn't matter if these have pentiums in them or celerons i can switch them out because i'm guessing maybe some of these were used even though you got mining motherboards here i'm guessing they still used the old z68s because they only had four gigabytes of ram in them for mining as well so eight motherboards in total and then we had for power supplies we had here also additional eight power supplies so absolutely clean up this is like i just i'm really shocked at how much i got way more than i bargained for with this one i mean even though some of these power supplies are just office pcs or you know to reference cs go that's uh it's been diffused but some of these other power supplies very usable even this 500 watts earth watts will do a good job i wouldn't even be surprised if this thing could power an rtx 3080 with say an i7 10 700 f but at the start of this video i promised two different pickups and so that means we've still got one more collection to go do so if you get a good deal and another good deal comes up why stop there so let's go check out this next one see what graphics cards we can still pick up [Music] and now we're back after the second trip and i have two working 960s that i've been told that were guaranteed working so we picked these up for it was 85 each because i did buy the three working cards so i got two 960s and a 660 which is funny because it's gonna be so weird i guess this is just how it goes with random nature i had a pc over there where i had a graphics card it's gone now i just sold it because i had to come back i went did the hustle come back got the card and the 660 in this batch worked fine but the problem was the card i had before that which was one of these cards i picked up i was told it was working and i got in this box here but this did not work so once it worked but once you got the driver installed it just clogged out so that happens with some of the older amd cards and you're really out of luck if you want to get it working after that it's just not going to work and so that 660 was came in clutch because it's like literally the only card that i would have replaced it with on that price point so that's just how you get like i guess you get unlucky but kind of get lucky at the same time so two cards and another card that was working for 200 bucks and that was aussie and then we got here a ryzen 5 3600 and they just asked us look do you want to rise in 5 30 sunday i'm like well you know it kind of didn't really need one but if the price is right sure so we've got two a320 boards here which he said he's not sure if they work but he did both of those with the 3600 for uh 200 bucks so that was i was like happy with that that's a decent pickup that's a decent score there and then um we got here a box of graphics cards but these ones he said they he's unsure like he just doesn't know if they work or not so he hasn't he's tried some of them he said they're either artifacting or giving out some weird problems or he just hasn't tested them yet so i was like look what i'll do is i'll test them out and if they work or if i can get them working i'll hook you up some money after the fact if not i can either just chuck them out or give them back to you and he was actually really cool with that so really cool he's um actually ended up being uh jaden his name was jaden he was in the discord he hangs out on the channel he's a local here so it's always cool to meet you guys just personally as well and and have a chat ended up having quite a big chat which was cool and then there was some ddr3 memory here which uh he said again was just all untested stuff so he's is not sure if the sticks don't work if they're incompatible with certain motherboards which in the case of like if we take for instance some of these corsair sticks i've found in the past that they can work on certain boards then if you pair them with certain other boards they just won't work so i'll be going through those this is the have to go to through pile and then uh see what does work but other than that we've got here a score of uh was it 2 650 aussie dollars for now just a table full of stuff so there's a lot to go through but all in all this is hopefully a precursor of what is to come later this year when crypto just goes busto cryptogo busto and that's all we can hope for hashtag crypto go busto get ready because if you are ready you can pick up some really good deals now for what i'm going to be doing with this i'm going to be doing cheap gaming pcs that's what i do i do flip flip keep cheap gaming pcs so i'm putting these in gaming pcs making my cut someone gets a really like the cheaper i get this stuff for the cheaper my gaming pcs become so i get the cut someone gets a really good deal on a gaming pc everybody's happy at least in australia now one thing i'm going to say before i move on out of this video is that we'll actually go we'll get down on the hot seat we'll start talking about more tech and more stuff let's get on that hot seat first sitting down talking to you guys about what happened here today it was just an absolute replenishment a rejuvenation session something that i've needed in a fur i've been just the last like honestly the last six months of tech have just gotten like for me it's just like boringer more boring more boring more boring and now today marks something exciting for me where it feels like i can get back into this stuff i can start looking for deals again it can start getting exciting again and i know there's going to be guys out there like well dude crypto's still amazing crypto profitability is still there but yeah i think it's going to start peaking out and i think especially if we look at people who are willing to buy these new graphics cards i would look at rtx 3080s there's not too many people willing to buy them for two and a half thousand here in australia so there is that they're available and they're available in the marketplace and so when they're available that means there's supply it's just the price is too high and so that's starting to cure the supply glut and that there is now supply and when we also look at the 6700 xt and stuff like that those cards are in stock you can buy them and so there is that alleviation happening now it's in the process of happening and so i think people are starting to be a little bit more patient and they're starting to wait for the prices at least on graphics cards to adjust a little bit and i think the people who are now heavily deep into mining with crypto and they've got their mad 72 rtx 3060 ti benches they're probably like the guy who bought that say for instance we did that recent video put the link up here where we looked at that 80 000 purchase that someone made the 72 rtx 360s or whatever that person who bought it is probably switched on his system and he started mining and he's probably like damn i paid 82 grand for this here's my power bill here's my profit and uh this thing is going to take a while to get all this money back and i think that's the reality that's setting in so now a person who got ripped off for 82 grand on his rtx 360 ti's he's probably not too keen now to go out and buy some more rtx 3060 ti's and then we've got on top of that the guy who initially sold the rtx 3060 ti he's probably got a bit of a tough time now trying to pick up his next 72 card batch off the distributor that's john mcproffitty so john mccarthy is probably having a bit of a hard time setting uh setting himself up for another hit so you've got this whole market that's just in a different dynamic now and it's to the point where guys like me who love doing the just the price performance gaming pcs there's a bit of an opening and it's starting to creep on in because who's going to want to buy i mean for instance these guys who are flipping their mining rigs and doing all this mining stuff they haven't got a clue about making gaming pc so when they look at the four gigabyte cards they're like well this isn't going to return me any money so then we've got guys like me who's like well the four gigabyte card i can play around with this i can i can make a gaming pc and put together some value put together some magic tech yes magic and i can make my profit and that's what's happening that's what's going to happen from here on in so get ready get ready because there's going to be some fire some magic some tech yes magic hitting the channel very soon and also another thing is too i was a little bit surprised lately um people message me and like you know like bro like where's the video and i kind of haven't had it in this way where it's like you guys enjoying the economics mixed in with the tech because i'll kind of just keep fusing the two together i mean i have been doing a lot of research in the last few months and that's probably why i haven't been uploading as much because i think i'm trying to educate myself above the trash education that we receive at schools nowadays so and uh university for me i'm just like let's i'm just going to be straight up honest i pretty much got a trash education at university i'm not going to lie about that looking back so there's a lot in one video i don't know we're going on these tangents but let's just keep going and then i you know and then i'm looking around and i'm looking at other channels and just the whole tech scene has just gotten a little bit boring so i'm going to try and bring that yes that energy to you guys where you want to watch where you're hanging for the next video because there's going to be something new in a tech yes video whether it be slithering around on the carpet looking for picking up some mining rigs off people or we're just going and doing some technomics doesn't really matter i'm going to keep making that content for you guys and there's going to be a lot more juicy stuff because this stuff really has rejuvenated the mojo man it's it's really brought it back and hopefully we can share that energy just like uh but do actually do let us know before we get on the question of the day do to let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite part of today's deal are you one of those people like man i'm liking the hard drives or i'm liking those rx5s i mean for me mostly the rx 570 has just been like a fix i've needed graphics cards and i needed like a a trusty supply that i could hang back on and keep making them gaming pcs up so this was a big break for me and i'm hopefully there's more to come so i'm gonna be definitely looking for those four gigabyte cards that's in the next uh month and don't worry the parts aren't still coming later this month even though this feels like a part-time it's actually not but i will be getting that done too anyway question day here comes from uh banabatov nith and they are i don't know if that's his name i'm just like i can't read it at all anyway they asked what is multi-purpose spray question mark and uh multi-purpose spray is multi-purpose spray it's used for different purposes now but i think what he's trying to ask is i think that's a russian name and they're trying to ask like what's in multi-purpose spray what is it exactly it's i believe it's fish oil believe it or not it's fish oil and just fish oil is the cure for everything apparently and fish oil is amazing so that's what multi-purpose sprays cleans all this stuff up uh lubricates it cleans all the dirt off it's just and it's non-conductive non-capacitive so you can spray it on anything and you're still good to go so hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that like button hit that sub line ring that bell and i'll catch you in another video soon peace out for now right you
