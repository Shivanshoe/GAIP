today and also in the next video we publish we're going to be helping out two flood affected victims here at the channel where i heard about their problems and they're having issues with their pcs where this one thankfully managed to escape water damage but they were saying that the pc was overheating and then the next one that we're going to be fixing in the next video that got completely submerged in flood water so stay tuned for that one as that's going to be one big mission for the yes man but in today's video we're going to go through this pc here why it's overheating it is the am4 ryzen platform and we're also going to be giving it some complimentary tech yes loving so let's get the show started never pay full price for windows 10 or 11 again with today's video sponsor scd keys you can get activated for as little as fifteen dollars using that coupon bftyc links in description below so immediately booting this pc up i wanted to check the symptoms and what problems this pc was giving out now one thing i'll say is if the pc has been submerged in water do not try to turn it on because you could short something and permanently damage it but since i found out this pc had not been submerged in water i actually wanted to find out what the exact issue was before it came in here and so what i found was there was no boot device so i believe the person took their main boot device out to maybe perhaps risk not losing their data and this is actually a really smart move in my opinion but i always and i mean i stress this to you guys if you have data that you cannot afford to lose make sure you always have a second backup drive with that data on it in case something happens however we decided to install an ssd for them and reinstall windows so in order to stress test these components i've got three of my favorite programs that are very quick easy to download and will give you near instant results and show you if something is wrong in terms of temperatures or of course performance first program is hardware monitor this is used for checking temperatures of not just your cpu and your gpu but also other things like your vrm or your ssd and hard drives so it's very useful program to get accurate readouts of what could be a problem we've also got unigene heaven this is for stress testing the gpu loading it up to 100 then we've also got cinebench r23 and this is used for loading up the cpu so what we're going to do is we're going to start off with the graphics card here load it up and then see if that's having any issues [Music] [Applause] so we've now just tested the gpu out and that's running absolutely fine we had 100 utilization the whole way through the benchmark the temperatures stayed under 70 degrees and the fans didn't get really loud at all so that means that the graphics card is absolutely fine there's really no need to pull it all apart i mean we will clean it a little bit later there's no reason to pull this one apart and change the thermal paste because it doesn't need it but now it's time to test out the cpu and then see what that is running like [Music] and finishing up on the cpu test now the temperatures were 80 degrees max running cinebench r23 and believe it or not this is actually normal for ryzen where i believe the maximum temperature on the ryzen 5 2600 which is the cpu inside here is 95 degrees that's where it starts getting into the danger zone the throttling zone and the center bench score was pretty much right on 7000 points which is a little bit lower than normal from my experience and this motherboard the temperatures on that were fine all the other temperatures on the drives and the ram they all looked good so perhaps the problem that eddie was having and that's the person who owns this pc was their actual drive that they took out perhaps it was faulty or on its way out and it was causing stuttering and issues and maybe even giving out a blue screen and they thought it was just immediately went to the cpu and that's where the problem was but what we're going to do from here on in is just give this some tech yes loving that's where we clean this thing tip to toe and then we're actually as a final test just going to play some games on it and just see if it's an overall smooth experience [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] and here is the final product after the tech yes loving has been complete and you may notice the leds around these red fans they are just glowing the rgb memory is now just glowing like new and i've also decided as a bit of a present for eddie to add in and change his cooler from the wraith stealth to the wraith prism which also has a bit of rgb bling of its own but also is a better cooler and so what we've done is we've run now re-run that cinebench stress test and the temperatures on this ryzen 5 2600 happy to report have dropped roughly 20 degrees now maxing out at 61 degrees celsius and also another benefit of this is the cinebench scores have gone from 7 000 points to 7 300 points so this pc is just functioning like brand new at least from what i can tell so far and from here on in i'm actually going to play a bit of dota 2 and just run that final stress test play it for a couple of hours and then also overnight i'll leave it running a couple of stress tests and wake up in the morning and hopefully this thing hasn't crashed [Music] so and we've woken up now to some good news and that is this pc has been running a stress test all night and it's absolutely fine there is nothing out of the ordinary and also when i was playing some dota 2 last night there was no stuttering whatsoever it's a very smooth experience and nothing crashed and we can present this pc now back to eddie and hopefully it will put a smile back on their face but one thing about the flood affected victims is that a lot of these people didn't expect um such a massive flood in such a short amount of time where in 2011 in australia where i'm where i live right now is a place called southeast queensland there was also some really heavy and big floods and usually these floods will be a once-in-a-lifetime type event floods that are this big and uh it's happened sort of two times now in 10 years and so a lot of people in these flood affected areas have unfortunately been affected very hard and so if i can help out in one way that would be doing what i know how to do and that's fixing gaming pcs and so what i'm doing here for eddie today is just a way for me to say i hope things get better and also we're going to have the next pc come along as well where that one's going to be a very very in my opinion difficult job to get working again but i'm going to definitely enjoy doing that and also showing you guys along the way and also what we saw in today's video is me showing you guys how if you get a pc in you can sort of take these steps to diagnose what a problem could be and so we found out this pc wasn't submerged in water but apparently it was having heat problems and then from there i started to diagnose what was wrong step by step and also the three programs that we used in today's video i'll put the links in the description below for you guys so if you come into similar issues and you want to try and diagnose problems for friends and help people out then it's going to be a lot easier for you to do so and with that aside i hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comments section below did you enjoy the tech yes cleaning process here today and also have you helped out friends in your community recently love reading your thoughts stories and opinions as always down below just like this question of the day here which comes from sean tran and they ask at tech yes city you're coming to japan is it permanent or just visiting like for only a few months so yes to answer the first question i am coming to japan and is it permanent uh i've got a three month visa so that was what i was allowed to get to go see my son however i realize whether it's in japan or australia one thing after this whole cv thing is that i don't want to leave my son again it's been very tough these last two years not seeing him due to being separated me being in australia and him being in japan so it has been very tough i'm going to try and work something out to have my son maybe come back to australia or i stage bent i don't know just yet but uh it's as it stands i'm going there for three months so hope that answers that question and with that aside i will catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell to get the content as soon as it drops and also if you want some behind the scenes vlog access you can hit that join button and become a youtube member as little as a dollar a month and also get some other perks in the process i'll put some links in the description below for you guys with that aside i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] yes
