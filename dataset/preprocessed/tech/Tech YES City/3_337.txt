we are going live back with Greg cells are so Mic Check one two Mic Check one two can I get a mic check I cannot hear you wait what you turned on your headphones and your mic is off now Greg I think we gon live wait uh uh yeah I can't hear you anymore can you hear me hold on yep okay your mics really soft now yeah you're on the virtuosos it's switched over to you I was gonna say yet and yeah so you're on your virtuoso just as we went live he put his virtuoso headset on guys and and yeah that's what happened sorry okay yep so we're good to go a bit of technical difficulty just switch your virtuoso off maybe okay now you got yeah you know you good okay alright yeah your audio just went to like something bad something bad happened all the sudden with your audio it's yeah it's kind of waning in and out of existence okay yeah your skype has gone really bad uh-uh okay this is guys we've got to have a fail every now and then so yeah I don't know what happened man your voice just started going in and out like I can't even hear you know yeah yeah I mean chats like yeah very low volume Greg yeah they can hear us but yeah your volume is just gone and as soon as you switch the heads guys this is a technical difficulty right as we hit live yeah like you do you have another mic you can quickly switch to no I have the webcam yeah just switch to something quickly man something happened on your end like about that oh yeah oh yeah that's like yeah okay we're good anyway we're good now you're good yeah I I do not know what happened I'll just pull out a stream labs but yeah talk to me yeah check one yeah okay your audios decent now I don't know what happened to you condense the minds is that coming through you can we tap that yeah well no I can't hear you tapping your mind nope right there okay I can hear the tap but it's going through another one anyway you're good to go let's do the livestream you're good you're good something just happened right as he went live yeah but not my audio is garbage no one wants to hear me coming through a web cam I just I do if we can get the show done because this is the thing this is like this is gonna we're gonna start off the stream now with a quick he should have used the virtuoso that's like plug the USB cable is it yeah but was it not working literally ten seconds before I turned this why is turning this on yep any trash we can bite at the style live stream we can do a quick how-to so you get the USB cable you plug it into the headset turn the headset on and then you talk oh is that how you that's how I got a guy I gotta get him back is that we started the live streams and he's roasted me about technical difficulties on my in like the live stream I this week I was like good to go I had everything ready thumbnail done and I was like did everything's on point and then I hit the life go live and Greg's condenser mic went and cut out and I don't know like what happened to his deck so anyway right our DNA - we got a beautiful show up ahead for you guys our DNA - you guys wanted to talk about it last week we're gonna talk about it this week and we've also got our TX 3080 pricing 3090 pricing a little bit of announcement like a little bit of an update I've heard through the grapevine about 3000 series so we'll talk about that and everything else in between let's talk about some cool new tech news a gtx 1650 ultra crisis remastered this is gonna be the new meme coming in because the system requirements don't live up to what I feel is going to be a requirement of the game itself but other than that we got our quick sponsors here Corsair virtuoso and I'll just quickly plug that Greg should have been using his so just quickly show the yet there we go if Greg had his virtuoso on he wouldn't have had these technical difficulties it looks like the gone up like this sold out or something so that that kind of sucks but yeah so the virtuoso like they've only got a special edition in stock so I mean it's a good headset it's a great headset so then we've got the next sponsor up here is SCD keys they got the pro-am keys I think a the much better than an eBay key these are single end-user license you can get eighteen percent off use the coupon code TYC on a Windows 10 Pro om global license so with that aside we now have our DNA - now have you heard the slides that have been going around 50 percent more performant performance per watt with our DNA - this is what empties Tony over our DNA one way they go on low they got an error like 50% more than the previous our Jeunesse yeah so this is the thing right there's the thing with our DNA the first generation we got 25% more performance per watt with 7 nanometer then we got the architectural improvements so that added around about 50% right over the previous generation of GCN but this time around I mean I gotta say getting straight into it go on with like 50 percent is going another 50 percent it's good I feel like it's gonna be really hard if they're sticking well we know they're sticking on 7 nanometer so like where's this extra 50 percent going to come from because were you were you there at the LA event last year for the 5700 XT launch no that was ok so you weren't there ok so basically they're they told us like our DNA to is gonna be a new thing it's going to be the next like 10 years or so we're on our DNA like the whole core of this architecture and then after that it was kind of like well is this all we're gonna get kind of thing so the fact that our DNA - is gonna be this huge performance jump I am a little bit skeptical coming into that that's all like yeah what do you think are you capable here okay Debbie Debbie said don't be sad about your condensed and dying as soon as I hit the livestream button it's okay oh it's not dead I'm pretty sure just a priority change actually yeah I'm okay there we go okay Greg no it's still it's gone bad again yeah I do it was working just fine before I turn this headset on and it wasn't Skype it's not a it's obviously not priority settings either all right Greg I need you to channel your inner Greg and focus for me because we got the beautiful tech yes citizens that need it here I know I know but that's why we're doing the the live strip for the viewers we're gonna give them something just condensed and something they can take home no but yeah I mean it's a huge it's huge right you go into the deep dive they're changing this and that on the actual architecture itself I mean a lot of that I do I look at them like okay cool I gotta see it to believe it but here's the main slide here right performance per watt improvement roadmap this is the one here we got the 50% with the arrow and they got that jumping over our DNA now we know the next-gen consoles are having our DNA - this is already confirmed ps5 Xbox series X these are going to have our DNA - in them now the thing about that is we don't know how they perform yet all's we got is a PlayStation 5 announcement from Sony we don't even have a release date for the PS 5 official wise do we even have an official pricing like an actual solid concrete official pricing or is it just rumors he's gonna cost $600 is gonna cost $500 gonna cause a those like I mean I again the amount of hardware you're getting though and for the you've got like AMD you need to pay for their research and development right and that's not gonna come for free so yeah like five hundred dollars for a ps5 it's probably too low maybe 600 might be more reasonable starting from there anyway from in the beginning yeah you do the Nvidia do the Nvidia pricing starting from you know I mean starting from $5.99 no well they could do a starting from $4.99 so I wonder what the I wonder if we'll have similar AI B's this time around yeah they actually the car is like that's one thing that like Vega 56 and 64 kind of struggle but because there were only a few different a/b options to choose from no the 5600 next to you 700 XTL so there's a lot more to choose from there but I really hope that that stays and is even just expanded upon because that'll give us more choice you know and choice is always a good thing to the consumer alright do you want to try you you can to try a condenser again on yeah I'm gonna blame sky okay that's right it's right okay so we got asked a cool question midstream here I did I did actually quickly notice it and I was like how many kangaroos do I see out the back every day there's actually like three kangaroos out the back right now and one of them's got a Joey inside so I absolutely love it I'm surrounded by kangaroos and wallabies here so it's really cool but other than that the PS 5 I'm looking here with the Gran Turismo 7 I'm getting excited because I loved gran turismo on the place day yes yeah I used to love that stuff man that was so good and like I mean even if the graphics don't like go full ps5 rDNA - I'm still like if the gameplay is good and it's a good launch title I think PlayStation will have that advantage over Xbox it's racing I've never really prioritized graphics and I really I've played so many older racing games at this point even even now today like I just don't care as much about how accurate reflections are off the web surface of my car you know I just I'm I'm just worried about winning races that's it well I think I think ps5 is a good testament to that like I mean sorry the fortnight fortnight's a good testament to how the most popular game in the world doesn't exactly look great so if fought and I can do it then yeah it's all about the gameplay experience mainly and so I mean personally I'm hanging out for baldur's gate 3 I cannot wait for that game to be released cyberpunk is well 2077 I mean 2077 is okay but I'm actually more keen for Baldur's Gate 3 myself because I'm a huge D&D not so we're gonna see how that goes and let's get on now so basically what our DNA turret here's the thing we don't know enough information about the cards yet what I'm seeing from the the specs and the stuff is we're seeing this performance per watt 50% which I I'm good I'm sceptical off straightaway because they're still on seven nanometer that's all my that's like this don't seven enemy to where they're gonna pull this from there you have to pull some big magic and they don't have Roger kaduri's still on the team at this kind of slide reminds me of the r9 290 launch when that was just gonna bury Nvidia supposedly and then it came out and it was like like wow so anyway it's also got over 5,000 GPU cores this is the most interesting this is where I think you're actually going to get a 50% performance increase from right so you've got way more GPU cause then the 5700 XT has 2560 I think so the paper has got double that is massive massive right you could see some huge gains from an our DNA to big navvy card so if they can pull this off then they will have a 38 ET i competitor that's how I feel so they'll be back in the games this Western architecture shrink from our DNA one to our DNA to Architecture sure they show you know know so I'm pretty sure it's still 7 n tomato right so I mean assuming they have some magic going on behind the scenes this would have to be a fairly large die by comparison oh yeah I mean they dig Dibble 5700 XT was never that big to begin with so right they did set themselves up for the RT X sorry the 38 ETI of 3090 competitor so yeah there's no talk of HBM to or anything still yeah they will stick to GT d l6 but I mean they I think the HBM thing they trialed it with vague or in also Radeon 788 didn't really work out for them I mean I think that was it's it's expensive it's expensive to put in a car if you want to be competitive it's expensive to drop in a car to remain competitive and your yields I mean you have to worry about yields when you're when you have a single chip that has all of that stuff on it like if one thing one part of that chip is is flawed the whole chip is worthless which also would increase the effective price of your supply side because you therefore have more fewer of those chips to bring to market right so all right well there's a big our DNA so our DNA - we've talked about that right but there needs to be more information there's just really not so sorry the mic is driving people crazy I don't damn the comments are like dude your most driving people crazy the the webcam like it's just I just like John Smith complaining oh poor Greg I'm just like sorry guys this is I know it sucks yeah it's never happened before which is why I think it's Skype but there's no other reason why but it was working before we went live it was perfect yeah it's my turn this on and it's great do you want to try you want to try - no just a change in the priorities do I try to anything and then turn your headset back okay so I got you off of there you're gonna come to my speaker's right here but the echo that's alright let's give it a go could you condense it back on okay yeah he's condenses like like low-key guys his condensers just taking a dump so oh yeah I think your 2035 like something in your pipeline has literally just gone because that's what happens when condense the guys in and out that could pass it as you're going on go it off yeah I've never ever had a problem with this literally it seems like it's fine on my end like I see my bars going up and down when I talk okay yeah yeah it's just this weird it's waning in and out of existence in the audio I don't know why I keep turning that off that function off but it clearly is not okay all right guys we'll continue on Greg's Greg's audio bed don't worry Oh Greg jump on board my back brother jump on board my back yeah I'll carry you through this live stream man let's jump so the r-tx 28 30 30 90 is if we got this leak we didn't we talked about it last week but the performance if we're looking at this this slide here right over the 28th egi founders edition that's where you should be comparing it if this is true it's a massive performance increase like 31% so this will be probably the 30 90 and it'll probably cost the same this is going to be my guesstimate it'll cost the same as a 20 atti so you're looking at a thousand USD for the 30 90 and then you'll be looking at around 700 for the 30 80 and that should perform the same as a 20 atti just more power-efficient have the latest and greatest r-tx features over the 2000 series that's pretty much cut and dry with our TX 3000 pricing and also when I have heard another rumor though when it comes to the release date of the r-tx 3000 is that it's looking like it will be sometime in like it'll be announced in August later later in August but I think I'm hearing conflicting rumors about it being either released in late August or released in September and it's gonna have a staggered start in that it's gonna be trickled out to the market in that you're not gonna get a heap of stock ready on day one as opposed to the GTX 970 and 980 I remember that launch was like one of Nvidia I think that was in bit his best launch was when they launched the 918 970 they came in with hard pricing stock was everywhere it was just like a selleth on um but with the 30 80 in the 30 30 90 or 30 80 i whatever they going with the naming scheme I'm not a hundred cents I've heard strong rumors that it'll be the 30 90 that again it could be the 30 80 TI it's all little details in the release so 31% though 31% is pretty big it's some people in the chatter like it's not big 30 want this set it to be it's pretty big like it's pretty exciting if they can do it right and if they can continue on with that now I will complain about one thing with graphics cards a straight up and that is that we when you look at a 1080 TI the price of that I'm just gonna give you guys in Ozzy pricing Ozzy dollars the Aussie dollar pricing of the 1080 T I was like I could get this on eBay sales for $900 and that was the flagship at the time and then we look at fast forward to the RT x20 atti and that's like yeah on average that's about $2,000 dollars and it really isn't a good buy like in terms of value in terms of flagships and stuff like that I do want to see a price drop in that trend I would like to see the 30 atti ideally be lower than a 20 atti because I think it would sell better not only would it sell better for in video but I looked back to comparing it to the 1080i and we just got this massive price performance increase for flagship performance and so the 1080 TI was kinda like the 10th series was in one of it like I loved the 10th series I thought it was invidious a great launch the RT X 2000 was kind of really just murky waters and I mean AMD didn't have the answer to beat that and that was why Nvidia got away with it but hopefully with the 3000 series they can bring that back they can say hey we're on top again here's the pricing and it's more reasonable and it's good to go so yeah that's a three thousand Greg are you back now are you back with us I'm gonna use the headset mic I don't know okay but my prayers are answered okay thank you sound like I have the mic just disconnected because I usually use the thanks so our set up but uh because that's crapped out on me for whatever reason which I will figure out after this yeah just right that's what I was saying you got all this fancy gear it's like having a camera and then it just runs out of battery when you got the prop like you got to get the chute you know what I mean like you just need reliability sometimes you need reliability that's it and chats gonna yet I mean chats gonna give it to you bro like three years the Yamaha mg 10x you which has been just rock-solid and then the 1820 thirty-five derringer b2 before about 1/8 20s yeah I mean but here's what's gonna happen I think it's your actual audio interface it's usually not the mic it's usually the actual interface that you think thanks there yeah that makes it usually goes here's the thing though right after this stream is finished I'm gonna get comments yo ditch this guy man AB it's about time you did chair so like this the Greg sellers are haters are gonna come out in the comments any of you like y'all just ditching Brian get rid of him and I'll be like dude I like Greg now got a defend our gonna waste time defending you in the comments cuz you you did this right as we hit launch anyway is the timing in history for our lives told me turn it on and off yeah best a confessed tech advice ever dude turn it on and off in okay so we got one more article here is we gonna give a tech test as a plug to I met these people the they're a couple I met them in did you made them in Computex tech testers no there's a really awesome channel I absolutely love that they is such a nice bunch of people like really mad the other thing is when I meet people man they're really cool people I love like working with cool people I love the people are relaxed that's what the community needs is just laid-back but I was looking for the 8 terabyte SSDs from Samsung they release their 870 qvo and they've they've got one for testing so it's just the normal SSD nothing super special but they've got it in Lavers up to a terabytes now and that's pretty like for a normal SATA 3 SSD that's pretty cool like an 8 terabytes that's huge right you've got 16 terabytes on the hard drives I had a few of them and you never 8 terabytes in just the little SSD which i think is really cool so yeah Samsung have launched that I thought tech testers as well really cool channel keep in mind with these that just the the way that they does use your Kela ctv v nan so they're not gonna last as long theoretically as some other drives using design structures yep the way is to store a data course is always better but just the way that they keep the cost down with these it also kind of inversely cuts into the lifespan of the drive again theoretically so ok so Greg's given you these science their science Joe yeah I don't know yeah I mean oh yeah so it's it's qlc it's qlc 3d 9 this is the cheapest of the name going into SSDs be aware of that it will have a burst Bank however they will use more extensive stuff for the cash portion of the drive but at the same time it's still good to see that a Tara this is like when I went to the Korea event with the data storage this was a big thing qlc will I think it'll eventually replace standard mechanical hard drives it's cheap enough to produce and it's the form that the size all right you got now all that all that data or you guys say data all that data in a small section as opposed to a big massive hard drive pushes out more heat it's not as power efficient and so there's so much there pushing qlc forward to be the next successful thing to I think one of the catalysts for that was the laptop market so like you know laptops are designed to be portable obviously and people toss and turn those things sometimes they'll drop them on desks harder than they should and if you have mechanical disks in there right now that's how you sure the lifespans of them or completely like loose chunks of data yeah so you know there was a huge push there still is a push especially in Cheaper laptops to move exclusively to solid-state storage for that very reason because you don't want to be knocking around hard drives not that you do that with your desktop either but it is I mean it's it's faster storage most of the time and it's just it's not as susceptible to physical damage well I mean I've dropped I bet personally I can attest this I've dropped a lot of PC parts and one PC part that I've dropped that has just been bad in general was that I dropped a hard drive and it was just gone after that I gone yeah there's no coming back so yeah these hard drives will probably want to be if not the most sensitive PC part so don't drop them and yeah getting these SSDs in there it's always a good thing but let's move on now to the GTX 1650 ultra like whoa now what is there's nothing to carry now apparently it's in a driver database video cards had a good article on it and it's like it's nothing but it's nothing to really look even look at it's just like hey slightly better 1650 even then the specs it's just like whoa okay I guess I hyped it up people were getting hyped in the comments and yeah then it became techno city with a K n Oh W baby oh yeah just despite your live there it's based on the T 106 is that 1650 is not based on the T 106 is that it's basically the cut-down r-tx 2070 that's right yeah like it's interesting to see like maybe there'd be some cool use utilization in the in the productivity workspace if you could utilize that extra features of that cut-down die but for gaming yeah this thing looks like it's a hard pass because the 1650 super he's already leagues ahead of the 1650 like I actually do recommend 1650 supers to people as opposed to a 1650 I don't really recommend to anyone so yeah Greg's not with us he's like in la-la land again all right prices I'm reading the article I can't read the article and comment on it at the same time if I have to get familiar with the stuff that really yes okay next up here we've got Crysis 3 remastered Crysis 3 remastered here guys basically they're saying the minimum required specs is an i-5 45 90 and a gtx 660ti I don't believe this I think the minimum requirements for crisis remastered not Crysis 3 crisis remastered will be a 2080 TI and arisin 930 900 X and also or a10 900k I think that's your minimum system requirements for this what do you what do you think Greg do you think crisis remastered will require the latest and greatest hardware it's a 660ti on the website is that what you're yeah we said yeah this is the minimum specs for crisis there's no way I just I mean you want to play it like dog crap graphics sure I mean you could theoretically play it at any resolutely any in-game settings just whether or not the fps is tolerable I mean that's the question but I would say for like a solid 60 fps and 1440p with high settings gtx 1070 1660 and that in that range that's my estimation thank you so yeah what do you guys think they the actual trailer looks really good I'll make sure the slots muted so it doesn't the actual uh the remodel you like it looks really good like it actually looks really good from what I've seen so okay that's just that's just the trailer alright well I've seen some gameplay looks really good but anyhow that's the news we got through the news portion guys it was rough this week like I gotta say I haven't had this rough of the livestream where I've had to carry Greg my Wow hahaha through the whole thing Greg like my back is actually fine I've been all good I've been all good this week actually so other that like okay let's go to chat let's answer some Q&A and Greg will hopefully sort out his sound by the next time and by the time I get back to you guys it'll be all sorted because I don't know it's just like honestly like I said before one of the unluckiest things I've seen it's just one of those things that happens so something I'm guessing something in his pipelines gone just as we were doing this well test it right after this dream I bet I'd be one of this it's not like I think it's Skype screwing with it my bets on your mixer it's like waning in and out of existence that's what it sounds I think Oh like its power it's just waning in and out I've saint-like as I actually seen that before on a mixer I've seen it before the exact if it was it doing that before I opened on the headset it's just I don't know what happened it's just like bad time that's what I'm saying so why would it have been when the headset turned on no it's just well if you look at winning the lotto right it doesn't happen that it does so it's just like unlike you unluckily it was literally working perfect right until I click this odd switch I just I have a feeling it's software-related thank you yeah anyway let's go to Q&A well to answer those juicy questions we'll pull them up for you so let's do it and here we go questions let's have a look what have we got so wait how did I get to this dream I thought this was a video ah it's I don't know maybe YouTube just like pumps it out as a live stream and yeah we do we do live streams now and then because we just want to connect with you guys and just sort of have laid-back chat and sort of relax I think it needs like especially where we do YouTube videos where we're focusing on a topic all the time and we're just talking about that one topic it's cool to just mix and hang out and talk to each other and talk to you guys in the chat I actually look forward to doing the chat more than anything but if anything we can get all this rumour talk out of the way with if there's this big rumors and people want to hear what we've got to say about these massive rumors we can quickly talk about that with you guys and say alright here's what it is like I think our DNA too is going to be good but I think you're gonna get the gaint like for instance with our DNA - I think you're gonna get the gains by having more stream processors onboard as opposed to having some major massive 50% architectural improvement I just don't see that happening over our DNA one especially when AMD was already pushing the envelope on Rd in what a 1 so anyway we got some questions so coming in here right up here we've got great stream guys my contribution towards Greg's new mixer thanks like I mean he has the virtuoso I think the virtuoso is good actually cause they are know they're great Coursera is sending that wave 3 over to us so hopefully I'll be doing a live stream with that and we can compare it to the virtuoso because I've heard some good things about the wave 3 but I want to take it through some proper tests against a condenser and see if its proper dedicated streaming material or if it's just like I don't know we'll find out next up here we've got which API will crisis run on Vulcan or dx12 actually that's a good do they say in this article that's a good dx11 what ok if it's just if it's just remastered they might be using the same yeah true yeah ok I think it's the x11 men so yeah it's not either so kind of like dx12 is is good volkens the best like out of every title I've tried that's had Falken oh yeah Vulcan is just king I'd like to see more Vulcan development the problem is Microsoft Xbox Series X DirectX 12 you're going to see DirectX 12 become the dominant I feel dominant API even though I feel like Vulcan is superior from what I've seen that's just my opinion on that so JD gaming says that Vulcan will also be supported I'm not sure where you saw that it might be in that article that we had up ok so it's a remaster not a completely new game and I so thanks for the donation Kusanagi he says it's a remaster not a completely new game I personally think that they just optimized the game engine which will allow it to work on Loren specs interesting true yeah that's true but with crisis I've always known it just would be a hardware hamper like a hardware destroyer I don't think that's gonna change I don't think it's still gonna destroy your hardware just a new flavor of it it'd be nice to use that benchmark like if it's if it's consistent and reliable across like between both nvidia and AMD cards i have a feeling it's gonna be nvidia bias anyway but if it is somewhat consistent i think it would be really cool to like just as a throwback kind of include that in some of our graphics for a benchmarks or at least there's like a stress test kind of maybe fun to use it again from memory crisis did run initially better on AMD but then the optimized hard and then it started they started bringing it back to the the team girl i did i could have swore they were i thought they were promoting it with crisis it's their cards with crisis at one point maybe I'm confused how's your day going Brian mines great Greg's isn't going too well he just like mix it down will let you guys know after the streams off we'll let you guys know in the comments yes and you guys can place bets you can place wages if you think the mixer is down type of zero if or an F in chat if you think the mixer is still working type of one yeah I'm my money's on F just show me those that zero one now you're a one yeah one for life these mixes living and F for a mixer is is down I'm going with an F are you giving yourself a you skip that's no no no way no way the second I turn on this head said that the frickin mixer dies there is no way I'm just so now had it had it not been working prior to the stream or prior to when I turn this on I had totally agree with you I would assume that would be what it is to you but it's on right now I can see the audio levels peaking still I think it's software so we got the next tech yes video ice I five thirty seven seventy can it run crisis okay okay I'm gonna pull up myself an i-5 3770 actually I got it I saw some dudes selling a arm he put in there what was it an i7 8400 or something I'm like dude so the people are trying when they resell stuff they're trying to like try get that yeah try to act try yeah yeah just instead of it I 5 this like yo there's an i7 man so like I think if you advertise an ice I wouldn't do it so I don't do that kind of stuff be like someone's gonna say hey it's an i7 10400 I reckon they could confuse people man cuz it's got 6 cores 12 threads I mean I was frustrated it yeah dude you mix is gone near chat said yeah you mix unruly is just spamming the chat with app that's when all fairness majority of them did think that that it was put and I think that it's just an audience bias thing I think if I asked my audience that in my live stream they'd probably side with me thank you yeah Kusanagi says I think it will get people more interested in the series again I mean hopefully crisis has always been its own worst enemy though and getting people involved I remember Crysis 3 multiplayer was an absolute fail because you've got to release a game that runs on potatoes like look at Valerie didn't like that game I did not really enjoy that game but it runs really well the tick rate on the servers are amazing it runs on potatoes in terms of the actual everything it takes to have a game working and reach the masses Valerie did a good job but crisis has always been more targeted towards Elite PC users and the problem with that is it's really only like 10% of the population that has all this elite gear most people have some crappy laptop that they just want to trial the game and if they boot up the game and it like doesn't even get choppy fps like because I reckon if you booted Crysis up on a really crap laptop it would be like one frame a second but you couldn't even play it as opposed to at least like 15 FPS you can actually say alright is this game for me is the story any good do I really want to I guess immerse myself in this game and I just think crisis has missed that mark on doing that a lot even though it's I played it per se I think it's a fun game I think it's cool it's just that it's missed that mark Greg's deleted I'm really bushed got owned Greg got mad so no no no I asked them to stop spamming timeout obviously but but him and one other guy were spamming after I asked them to stop because we need to see questions all we see is f but that's I partially brain mute blame you for that Brian yeah I'm partially blaming you for that one yeah so I got asked from Adam any chance to check out CNC remastered yeah I will be I will be checking out saying I love the CNC series I love CNC Tiberian Sun that was like probably my favorite like I used to love Red Alert don't get me wrong Red Alert was like my second favorite but when Tiberian Sun came out that actually did it for me that was better than Red Alert I loved what they did with arm sans III even to this date I will play C & C 3 and absolutely love it so yeah I'll be getting on CNC remastered seeing what they do with number 3 I know but since he remasters just the original remastered so I'll be checking that out but yeah in terms of command & Conquer I love number 3 Tiberium son I kind of wish they would bring it back in 2020 big RTS buff that's what I'm a big RTS buff and I'm waiting for Age of Empires for like desperately so I'm hoping that'll come out sooner than later but who knows Microsoft really haven't given us enough on that oh do you play more than any other game usually please at the moments dota 2 I met like but I didn't even plan it I haven't even played a games like a week burner and there's a sad thing is like when I'm benchmarking I'm just benchmarking cuz Oh yep that's what I'm used to doing so if they're not the bourret like the most boring part of this job is benchmarking just doing the same thing over and over and well see I this is why I kind of like fortnight because I finished benchmarking that and then I just go around for a quick fries that's why I like what I like in that sense but to be fair like to be fair in fortnight's defense it has a massive skill cap and it requires skill to be good at the game right you can't just jump into fortnight and be good you need to practice you need to know how the game operates and it does have a massive skill cap that's one thing I'll give to fortnight and I do enjoy kind of like going for a quick frag after benchmarking f1 mm 19 that's kind of like just hit benchmarking afk shame with shadow the Tomb Raider if you notice any dips you got to rerun the benchmark and figure out what the did was but usually my benchmark systems are like tuned to perfection dude so usually I never have any problems benchmarking on those systems I'm actually I'm actually working on a script that's gonna autorun those all those benchmarks just oh okay key and it's a script it will open up in bench marido set all the settings or confirm the settings are the same between runs but it's you have to be really careful because if there's one or two lines that are written you has one bad butterfly it's you know like go out of control and then you act yeah it's like coding in general yeah yeah we're gonna be like no I'm never going to this guy again for my tech news reviews but but it's cool because like I'm learning how to do all I think I'm learning how to write scripts like complex script not gone like easy ones but like actually complex scripts by by doing this but I kind of occasionally writing lines oh so you telling me you're gonna write a script to fix up your dead mixer then you know everybody you mix is working I love love a dream and I love the only time I've ever been vulnerable like this alright so we got those questions real tech on board sound good enough for games these days or PC a sound card bit of real tech on board oh it depends on how its implemented but yes it's more than capable of being good enough for gaming really good in fact to the point where I would recommend you go out if you're like if look if you want to go down this whole audio rabbit hole go get yourself a kph thirty eyes from costs go grab a set of these they're like 30 USD go grab yourself a set of these plug them into you might need a splitter as well you might need one of those $1 splitters that changed is for pin two three pins go get one of those go get the split up plug it into your onboard audio tell me I haven't just given you the best value for money audio in your life but other than that you can that is easy to run off on wall audio so the problem with onboard audio a lot of the times is this the amp page is not good enough so you need easy to run sensitive speakers if you don't have that if you're going to put on a $600 headset or although dynamics on Autobahn board audio they're gonna sound like crap because the powers the amp page isn't there for those headphones and in fact it's going to agree is sorry so you're spending them put on a headset then I mean I don't think anyone would sweat yeah but then a gander dollars out but then it but then again some people are spending like six seven hundred dollars on a motherboard they want it all they don't want to sound they don't want to outspent they just want everything go so the bottom line is is I would always that's why I'm a big fan of the value our mid-range motherboards have the good vrm that have the decent onboard audio because you just use your budget headset or your kph 30 is go plug them in if you want more definitely go buy a dedicated amp for your headphones because there's two reasons behind it's not just the sound quality like your sound quality's going to be good on your onboard audio the frequency response goes gonna be flat but the problem is is when you require more amperage than that amp pitch can deliver you are damaging your ears you know when I was picking up my car the other day the chicks there with these I don't know they called air pods or whatever and I just said to her like look do you know the damage you're doing to your ears putting those things on because not only the sound source so close to your ears but because if they use cheap air they were air pod knockoffs I haven't tried the airport's but they were cheap air pod if the signal spikes because the amperage is crap those spikes are hitting your eardrums so when you go to bed if your ears are ringing that straightaway means that you've got to get a better audio solution whether it's a better pair of headphones then most likely it's going to be a better amp so I think you've got I think to that end though like if you're worried about the damage it's doing to your body I mean I would be concerned about anything I put close to my face including a cell phone oh yeah I think well that's why whenever I use my cell phone and I just put it on speaker I don't know I never yeah yeah oh yeah I really think that those I mean you you name it brain cancer whatever else like I think that that's gonna be a huge problem it's just the high frequency pinging all the radio signals coming off of it yeahbsolutely she's not good to keep that yeah but in terms of the kph thirty eyes right the reason I like them it is the testing I've done so far indicates a nice smooth frequency response curve that rolls a bit off on the treble you want that you don't want that typical 8k spike in treble that a lot of these manufacturers do to make their headphones sound better that crap is gonna make your ears ring and coupled with the fact that a lot of amps out there whether it's on onboard audio or on cheap audio gear have these spikes you can check it out for yourself run a frequency sweep on your computer set it to 7k your phone should have an app to download a decibel meter get that decibel meter plug it right up to your headphone smash it on 7k and I guarantee you around the 6 7k region is gonna have higher decibel outage of the same volume as say 1k or 500 Hertz and if you're seeing that that's the same crap that's hitting your ears so yeah audio I've been spitting audio for years on how serious it is to take care of your ears because when you're older you can't just magically jump in the back to the future time portal and say hey fix my ears that's not how it works I mean I've already got tinnitus in one year I went to the shooting range and I didn't have ear plugs and as far as I should guy standing next to me a good buddy of mine he was just popping off and I got home that afternoon and ringing in my ears they I had to go away I still have a ringing in my ears to this day six months later and it's never gonna go away I'll have it for the rest of my life that's it man so there it is so serious take care of you take care of your ears don't be don't yeah it's like looking at like this is the thing right if you look up at the Sun you quickly look away the problem with your ears is you don't really have that same receptive response you do like if it hurts you're gonna be oh great you're gonna turn away quickly but that the with the ears it's so much more damaging because at least with the Sun your gosh you look away like instantly with your ears you your body doesn't it's just that it's gonna hurt sort of thing there's no real the best defense against that is to not expose yourself to potentially getting these South's loud sudden bangs another thing we'll go on another thing about ears and audio I love this I love talking about this serious right we'll go with the whole yes blase like head banging like youuuu we'll do that when we need to but I like to care I care about my viewers another thing is too is that with audio right this is one of the most important to know I had a brain fart no I was gonna give it like the last final verdict and I had a brain fart you were taken out in a way I would I was I was going away with that I was good to me one more thing was I'm full of it I completely figured out okay yeah I can rip me man you can rip me live it was such a good point - it was such a good part I'll take the high road on this one it was to be like it was to do this okay yeah so witty is right this is the last one episode your ears have defense your ears will have a natural defense built in that if the noise is too loud it'll then suddenly close off the eardrums a bit so it has a defense against loud noises the problem is it's it's a reaction so if you've got the worst thing for your ears is sudden impact loud sounds because your ears aren't ready for it like they're all open they're used to hearing what's around them ambient noise and then all the sudden this massive noise comes and hits your eardrums the defense can't kick in it will kick in after but it won't kick in straight away so your is the actual defense mechanism is it like this is the doesn't the muscle like tighten or loosen like a bone really it's something yeah I have irie Syre searched I forgot exactly what it is but your body does have a defense against it but the problem is the the bottom line is with it with audio is that the in the large noises that are very loud very quick and sudden are going to do damage to your is the most and that's what the headphones comes back to the headphones if you've got those spikes they're very dangerous to your ears which is why I always use speakers if I'm using headphones like these headsets as much as I like Corsair I don't trust them with my years I'm still gonna keep the volumes down to levels that I know aren't gonna give me tinnitus so don't use headphones loud even if you're using them that's just my advice anyhow that was a long long long topic sorry no no your audience is liking it they okay cool well that's why we come to this live stream baby I mean sorry for the rough start with this live stream it was like that's Gregg's bad man I check yes gonna deliver always you guys can rely on me to deliver but I just don't I know I have no I still don't know I have no idea why I did it this one time I've even turned on this headset before I can still use that heigen it's okay so to redeem yourself if the if the mixer is gone can you make like a Twitter video just smashing it and just taking it out of existence I think we all run over how that gets run over it okay with an SUV as well it's gotta be in a big like SUV oh yeah and the wheels and the wheel we got to see the wheel going up like boom you know proper low angle motion yeah yeah great tech Greg yes Salazar city that's not a question I think that's what we need to change our disk for a name too oh yeah yeah also would you have mobile version 1060 no I I don't really I don't I'm not interested in laptops guys I really don't mess with it laptops just aren't really my thing I do like them though if you're a uni student or you are constantly in many places at once and you need to do work or game in many places at once if if you've got that prime spot where you do everything and that's your one station i i'm desktop all the way that's just how I am but if I if you're mobile and you know you need to be mobile then yeah definitely look at laptops but even for tradeshows you take you brought the Nook last year didn't you I brought the NOC and then and after that I did a 9900 K Mini ITX suitcase build I've got alright I've got our grade down I'm gonna put a 39 50 X in it I think and give it a 16 core upgrade some tech yes love some proper techies lovin because I do my question sorry go ahead sorry I'm just I'm going strong through the questions here so yeah I know I've been saving them like you asked me to in the notepad oh ok so which one's the juicy one which one okay this I forget who asked it they asked it a few times what do you think of an AMD r9 3900 X paired with a 2070 super for games like wow cod and shadow of the Tomb Raider I'm gonna be testing this like I got I've actually if you get AMD chips make sure you tune them you have to lock in your XMP profile I mean it's gonna be fine first of all it's gonna be fine 39 Rex is gonna be absolutely fine but what you have to do with AMD systems you have to do this is make sure you got your channel memory make sure you're tuning your XMP profiles at least and make sure your memory validate that your memory is overclocked I've got a guy coming over this arvo because I'm friends with computer stores and stuff like that and whenever people are having FPS stuttering problems they just say look go to this guy he'll fix you up he'll tune your computer make sure it's all good go with you it's step by step I love doing it because I'm an ACN right I don't just do YouTube I love doing other stuff behind the scenes because that's how I get my ACN through and all that stuff so the bottom line is is that with the ACN and stuff like that this is anyway back to the problem not not how Tech yes does his business the batch of the problem is the I've had a lot of AMD systems a lot of AMD systems come through where people have required me to tune them up so if you do get the AMD system make sure you're tuning it that's all it needs more tender loving care than the Intel system where you can usually just get some banger 2666 memory and a lot of people don't even notice that their systems not tuned on the intel side because it does run out of the box i feel like out of the box it runs smoother that's all it's around smoother on untuned systems so I never really have you know people with stuttering problems on the intel side with new Intel stuff as opposed to the AMD side where I've got this not this is like the fourth case I've had in the last two months where I've had a referral where someone's coming around they're like look my system stuttering in war zone pacifically so war zones stuttering I'm gonna check it out for him and do run through the whole nine yards and get their system running to perfection but yeah if you do get the only system just make sure you tune it that's all so something that's that's real street talk right that's know like hey guys this is amazing that's amazing on the street I love that I love giving you guys that opinion as well on what actually going on out there to the average consumer with enthusiast tech so all right next question Greg have you been saving them I get another one here just asked I want to upgrade 20400 G in an Rx 57 or 574 gay excuse me what do you recommend upgrading first saving three hundred dollars by October and let's assume USD for the sake of so Jed you you answer that but yeah I think the 2400 G is gonna be the thing I would upgrade what do you think I mean you can get it you can get by you can you can really milk 574 a lot more than probably think you can especially in 1080p I'd keep that nice the frame buffer is your limiter if you gain if you gain yeah if he game experience sucks I would say it's more to do with the 2400 G you gonna remember 2400 G's first gen rise in IPC yet that you with that you've also got a first gen Rison IMC which sucked like let's be honest the first gen rise and I'm CID wasn't a big fan of like a lot of times you had probably a first gen yeah yeah and so I would wreck it that's a good upgrade I'd recommend gone for a rise in 3300 X 3500 I mean yesterday 3300 X is king man I love it it's a good chip grabs around 100 bucks yeah good luck finding one though oh yeah apparently you guys over this I mean you can get them over in Australia are you okay over there in Australia yeah yeah yeah usually it's like I think in a state so you guys have a lot of like I guess you have a lot of enthusiasts that like will buy extra stuff so they've already got a 3600 they'll probably just buy a 3300 X because they want to check it out and and and have a bit of fun with it over in Australia people to just pure like I'm gonna say the work tight asses right literally people in Australia tight asses so though they'll just buy what they need but they'll want to get the best value whatever spectrum there and if it's a twenty atti or a 1080 TIR twenty sixty super they'll buy the CPU for that that's it one rig one go all over so yeah there's that what do people care about next question we got appears what do people care about most when buying a used PC CPU and GPU it's two things it's gonna be that I think it's a platform like it's a motherboard RAM and CP is a big thing to swap it's a pit and it also depends on the price point if you're going over 2000 AUD you want generally all new banger stuff 1000 you want like i7 and usually an i7 if you get a Rison in there it's great and you should like a GTX 1060 1070 this is Aussie pricing by the way so anyway there's that question what do we got up a clue says how do you ask how do you feel about PC i3 PCA for and say it is different options for a boot drive and I think that totally depends on your budget I would say even even in budgets up to 2000 2500 bucks like well you basically buy whatever the heck you want consumer grade and throw it into your system I think PC i3 in beanies will still be fine and just make sure it's a four-lane drive so you can fully saturate that assuming it's a lanes to your CPU you'll get that for what thirty five hundred megabytes per second there abouts for reads and possibly even writes depending on the drive and you can find those fairly cheap I mean the PCI agent four drives are still a bit premium but they're not as bad as I thought they would be considering there aren't too many of them out yet and considering its it's a fairly fresh reiteration of it so I think that up to probably a thousand bucks going with SATA for a boot drive is fine of course if you can make room for it that's that's great but I think up to a thousand dollars I would probably prioritize cooling so I'd get a decent CPU cooler with the extra money I might have I might even prioritize aesthetics to an extent maybe like some custom cables you can get cheap $34 extensions that will make your bill just look way better and will definitely help resale value as well the presentation side of things so that's what I would say up to a thousand bucks state is fine past a thousand bucks difference between PC a three and four and B B's yeah you're it's unlikely you'll notice a difference in rural testing I'll get a quickly bought in when I heard extension one thing I've recently talked about with a few people this piece a extension riser cables I'm gonna be honest I've had nothing but trouble with those things dude like what do you mean just like graphics like it'll run fine for two months and then it'll start crashing and then I take out the riser cable everything's flying again oh no no not not the riser cable I just I know I know I know your talk about extension cables for power cables but I was like well we're on that note of extensions are ya know risers are super spotty they've been spotty for years you and even from reputable companies that manufacture these themselves or I assume would use a fairly reputable because many of them do use the same one even those are hit or miss it's just yeah but I have I have found believe it or not on x58 I love it how you had that option to up the PCIe voltage I found when you did a riser cable and you up that PCIe voltage setting you could get some you get that extension working better but also you could get there was a problem with Radeon cards and they'll first release like rx for 70s and 570s you could get those working on X 58 by upping that PCIe voltage just fine so it's a cool setting to have I've missed some of those older BIOS settings I wish they'd bring them back and just put like a warning tab on them a if you don't know what if you do not know what this is better don't touch it but it's cool it's cool for people like us who like to diagnose problems but we don't have that option there anymore so anyway it's it's just because it's one of those settings it's unique it's kind of like I think they phased it out after x58 come on I think it's probably I mean there were probably tolerance issues to you with like just the the sizes of the traces themselves like you can only mean that that's why like you know I and this kind of off topic but like why custom loops that have D 5 pumps still use molex connectors right you would think okay it's 2020 why are they still using molex why aren't they using a SATA power cable instead so I don't have to rip out the old molex cable from extension kit and the reason why is because d5 pumps require a lot more power than a standard SATA Drive and the molex connectors have thicker gauge wire and so they can handle the higher power draw so it's it's actually actually a safety feature so to speak using older connectors okay so we got a question we got a donation here 50 bucks thank you very much elf boy 902 says always loved your channel and I love everything you do here the use price performance you get is also amazing and yeah I don't use price forms and going anywhere anywhere anywhere it's not going anywhere this hood this hoodie thing is not working so all right thanks so much for the donation - that's really appreciate it and we've got here next up is audio so there's a lot should I take off my earbuds yes that's a question yeah take them off burn them in a fire is is a used x79 Gd 65 a good deal or not for a hundred euro 162 Aussie dollars kind of yes if you know what you're doing with x79 if you know what you're doing with x79 if you can get cheap ddr3 memory and if you can get the cheap CPU as well then the ex the hardest problem with x79 is of course to get the x79 motherboards so yeah if you can get one for 162 aussie i would say yeah if it's working fine that's actually a decent deal believe it or not ah yeah the hardest problem with x79 is getting x79 so that's just that um 1650 ultra yeah we talked about that it's just it's basically maybe if I put it in the title I don't it doesn't need to it's not clickbait it's just it's it's like hey you know that's this thing so so out still promoting a legal CD Keys actually note their CD keys keys are not a legal dude you have got no idea how they work I get this question yeah they were illegal why would be yeah like that people people like I would have talked about this quickly people think they're the MSDN keys they're not go grab an s CD key and go Pat being it's a single end-user license so and now if you if you if you watched our Taiwan arm garbage vlog you'll see how they're getting a lot of those keys and yeah they're legit they're legit so you can get legit and you you can get legit I get legit keys all the time from my used parts hunts on these $15.00 bangers that still have the seven Pro om on them that's a legit key and if it hasn't been reactivated you can reuse it so yeah please like before you start you know pro all the time just people talk without knowing what they're talking about it's the biggest problem on the Internet period yeah like yeah yeah sorry I have to vent that hey no I'd say I think online no - one of the one of the side effects of that I people will relate that to what people do on eBay and elsewhere like on what King win and other sites that are peer-to-peer so we're sort of like eBay but they'll sell keys to ten different people like the same key I have two people will activate it it might work and then another two or three people activate it six months later right when the keys been reused recycled and then it'll deactivate that copy of Windows on the two previous installations right so yeah it might work for a few months the reason why it's only working for a few months because someone else probably used that exact same key and it was resold over and over and that's a problem that you come into many times on sites like eBay and I know this because I've been there that's where I used to get a lot of my keys I always said he ignored our super Jess sorry no I'm actually manually scrolling down so I don't miss questions sorry about that elf boy so yeah so a question for you both is the 3,300 X is there any point going more than an a320 or a 520 when it comes out if if you're just going with 3,300 X and that's it you know you're not going to upgrade for a long time a 320 and a 520 is absolutely fine man if you're not going to use all the extra features on the motherboard don't spend the extra money and then we gotta hear Brian what models your kia sting and GT or a normal - GT yeah I got the GT and we'll make a car vlog for you guys like absolutely love cars and getting the case thing it was a big like it was a big decision for me it's the big like what probably is one of the biggest purchase decisions I've made life but it's been such a cool it's such a cool car like it's so it's I'm gonna make like what I do the car vlog video I'm actually gonna compare it to use price performance in PCs because I feel like the car market is such a different market to pcs in some respects in though you buy yours right yeah yeah a new out of this it's those big reasons right like I can say on stram the biggest reasons I did it was tax purposes yeah like you get to keep all the GST which we have a 10% tax that all if you buy from a dealer you get 10% back that's how it is and then you've got the income write-off so you get all that money back if you I'm using it for business because I run around make videos and whatnot so GG it we got here Glen James asked a good question can a bad RAM overclock cause audio study yes definitely a bad driver can cause it to from the video card a bad CPU OC but usually with the RAM and the CPU if you hear the audio stutter if your computer's gonna crash like the audio is just it's just like a warning sign I'd say I've found audio stuttering problems with AMD GPUs over HDMI and DVI ports and DisplayPort and it's weird with DVI I think you've got to use a HDMI it's weird DVI can sometimes carry audio I found it's in rare circumstances I forgot how I did it I think I use the HDMI adaptor or something anyway let's continue so I have a 3700 X and 1080i my ram running at 3,600 minutes with XMP profiles on is it worth adjusting the timings further a game at 1440p mainly cheers guys now if you've got thirty six hundred megahertz on XMP on just you can like it can be worth it just keep in mind it's gonna take you a long time to you I find memory the reason I don't really tune memory nowadays is because every memory stick is different every memory stick is different but um it's not just that it's that when the memory sticks are different you've got to spend a lot of time finding how fast that memory goes and then there's another curveball thrown in and it's still related to your CPU as well in its imc so memory OC is one of the hardest things to do and so you can it can't be worth it but I would just go for a quick and easy slight drop that would be the quickest thing to do so try and drop it up the voltage a little bit more drop the CL timings just one notch on each if you can get that going then you'll get a little bit more but other than that XMP is good to go isn't a 3900 X overkill for gaming especially considering the rising 4000 yeah 3900 X is overkill for gaming 8 cause 16 threads will be mainstream for a very long time anything over that it's going to be bad okay I I've lost track of questions man so many coming in elf boy became a new member to Cheers elf boy do we have any other juicy questions we got so many coming in so I've literally been reading them as they've been coming just regular conversations what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy paste all the comments and then I'll just drop them in the comments on the videos and reply that way for you guys there's just way too many coming in and if there's one real juicy one you've got answer then go for a bit we can start off with accents guys we've we've talked heaps this caucus I noticed someone said has Greg worked on his British accent before especially especially for that audio hiccup he owes it to everybody yeah make up for it this doubt sound boards dead I'm gonna go some you know slow mo crushing okay and it can be just we've got the go-ahead I think the audience said you can do British if you want alright yeah it's kind of joking at that point I didn't think I would actually now take me up on that I'm not alright do you want me to start off with yeoman start off then do about you just take it away Frank yeah but you're going later on you're going okay okay so I just came back from the like I went to this convention and like this dude had a pair of these things he's stuck in his ears and I went up to him and I'd I just said like hey dude what are those things he said you know their air pods I was like whoa what what's this concept of a pod in your ear and so I got a pair and I got them like on a sale for like $200 when it said like one nighty so like the price was like it said it was on sale so I paid $10 more than the one night he got a mad deal and then I got them in the mail I put him in and I started exercising and I went for a jog and little did I know that I was pleased these things were loud they was sounding great and little did I know I didn't research about exercise in my ears and now when you exercise your ears actually open up more than usually so here I am with my crappy pods in my ears like already on loud volume damaging my ears and then coupled with the fact that I'm exercising with them I'm doing double damage so when I went to bed I had this mad ringing and then I like whacked in some beats over the top and it just sounded like perfection and then the problem is when the beats died because my mixer was bad I just just left with some ringing and then I went to return my air pods and said hey these damaged my ears and they said look you should have read the disclaimer in the Box dude it said ear damages at your own responsibility and I was like damn like dude I just got hosed so every week my dudes getting hosed okay and so he's held his health co-host his health got hose this week look you get hosed on a product don't worry guys just make sure you never get hosed on your health that's the
