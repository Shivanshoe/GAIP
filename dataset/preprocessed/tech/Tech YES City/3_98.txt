in today's review of the rx 6600 from amd we're going to be comparing this to the rtx 3060 as well as the rx 6600 xt and will also throw in under volting and overclocking and seeing if the 329 dollar price point that amd is suggesting and i did use quotations there because i think we all know that amd is not going to be able to deliver this card at this suggested price point just like what we saw with the rx 6600 xt where crypto miners ended up pretty much buying all those cards up when they were close to that msrp and it only lasted at max for a few hours before the prices increased however we'll talk about the market and the card a little bit later let's get on to those gaming benchmarks where we've tested at 1080p at either ultra or max settings and the first title you will see here is battlefield 5 where the rx 6600 does score a sizeable victory over the rtx 3060 and you may notice the 6600 xt is pulling out quite a fair bit ahead of the 6600 and this has to do with the makeup of the card itself even though they share the exact same silicon under the cooler they do have more stream processors enabled on the 6600 xt and also the memory speeds have been capped to 1750 megahertz which is then quadrupled to give you the effective memory speeds and that exists at seventeen hundred and fifty megahertz on the rx 6600 versus two thousand megahertz on the rx 6600 xt however if you do like tuning your graphics card then you can up the memory speeds to 1900 megahertz which i do suggest everyone does however this is a hard limit imposed via the bios on this particular graphics card however if you are into overclocking you can raise these speeds but you will be met with unfortunately a limit of 1900 megahertz as opposed to the 6600 xt which can go from 2 000 megahertz to 2 400. though onto f1 2020 here is where the 3060 and the 6600 start to trade blows scoring very similar performance and then after that the 6600 xt and the 360 ti scoring higher performance though onto far cry 6 a recently released title this is where nvidia does even the score from battlefield where they're scoring a victory with the 30-60 over the rx 6600 and then the 6600 xt then falls to the 3060 ti then in shadow of the tomb raider we do see a victory for the 6600 over the 30 60. though the last title we will pull up here is borderlands 3 where the 3060 does edge out the 6600 and that's then beaten by the 6600 xt and that's then beaten by the 3060 ti though just like the rx 6600 xt the 6600 is a phenomenal under vaulter and if you are into the most power efficient at least desktop gaming then this card just like the 6600 xt will deliver some impressive watts for the performance if you want to save power though also another interesting thing was when it came to overclocking the most gains to be had out of this graphics card actually came from the power limits which were imposed from the get-go so just like those memory limitations i did see a power limitation which limited the card at least from the raw power consumption from the graphics card to 100 watts however you can raise this 20 percent which then gives you 120 watts which still falls behind the 6600 xt but you will get a sizeable uplift in performance if you decide to do some basic overclocking so if you choose to overclock or undervolt i feel like you will get better price performance than what this card is offering out of the box though touching on the ray tracing this is where the rx 6600 doesn't do too well i wouldn't say it's really amd's generation for ray tracing performance and in fact the nvidia card the rtx 3060 does offer better value if you are looking to play games with ray tracing enabled you also do get the dlss 2.0 features on the rtx 3000 series card but amd has tried to counter this by offering fsr though for me personally i always try to play games at their native resolution and so when we look at the 3060 versus the 6600 we can see that they actually perform quite similar and coincidentally they also share the same so-called msrp the one to that 329 dollar price point here is where unfortunately just like the rx 6600 xt i feel like this card if it is in stock at close to this msrp i would actually interlude in this review and say buy it if it's close to the msrp especially if you're a gamer because just like the rx 6600 xt review i did i felt that the prices were going to go much higher than msrp and even if there was a card that was available for close to msrp price it didn't sit on the shelves for any longer than a few minutes if not a few hours depending on which country you live in one more point is that the rtx 3060 this card currently even with the low hash rate mining version in australia the cheapest you can get this for is 900 aussie dollars which is still far above nvidia's 500 aussie dollar price point that they were suggesting this card come in at so as long as cryptocurrency miners keep buying up these graphics cards unfortunately these cards are going to be coming in at higher price points than msrp but speaking of the crypto mining performance unfortunately just like the rx 6600 xt when i did the tests here it showed that it was giving about a dollar sixty per day which means that crypto miners are constantly going to be looking to purchase these cards especially around 320 which would give them a 200 day return on investment and the power consumption whilst doing this is also extremely good in fact the rx 6600 is one of the if not the most efficient mining graphics card out there so until this misery ends or if you are watching this video in the future and crypto mining profitability has completely sunk off the face of the earth which i'm hoping happens sooner than later because pc gaming just doesn't feel the same as it once did before this crypto mining ever happened i would say that this card right here at 329 dollars is a decent buy it's not the best choice i've seen but also not the worst where this is the swift 210 edition and putting this through the paces of the temperature and noise test we can see out of the box it likes to go to an automatic speed of 76 percent and this will give out roughly 44 decibels of noise though when i manually tuned it to 60 this was giving out much better noise and the temperatures weren't all that different moving up to 80 percent does give you slightly more noise does it drop the temperatures a slight amount and then going to a hundred percent is simply unbearable in terms of the noise and also the temperatures weren't that much better than the out of the box settings so for me personally i would set this card to manual 60 and enjoy lower noise as well as a decent gaming experience but speaking of the graphics card itself at the back we have three display ports as well as an hdmi 2.1 and this card with its dimensions measures in at 245 mil times 46 times 129 weighing in a little over 600 grams now there is two 100 mil fans as well as a metal backplate a v bios selection switch and an eight pin power in though with all that out of the way it's now time for a short and sweet conclusion with the rx 6600 and here's where we're going to say if we were comparing it to 2019 standards the 329 dollar price point would be mediocre they're looking at what we're faced with in 2021 if you can get this card for 329 usd or somewhere close to it and you really want to play games at least with good performance at 1080p then it will be a solid choice though i feel like paying anything over 30 percent msrp in this market is a straight rip off so i wouldn't pay any more personally than roughly 400 for this card and i hope that a lot of retailers can hold this card in stock under that price point though until then if these cards hover well above that 400 price point i personally wouldn't be buying one or i wouldn't recommend people be buying a graphics card with this performance at such a ridiculously high price anyhow guys with that aside i hope you enjoyed today's review of the rx 6600 xfx merc 210 if you did then be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comments section below what do you think of this launch right here from amd do you think it's a decent option if so yes if not why not love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day which comes from edwin k and they ask is it also compatible with windows 11. now they're talking about a budget 18 core and i know you might be thinking budget and 18 cores but that's exactly what we did in a recent video i'll put the link up here and we paired that with some other used parts and this build will currently work with windows 11 but microsoft does keep moving the goal posts backwards and forwards with windows 11 and what to expect so if we are referring to the windows 11 final release then i'm not entirely sure if this will work with that final release and this is basically a haswell generation xeon but as soon as it is released i will let you guys know until then peace out for now and if you've stayed this far and be sure to hit that sub button and ring that bell if you want to see the tech yes content as soon as it drops i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now [Music] world [Music]
