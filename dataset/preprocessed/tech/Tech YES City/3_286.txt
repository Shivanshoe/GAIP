the recent announcements of playstation 5 xbox series x and also the rtx 3000 having a messy launch have caused all sorts of different weird behavior especially in the used gaming pc market and today we're gonna go out and get a couple of deals but one really important thing on my mind is what is the future of used gaming pcs [Music] so this is one thing that i picked up on the road yesterday it was 45 aussie dollars this is a 5870 and you're probably thinking that's too much for a 5870 and i know it definitely is but the reason i got this because it was just in such good condition for a card that's 11 years old i believe i think this came out in 2009 if i remember correctly but this has got the accelero arctic accelero cooler on it and this looks like it's very similar to the xtreme 3 and the xtreme 3 does a really good job of cooling down graphics cards so i'm surprised they made a custom model for this card with the 5870 sticker on it and one thing i'm going to try and do i don't think it'll actually work but i'd love to be able to put this cooler on this card right here but if we look at the back of the cooler and the mounting spots they are completely different so if i can make some sort of mod work where i can get this mounted to this then i would love to check out a cooler that's over a decade old on the latest and greatest just to see how far gpu cooling has come or how far it hasn't come we're now here at the next day and i went to uh brisbane which is about an hour drive from where i am for my sister's birthday she had a really cool birthday going on and i of course i always do like i always get value out of my trip so to speak so there was a person who was having some problems with their uh pc that i sold i just sold them like a basic low end uh entry level pc and instead of going there and fixing it all up and spending maybe potentially hours at their place i just offered to replace their pc with a slightly better pc and they were just like over the moon and so that's one method of i guess service that you can do if you're flipping pcs because to be honest i would say one in every 20 pcs or so will just have weird problems and you just i mean they you stress test them they leave your studio absolutely fine but for whatever reason maybe the person's going four-wheel driving before they get home and a ram slot becomes loose in the process but you just sometimes you don't have time to figure it out when you're on the road so replacing that pc with another pc and then fixing that pc at your i guess your fixed station or wherever you work on pcs is just a lot more comfortable and a lot more i guess efficient than fixing it at someone else's place so that's a one little thing that i did and then also when i was up in brisbane i went and saw good old les and he had just a heap of monitors this time and i was surprised because at the moment where i am monitors are in extremely low supply everyone i'm talking to says they don't have monitors at the moment and i'm like well les had all these monitors i'm like sweet like i'll take the lot and so i cleaned him out of 22 inch monitors mainly 22 inch and one of the funniest things happened when i was at lez's place and that was he had a 90 mil stand in the last part-time and then when i went up to his place yesterday or if you know if you guys want to be fancy and say yes did i when i was up there he uh had a 22 inch samsung monitor and it had the 90 mil like indent bracket on it and then i was like dude you had that 90 ml stand in the last parts hunt that i did and he's like yeah yeah i had it but i threw it out and i'm like scratching my head i was like dude why'd you do that he's like i don't know man i had it sitting around never came into a 90 mil mount and then it's funny because he chucked it out and then he got a 90 mil mount monitor came in that actually needed that stand and i know exactly how les feels in this circumstance because in the past i've had cooler brackets that have just been sitting around for years you never use them and you're like all right it's time to clean out your place chuck them all out and then the next day you'll get a cooler in that needs that exact bracket or in case of a power supply like i'll have all these really weird modular power supply cables that i'd never use and they're for say like some super flower power supply and i chucked out some of these power cables and then like the next day a super flower power supply comes in i'm like i think in ways that relates back to murphy's law if something can go wrong then it will go wrong but i don't know how it ties in with maybe there's another a law out there the hey i had that thing five minutes ago and i just got really unlucky law and now we've quickly whipped up a beautiful beautiful little setup right here though here on in i have to go fix up a pc for a separate job that's not related to gaming pcs then after that i'm going to go see a friend and see if i can pick up any graphics cards and see what the situation is on gpus then we'll finally talk about the good old used market so i just finished up now after checking out this pc problem where it was i've never seen a problem like this it was basically when they went to make a new folder and then they made the name for that folder the folder would then freeze and the whole system was running absolutely fine you check the cpu performance the memory tabs and the gpu all that is not even going anywhere near 100 so you know the hardware is all running fine it was just some weird error that ended up being in file explorer where you had to take off quick access so basically they must have used the pc for so long that that temporary bank must have run full and it must have then been some sort of like registry error so the easy way to fix that was to clear all the quick access and then just turn it off and that actually fixed their problems so for me personally that is one of the funnest things about going out and doing call-outs is that you get to experience all these new problems and then fix them and i think it's uh it's one of those things honestly it just takes my mind off of all of the main stuff and that's making videos for you guys just takes my i don't want to make videos anymore i love making videos for you guys but the editing on those videos takes so long sometimes you're spending hours and hours a day in for me personally in premiere pro just constantly editing and it does get very repetitive i guess that's the worst part of doing youtube is editing the videos and so it does get very repetitive and boring so for me doing something like a call out getting out of the studio it's just really good uh to have a breather so let's get on to another question though because coming back here i got asked about uh rtx 3000 what do i think of it and my answer in the prices video when i made a video about the scalpers charging threefold the price i sort of like that opinion hasn't changed right i think it's a supply problem mainly here where nvidia i think they should have just allowed the reviews to go up but held back all the supply until they had that supposedly this massive shipment coming in at the end of october so i think if they held all the supply back till then they wouldn't have had the problem that they had and people are saying the scalpers and the bots they're the guys who made this problem and they only compounded the problem like if we put a supply and demand curve up the supply was clearly nowhere near that demand curve on this release and so basically the bots and the scalpers just really raised that demand curve that's all they did you still would have had people going on twitter and getting angry at nvidia if the scalpers and bots weren't there and for me personally this is the biggest take out of this whole situation this has got to do with the ps5 as well and i mean you got to give it to sony right they just said look nvidia we're going to take some of the heat off you and come in clutch here so we can get burned as well so they came in and they had their own problems with all the pre-ordering and people reselling pre-orders on sony ps5 that's the exact same problem that is happening with the ps5 that is happening on the rtx 3000 series but what i really wanted to get at here was just take a step back and say to yourself if the only problem in your life right now is the fact that you can't get an rtx 3080 then your life is really and i mean this it must be really [ __ ] good and i mean guys there are people out there in the world who have real problems i mean when i was a kid when i was eight years old i remember there was this span in that year where we were like damn is there going to be a plate of food on the table tonight and so you don't forget those kinds of things you don't forget those times because they've happened and so that's what you see what's going on here on the channel if i'm doing bad i'm really doing good i'm always going to keep smiling and happy because i've got a place to stay i got a bed i'm healthy i've got food on the table so things are good in my corner of the uh of the world and so that's never you know as long as i've got a plate of food coming for the night i'm going to be happy and so basically there's going to be no supply problems for rtx 3000 cards in a few months you just have to wait and so if you can't wait then of course you can go out and you can get ripped off that is up to you if you want to do it but the problem would have still existed had there not been bots and scalpers that's just my opinion and i i watch uh review tech usa rich and he's like ebay have got to stop this ebay i've gotta do something about it i don't think ebay have to do anything about it ebay is just a marketplace and they make a cut off whatever people sell it's in ebay's best interest to allow people to sell stuff so they can make profit i mean if you want to cut that off then you're cutting off essentially what is known as a free market and without a free market believe me you wouldn't even have an rtx 3000 to begin with you wouldn't even have a ps5 in the pipeline these products just wouldn't exist if there wasn't such thing as a free market anyways there's my opinion on that one we're going to talk about some used pc parts the market and what's going on right here if you want to build a used pc in the next few months it's going to be such a good time except for the gpus and this is the thing the low-end gpus they're still overpriced i look on on facebook this guy's selling gtx 960s for 200 bucks aussie like what i mean there's an rx 570 brand new for 169 dollars why would i bother going to buy that used card when i can get something more powerful and better for cheaper it just doesn't make any sense so the used market for gpus is still all over the place i'm really hoping that nvidia and amd do bring out their lower entry cards as soon as possible so they can fix which i believe is the biggest problem in the uspc market right now but in terms of the rest of the parts in the builds that's going to get competitive i mean i already see guys dropping prices of bills i'm dropping my prices of builds things are getting really competitive and i like that because with competition brings innovation so the content that's going to be coming in the next few months i feel is just going to be really exciting i'm going to get back to that 2016 2017 tech yes city where we're going to be mixing used and new and it's just going to be some of those past good times they're going to be coming back i'm ready i'm going to bring the energy for you guys and in the meantime if you are doing it tough if you can't make any money and you're just breaking even on your builds then now's a better time than ever to just have a break and just relax a little bit hang up the boots for a couple of months see how the market goes being patient is never a bad thing don't forget that and with that aside we've got the question of the day here which comes from donny and they ask what's the verdict on burn in though oleds have issues with it and something like a gaming hud might burn in on an oled tv and this has been a problem in the past but i believe at least the lg oleds the newer ones have a thing called screen shift and that stops them from getting burning i believe some people have played games on these lg tvs a lot and over like 5 000 hours and they've suffered no burning and you may notice in the background we've got the newest member of the family here here's the cx lg 55 inch oled that thing is absolutely amazing if you get it with an rtx 3080 you're going to get that 4k 120 hertz and oled is just the best of all monitor technology out there you really need fast response times the backlighting is beautiful for your eyes and with that aside guys i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
