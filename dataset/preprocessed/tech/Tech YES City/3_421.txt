aisa Nitro viewers viewers made the a the Nitro this was a PC that got traded in a few days ago and it was very curious to me because the person who traded it in they said they were having problems playing Fortnight competitively and they said when they got into matches these big matches where they're in a circle and there's all these buildings going up and stuff that this FPS on this machine would dip and I automatically responded okay what's the specs of your system and they said it had an i5 8400 and then they said they've got a gtx 1066 gigabyte and I'm thinking well these specs should play 49 especially on low settings which is what a lot of the comp players play on this should play this game absolutely fine with no stuttering whatsoever and so I then asked him okay how much RAM does it have and he thought it had 16 gigabytes of RAM but I just said to take a quick peek through the side panel and ask him how many sticks of RAM it had in there and he said it only had one and I was like okay well it could be that but usually even a single channel of memory on an 8400 should be okay at least for not getting these big dips in fps and so what I said to him I said I I'm so busy dude I don't really have time to look at it and if I look at it I'll have to charge you unfortunately and he said look you've got some pcs for sale can I just straight up trade this PC with one that I know works and I said sure thing so he came in he traded in his ace in Nitro and then he I haven't heard from him since so the pcs obviously working really well for him but this one here the more I started to look at it the more I started to realize what was wrong with these om systems so what we're going to do today is go through this ace of nitro and 50 - 600 and find out all the things that I feel aren't up to par when it comes to selling a PC especially for gamers [Music] to the right of me here we are running a stress test on the i-5 80 400 and even after a few minutes this cool is starting to get a bit noisy the temperatures are in the 80 degree region and the funny thing is today is actually a pretty cool day here at about 23 degrees Celsius so straight away going through the hardware issues with this whole nitro system here it starts off even from the CPU cooler that they've implemented it's really not that good enough and the i-5 8400 is actually a really easy to cool CPU and that you don't need a big cooler to begin with but that's connected now to a motherboard which is a proprietary board and we did have some troubles with this when I initially installed in RTX 2060 and I couldn't get it to install properly I then had to download the BIOS update install the BIOS update and that that installed the graphics card afterwards I also tested an AMD card on this and that installed fine after the bus update before that however we could only use the 1066 Giga Byte with this system so it was a pretty bizarre problem in that if you don't know how to update a bar so you're not comfortable doing it then you're really only locked into one line of graphics card on this system and the temperatures got quite hot on this thing as well as it having only a 550 gram cooler so there including a gtx 1066 gigabyte sure but it's really not the best example of a 1066 gigabyte it's like the worst model you can get but other than that the CPU cooler managed to keep the CPU over 80 degrees so this is for an i-5 8400 so they're using a cheap cooler they're using a one of the cheapest model 1060 you can get and then inside that all that is mounted on a cheap motherboard one of the cheapest I've seen to the point where it doesn't even show you your memory speeds in the BIOS and it locks you out to the point where you can't even read your memory speeds in the program like I 264 for example so the only way I found out that my memory speeds were at a certain level was when I booted up the system after the BIOS update and it showed me that I was running at 2400 megahertz now initially this had a stick in it I think it was 2666 but it was only in single channel and so what this meant was this memory could be running at 21 33 megahertz those 20 666 speeds aren't guaranteed unless you have the option to lock them in in the BIOS so this poor person who traded his PC and could have had one of the worst case scenarios when running his game of fortnight when his hardware especially the 8400 is much more capable of giving in better fps basically selling something like this to a consumer and having them have all these problems when all's they buy these PC for usually is the simplicity is not a good thing it doesn't really go well with the brand image that I guess ace is trying to portray I don't know because if I sold a PC and add a single stick of memory in it and that wasn't even clocked properly and then I'm putting in the cheaper CPU cooler the cheapest motherboard and there's a thing that the motherboards not even anywhere near as good as an h3 10 motherboard because at least all the big manufacturers that I know like MSI gigabyte has rock Zeus they all let you at least have the ability on an h3 10 motherboard to lock in 26 66 megahertz at least and change your timings now this thing here just doesn't give you that option but furthermore there's no heatsink on the platform chipset hub it's just got nothing on it and coupled with the fact that the vrm has no heat sinks on it it looks pretty cheap this allows the i-5 8400 to go all the way up to 65 watts in the stress test when I 580 400s usually use up a little bit less power if you've got proper cooling and proper components feeding them power so I'm not exactly sure what acer is trying to portray here with this nitro series essentially you're buying an expensive pre-built system that isn't running as well as it should be out of the box furthermore you've got to jump through hoops just to get your system running properly however the problems don't just stop there when I try to install Windows 10 Pro I was only greeted with the option of not having any options in that it would automatically install Windows 10 home and it would force that install and you can't upgrade the OS after that so whatever deals ace is doing with both the motherboard manufacture which in this case they're using either a company called quanta or compound and Microsoft has me like I'm seriously confused here I'm guessing that they're going for the cheapest options available on motherboards coolers and also RAM and GPUs and they're sourcing all this stuff so cheap that they don't realize that the end user in the end is missing out so basically in a nutshell when you see an OEM system like this and you think wow it looks good I'm gonna have no problems you may wish to think again because the amount of problems I had just to get this thing running to a smooth gaming experience left me scratching my head it shouldn't be happening in any pre-built gaming desktop that's sold on the market to this day and in fact what I saw with this Acer PC was pretty much everything inside it besides the 8400 the two drives in the powers play weren't really up to par and so at least they did put in an FSP 80 plus bronze powers play that was pretty good to see I've used a lot of FSP power supplies in the past and they are pretty decent but as we said before that everything from the RAM did the cooler to the motherboard to the GPU was just really lacking and they didn't even put in an exhaust fan to exhaust heat out of what would be considered a mid-range gaming PC we're in a small case like this he is going to accumulate pretty quickly and with all those complaints aside it's finally now time to boot up fortnight and see if this computer has any more issues with dropped FPS or stuttering frames [Music] so the FPS is now fixed it's now running really smoothly but I probably will add in an exhaust fan as well just to cool down temperatures on this system and the last thing I gotta say is and what worries me about this PC here is is that this is a reason people wonder why for instance the competition between a and D and Intel scanned of been a big argument lately but when we look at rising systems they're really good value for money and you're probably thinking well companies are going to change over like aces and Dells and stuff like that they're all gonna change over to Rison and realize it's better than tell you for money and I'm thinking of myself well maybe not if they keep having the incentive to use a single stick of memory and its really clocked low because I do know from my testing that Intel CPUs do perform better with lower clocked memory both in single and dual channel memory the AMD Rison systems do scale a lot better with more higher speed memory and so when you look at that picture and you relate it back to systems like these you can see why these companies have these incentives just to cheap out on everything just so they can get that spec sheet looking good at the end of the day and it's one thing that I'm gonna implore you guys if you know people who are looking for pre builds go out and buy pre-built off small businesses that actually build proper pcs and they're not trying to pull this stuff what with what ace is doing with this nitro system here it's really not good for a gamer especially a gamer in the long term that wants to get smooth FPS and a non stuttering experience so basically there's the journey finished with the ends 5600 series desktops nitro gaming PC I'm guessing the only thing that's getting boosted here with the nitro is your wallet so do be careful of that when you go out and think about buying something like this I was just kind of like realize what's going on here and it's just a yes a cheap special where everything's getting cheap doubt on I mean the fact that they're not including an exhaust fan with like a PC that easily in Australia this thing would have costed over I'm guessing $1500 when it was sold it's beyond me there's just cheaped out on so many ways possible and the end of the day it's all in the name of making the most amount of profit possible and you can see that with this PC right here but anyway guys if you enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comments section below what you think about pcs like this pre-built like this do you think they need to change their game and at least include some of the what I feels the basic necessities as I love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of thoughts and opinions we got the question of the day which comes from a jackin deluxe and he asked what was your biggest PC related mistake and this comes in the form of actually in the last few months I've made a II I guess it's a big mistake and it happened when I was making the thumbnail for the 55 dollar fortnight gaming PC I'll put the link to that video up here and that PC I ran everything I did the video went so well but then afterwards I was trying to take a thumbnail on my balcony but in the end I actually had to end up photoshopping the thumbnail because what happened was when I put it on the balcony and I plugged the power up it just this massive bang I've never heard such a loud bang come from a power supply in my life and I realized oh no that power supply is gone and so that TX 750 that I used in that video that just it was ruined and so what the biggest mistake I made there was not turning that switch to the O position before I plugged in an extension cable so there's probably like a I'd say to be about five meter extension cable and so that's a lesson I've learned now is when you're using really long leads or even if you're using short leads just make sure that pounds play is always in that position before you plug it in especially with high powered power supplies because this one it was in that I position the on position and when I turned it on and when I plugged the power and just bang and so that was one of the biggest mistakes I've made both in terms of foolishness but also in terms of something that's costed me a little bit of money because the TX 750 pounds play is actually quite expense if anyway without all the side guys I'll catch you in another tech video very soon if you're enjoying the content you've stayed this far and you know yet something you want to see it as soon as it drops don't forget to hit that sub button ring the bell and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
