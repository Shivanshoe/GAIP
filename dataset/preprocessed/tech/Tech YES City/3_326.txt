Henry Cavill aka superman has recently
built a gaming pc and the internet is going
crazy over this video that he posted on
instagram now i watched this video and i absolutely loved it but the reasons i
loved it for are probably not the most obvious
reasons which is why i'm going to make this video today
and talk about some of the things that i really took out of this that i think
that you could apply to not just pc building
but life in general though of course i can see why the internet will go
absolutely crazy over this video to begin with first of all he's building
a gaming pc and therefore superman's building a gaming pc then you've got
greater than symbol console and i'm sure the pc master race
subreddit is going to be going absolutely but bonkers over this video
but then also in the video he's using amd ryzen so a lot of the amd subreddit
is probably going to be going bonkers over this video too and then of course
nvidia they're like tweeting this going hey he's using an rtx graphics card
so all the factors involved are absolutely loving this video of course
except intel you gotta feel sorry for intel
or do you now let's go from the start to the finish on this video
and see what we can all take out from henry cavill's
epic first gaming pc today's video is sponsored by
dashlane dashlane is a password manager that is quick to download and powerful
in its abilities so i like to browse local forums trial new video services
like apple tv and i don't want to give out my most
important tier 1 passwords especially if i'm disconnecting from
this service later and this is where i let dashlane simply
do its thing with dashlane it can autofill and
remember these passwords for these websites that you don't visit
often shipping details and also other boring details
can be auto filled too on top of all that it can auto generate complicated
passwords and store them too so if you have become
accustomed to using one word dictionary entered base passwords
and you might want to stop doing that then all you have to do is download
dashlane login and remember the one master
password you set for your dashlane account
and the rest is history now if you use the link dashlane.com

below easy let's get back to the video so then uh
we move into the next part of this video we see that he's got all the parts laid
out here on the desk and he's blurred out some of the logos
in particular the rtx and also the ryzen logos and my guess
here would be either two things i don't know exactly why but
the first reason would be he's using copyrighted music in the video
and he doesn't want the companies to be associated
with that so i guess he's just blurring out the logos just in case anything
could come out of this secondly of course he could be saying
look i'm going to build a pc i want to get into the magical land
of gaming pcs and here's how many views i could potentially
get your brand so let's work out some deals perhaps
it could be either of these two reasons but i'm guessing it's actually more to
do with the first reason but honestly how cool would it be if
henry cavill had his own pc gaming tech channel
so straight away he's uh reading the instruction manual and then he's clearly
showing the camera that he really like just doesn't
know what he's doing but he's got the instruction manual and he
doesn't really care he's just taking a simple laid-back approach
to building his first gaming pc and that is a really good thing
that you're going to see coming into this because in life
if you don't know something you can figure it out
and that's how everything with human evolution
and also technology and stuff like that that's the attitude that a lot of people
had going into it if you don't know
something someone somewhere along the longs of time had to
figure out how to do it and so that's that attitude you just see
it it starts like look we've got the instruction manual here we
don't know what we're doing but we're just going to take
a laid back approach and get into this and
start building he then tries to install the cpu he's reading again being patient
reading the instruction manuals on both the motherboard and the cpu and
he even makes a note this is a really sensitive part and then he just
proceeds to take his time he actually made a mistake here
and he put the cpu on the wrong way but because he's taking his time and being
patient he tried to pull the lever down but he
knew straight away that that wasn't going to work and so this is
important for pc building in that if you know something isn't fitting
right just take a step back ask some people on forums or get some
friends to help you if they've not only done pc building but
say for instance you're doing something else in life that you've never done
before whether it's changing a car tire or something like that you can just
apply this simple way of going about it and that is of
course just be patient and if something doesn't look right
always take a step back so that's what i really loved about
this right here up until one minute and 15 seconds
is that he's humble he's showing that he makes mistakes
and everyone in this world makes mistakes but also it's the way you go
about that and so nothing was really severely
damaged here he didn't have a finished product
he didn't claim to know that he was the master and god of pc building
unlike another publication we've seen in the past
so now we can see here he's uh putting the water cooler on reading the
instruction manual again and he's actually trying to mount it in
the case at 1 minute and 47 seconds because i guess
you can read the instruction manual to a certain point
but there's going to be things that don't apply to your situation i'm
guessing his particular case and how he should
mount this cooler isn't in the instruction manual so he's
trying to figure that out himself and he's like no that doesn't look right
we'll take a step back and then we'll try it again so really
again just that whole calm and patient approach
is working out really well and at two minutes in one second we can see here he
kind of abandoned the radiator install and then just went on to the power
supply and something else and if you're getting
frustrated with something this is actually a good thing in life
where you can just try and do something else
to take your mind off the frustration and i can kind of see here reading his
face at two minutes that he does look a little bit
frustrated but also we can see outside his house
that it's actually turning into night so he has spent a lot of time
so far trying to build this pc but that's a good thing right it's better to
get the job done right one time than to make a mistake
and potentially damage something so now we fast forward to two minutes
and 30 seconds and here is where he's sort of skipped a lot of the video
showing you how he built the pc putting the power supply in and putting
all the cables and routing all that stuff
but you can see he's now kind of got a near complete
build and he's just checking over it to make sure it looks okay
and this is a great process not just for pc building but for anything you do in
life and that perhaps if something doesn't
look right then perhaps it isn't right and now three minutes in it
looks like he has his preliminary build finished with his gravis card mounted
but then there's a message here totally just ran out of hard drive space
uh not really a surprise considering this took hours i'm not sure what he's
particularly referring to here did he run out of like
actual space on his hard drives trying to copy data over or
did he run out of hard drive uh like space to mount the hard drives in the
case with perhaps too many cables at the back
with cable management so that one's a little bit ambiguous so
now the next minute of this video is basically
he's uh started the computer up it's working fine
he's checking over it in the bios and then he's showing the world that hey
look we made a mistake mounting this cooler upside down
but who cares i want to play some games i've spent long enough
building this pc it's time for me to enjoy my hard work
and fruits of my labor and i'll get to fixing this later
and that's a good thing like showing the world that you make mistakes
even superman can make mistakes is a good
thing everyone in life makes mistakes and this was my favorite part of the
video because he just said look i made a
mistake and he just he could have easily have cut all that out
and just mounted it properly and pretended like it was never there
but the good thing is he just doesn't care about that perception
and he wants to show people look this is my first time building
of course i'm going to make some mistakes and you could make these
mistakes too it's nothing really to worry about
we'll fix it later and then right around four minutes you
can tell he has spent a lot of time building this gaming pc
just that oh here we go again and then after that he says the end or more
realistically just the beginning and so that's the
positive glass half full coming out of it it's
like look we've built this pc and it isn't really the end
it's just the beginning because i'm going to start playing pc games on this
thing and really enjoy what i've built and all
in all that is a pc build done and dusted by a
celebrity and it's really cool to see this not
just because of how humble henry cavill was when he was building
this but also the fact that he just made mistakes
and he took a patient and laid back approach to doing this
and basically the biggest message coming out of this video for me personally was
hey we all make mistakes in life it's just your attitude towards how you make
those mistakes and whether you learn from them and
clearly he did learn from them even within the video itself
and he showed that so that was really awesome to see another really good thing
of course is that pc gaming is getting a lot more
mainstream attention now and if celebrities are getting into this
kind of thing it just means that there's going to be more interest in pc gaming
and when that happens that means that we're going to be getting ultimately the
end better parts better games and it's just
really one good thing to see pc gaming evolving
and for me personally how about console gaming well i guess that that's just
sort of getting integrated into pc gaming because
they're starting to use a lot of uh pc hardware and consoles now so it's only a
really good thing for pc gamers when videos like this pop
up the last thing that came out of this for me personally was i love that this
was how he approached this video as opposed to another publication in the
past that's made a video building a pc and then they
claimed they knew everything and they made some of the
most terrible mistakes you could make and then they backpedaled on all those
mistakes and the ironic thing is is they reported on henry cavill building his
first pc and made no mention of their own uh terrible
first pc building experience but anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's
video do let us know in the comment section below what you think of henry
cavill's first gaming pc i absolutely love this
video and as i said in the intro i loved it for all these other reasons
that i pointed out today as opposed to the main celebrity getting
into pc gaming kind of thing i hope you enjoyed this video if you did
then be sure to slap a like on it and if you stayed this far and you're
enjoying the content around tech yes city sure to hit that sub button
ring that bell and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye [Music]
