so you've just bought your shiny new risin five sixteen hundred AF and you may want to save money and go with something like an a320 motherboard and if you live in an area where you can't get access to say hey 320 from one of the big brands like MSI or gigabyte or Zeus or asrock then are these Aliexpress specials going to do the job well today we've got the budget a320 Aliexpress showdown where we've got here the andar first up which is coming in with the shipping price of $65 shipped to your door now this one right here does have a BIOS update on the website which does say it supports rising 3,000 chips and also upon opening the box this is all you really get is the motherboard the i/o shield and a SATA cable and then up here we've got next the colourful motherboard this is coming in with a smooth price tag of $55 so it's ten dollars cheaper than the under and what you get is in the last ten days on their website I have actually seen that they've released a BIOS update for rise in 3000 so this one here coming in ten dollars cheaper and then we've got last up here the Challenger I did check this out before when I did a build last year naulila Express build but I think I use the version one this right here is the version two which is supposed to have a one gigabit per second Ethernet port and just got better specs overall so essentially it's an upgraded version but the problem with this one is is it doesn't have any support on the website for any BIOS updates the last BIOS update for a max on a 320 motherboard is from 2018 and of course if you want metier CPUs you want at least a 2019 BIOS on this so this one I don't think will work with 3000 series chips but what we're going to quickly do now is put the rise in 3,000 3300 X in all these boards and quickly check for that compatibility and if so can we update the bosses and then we'll get on to the arisin v 1600 AF tests to see if it can handle the heat on the vrm but this one right here coming in with a price tag of $50 it is the cheapest in today's comparison so it does have that going for it and honestly the one that I used in the past it's still going strong to this date so even though they're cheap they can still do the job and this is one thing I'll point out before we get into this comparison is that if you're getting an a320 motherboard seriously think about limiting it to a six core only and that you're getting a rise in five 3,600 if it supports rising 3,000 oh you're just going with the risin 5 1600 AF or a 2600 personally when I think of a 320 I think of a 65 watt TDP limit just as a safe zone anything over that you may get throttling of performance or of course the temperatures on your vrm may get too hot word of cause problems over time and of course with those problems comes hassle which I'm sure none of us want but last up here we've got the galaxy 320m I've never tried a Galax motherboard before but this one does have the BIOS support for the latest rise in 3000 series on the website - so three of the four boards are supporting BIOS updates on the website and this one here unfortunately it's no longer for sale on Aliexpress and I don't know where you can get it anymore but I thought I'd include it in the comparison just in case you can pick it up on a deal somewhere and you're wanting to know what it performs like though with all that aside let's roll that intro and then start getting into the compatibility test straight away [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we've updated the BIOS on this Galax board now and the problem is it still doesn't work with a razzin v 1600 AF or a risin 330 300 X so we're gonna give this board a Miss and get on with the others and now we've booted up the colorful motherboard and there's already some good news and that is the risin 5 1600 AF it works out of the box at least with this one that I bought off Aliexpress another good thing is is that it does have a ram overclock feature within this BIOS and it's actually working fine the 3000 megahertz seal 16 stuff that we put in works fine with the 32 hundred megahertz profile that they have in there now I might try and drop the timings a little bit with the other profiles they have but I just wanted to see if this concept of this memory overclocked feature would actually work with the rise of 5 1600 AF and sure enough it does work absolutely fine another thing is to we're running the stress test right now on the vrm so we're gonna let that sit for a good 20 minutes and come back and see how hot the VRM gets with the 1600 AF now nothing is - it is running the old cool boost here 3.6 gigahertz and it depends on the motherboard sometimes you can go up to 3.7 gigahertz I believe but 3.6 gigahertz all cool on a budget a 320 board for 55 bucks is already looking pretty good [Music] and here we are with the first motherboard that has completed a semi recommendation testing phase here this is a bit of a weird one because the risin 5 1600 AF pretty much failed on this motherboard in that the vrm was getting up to a hundred and 18 degrees Celsius and this is in a 21 C environment so basically if we get into summer this thing will start throttling and it's just not good for longevity purposes so it was getting up to 3.6 Giga that's all core 3.7 Giga single core scoring around 2,700 30 points in Cinebench and then it was reporting that it was juicing 77 watts in Hardware inferred that it was juicing a 150 watts from the wall the whole package now here's where the news does get good for this motherboard though because the NIC on board is a true 1 gigabit per second testing the speeds out they looked fine and then moving on to the onboard audio surprisingly it was decent yeah we had a -7 decibel 10 Hertz to zero Hertz roll-off but the crosstalk was negative 82 on left and right channels and the good thing is after that frequency response roll off the line was really straight this is literally the straightest line I've seen for a board that's a super entry level budget motherboard at fifty five US dollars ships so that news there is looking pretty good for the board itself but then we had to update the BIOS to get these 3300 ex to work and the update process is a little bit tedious you got to go to the website download the BIOS update it doesn't update within the boss itself so you've got to use I just use the windows method and then it runs all these commands and it asks you look the rom sizes don't match up do you want a force flash and this is the same with the galaxy's follows the same method you just gotta hit yes I think it's iki and it accepts it then it force flashes your bias then you change over the CPU and you can have your 3,300 X or 3100 working absolutely fine and I do point to these two 4 cores specifically because they work really well like I'm running a benchmark in the background now the Cinebench it's working absolutely fine with the four core 3,300 X and the VR M is only getting up to around 70 degrees maximum which is absolutely fine so the scores here for the 3300 X it definitely gets a pass the Cinebench all core is going up to four point two to five gigahertz roughly and that's scoring 2542 points which is quite impressive and then you've got that RAM overclocking feature on an a320 motherboard which also allows you to lock in even better Ram speeds and they do work quite well on this budget board so overall it's not geared up really towards six cores but it's geared up quite well towards budget four cores and it does a pretty good job at that let's however now move over to the on da and run some more tests [Music] and here we are now just finishing up testing the Honda a 320 V version 3.0 and now this worked out of the box with the 3,300 X and I did like that so if you want to go get a board and a 3300 H you have to worry about using another CPU to update the BIOS but that is literally the only good piece of news with this board where everything else just started going downhill and that is when I first started it up there was you had to go really deep into the BIOS to find any sort of memory overclocking which maxed out at 2.5 gigahertz initially and I was like ok this is really not gonna work and then after that I did decide to update the BIOS and we saw that there was a 3,000 megahertz option there and it just didn't work the the overclocking on the memory just didn't work and so they really need to update the BIOS to have a more simplistic way of locking in higher memory speeds and getting that to work so their BIOS does need a bit of work but other than that the temperatures on the vrm ended up being a little bit worse than the colourful board despite it having what it looks like a couple of extra phases on board and it scored 71 degrees and it was drawing a roughly the same wattage from the wall as the colourful board though surprisingly in Cinebench this took the Rison 330 300 X getting it close to the 2600 points at 4.3 gigahertz all core and then the single core went up to four point three five gigahertz so it was boosting it at quite a healthy level it's just the BIOS and the tuning of memory in particular really needs work with this board it's got a bit of potential but the potentials letdown with essentially the programming there besides that before and after the BIOS update it also didn't work with a Rison five 1600 AF and if anything if we're getting hotter temperatures on the vrm then the colourful board it's probably going to fail and so I decided not to test the onboard audio and the NIC speeds out because I just simply can't recommend this board to anyone at this point in time especially when it's $10 more than the previous board will be just tested [Music] and it's the morning after and we have here the a320 m2 - VH now I was surprised because in the listing it didn't say it's supported municipal X was working absolutely fine on this motherboard now we saw with the temperatures they got a little bit higher than the colourful motherboard so the vrm is probably a little bit inferior to that of this one right here but it also comes in five dollars cheaper ship so it's coming just under 50 USD shipped to your door worldwide and the funny thing is this one did have an inferior BIOS but at least unlike the onda we were able to get our memory speeds up - in this case I tried 3066 megahertz and it worked absolutely fine so even though there's no support for a BIOS update on max ons website for this board the one that shipped with this will support the new 30 130 300 X though keep in mind just like the other boards here I probably wouldn't recommend going with a 6 core just because the V RMS overtime longevity we saw that temperature going over 100 degrees on this board but unfortunately for the Challenger it didn't even flat-out work with the 1600 AF it just wouldn't boot period so that's the problem with this though going through the other figures with the onboard audio it was again inferior to the colourful board where we saw - 10 decibels drop off from under 10 Hertz and then the rest of the frequency from 600 Hertz and upwards that was actually shaky so pretty bad onboard audio than the mic input that was showing some heavy noise - and then the NIC surprisingly has been upgraded like this saying from a hundred megabits per second to one gigabit per second so with all that out of the way let's now move on to a conclusion with these four aliexpress banging motherboards so straight up we got the Gallic sport which had come had ability issues I couldn't get this to work so that was like automatically out of the equation even though it kind of had even a little bit of bling on it it looked pretty decent though then we're moving on to the on dirt and this one looked promising at first but after we went through it it just ended up being a disappointment especially the BIOS that really needs work on this the memory overclocking was just pretty much non-existent and it was just buried in a heap of other options which I would say is more suited towards someone running a low powered server so that might be an option for you there was a lot of options in the bass to choose from with this particular board but when it came to gaming and making something dedicated for gamers this wasn't the board for you then we've got the Challenger and this board a $50 ship worldwide if you can get a cheap fork or whether it be arisin 5 1400 or Rison 330 130 300 X then this board right here it is going to check out but the problem with that is that the onboard audio is really bad so I'd recommend just for the sake of the health of your ears I would get a better onboard audio solution and not use this one but also at the same time the vrm even with the 4 core was getting pretty hot and when I've tested a320s in the past from gigabyte and also as rock they've even handled a risin 5 3600 absolutely fine I've had no qualms of that so this one here if you've seen what I've talked about in this video and you know what it's about and you want to save that $20 over cent as rock board even on our Express then you that's up to you to take that gamble I personally wouldn't recommend it because we got the next board right here the colorful which is only another five dollars more and had decent onboard audio and the temperatures were better even though it was a slight victory it was still better in terms of not just as power efficiency it was slightly more power efficient but also the temperatures were lower on this vrm so make no mistake all the VRMs on these a320 motherboards pretty crap but that doesn't mean that you can't still get a decent gaming performance especially out of the likes of this one right here so we saw those performance figures with the 3,300 X this was giving out some really good numbers both on the all core and the single core speeds so really when it comes down to it we've got one winner amongst the bunch and I wouldn't really call it a winner per se because it didn't really sit well with the six core and that the temperatures on the rise in five 1600 AF we're getting too hot for my liking now one thing you could do coming out of this you could maybe fit in some heat sinks but it would be pretty difficult amongst the inner parts of this vrm here and then put a fan over those heat sinks and you could get some good value for money and still run a six core though the problem still exists for all four of these a320 boards here and that is that the ones that I've tested in the past they as rock and also the Gigabyte even their entry level boards are much better than this colorful board right here so the colorful does win in today's comparison and I will say that I did like the BIOS it was very good and the memory OC feature that they implemented worked extremely well though it still leaves a little bit to be desired and also on that note if you do get this board and you're getting say arisin 330 100 or 3300 X do make sure that it's got either the 1008 bias or the 1009 bias because 1007 a bias which was released after the 1008 bias it's weird I know the dates I had to double-check all this won't support the Machias CPUs like it says in the notes so you have to make sure that it's got the two biases that says support for Mature CPUs otherwise your CPU won't boot and there is no bias flashback feature on any of these four boards that are featured here today so that's pretty much it when it comes to cheap a320 motherboards from Aliexpress from brands that you may have never heard of before the the compromises are there even though you can save some money the compromises are definitely there so making a clean-cut recommendation now with these four motherboards I would only really go with the colorful motherboy current price points and with that said I would keep it strictly to a maximum of a four core and if you wanted to go with the six core then I'd recommend stepping it up to an asrock or gigabyte a320 and spending a little bit extra money but for what it's worth this board right here did show a lot of potential and I am gonna be keeping an eye out for what colorful do in the future especially with their motherboards and maybe if they were to release an a320 with a slightly better vrm that would handle six cores then I think that have a winner on their hands in terms of the other three they're really not worth it I would give them a Miss that's just my opinion and I hope you guys enjoyed this one if you did then be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comment section below what you think of today's aliexpress a320 roundup but before I get on out of here we got the question of the day which comes from three electronics zero and they asked or is pro the new tomahawk question mark and I'm going to be honest checking the new horas pro boards I've only had one come through here that was the Z for ninety or as pro ax but it looks like their pro lineup is gonna be their premium value sort of thing like you're gonna get a really good VRM out of gigabyte and now with orissan gigabyte motherboards Oris basically means nowadays really good vrm that's what I've been told from gigabyte themselves so the Auris pro looks like it's coming in with the best value for a VRM if that's what you're looking for out of a new motherboards whether it's be 550 or z 490 or x 570 the Auris pro is that lineup from gigabyte it's gonna give you a really premium vrm for the money and with all that out of the way if you guys are still here and you want to see the content the moment of drops then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and I'll catch you in the next one pretty soon peace out for now be
