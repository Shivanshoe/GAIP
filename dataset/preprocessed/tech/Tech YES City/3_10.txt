live we should be live it has been a long time since we've been live a long time i don't know i don't know if this is going to work we are live streaming from japan possibly in 4k as well so connect your live streaming oh well we're just like straight up live welcome back to a tech yes le city live stream join in on chat join in on chat because today we have a lot to discuss it is finally happening all over the world we have the great gpu sell-off has begun we've got ebay 235 bucks for an rx 6600 bet you thought that would never happen but it is happening so come join in and chat come get cozy because man i gotta shrug off my live streaming cobwebs and uh yeah come join in say hello and chat and uh i've gotta actually look at the chat because i got like a small monitor and i got a big monitor they got two monitors in the background but those monitors are kind of doing not a whole lot okay all righty all righty we're getting prepped for the big one the big sell-off are you ready folks are you ready what is cracker lacking i'm gonna turn that little light on too just to make sure it's a little bit warm in here because we're going to need a lot of warmth we're going to need a whole lot of warmth and uh wow you guys you guys are you guys are coming in fast man the chat's just like coming in crazy fast so it's been it's been a huge huge long time right since we've been live streaming take your citizens welcome back and i'm going really well like yeah how's it going how's it going guys and i've been going great uh japan's been very good to me and we'll talk about japan a little bit later and uh because they're saying japan's going to experience massive inflation and if you look in australia like the lettuce the price of a lettuce is ten dollars that that to me is like really bad inflation but um japan's been really good i'd say out of the major economies japan's inflation's extremely low like i come here and i get breakfast with a drink bar and everything for like six dollars australian that's at a restaurant so there's the comparison automatically to how bad inflation is in japan versus australia it's almost non-existent here but um let's uh let's go into it guys marco's in chat as well hello marco join in everyone join in chat and get cozy because hopefully the mic sounds good as well believe it or not i'm using a audio interface board from 2004 so i will be making an audio video for you guys if you want to get into live streaming you don't need to go out and buy thousand dollar mic setups and all this other crap you can get like a 50 use mic 40 sound board and you should be getting awesome audio so hopefully uh do let us know if you're enjoying the audio on the chat if the audio is coming in hot and good that's a good thing and hello from the united states hello brother how are you going g'day chat is poppa loppin and uh let's get into the news first of all what's happening with crypto why is crypto crashing people want to know what's going on well we've got here 20 cents a kilowatt hour and i think power's on the way up in australia some of the power providers are charging 40 cents a kilowatt hour so if we look at the profits here there's an rtx 3080 that i've locked in for the what to mine.com and we can see here ethereum's pretty much the only thing giving people any sort of incremental sorts of money where even in september 2020 i remember this was like getting up to two dollars a day this right here is just mine designing it's not even worth their time right they're gonna burn out their hardware at these profit rates so you can expect the gpu sell-off to come right now it's happening and it's going to like i said september's the time just based on the good old tech yes economic analysis on when the prices will bottom out i think september's going to be that month where you'll see gpus coming in very cheap and the amd gpus on the used market uh we'll put in here though we'll quickly put in here 30 cents a kilowatt hour calculate this and see right here wow you're losing money so in some parts of the world if power is expensive and you're mining you're going to be losing money so instead of paying for instead of paying for your mining setup it's just better to go buy the crypto directly right so that's why the sell-off happens to begin with it's because it's no longer profitable you guys will just sell those gpus if you want to buy the crypto you can just buy it manually rather than doing it via mining so uh what we've got there is is mining is pretty much it's dead and to the people who are on like brian there's these massive farms they've got their solar batteries and solar stuff they've got to pay for those investments and they're going to pay them off with their mining so they're in a tough situation too where say for instance they might want to sell now and um and recoup some of their costs before it keeps going down and i warned about this in especially in december last year i was warning about it the signs were coming in where the you know they were saying oh the money printers are gonna keep going on forever that was an option right but we don't know that as an average individual we don't know if the money printers are gonna keep being turned up they're even going to exponentially get turned up or they're going to taper off or they're even going to go down you don't know that as an individual and i mean think about this right think about this as an individual um chats like uh people are just worried worrying thing is it if it's going to go back up we'll talk about that a little bit later is it going to uh recover is it going to go back up we'll talk we'll answer those in chat with crypto a little bit later but this is what we're warning about last year right we were looking at this point here where it was starting to come it was starting to plateau off and from here you had three different ways this could go two of those ways this is just basically the the um federal reserve cheat sheet this is what i call this one the cheat sheet this could go three different ways if it was going up exponentially that means heavy inflation if it's gonna even just plateau off at a straight line you're gonna have a recession you're going to have prices even go down because the amount of debt out there is deflationary but if it starts to go down you're going to see a huge crash a massive crash because essentially what the federal reserve's doing now is they're destroying money they're taking money out of existence and especially when we've got all the supply chains being artificially choked that's another problem too which is adding to the prices of essential goods so we've got a market here that just is not in favor of crypto it's not in favor of graphics card prices going up it's actually in favor of those things going down so that's your little cheat sheet right there you guys should save this into your browser this one right here this is what i call the one cheat sheet to look at because it's essentially what the big central bank is doing in terms of their outlook and so interest rates are going up as well i i think they're going to go up a lot faster than people expect right if we look at the trend in australia they were telling us oh interest rates won't go up until 2024 and it's now 2022 and they're already going up so by that trajectory i'm going to say they're going up a lot faster a lot quicker i'll put the link in after we finish the live stream i'll put this link in the description for you guys i call this the tech yes cheat sheet it's just the one thing you can look at and you can see uh basically a general indicator of which way things are going in terms of uh across the board prices in terms of just money supply right because what they're doing is they're destroying money they're reducing liquidity and so that's uh where these uh problems come from so what we've got now is the ethereum price right this thing has just plummeted in the last week the ethereum price has just fallen off a cliff and i i was warning in december i was telling my you guys will say i'm selling all my stuff i even recently sold my car a few weeks ago because i just feel like the the essential goods is going to be more demand and the prices of that stuff's already going up i think someone in australia was telling me they went out for a breakfast the other day and a milkshake was 14 it's like 14 for a milkshake man what is going on in some of these economies but this price of ethereum right now what you're seeing with crypto cars are crypt not cars cryptocurrencies what you're seeing here is essentially these things and this is what i want about this is why i quit crypto in 2018 i sold all my crypto i got into crypto um i sold it all in back then and i never really delved in crypto since and i'm glad i didn't because since then what i saw with crypto wasn't so much utility what i saw was speculation there was just mad amounts of speculation pump and dumps left right and center everywhere you look there was a pump and dump going on in crypto and so when these assets don't have raw utility when they're not focused on bringing about services and utility then of course they're inevitably going to crash off because they're not an asset that people need i haven't used any crypto in any real world transaction to this date and that speaks a great length about crypto and how actually so far it hasn't come rather as to how far it has come now another thing is is um we look at ethereum right i heard some news about ethereum the the the maker of it he was touting about how he can just destroy people's balances and that was very concerning because wasn't the whole point of crypto to be decentralized you can't do that yet you've got the owner of ethereum touting that they can destroy people's balances if they want to that's basically centralization that's no different to what we have now in the economy from governments and central banks how is crypto solving anything if they can do that so that's why ethereum's dropping i'm it's dropping off because the real world value there is is just it's not there really but uh the worst one is i mean we can look at the doggy coin right wasn't there the um there was the doggy coin that uh given me the pound maybe it's taken a pounding so the doggy coin is uh this is the one here five cents i remember there was the dogecoin millionaire he was like i'm holding this one guys it's going to ten bucks and uh doggy coins now just completely off the re off the map i think that guy is uh maybe losing money now on his doggy coins so he's uh he went all in and unfortunately he uh that was what you call a wealth transfer with the doggy coin so i mean i i tried to warn you guys about this last year i mean to the guys who listened i love you guys you know you made a smart decision i was telling some of my friends because this is why i don't hate crypto miners i don't hate people in the crypto space i just as a community i want people the average person to do better in life i want the average person working nine to five to have a better life because we are the people that make up an economy right not the big guys who just sit there on on twitter and through all their affiliate links and pump all these uh crap coins they're not the guys who who do the everyday working it's it's us guys so when i was like man get out of this stuff last year i was just being sincere i was trying to take care of the uh especially if you're a techie citizen i was trying to take care of you guys but um people people were calling me crazy they're like brian this is never going to happen doggy coins going to 10 bucks you're a fool bitcoin's going to a hundred thousand you're a full like i kept getting called a fool i don't know what i'm talking about but i was just at the end of the day i'm just trying to give people just a sincere opinion on hey like just make sure you're always going to be able to not be in a bad position so anyway that's the cryptocurrencies they've fallen off a cliff and the reason they're falling off a cliff is because the tightening conditions the worsening conditions in the economy uh you can see here the federal reserve is now reacting and they caused a lot of this speculative mania if we go back to here right if we go back to 2019 the economy was ready to fall off a cliff right then and so they pumped it up a little bit but even that wasn't enough they had to pump it up much more to keep the the bus from going but the problem is the wheels are just falling off the bus completely now and the boss is ready to slam crash straight into a wall so you've got the options there and this is what we're talking about in previous live streams you can go back to them where we talked about the liquidity trap and now it's happening right so things are getting illiquid and things are selling off this is just how it is so i hope you guys around the world wherever you are if you're in deep in crypto you at least took out some profits along the way and you've got at least maybe your original investment that you didn't lose out on sort of things so anyhow we got more news coming in from crypto and that was uh celsius pauses withdrawals due to extreme market conditions in other words the they're everyone's running for the exit doors uh and so everyone's running for the exit doors they can't cash out people's balances because perhaps they were leveraged and they don't have the liquidity so if you're with celsius you might have lost all your money binance had a problem where i guess people were running for the exit doors too quickly their system couldn't handle it so they paused withdrawals apparently it's back online now but these are the things that happen when a massive amount of money starts leaving and going into usd or other big currencies so um have you thought of checking out the 30 70 mobiles that they are selling on all express aliexpress gpus hopefully we're going to wait a couple of months gpu prices should come down aliexpress i love aliexpress i think the aliexpress meta is going to come back this year i'm super excited because it completely dropped off last year aliexpress was just you weren't getting any value buying anything from aliexpress but actually i'll be doing a video very soon there are some bargains that are coming up on aliexpress you'll definitely want to be um taking note because you can get better value than where you get it even in australia or the us so very good but one thing we so ask you if you've got questions about crypto ask them in now and um uh we had to go back to the start of the live stream where uh you know what is uh what is doggy coin so doggy coins i think dogecoin is the official name for it i just call it doggy coin because um just like a doggy it just you know it does it's simple things you know it eats food every day it does its thing so it's a doggy coin it's not too advanced it's not too sophisticated but in this case people thought it was very sophisticated so they unfortunately lost a lot i think a lot of people lost money on this stuff so that was the sad thing there but yeah we're gonna go over we're gonna go over to the gpu prices soon because they are coming down in mass and it's it's a fire sale it's ready it's waiting and you're already seeing it on ebay right now so uh we got a donation too thank you for the five dollars my man five dollars and thirteen cents very uh peculiar number there hope you and your family are well brian good to see you with your son again crypto crashing is good for us gamers at least yeah it's very good for the pc gaming market because you're taking speculation out of the pc market right when you speculate on assets it raises the price of those assets and if there's no substance behind that speculation then inevitably the prices will come back down and so you're seeing this with real estate as well yes there is definitely substance behind real estate real estate but there's way too much speculation and one good thing about me like i'm with my son now it's awesome i'm loving life in japan it's a breath of fresh air but also something else i wanted to talk about was it was a big breath of fresh air in terms of the fresh air in terms of uh just getting away from australian culture for a little bit i know this is gonna sound weird but everywhere i went in australia all you people were talking about was property property property property property property i go to my friend man i want to buy this investment house man i got to borrow up half a million dollars man have you seen the property prices out in this location everyone was just talking about probably i just got sick of it it's like guys you got a house to live as long as i got a good bed as long as i got electricity as long as i got my pc set up i'm all good it doesn't really matter too much i don't need a fancy um gold-laden pool to go swimming in you know and it's funny like we've had a pool like yeah at my other house we had a pool and i use it a few times a year so you know you can see that just the speculation in real estate was just insane speculation and everything really was just insane so it was uh good for me to come to japan and sort of get a take a step back and have a look at what's been going on so uh what's the time right now it is uh 10 54 a.m sorry that clock in the background i think i've got like an ikea clock every time i it's plugged up to one of my monitors so one of my monitors has a usbc power on it and uh that's powering the clock so sometimes i'll turn off the power and then the time will reset i couldn't be bothered resetting that ikea clock so i just it's just displaying a wrong time um so there we go guys the uh so anyway let's get back to it so uh two dollar donation thank you brother i keep up the awesome work thank you thank you guys for watching too and thank you for joining in chat so we'll go to free chat soon we'll go over to free chat answer all the questions very soon let's get over the last piece of news though because it does relate to the gpu prices right um it's mainly to do with nvidia versus amd i've been doing a bit of research on this and i swear like i swear to god the the difference between nvidia and amd is getting worse people are buying nvidia cards almost exclusively now uh to the point where you've you're seeing on say newegg you're seeing the prices of rx 6600s for ex for instance they're under msrp this is a great car too the rx 6600 is one of the best sort of segment segmented cards out of the new release cuts it's not gimped like the 6500 xt and it's just it's got 8 gigabytes of vram it's got great performance it's a cool running card it's very good in power efficiency and especially this sapphire pulse model this is a really good deal but you look at the rtx 3060s they're all over msrp and the reason they're over msrp is because people still want to buy nvidia over amd and i mean the performance should be pretty similar between these two cards but you got the nvidia tax just coming in because there's that raw de demand from the market now what's even more scarier is when i go to japan the good thing about these japanese sites here is that you can actually um is sort of you can interpret different data from what they're showing so i can get some results here that show me what the top selling cards are and then i can say okay what's the top selling cards in japan in that ratio of nvidia versus amd and so what we're seeing here is the top selling card in japan right now is a 1660 super so that's a card that's yeah three years old almost and has a top selling card but it's 300 well in usd terms would be about 230 dollars i think so 230 1660 super people as we're talking about in the past with that price uh limit right people are only prepared to pay a certain amount doesn't matter what it is they're only prepared to pay a certain amount of their discretionary on particular things so that's why the 1660 super is selling so well in japan because it's priced at a level that people can afford then next up we've got 30 60 but if we keep going down the list we're going to see here top 10 graphics cards sold there's not one amd graphics card uh we keep going down top 20 graphics cards there is not one amd graphics card in the top 20. then we go down we're still going down not an md card in sight here we go i think it's yeah number 27 number 27 on this list so the top in the top 30 gravis cards amd has one gravis card in japan that's in the top 30. the rest is in video and that's an rx 6400 for 200 150 bucks 140 dollars and it's a card too so that's kind of really sad for amd that's some sad news to show that even and this is basically this website is called kakaku.com it's price.com in other words you're looking for the best price in japan kind of like static ice in australia in america be pc uh part picker i think pc part picker shows you all the different retailers so you're looking for the cheapest price to begin with but people place that value already over amd so nvidia is just carrying so much more perceived value from the market even though my top pick right now based on current uh prices versus performance i'd be going for an rx 6600 but the market just sees the favor for nvidia is just so much stronger and so if you're looking for an nvidia card you're gonna have to wait a few months i think before those prices really start hammering down from the used market selling off with the crypto cards and um and also prices just price pressure in general coming down from uh liquidity drying up so here it is right here there's these things i'm looking at these things i'm like wow that's that's nuts but even if we go to the steam surveys which just shows you what people are using in their computers to gain what people have in their computers to gain uh uh also oh thanks for the donation as well we've got a five dollar donut sub tech yes brother uh how long are you staying at japan it was still close i'm staying at japan uh here it was still close happy to see you with your son finally why do people choose nvidia vs amd okay we'll go that question relates to what we're looking at now um so japan is just absolutely amazing we'll talk about that you guys probably have some questions about japan how long am i staying here i i just don't know at the moment it's for another four months it's for another four months i just i really don't know uh i i do want to stay here longer it's a it's a real breath of fresh air because it's not just like getting away from everyone talking about property prices in australia it's also getting away from just every time i go on the news in australia it's just like it's constant just hammering you with all this negative stuff you turn on the tv in japan and they just got game shows on they just got people having fun they just got people enjoying their lives and that's kind of like for me it's awesome because i just want to get back to that energy get back to focusing on just having fun because i guess that's all we can do as individuals is try and stay positive and move forward and uh try and ignore all the negative news and so japan's got that that culture still and i'm absolutely loving it i i don't like i haven't thought about covert in in months and in fact the the scary thing is about that is uh i might my boy and my ex they they got a cold recently like they got pretty sick with a cold and i didn't get sick at all like not like nothing at all now i had covered a few months ago so i mean i'm not going to really speculate here on the stream i'm not going to say anything but maybe that might be an indication of hey that uh that immunity is working pretty well for other things outside of coven so uh that was something that sort of shocked me a little bit personally but yeah we're not talking about that stuff though in japan it's not really any any sort of it's not big news but it's good not to hear about that stuff and not turn on the tv every day and um just whatever so it's just been a good break uh been drinking green tea as well the green tea here is amazing if you ever come to japan you gotta drink the the matcha you gotta get the raw green tea actually speaking of matcha i think i had a cup on hand just wait i gotta go get my matcha just wait yeah so i've actually got i get a big cup so i brew myself up a big cup of matcha every morning as well as a decaf coffee so we did the video on the two dollar decaf machine that's making me some real good value coffee but i drink the low caffeinated uh green tea it's the matcha so and um and so what we've got here is uh what gpu do you recommend at the moment i would recommend the 6600 off of ebay i mean take a look at these prices 235 bucks buy it now that's well under msrp solid card this guy's just cutting his losses right now because he probably thinks well gpu price is going to go down even more so you're seeing it right now the price is 250 bucks these are coming down the rx 6600s are coming down they're a great buy especially if you've been waiting out for a long time to build a good value pc go get that and i'll show you another thing just hang on a second i'll show you what else we've got here very special cpu we're going to do a video on it very soon i just check out if it's in the studio here i swear so we got this one right here this is the r the ryzen 5 5500 this right now is easily for me it's i've got to test it out still but it's looking like you grab a ryzen 5 500 and an rx 6600 that's such good value like you are you have a pc a gaming pc that's gonna come in with such good value um so and the good thing about this is you don't have to worry about prices in your country so i'm seeing in chat like price i wish prices like this in my country this thing can be had on aliexpress for 110 bucks six cores 12 threads zen three uh even though the level three cache is not as big as the uh ryzen 5 5600 or 5600 x it's 110 bucks such a good deal this here is the deal of the new meta that's the new meta that is going to put some pressure and plus you can couple it with a b450 so very good very good rx 6600 ryzen 5 500 i'll be doing some content on this coming soon for you guys that is just a price performance king right now and um here we have uh so we'll finish off with this data though you know i'm from australia so it's the data you know some guys in some guys in the chat they're like data say it for me one more time it's the data not the data it's the data and that's what it is in australia so uh two dollar donation from shampoo time thank you my man i got some gpus when you got when you get back only to sell to you okay so he must have been crypto mining buy my crypto gpus brian so yeah i mean hey i'll check them out we'll we'll check out the overclocking on those gpus we'll lock in msi afterburner see how much headroom they've got change the thermal paste another five dollar donation thank you guys dude thanks so much for the donations you guys don't have to i mean especially when liquidity is getting tight i want you guys to keep your money and get a bargain with what's coming up hey brian i just got a 3080 ti for 950 used i bet we might see them as low as 800 a few weeks before the rx the 4000 series launched yeah so next live stream we will do we will dedicate the next live stream to talking about the new rumors with the uh 4000 series cards the rtx 4000 series cards and um should upgrade my 2080 ti not at the moment man wait wait until september september i think you're gonna have some great pickings and that'll be that'll be like fantastic time to pick out some bargains um so i'd keep the 2080 ti so very very good uh time very good card and um have you done a review for the 6600 xt yeah i have yeah just type in take a city rx 6600 xt was actually uh i enjoyed that review like uh yusuf he edited that video and i just thought that video came out awesome but in terms of getting a 3080 ti if you've been holding out for a long time 3080 ti for 950 usd it's it's decent i think prices will come down more and so you will be able to get a 3080 ti for maybe 800 bucks maybe even 700 just because things are tightening that much right there's the speculation bubble is finished it's coming down and on the way down it's going to start letting the air out and so the um all those people who say for instance if you looked at this terra luna i heard i heard something about tara luna uh some cryptocurrency completely collapsed and i was like well of course it collapsed it it's a it had no utility it was just a scam brought out to take people's money and there was one youtuber i think his name was ksi and he posted up on twitter i saw this tweet and i was like i lost 2.8 million dollars and i'm thinking to myself man like as brilliant as this guy is in terms of setting himself up on youtube and being such a successful person in life man he's got to be a fool when it comes to handing over some dude on the internet on an unregulated uh system 2.8 million dollars he doesn't even know this guy on the internet and he's handing the developer of luna 2.8 million dollars i mean it doesn't get any more like stupider than that in my opinion so like kind of like you've got to sit back and say i've earned this money i've put in this much time and effort into earning this money what am i going to do with it and for me i i like i was pretty much just stay i was chilling out through all this speculation i was just laying low you know i bought a bit of silver that's about all i did that's insurance like when you look at precious metals they're insurance don't think about them as speculating their insurance they retain buying power but that's about all i did i was buying a bit of silver a little bit of platinum too that was like walls i was doing because that was insurance against uh crazy money printing and again back to that uh back to that graph we'll go back to that graph of the fed cheat sheet this could at the time right when i bought at the time you didn't know if this was going to go up this way right no one knows that right except those people inside government the real insiders or the people inside the central banks um and we got 10 donation from lyle thanks brother thanks for the 10 dono uh so in terms of stocks i stayed well away from stocks i thought it was the biggest sucker rally in history that was my opinion on the stock market since 2020 march uh i did uh play some meme stocks amc i i did make some money on amc and that's because there was a trend that was just screaming out to me when gamestop took off that was about all i did in terms of investing and other than that i just stayed low i laid low i did my thing did what i was i i thought i was pretty good at and that's uh you know building pcs and flipping pcs so one thing that i'm well versed in so now in terms of me losing money i haven't lost any money so there's no money lost on my investments and that's a good thing going into this year i'm looking at all the losses that are happening right now and um yeah it's sad to see that but there's no qualms here tech yes is really fine so you know win big lose big that's the age old saying uh for me it was i didn't i didn't win big at all i didn't lose big at all so let's get back to these steam surveys though because uh we have a lot to discuss i got a five dollar donate as well i managed to get a 20 80 for 400 off ebay during the 2020 sell-off after 3 000 series announced well 4 000 series announcement caused a similar sell-off uh what's going to happen with the sell-off is uh 4000 series itself if it does provide as big as a leap as the 3000 series did you'll have a sell-off in itself but because of what's going on in the broader economy and markets and crypto especially in the profitability being pretty much zero now you're gonna see a sell-off before the rx uh sorry before the rx 7000 series cards before the rtx 4000 series cards you're going to see a sell-off before that and so expect to get a cheap card later on uh getting a 2080 back in 2020 that was a bargain that was a great choice uh that card's still just an awesome card for gaming in general and i mean when we look at rtx right the only game that i really enjoyed rtx on was cyberpunk uh it had the reflect the reflections looked so good especially when you're out in the main world and it was raining it looked really good so but besides that i really didn't have much of a desire to turn on rtx actually though my boy's been playing on my main computer he's been playing minecraft he's loving rtx in minecraft so in terms of rtx though it's not a massive i have to have this but dlss 2.0 can definitely help with the fps in terms of that series but you still get that on the rtx 2000 series cards so they're a great buy in uh even now rtx 2000 is still a great buy especially if you get one for a really good price um plus a lot of people didn't buy them up for uh crypto but if we look at the steam surveys let's go back to these steam surveys because this is even like i remember nvidia cards just being right up here on the charts like nvidia cards were just hammering i mean sorry amd cards were like some of them were right up in the charts but now if we look um now if we look at what's going on here it it's just it's crazy like it's crazy right here you've got the top i think number 18 is the rx 580 that's amd's first entry into the video cards steam survey all the rest of this is nvidia cards like in the rx 6600 is just nowhere to be seen so like radeon what's going on with radio i'm guessing radeon graphics might be apus i'm not too sure with that one i don't know what that one is but we just see here like it's actually saddening to see that nvidia is grabbing even more market share with the already huge amounts of market share that they have uh so we got this donation from i am blaze 20 thank you brother uh brian who's babysitting the oz studio while you're away how's dead man here have a milkshake on me i look a japanese milkshake dude will be like i think it's about four dollars here at usd it'd be like three dollars so i think that was a usd donation i can get about five milkshakes six milk shakes uh with that twenty dollars thank you brother i get a strawberry milkshake that's that's my favorite milkshake i also like banana and caramel that one's good too uh in terms of who's uh babysitting dadman is babysitting the oz studio um yeah i uh we got the studio here i don't know which one do you like better do you like the japanese studio better or do you like the australian studio better do let us know in the comments below i'm going to probably say japan studio because we got this new audio kraken we've got the audio technica at2035 i'm back on the mic that i was using years and years ago but i had to return that to my work but then i found it on a deal for usd wise this would be about 35 us dollars and it came with a three meter xlr cable now that's pretty important um because xlr cables are going up in price so everything you're looking at just going up in price because the commodities and the inflation involved in the transit is going up too so we're going to do an audio video though that's going to be really cool because you get so much value if you are smart shopping with audio audio technica i've actually in the last few months i've learned to love audio technica so much more than i previously had because in the past i tried the ath mx headphones i tried their atx mx50 headphones and i thought after that i didn't like that sound profile from those headphones i thought it was like a a stabbing treble like this the treble was very stabby and it was kind of like i didn't enjoy that headphone but then this mic i tried this mic and recently i don't know if you guys know about these but the these are the i think they're called like ath ad500x and i got these for around 50 here on amazon on a time sale and i crap you not these are like the best headphones i've tried against even more expensive headphones they're a nice warm sounding headphone they sound so good if you're gaming you're going to be able to hear exactly where people are they're easy to power they'll run off onboard audio most onboard audio i've even tested some of those h81s while i was benchmarking with these they're just such a good headphone i cannot recommend these enough plus they're like plus they're like uh just they so comfortable you won't even notice they're on your head so i've just become lately i've become a bit of an audio technica fanboy um so yeah that's a audio technica fanboy right here confirmed because i just i realized they got so many good products especially for the price um anyway in terms of cards under 100 usd you'll definitely see like i think you'll see some nine series cards a lot of nine series cards perhaps even 1050 ti's and uh 1050 they'll come in around 100 price point so you will see a lot like the market's going to heal the pc gaming will heal and in a nutshell that's mainly because you're taking away all the speculation so that's a really good thing for pc gaming going forward it's going to bring black the bring back the glory days of pc gaming we can get back into it we can just ignore crypto once again and we can get back to those fun times um so if you have you experienced some jbl products too so jbl products i haven't tried too many back in the day i remember i tried some jbl car speakers they were pretty nice they had a nice uh flat warm signature too so we got a donation of three bucks trying to sell my rx 580 what is your average used price oh man like for me i at this point in time i'm stepping back from an rx 580 mainly because i've got to reassess what's going on with rx 580s in general because you've got to remember there was a lot of rx 580s and 570s 400 series cards too they were mined in the first crypto run and now this second run i'm sure there was a lot of rx 580s that were mined again on this second crypto run so you're gonna have to be very careful like from a from a buyer's point of view i'm gonna have to be extremely careful on what i buy in terms of rx 580s and 570s just because a lot of those cards i'm going to assume have been run through a second round of crypto mining and so that means i've got the potential to get hosed a lot more than i otherwise would have but i'd be looking in terms of rx 580 what i'd pay i would be paying max 100 for that card easy like max when we look at an rx 6600 on ebay let's go back to that let's look at that it's 235 bucks i mean if you've got your rx 580 right now just sell it and then go buy this rx 6600 because this hasn't been my if it's been mined on hasn't been mined on that much at all still got great amount of life left in it and it's 235 bucks you can have much better performance than an rx 580 and you can have a much more power efficient card and that yeah it's just a great decision because i think there's going to be a heap of rx 580s coming on the market so get where you can for it now and then buy a better card right now or even wait with that money so uh one thing is i'm pretty sure the other day you know the other day i was just thinking back to when i made that video about we got asked about i don't know if you guys remember but we're on that stream a long time ago uh manny was asking me you know should i sell my vega i think it was a vega 56 and he's like you know i was just like look sell that gravis card hold on to your cash now he would have been holding on for a long time but now look at what he can buy so if he held on to that coin he's got a great buying opportunity right now so at the time might have seemed a bit crazy you might have been like well brian you know these things were only you know stonks only go up but now you're starting to see that the uh road to stability is a very difficult one right now because you have to have price stability let's keep this in let's keep this in check you have to have price stability and the reason being is because you have to have forward guidance so if prices are unstable businesses might not want to conduct business because they might not know what the prices are going forward and that goes both deflationary and inflationary and so if you're making a contract for 10 months time and the prices all the materials go up you're going to go bankrupt and that's exactly what's happening with a lot of these builders and they're going bankrupt in australia i mean maybe in the u.s there's construction companies going under in china there's construction companies going under when inflation really happens and it hits hard it creates a lot of instability in the markets and so of course with that you lose jobs discretionary income discretionary spending starts falling and so uh do you think it will get back to normal again uh define normal because uh what has been normal in the last few years so for me we're not like i i i didn't think that when i went back to australia at the end of 2019 i did not think in any way shape or form that i wouldn't be able to see my son for three years like that right there was just a wake-up call for me man like i i really did i struggled behind the scenes i i struggled a bit man it was harsh you know not knowing if things were ever gonna get better but in terms of are things going to get normal like 2019 normal again i mean what you can do in your life right now the only thing you can really do in your life from a personal standpoint is say look am i surrounded by people that i love i got my family and friends family being the most important and is my outlook okay like am i going to be able to survive you know do i have my my computer like if you're a gamer have you got gaming have you got some savings saved up because power's going up all the essentials are going up government regulations government choking off supply so you got to ask yourself okay what is normal for you for me now normal is just being with my son and you know even even my ex we're we're getting along pretty well so for me normal is already here for me i'm i'm completely normal so i'm not worried for a micro second anymore i just don't want to think about what can happen in the future i for me i'm i'm right here in normal and so a lot of my viewers know exactly where i'm coming from as long as you got that warmth around you surround yourself with warmth and you'll be you'll be okay uh so um maybe i've said this in the past too imagine um imagine being in a world with no people in it how lonely would it be right and if we're live streaming here we're all joining in on chat we're all communicating it's just such a good thing to have other people in the world so surround yourself with people that you get along with and that's going to be your normal so anyhow marco the gputuber do we replace the 225 pc for your x yeah um uh i guess a lot of people wanted to see uh the x me build a pc for it for the x so we wise we'll build her another gaming pc if she's she's she's definitely earned uh she's earned some very good points in my book so she deserves a good gaming pc so i think i think yeah we might build the x another pc so you know she's definitely been helpful man she's been great so she has been good and uh it was a contrast in hindsight you know a lot of things that i i thought in the past time proved them wrong so yeah 400 x build challenge so you want me to actually okay you want me to me and the x to actually build a pc a build off challenge i could probably do that for you guys definitely could probably do that for you guys uh but yeah we'll move over to just dedicated chat now we'll close off this stream but in terms of like in terms of the content and uh but basically going forward what you need to know is that okay things are tightening right now that line so we'll just cap off this stream in terms of the actual content in terms of what you need to go take away from this live stream before we get on out of here is and go to chat we're going to dedicate a chat we're going to talk with you guys it's been such a long time but what we're going to see here is we predicted this a few months ago like not predicted we talked about this a few months ago where this was crucial which way this was going it's looking like it's going down that right there is signaling that it's going to go down and if this line starts going down money's getting destroyed in other words cash is going to be more scarce because there's going to be a snowball effect not just from this here not from just the fed destroying money directly but there's also going to be all these companies going bankrupt and that's going to create a snowballing effect so the potential here i'm just saying the potential here for what for the future in terms of financial financials is not looking good that's all i'm going to say it's not looking good at all especially if you're used to investing in things and getting a lot of money out of your investments i think those days are numbered at least for a few years so the main thing is if you're in crypto and this is why crypto is crashing it's a speculative asset mainly the most all that money coming in was speculation it didn't really produce much substance i mean if you consider 50 f fees plus waiting ample amount of time and board ape i think it's board ape nfts if you if you think that's productivity in an economy i think you've got your definition of productivity wrong so that's all really that's all that came out of cryptocurrency in the last few years was nfts board 8 pictures i think they even had mutant apes as well you had these eight pictures coming out you had 50 fees that that to me is not innovation that to me is just garbage anyway that's a speculative asset and that's what a lot of people were in now they're the first those useless assets they're the first to get sold off when things start tightening up people have debt to pay off they have bills to pay they have maybe they're going to save more than they usually saved because the out looks bad so it's this snowball effect that comes with this this has the potential to get a lot and i mean a lot worse that's just the outlook right there that's the cheat sheet right this is the cheat sheet i'm gonna put this in the you can just save this one in your browser just watch which way this goes this is the overall cheat sheet for you guys and i'll take care of you i think i my friends know i've been telling my friends this in person this is your cheat sheet i just care about you guys as much as i care about people i meet every day in real life so this is the cheat sheet go buy this one save that in your browser total assets the federal reserve are they destroying money are they creating money now we had this that was all inflationary right but now we're coming and this is the funny thing we're only just here we're only just here and look how bad things have already gotten we are only just here at the plateauing stage and look how bad things have already gotten too so that one's a very big concern for me but then we go to gpu prices we'll cap this off with gpu prices sell-offs already beginning you can get cards very cheap right now if you've been holding out for a long time could this go cheaper definitely easily but is it a good price right now yes that's an extremely good price for an rx 6600 so that's what i i like these prices in the gpu market nvidia is currently over msrp because going back to these steam charts going back to the numbers here in japan and from what i see with the sales data people want nvidia cards a lot more than amd and so we got asked earlier in the stream which we'll answer why do you think people go for nvidia cards so now we'll go over to free chat with you guys what do you think why do you think why do you think people are buying nvidia cards over amd cards and it has to do the first like this spans back if you're a pc gamer an og pc gamer this goes all the way back to world of warcraft this is when the differences between amd and nvidia really started to come out and it came out here because back in the day we didn't have the technology to test the stuttering but a lot of people said in world of warcraft blind nvidia gravis card this was back with wow classic and uh burning crusade world of warcraft um back in those days everyone was like dude get an nvidia graphs card because amd stutters amd's not smooth it just feels more smoother on nvidia cards i didn't believe it at first but then i was playing with my friend side by side and we saw this we're like yeah the nvidia card is smoother and so that had a big effect going forward for nvidia people wanted to buy nvidia cards they didn't trust they felt like they were lied to by amd they felt like that trust on amd graphics cards ati as well that trust was broken and since then people just exclusively buy nvidia graphs cards they're not changing they don't want to change and they don't that that's what i mean once you burn that bridge you know you can build up a whole company in 10 years but it only takes a one day to destroy your reputation that's why you've got to constantly do the right thing in terms of what you're delivering um so that spans from the uh that spans from the world of warcraft days the nvidia bias why people are buying nvidia cards now of course since then nvidia has i i in my opinion right they have had better drivers too i'm telling you right now i've tried like i'm doing a challenge against gear seekers this uh 1500 aussie dollar budget build but the the problem like you look at msi afterburner if you have that and you overclock with afterburner you've got problems with the amd adrenaline software conflicting with afterburner the fan speeds there's still a bit of a mess in amd's software amd's drivers aren't as good as nvidia's drivers and i've this is from a guy who's used both in main rigs and tried both nvidia does have better drivers that's just that's my opinion if you want to and that's based on experience now is amd a good card for gaming yes if you just want to play games especially on a single monitor amd's come a long way they've got very smooth fps right now and they've got a very good card especially in terms of price performance but if you're doing something outside of that say for instance you're streaming you've got the nvidia codec i like the nvidia codec for streaming better than the amd i like multi monitor support right now i'm running four monitors off my mini itx pc that's through thunderbolt i'm running two of them through thunderbolt and then the other two from the nvidia 3080 they got on my system that's the nothing's there's not one hiccup on this system nothing is out of whack everything's just working as it should be absolutely amazing experience so that's when you get that experience and then like for instance i've tried when the um i haven't tried amd recently in terms of multi monitors but when i was using multi monitor setups i was having a lot of problems with amd and so there's that there's that difference right there and people talk about that you know word of mouth is the most strongest word of advertising or method of advertising and so when that goes around it starts going out in in a way that really is a detriment to amd's gpu sales but if we look at amd's cpus they're growing month by night their cpus are really good their cpus are doing a phenomenal job in delivering good price performance and that's just like so people aren't stupid at the end of the day people say oh people are stupid when it comes to a dollar when it comes to spending your money in general people aren't that stupid so what the premium you're seeing with nvidia versus amd right now that premium that you're seeing is based on the fact that people want to pay more money for nvidia they perceive it even with the same fps numbers they perceive in video as better value so it comes from a lot of different things but it did just make no mistake about it make no mistake about it it spans from the world of warcraft days that's when if you look at the charts on when nvidia and amd really started separating and sales it spans from the world of warcraft days and since then it hasn't come back so really what amd needs to do is they need to i'd like to see the adrenaline software work a little bit better um i'd like to see things in that sense work a little bit better i'd like to see their multi-monitor sport work a bit better they don't have to copy and this is the thing like what i don't get about amd is they keep trying to copy and video in terms of bringing in fsr and fsr 2.0 and make something new amd make something new that amd that sorry that nvidia isn't doing make something new amd it doesn't matter what it is give us something new innovative make something different to what nvidia is doing stop trying to be like nvidia and make something new that's what i'd love to see amd do in the gpu space so they it seems like they constantly just they constantly want to be like nvidia and nvidia you know no one's better at being jensen than jensen so in terms of intel um in terms of intel with the gpus that's going to be interesting i think they've got a i think intel hit a brick wall with drivers i think they thought it was going to be easy but like i said to people in the past just by using their intel extreme utility that tuning utility that was total garbage and i'm like well if that's the experience that they're giving people on the cpu side in terms of software man they got a big hill to climb intel's got a huge hill to climb in terms of drivers so nvidia currently as much as people give nvidia crap as much as people crap on in video they do have a polished product that's all i'm gonna say as much as like i don't really like rtx and the rtx tax and all that um i think nvidia have a good product like the end of the day and so yeah that's where you're seeing that difference i guess a lot of i guess when it comes to buying a lot of people might agree with me there so oh all right oh we got a welcome new tyc supporter thank you very much during the live stream brother thank you so much for joining in um actually yeah so uh we will wind this down i do have to at any given time i might have to close off the stream i do apologize i might have to close off the stream because i gotta go pick up my ex uh she's getting her teeth done like she's got she had to get a tooth tooth pulled out because it was this is just like his dental problems so i've got to be there to sort of i've got to be i got to play support today i got to take a break from being carrie and i got to play a support hey brian uh can you help us with pricing on new stuff yeah definitely uh go ahead and ask some questions in chat in terms and thank you for the continued support for being a member thank you so much i really appreciate it uh if you guys you know i'm just aiming to go forward with take a city i'm going to make content that just is different as well uh dota rolls yeah i'd like in terms of like in terms of you know yeah like more more will be revealed more will be revealed with you know more will be with real with the x more will be revealed in time uh but put it this way sounds like not x for too much longer yeah like more will be revealed in the future i mean at this point in time we sort of covered was really a wake up for both of us uh it was a real big sort of you know i think we were both too selfish before that uh it makes you take a step back and realize hey you know what do you need in life do you need a fancy yacht or do you just need to have a comfortable life so does the ex have any cute single friends marco if you shave off that beard then maybe she might so currently marco's got like this uh like jungle he's like literally got a jungle swimming around on his face i told him to shave it off or at least clean it up you gotta trim that stuff man because women like clean cut when it comes to a gentleman as much as you see it on netflix you see all these you know rugged jungle guys running around you see these rugged jungle dudes running around and they're getting all the women on netflix when it comes to real life bro clean cut is always going to be the way you go you always you always got to stay clean cut that's just the way it is don't even try to differ from the norm you know i'm going to try and be different bro i'm going to go grow my hair down to my shoulders you know go with the whole like jungle beard women are going to love it yeah like let's see how that works out in the real world for you [Laughter] they call me the yes man for a reason yeah so i oh man i guess like inevitably look when it comes to a tech yes live stream we always devolve to just talking about this stuff so let's uh let's continue on i mean we're having fun let's just keep going let's just keep going with it hey uh my girlfriend won't let me shave off my mustache wow man okay that's interesting you gotta is it a clean-cut mustache like you gotta i mean as long as the clean cut does it look like the um the old school 1960s mo the sheriff mo uh what what oh the western mo rage against inflation yeah so i'm running away like in japan i'm literally running away from inflation here guys um and i think i think that's going to be the new life metal in like 2023 is like hey get me out of these western countries where they're just where all the private borrowing is creating inflation and get me to the countries where people haven't created all this inflation with borrowed money because this is when we go back to a bit of finance right when we go back to the inflation who causes the inflation well it's not actually the central banks the central banks are holding the toy bazooka it's just if people think that toy bazooka is real they're gonna go out and borrow as much as they can they're gonna go out and uh borrow the government's gonna be like yeah we gotta we gotta stimulate the economy borrow new money create new money which is pretty much goes back and this is the scary thing about finance right when people tell you don't listen to this guy he's not an economist or don't listen to this guy look how many of these economists were wrong in the last couple of years crazy crazy look how many of these economists were wrong and i'm just a guy who's been studying especially since the end of 2021 i've been refreshing my brain with this modern money system and i've been sharing a lot of my thoughts with you guys and what's uh oh that that clock's way off bro don't look at that clock it's it's just completely wrong time it's completely that that that time is just wrong um the economists right here's the thing about the system right the i don't we don't know exactly how this system works our monetary system we do not even know how it exactly works there is still money creation theory fractional reserve theory all these other theories i believe money creation theory is the main that's the right one i think every time someone borrows money it puts a ledger that's opened on the bank and so you owe the money but you've created this money out of thin air that's inflationary and that's what we had in australia especially people were borrowing money that they shouldn't have been able to borrow because they will never pay it back they were creating inflation in japan people don't do that like speculation here is completely different in japan than it is in australia and the us and the uk so isn't it a wonder why japan doesn't have much inflation at all that should be proof for me that's proof that money creation theory is the right one now even when we go into quantitative easing now this is the scary thing about quantitative easing they've got theories for quantitative easing they've got reserve gate theory asset swap theory in other words the average person and even the economists don't even like we don't even know exactly how this money system operates that's a scary thing right so how can you give a 100 percent uh cost like correct opinion on something when you don't even know how the system works exactly and that's a scary thing so when it comes to it now all i do is like i correlate with um all i do is i i correlate what i see in the past now and try to add things up in my head now japan yeah people talk about japan japan's got massive debt debts deflationary right so how they're going to get out of this mess everything comes crashing down yen's going to soar i think the yen's going to be from here on it's going to be a very good performing currency that's my personal belief just by what i've studied hey look i'm going to put this out openly if i'm right about the japanese yen you guys get a finance channel okay i'll make a finance channel and if i'm wrong then there we won't get any finance channel i'll just stick to stick to making a banger used videos and going out parts hunting in japan but if what i think is right about the japanese yen and i think it's gonna soar uh right now they're just deterring you off japan oh japan's gonna have massive inflation this and that so many people borrowed money from japan internationally so many people borrowed money from japan international entities that money has to come back right it can come back with margin calls or it can come back by paying it back and what do you think is going to happen in the next year it's going to be a lot it's going to be a lot of margin calls you know back in 2008 i never really talked about this before back in 2008 i remember i used to watch the aussie dollar versus the japanese yen and in one day in one second literally in one second one second i saw i saw the japanese yen appreciate against the australian dollar by 150 pips that's so you were going from 70 i think it was 76 and a half yen it went down to 75 in one second i saw that i know that that that real that's what can happen in the markets so yes the yen's weak right now yes it's been speculated against yes there's people borrowing up heavy and speculating against the yen but when that starts turning around just like everything else is turning around right now i think the yen's gonna soar so i've been buying up all my savings are in yen now i've transferred it all across to yen now the us is gonna the uh u.s dollar is going to appreciate as well because the u.s dollar had really low interest rates people were borrowing u.s dollars and buying all these crappy currencies like the turkish lira getting doing what's called the carry trade they were buying um whoever had mexican peso they were buying mexican peso anything they were doing what's called the carry trade a lot of big entities they'll be buying assets in cheaper countries and trying to make returns on that but that has to that debt has to be paid back so japanese yen i like i said i'm bullish on it right now you probably don't hear that from many people you probably hear that from no one everyone's talking crap about the yen right now but um i see the the japanese yen actually going up just based on how i think the system works right now and that is japan hasn't as a nation borrowed anywhere near as much the private consumer as much as other current countries have borrowed but also they've got a massive amount of government debt that's owned by the japanese themselves and a lot of international entities borrowed from japan and that money will have to come back so there it is that's the outlook on the yen so maybe it makes sense maybe it doesn't but we'll see a few months time we'll come back on the live stream and we'll talk about the japanese yen in particular if i'm right i'll make a finance channel from it for you guys guide you through the terrible times to come in terms of the car scene in japan it's poppa loppin um i love the uh there's a call there's a car called the toyota rays toyota raizu they call it the raizu i think it's the lazu and that if you mod the toyota rays it looks so cool like i'm gonna get i'm thinking about getting a toyota rays and putting some black mags on it and getting a body kit on it and that like you can go check it out on google i mean we can check it out right now what a modded toyota rays looks like i gotta find a good one though before i show you guys um and yeah i mean like in terms of weeaboos someone's saying in chat what about weeaboos in terms of discord as well i did see a message about discord i'll try and get like i've i've just been like at the moment guys sorry about discord sorry about social media twitter and and instagram and facebook at the moment i'm just doing youtube videos and spending time with my family that's just it like you know i've been it's been a crazy time so i'll ramp up the discord again i'll i'll fix it i'll fix the social media presence even though i'm just going to be probably crap posting on social media just to have a laugh did you visit bangkok for used parts yeah i mean i did visit bangkok in 2000 night when did i last visit bangkok i didn't i think i did bangkok and vietnam uh those two have been done definitely enjoyed them both vietnam i liked vietnam better than thailand in terms of used parts hunting but that was probably because it was like that was when the crypto crash the last time happened and things were so cheap so love this love the live stream best oh thanks man thanks brother thank you guys so much man it's like that's what i thought i was live live stream for you guys it's been a long time and we just chat just hang out just uh hopefully put a smile on your face but we'll lace it with some realities you know the harsh realities that are you're not a weeb unless you get an anna man i had a brain fog i was going to show you guys something before yeah the toyota race that's right we'll show you the toyota rays and then we'll get back to talking about weeaboos because that seems to be the hottest topic on chat also i've got to be prepared gotta be prepared toyota ray it's hard to rise it there it is the rise of z toyota a z they got it right here i'll change it over to you guys but we're going to find out like someone's got to have a custom like here we go look at this baller right here look at this baller this is the car like i've been i've dude i've seen this thing and it looks so good this car like on the pictures it looks good in the flesh it looks good this is the toyota razor the riser z it's got to be the z this is the car i've been eyeing off how cool does it look if you guys are car lovers

absolutely loaded dog uh now my pricing so we've got a donation here of 15 uh rosin guns from uh from mud now my pricing on new stuff ebay prices less 15 percent uh add as little as 40 uad ah so that's the yeah i forgot the currency name again it's the united is it united arab dimer diner for myself still stuff not moving yeah so the market like like this is why i said back in december i said back in december like i said this on the vlog in the btc right behind the scenes uh not b bitcoin not bitcoin bts um i said behind the scenes that just sell all your stuff man get rid of it all right like in australia i literally sold every last pc um used used piece of hardware i had i was literally sitting i even got other hustlers that i knew locally to sell stuff for me that was back in december and in hindsight i think i made the right choice um because yeah this is like when back in 2020 right when things were so hot when people were just buying pcs and overpaying for them i knew back then there's a balance to everything right there's always a balance to everything and right now we're going into that we're heading into the bottom and so pc sales in itself are going to be a lot slower than they otherwise would this is what happens when the belt tightens up we haven't like as pc hustlers we haven't been through a period of time proper tightening right last time they did a little bit of tightening they raised interest rates and the whole thing started to collapse but they should have let it collapse they should have let it collapse in 2008 if they let it collapse in 2008 we'd be in a much different situation right now we'd be back to sound money we'd be back to more steady pc sales so what you had was a boom in 2020 2021 now you're coming off that boom and you're going into a low season and it's not going to be like you can have the fanciest pc possible if someone doesn't have money to buy it as we saw with the japanese data before right the top selling card in japan's a 1660 super let that sink in people are running dry uh we've got a oh welcome to tyc supporter thanks rhinos thanks brother yeah thanks man um we gotta we got that vlog behind the scenes man just selling all your hardware like back in around december i made it i was like look i'm getting rid of my stuff i'm getting rid of all my stuff you guys should sell your stuff to and because i thought this was a scenario that could play out the tightening starts happening the tightening starts happening and um basically from there money gets tight people can't buy as many gaming pcs but another thing as well was that with the hyper inflationary right the hyper inflation that people are saying america is going to go into hyperinflation do you really think do you really think the people who borrow this money out do you really think the big the big wigs do you think they're going to let someone off the hook with a massive house mortgage because that's what if we go into hyper inflation people get let off on their mortgages perhaps maybe they reconvert the mortgages it depends but there's going to be a lot of the average person winning in a hyper inflation environment especially but if we look at australia household debt to gdp it's huge they're not going to let all those people keep those homes they want to let the whole thing crash and then those people can lose all their deposits this is how this is how the real world works unfortunately it's um this is how the real world works they they always want the average person and i hate seeing it these these big banksters they always want the average person to lose because when the average person loses they win and it happens on an aggregate sale aggregate scale and that's what's sad about the system and that's why i thought it was more likely going to be we were going to plateau off and then go down and that's what's happening now so businesses are going to go under wrap so yeah then they're just yeah the investment businesses scoop them all up exactly that's it's it's kind of like yeah please ban blockchain as well i mean blockchain if it can be utilized properly has its merits and i've said this before about crypto it has its merits the problem is it became a speculative casino and there was like your top dog ethereum was total use it was used it was crap 50 transaction fees uh nfts let's have a look at some of the other like what wasn't wasn't someone paying a million dollars for a rock and then he couldn't sell his rock for like 300 bucks wasn't that like a scenario that was happening so that was uh yeah anyway guys uh going forward uh one caution i'll talk about before we get on out of here is if you're if you are that person watching this and you are deep in crypto you're deep in crypto and you're watching your balance go down you're watching you it's hard look i know this from first-hand experience it's hard to take a loss it's hard to take an l really hard especially when it's money but you've got to look at the situation right now if you bought ethereum at two thousand dollars three thousand dollars in ethereum if you bought that at those prices you were buying it off someone else that was selling it for three thousand dollars someone that was selling it for two thousand dollars now it's down to a thousand dollars uh well what what is the price of f it's bouncing up and down like yo yo right now um i'll just try and refresh it see what the price of ethereum is but ethereum price usd it's down to eleven hundred dollars and at the start of the week i think on set was it on friday on friday ethereum was seventeen hundred dollars it's lost like forty percent of its value in five days that is not a that is not a stable asset b that's a massive amount of speculation coming out of the market so you've got to ask yourself how much can you afford to lose if it keeps going down how much can you afford to lose that's what you've got to weigh up in any investment if it goes like just picture yourself now if it goes down if s goes down to 500 bucks what am i going to do picture that scenario because that's for me i think that's going down to 500 bucks i think it might even go down more uh in terms of bitcoin i mean bitcoin seems to be the biggest cryptocurrency in the room uh we can check the price of bitcoin but uh let's have a look at that i haven't actually really checked bitcoin but bitcoin price is that bitcoin price usd let's have a look whoa 21 000 that has dropped off like a th in march it was over double its value wow i should put a bit more emphasis on wow wow says i mean people like people would have bought someone bought bitcoin at sixty seven thousand dollars now they've lost a heap of money the chart signing like the max charts aren't even showing the 21 grand drop that's how quickly it's dropped off down from 30 like isn't that wow isn't michael saylor going to get um isn't that big crypto guy the guy who's like bitcoin is energy or something or bitcoin is life bitcoin is love wasn't there the michael sailor dude like um he was like bitcoin is is uh is the fourth dimension um wasn't he like isn't he gonna get margin called so again there's a point here around this level right now at twenty one thousand dollars four hundred dollars let me make no mistake let's make no mistake that margin call comes in for this guy's bitcoin there's gonna be another massive sell-off so bitcoin could be down to 15 grand in the next few days so just keep that in mind uh you might think oh that's that's crazy this guy apparently i from what i researched his margin call line was around twenty one thousand so uh that's a very scary level he's down to that he i bet you michael sailor right now is sweating he is sweating right now there is profuse sweat and you know he's try probably trying to hide it on twitter he might be making some tweets might be making some videos like yeah it's gonna come back up but i mean in the back of that dude's mind right now make no mistake about it he is sweating man he is he's probably shaking too and because the harsh reality of it sets in right um you know no one's spared from this system not even the elite so not even the bigger lead are spared sometimes fellas so er yeah we could go a little bit deeper in this whole subject but uh we'll save that for another live stream we've got manny thanks brother welcome to the tyc supporter manny was that with the uh vega 56 money brother the vega 56 money's like man such good advice brother i'm now sitting on that i sold that vega 56 i can now buy that rx 6600. uh watch traders johnny bravo and maverick of wall street who is a boutique trader for a small amount of top dollar players between those two they lay it all out okay cool i'll have to go check them out uh thanks for i love checking out other finance channels um they're some of them are really good actually some of the youtube guys uh george gammon is one of my favorite if you guys want to get so many different opinions from so many different people who understand the system uh i love george gammon's channel and so i give him i give him a big shout out he's it's just a like that channel is a goldmine of just information um and yeah so that's one channel i really like is george gammon i've been watching that channel quite a bit very good very good source of information i'll have to check out johnny bravo and maverick of wall street thanks for those recommendation uh recommendations um yeah so i knew you were a rebel oh yeah yeah i was actually in his chat one time george yeah so i love that channel so it's a very good channel and you can just tell like when you watch a lot of these guys on youtube and i think that's why you guys still that's why my channel hasn't dropped into the ground is because when you're watching people you can tell if they're sincere or not right you can tell that the fake people eventually they flip flop they change they're just hungry for views then you could tell people who are just genuine about their audience and a lot of the finance guys a lot of these finance guys are actually genuine about their audience especially i find like george gammon they care about people they care about uh humans as a species so that's kind of like where we're going forward i think there's going to be a big change in actually hey do we care about each other as a community do we want to lift each other up do we want to go in the right direction or do we want to go in the wrong direction so yeah anyway guys i'm shorting amd and nvidia if 200 cards flood the market they won't make any profit for a year yeah um shorting amd and nvidia stock no financial advice but uh timing is going to be pretty hard on that one as we see with tesla as well these start like it's hard to time these these stocks but i think that'd be a smart move um personally i'd i'd love to i can't like with the broker that i'm with interactive brokers ib they won't let me in as an australian citizen short stock so it's weird because i can buy and sell options but i can't try i can't short sell um stock but yeah i would um yeah the techies community any community you ever need thanks brother so way too many elites in this world unfortunately now there's not that like there's actually when you break it down the the elites are like in my opinion the the you know the real elites are the ones you never hear about if you hear about them then they're not actually so elite that's what we're finding out with this system there's a lot of like i've seen a lot of um d and d happen even on the higher end of things in terms of the economy and so yeah it seems like the people you don't know their names they're the elite so um they're the real elite i guess so plants pelosi's husband knows what to do while he's not driving drunk yeah you guys know what's up you guys in chat know what's up so yeah there he goes you guys know what's up in chat a lot of you guys are pretty smart so we can't we um we keep it going that way we keep it going that way but basically what we're going to see after all this after the next few years what you're going to see is speculation in itself doesn't benefit benefit society raw speculation doesn't really benefit anyone um in the sense that publicly traded speculation right if you're if you're backing someone with an idea and you're helping them create something that's new and innovative that is good you could consider that speculation but if you're just buying this stock that's on the stock market pumping up the price of it that doesn't help society it's just a wealth transfer in itself so i think the system itself is going to really show how weird it is in the next few years it's going to be huge like the what's to come is is just like stay stay humble brother stay happy stay you know i'll try and uh point you guys in the right drinks make sure you're drinking green tea low caffeine make sure you low caffeine green tea make sure you're eating a lot of onions and this is one thing that i haven't really talked about have i talked about the onion metal because if i haven't you've got to get onions every day you've got to be eating some of the onion family whether it's ginger onion green onions get some form of onions in your life you need onions and that's what you need every day and if someone tells you don't eat onions you just ignore that but they're not your friend okay they are not your friend you can eat the onions cooked cooked onions whatever doesn't matter yeah garlic's another one too garlic's part of the onion family so i i think i don't like i haven't checked vegetables like the meadow i just know that every day you should be eating onions the onion family so that's um that's my tip for you guys green tea and onions and uh yeah man they they're good they're good so i hope you guys are hitting up your onions make sure you can stockpile onions too they last quite a while i mean depends on the climate you're in but yeah you know it's all you need just some onions i'll just go on an onion diet onion diet green tea and we'll see if um if my hair starts going back to its original color uh fried onion and garlic yeah oh man i'm glad like there's not one anti-onion person in chat you guys just continually impress me you guys continually impress me you know in australia before we close this out you know what happened in australia we had um we had lettuce like people were telling me lettuce was like ten dollars and uh then kfc was putting uh this will be the last topic for the day kfc puts cabbage cabbage on burgers like uh this is how bad the inflation's getting in australia they're putting a cabbage on the burgers in in in australia now like for me personally like if you have a chicken burger and a stray man it's got to have lettuce on it lettuce and onion just keep it simple don't give me like cabbage on a burger man like so they're doing a 50 50 mix now so yeah and they're like oh it's the floods and here's a scary thing in australia they're going to tell you oh it's the floods it's the uh the floods are causing it the everything's causing the not not the money printing right they're gonna tell you the money printing and the government's reckless spending hasn't caused the inflation it's it's the floods then you go deeper into some of these articles it's like yeah last year we were selling cabbages and and cauliflowers and all this stuff uh we're selling this stuff for double what we usually get and there was no floods then so what you got now right in a free market right if you have a free market with sound money which you don't have sound money right now it's crazy you you've got these lettuces if they're too expensive in australia and the australian dollar's strong against the other nation they'll just import the lenaces right the lettuce price will come down but you see the transit costs this is what you're not getting told in australia the transit costs are so expensive in australia right now energy costs are so expensive everything's so expensive that transporting the lettuce the prices are naturally going to go up even if you import them so that's what they're not telling you on the news on the mainstream media that's what they're not telling you so yeah we've got an artificial uh choking of supply but we've also got some other issues going on too and the biggest one is the money printing that's happened anyway looks like it's going the other way now so the money destroying has begun and it's wow the effect it's already having so yeah make sure you guys eat your onions make sure you eat keep onions with you every time you're at the supermarket i want you to get some form of onion make sure you get a bit of ginger onion family for life okay sing it with me please do some car content we might i was actually thinking about it hey we'll close this stream
