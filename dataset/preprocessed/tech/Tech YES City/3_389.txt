so with everything going on in the world at the moment I've been doing my best to make sure you guys are getting that content in your sub boxes but another thing I want to do here today is give back to you guys where I'm gonna be giving away two gtx 1070 s off the back pocket as well as talking to the sponsors here at the channel that's creative as corsair and also as rock and I asked them look can you guys pitch in a couple of things as well and we do this big giveaway to the tech yes citizens out there and really the message of today's video is just a big THANK YOU for you guys for watching the content and also of course you get in with a chance to get some free stuff now there's no strings attached with this giveaway it's an international worldwide giveaway all you have to do to enter is check out the link in the description below it's a gleam link I use this system because it's fair it also blocks out any spammers that try to cheat the system and of course it's randomly generated so anyone gets randomly drawn there the winner they get one of these awesome prizes now there's also something else I'm going to answer in today's video which was a comment that kind of hit me it was a fair it was a fair comment in that someone asked me why I do what I do and why do I share what I share on the channel essentially but we will get onto that later let's go through all the goodies and prizes that you guys can get in with a chance to win so first off we're gonna start off with creative they've got the x3 here this is the sound blaster I took a look at this unit right here and it's a USB DAC amp solution and I found it just had some amazing add-ons as well where it had pretty much the replica or the new-age modern cmss 3d and it worked pretty well in games as well as having enough power to even power although dynamics so that was a really awesome unit and then below that is the sound blaster ae7 this is a dedicated PCIe sound card there has some really good numbers coming out of it especially if you're using a cheap onboard audio solution so these two units here big thanks to creative for giving them away and then we've got next up Corsair they decided to give away a k70 mark to RGB cable it's of course got that IQ that it can link up to so you can control all the RGB effects and it just looks so nice as well as having those mechanical switches on board if you want to type consistently this is one of my favorite keyboards around here at the studio I do use this quite a bit especially on my benchmarking rig and they've also decided to give away a dark called Pro this is a mouse that allows you to charge it if you get the MM 1,000 miles pad you can wirelessly charge this mouse and it's more for a palm gripper so it is quite a big mouse and it does have a bit of weight to it and then we're moving on to asrock and they're giving away a Z 390 phantom gaming 7 this is a great balance motherboard if you want to go on the 9900 ke side of things and it's got all the features you want great onboard audio decent VR Ram I've got a two point five gigabit integrated NIC and an integrated IO shield for that ascetic now for the AMD side of things I said look you've got to throw in another motherboard here for the viewers and they said they've got an X 470 Taichi which they're gonna update the BIOS to support horizon 3000 for you guys now the Taichi series of motherboards I've liked what they've done especially on the AMD side of things X 370 Taichi X 470 and of course the x5 70 Taichi all solid mulder bullets with very solid VRMs where the X 370 Taichi will still power the 3900 X absolutely fine so now moving on to these gtx 1070 s I picked these up in a deal where I got six of them for 280 ozzie a pop and that was before I kind of had the foresight to buy up a heap of gravis cards when I made this video up here where I thought GPU prices were going up and in hindsight especially in Australia I was right on the money there GPU prices have gone up in Oz but that's not gonna stop me from giving away a couple of these to you guys gtx 1070 great solid mid-range card even in 2020 with the RT x-series out there this card has the eight gigabytes of vram it's got the performance to boot too and so there it all is with the giveaway make sure you get in with a chance there's only one prerequisite on gleam and that is you be

guys so much for supporting us all these years and speaking of that support this segues into this next question beautifully because this is pretty much the answer to this comment right here we're funky giblets they say kind of no surprise you've basically made competition out of every aussie viewer you have not only that you've told them how much you pay and how you go about the business you have essentially handed them the tools to screw you should have just stuck with showing off hardware and breathing new life into it and left the business sign out of it what's that age old saying about no good deed going unpunished and the road to being paved with good intentions wish you the best but you really should rethink the content you feature especially it has a chance to shoot you in the foot and so what this all boils down to is yes I do show a lot of the inner workings of flipping PCs PC parts what's the best used parts to get and me showing all my I guess my secret sauce is not a big problem because that's how I grew YouTube in the first place it's like people watched me because I was passionate about what I did and I didn't mind sharing all this stuff and just making you guys come on board for the journey and it's funny to say that because I got guys on the Gold Coast here who essentially are my competitors but I'm friends with them and they love watching the content here at Tech ES city they love use price-performance they love it it's like it's good competition its competition that promotes new metas which in turn promotes the best price performance and that all then ties in at the end of the day with your grass roots who are you as an individual I'm someone who just enjoys what I do and I enjoy sharing tips whether it's at my own dish trim it or not because I don't really see it as being a detriment when I've got this amazing community behind us and people hit the like button they watch my ads they support the channel they do everything they can to support us and I'm just grateful for that with the YouTube side of things you guys have given me a career out of YouTube that I never would have had if I'd never shown anything here on the channel to begin with so basically there was some replies to this comment which I agree with - you've got this pie which if I didn't do any of the content I did it would be very small I'd think of it as a rotten boring pie but since we have this community that's growing we've now got this big amazing tasty pie that I'd rather have 10% of that then a hundred percent of the rotten pie if that makes any sense so for me with gone forward I'm always just gonna share this stuff because I love just promoting that price-performance and always trying to give someone the best price performance if they're getting into PC gaming because that also ties back to when I was a teenager and I didn't have any of that help it was always back in those days I will always go buy the newest stuff and it was too expensive for me I wish a channel like mine had existed when I was a teenager so I could have extracted the best price performance and got the best PC gaming experience when I was only working minimum wage when I was 14 years old for example so that side of me will never change that grass roots will never change that's what it's all about around here just staying humble basically in the day there was a saying that I learnt back when I was a teenager and that is better than no man lesser than none and so basically for me those are the words that I live by and I just keep on rocking and rolling and without aside I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content then you know what to do hit that sub button ring that bell and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon but just remember one thing with competition if you're caught slipping then I'll be flipping peas out for now Bay [Music] Oh
