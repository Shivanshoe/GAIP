I think we're good are you sure you want to start live streaming yes I want to start live streaming I think we are now live with tech something you just check this camera right hello tech glorious tech people of the world I am joined by the one the only Greg yeses are actually yeah that's uh sorry how you been dude how you been I'm doing good I'm actually trying to watch your livestream now and I'm watching a non skippable ad so oh you're making like point zero five pennies you know I love you right now you are watching an ad like that is great is it good at uh it was like it almost look like a ramen noodle ad but it was it was like a high-end ramen I don't know how to describe it but like it was very entertaining look what I got for you before we start the livestream we've got Star Wars Top Trumps with the twist now I thought I thought I knew my Star Wars R I was like yeah bit of a Star Wars geek but I'm gonna throw one question at you and the audience and you can't Google the answer okay and we're gonna see your Star Wars knowledge are you ready I'm not ready so question 1 what does Han Solo say about older on when the fault can arrives at its coordinates to find a meteor shower first stuff you said Han Solo han sol yeah yeah yeah I should be asking you these questions what is it aunt here it ain't there it's been totally blown away if we're gonna put this doublets quiz down yeah like it off like it's some other questions as I was playing like one card each with my brother I'm just scratching my head it's like when order 66 is put through who's the first Jedi to [ __ ] it and I'm like blow [ __ ] because I remember him you know in his shuttle he got down downed in Episode three and I was wrong it's apparently some other dude who I don't even know his name but they didn't show him in the movie they did they did I think he's the dude with the conehead do you know the I think I know he called the old guy with you yeah with the white little hair yeah what's he called again that's it that's how you play a battlefront too freakin a what's his name that's all main that's what I mean Star Wars knowledge so all right we got some articles up here I pulled up boulders gate three first oh okay I pulled up boulders gate three because I was excited I was actually reading up about this before basically in a nutshell I can't wait for Baldur's Gate three it's been more like 20 years since they released the Baldur's Gate 2 that was a game I lost myself in but let's get on to some tech news here with rumored specifications of our TX 27 architects 30 70 and 30 80 now before we even get into this right we're looking at around 3,800 cuda cores on the 30 80 10 gigabytes or 20 gigabytes of gddr3 thousand cuda cores it's 8 or 16 gigabytes now from those specs we've got what looks like a better 20 80 right if you can play the 3072 the 2080 it's probably gonna beat it out now I don't think I don't think they're gonna be putting six dang gigabytes of vram on the 30 70 that's just my guess like like that's just really taken at next level you know what I mean oh yeah hey hey you guys want beer and we heard it sells GPUs this is 16 of it I mean if you think about it they're like even some of the lower in like a and D I mean whoa and adjust the mainstream like rx for eighties and 5 even those have optional 8 gig buffers right so like you could get a gigs in a two hundred dollar card why I mean how is having only 8 gigs in something that's worth six $700 anything special anymore you know that's why people like the 1080 TI because you get their an 11 gig oh yeah 1080 T I mean you picked that thing off it's cheap oh yeah you 400 here 11 gigabytes you know people who love fear and buffers will lose it for that price you bet that had a budget build and you're like even like I wouldn't say budget probably the wrong way to say be you put that in a high-end gaming PC and that's gonna sell really quick so I put in a budget build and you'd have a system with more vram than system ran if you only had 8 gigs in the system yeah actually dude that is such a good video idea hey can we map yes you've given me an idea right here like can you max out 11 gigabytes of frame buffer on 8 gigabytes of ddr3 that is such a good video idea we're gonna get that done this is why me and Greg do these live streams so we can just brainstorm video id' oh that's how you give me without yeah yeah do an AMD system and an Intel system and report back okay yeah do you want to do the AMD or the video on the GPUs uh oh yeah they do it gets a 16 that's yeah I don't have one of those one not but I blame anybody for nutso anyone because they weren't really mean to me it's the right man if you want to cry like you just let it downstream speaking of this the success of the true successor to that that is big navvy so actually we'll just skip through a few articles here because I mean you guys probably already read these articles where we've got big so there's like yet we'll talk about GTC core the I'm just gonna mumble that out so I don't get you know you can't really talk about those exact words but okay so we got AMD's next-gen flagship is apparently gonna have double the stream processors as the 5700 xt and it's gonna have a HB m to memory and two terabytes per second bandwidth like when you look at it we scroll down to the specs here right there saying a guesstimate of 275 watts TDP which is like they're gonna have to seriously put the clocks down on this thing to get to keep that power yeah that's pretty low considering I mean if you if you look at what the TDP of what's what's TDP bar X 5700 XT 150 200 225 I thought it's 20 or 25 like yeah so 275 for twice yeah for having twice as much exactly that's not how it works - once you get the bigger biggest silicon what about HBM - efficiencies is there is there any substantial power savings because I'm also questioning why they even went with that the first place but well you got twenty five gigabytes of it so yeah a lot more yeah well yeah but I mean do you know you xx I mean this goes back to the core thing right do you need that much I'm sure could come up with the use case for it but a majority of gamers won't realize that they've even well I think if they can beat if they can beat RT X xx atti which I mean this is the thing right this is what we're gonna talk about with 3000 series coming out we know that's coming out soon possibly in the next month even I'm told it's second quarter definitely like 3000 series definite second quarter release in terms of what the specs are gonna be you've heard up rumors about this thing it's going to punch hard basically I've heard stories that Jensen's not holding back with 3000 series and the reason being is because he's seen what's happened with AMD versus Intel on the CPU side he's not stupid he's seen that so apparently he's not holding back with this launch so that's yeah and with that in mind even if this big navvy comes out it's really like before it gets bested man I love these ads coming up yeah did go to chemistry house yesterday and I did get some fish oil and I did get some vitamins right to stock up you gotta get your body healthy before you would get sick that's good yes it just don't say the full word because I don't want my channel getting hit birth it gets hit you do yeah cuz they YouTube's got a thing in that stops spreading thud you know what I mean like YouTube doesn't want this information spread about it like to cause panic and all that stuff you know what I mean yeah but if I said the full name it wouldn't de monitor yeah yeah it does that's the thing no it does to don't do it so we'll just call it we just call it the core V core V okay yeah so yeah I'm stocking up my body I'm getting it ready bro fish oil red krill oil I'm taking a bit of a mix here and then I've got like this garlic vitamin C formula with zinc thrown in and yeah I'm I'm stocking up right that's it you spend like a couple of bucks they had probably 50 bucks on vitamins it could potentially save you a lot of headaches how's that for an investment do you think people really care about efficiency with this next-gen launch on both sides efficiencies good man like if you're putting together especially resellers dude this is the thing like people like buying a case with high airflow they don't really care too much like they got their high end power supply high and motherboard they just want the best performance but where the mainstream of course is always gonna care about efficiency and the reason being is because then you can cheap out on the case power supply and multiply these resellers are like yeah we could cheap out on all this but still have great performance and that's the reason why efficiency is always going to be king in the mainstream so I mean that's just my thinking so we've got here basically big navvy is going to be a power it's gonna consume some power like it's it's ready to rock and roll but I think the 50% it's going to be like 50% Fossum 5700 XT definitely but how much it's going to come over a 20 80 TI and then 3000 series coming out what's the situation gonna be is it going to be another Radeon 7 where it's just too little too late I doubt it the jump to 7 enemyís I think now I feel for Andy like big navvy is - there's ago yeah no I definitely if I had to bet my chips right now on one company outperforming the other at the Nvidia at this point I mean the the jump I think is to be more massive for ampere granted depending on how they market these cards and how they price them with ray-tracing and it's just stuff that they've been trying to kind of shove down our throats it honestly hasn't caught hold yet for a lot of people yeah it's it's gonna depend on how they present it and again how they price it accordingly but I still think that the power gains even if they kept all the prices the same yeah are gonna be enough for them and that's all they need is it Nvidia is always going to be the the premium brand in a lot of people's eyes AMD has more specifically radon it's gonna have a tough time with power I think though that's something they admit it even at CES was like they're still struggling a bit with getting the efficiency on par with their competition and it looks like they're under selling TDP at 275 for a GPU that has twice the potential packed into it I don't see how that's possible at all like so here we go every episode I go throw your curveball I'm throwing one right your way good okay so you really are you ready for this curveball always free come on okay let me just throw on the mass then so we got here the question do you think they're going to release the r-tx 30 atti straight away with the 30 80 and 30 70 based on precedent no no I don't see why they I don't see why they would because they they always approach this from the from the top down right they're gonna release the good cards first the people don't want to buy them and pay more for them or gonna do it and some people who don't want to wait for the cheaper cards they're gonna bite the bullet and spend more money because the lower end cards are the ones that are more desirable so it makes sense to launch the for the higher tiered ones first yeah but launching something like the 1080 TI or they clear 38 ET I would be I what I think they do this for instead of launching that one first and then trickling down I think they're released the the mid to high tier 70 90 series skews first yeah to get like people kind of in the lower tier market teetering on the edge of spending a bit more to bite the at first then the guys that have the money to spend by the middle stuff first and then when the 2030 ATI comes out and they're like yeah screw it I'll buy that - you get off exactly that's what made you know Jensen knows how to trickle it out he's like here we go yeah you know why it's because the guys that can spend more money are there more fluid and they can adapt to newer hardware faster than people who are more budget sensitive yeah so it makes sense to kind of play with the higher tier stuff in a different order because you can get them to buy this and then get them to buy this even better thing five months later obviously it's working for because they've done it five six years in a row well it's funny because the way the way you'd like to use markets working anyway they can sell that for like 80 percent of what price they paid anyway on their 30 70 30 80 like people just snag it up straightaway so it's still got warranty whatnot people are gonna snag it up straightaway so that's the reason like Nvidia is just so smart with that man like but at the same time it still leaves AMD where they've got to start firing more and do more and be on top as well that's what I feel like but again it goes back to that last argument we did in the last episode where we talked about their R&D budget and they I'd like to see them win the CPU market which they kind of they're doing a great job of and we'll talk about that actually we'll move into that because something really interesting if you like seeing this the 3900 X is down to 420 bucks like I got your first Emma's only yeah so I checked it on Amazon and I was like man like 424 3900 X like how is this possible I thought this thing was sold out what this is being sold and shipped by amazon.com yeah so it's legit yeah it's not a third-party reseller yeah this is interesting what is it on new way I'm curious if New Age matching can meet you I don't tell you if it's like a my keyboards lay on their I'm standing up dude my keyboards dead no you're good let's see new egg has it for 420 bucks dude whoa so what do you think's going on here like my speculation I don't talk about this because we look at the feedback score right this CPUs got paper sales it sold really well but I think there's maybe a slowdown like I think this is what I'm noticing to men there's a slowdown in higher-end pcs like yeah you know know people just don't I mean and I've been pushing this narrative a lot because I want people to understand that while it's great that we have the option to buy a 12 core consumer grade ship most people don't need them yeah and I think AMD was expecting people to buy into the hype a bit more than they actually did and that's kind of like I saw that as like my responsibility is someone that refuses this stuff and plays with it every day to tell people look you're gonna be you know if I put a 3700 we talked about this last stream yeah against a 3900 X and we did just a blind test streaming and gaming I highly doubt highly doubt you'd be able to tell the difference between the two and that's what a majority of people do like that's that's probably the higher you know upper echelon of workloads for the average consumer is it's maybe a streaming gaming and then maybe some surfing in the background some crazy stuff but you're not doing hard like serious compiling or anything like that you're not doing things that actually demand high high core count chips and so maybe that's like yeah like you said they're seeing a slowdown because the hypes over with it's been out for at least a few months and yeah I mean they're gonna drop prices according to the demand that they see so if they don't like the demand at a certain price what you do is lower the price to match a higher level of demand exactly push the supply that you have so it what's funny is they were struggling with supply at one point like we couldn't even find 3900 X's in stock and now all of a sudden they're in stock they're cutting the price by what a hundred bucks or so I don't know what that's about it's a little bit weird like tech anomic skipping in here like there's a little bit more - there's gonna be a bit more to the story like I think they still got 12 nanometer plus like fabbing hard because I mean we're see in the 2600 it's just like the sale infinitely for sale here's that here's the thing though do you think the PlayStation 5 and stuff do you think they actually gonna use 12 nanometer + on those rising cause because if seven nanometers in such a shortage it wouldn't make sense for them to they not make they don't make much money on console deals well make a so one of the consoles supposed to launch is it's at this year sometime little dear I think I think Xbox X is going to have like the first go at it Sony's like having problems so maybe the inventory constraints were tied to console production maybe are they are they producing it now I mean are they like producing these as they're being sold or are they trying to stockpile up because they you know they have years and years of console sale experience to reference and so they're choking the market up front to get the consoles out there and then once they have a certain amount of supply that they you know historically can can use to gauge interest then that's when you see the XS 7 animator stuff hit the shelves and that's when you see the price cuts and actually that's been like that it wasn't as bad with Zen and Zen plus because there was there is no serious console release that I mean the Xbox one I don't know when that came out but I'm pretty sure I had an Xbox one before yeah I had yeah I don't know way before I just intend a 64 that was my loss like hardcore console like that I had yeah I'm a little I'm a late bloomer compared to you but I do believe that the the overlap is probably partly to blame for this I didn't think about that but that's I think you're right maybe some so you'll just say what you're trying to tell me is that you're throwing me a curveball food yeah what is over you like 12 12 a.m. or 12 p.m. for you over there okay it's 11 a.m. I mean if you down south in Australia you at Walt you'd past lunchtime so daylight saving you some lunch man I just like everything Australia they just eliminate daylight savings that's just it's so annoying cuz like I live about 20 meters away from the border to the next state and as soon as you cross over you like your clock starts going crazy and it starts skipping an hour forward skipping back it's like oh my god yeah it's so annoying so I mean I could only imagine living on that border and you've making plans with your friends and your cross yeah it's like it's not just like that your phone's like giving you the wrong time you like and then I where are you my heart photos in an hour's time I lived really close to the Dateline here I'm not Dateline but the time zone change here so it got really it was really bright really late at night in the summer time like it'd be like 9:00 p.m. oh wow and it's super dark or super bright still like the Sun would almost be up still you know and and then in the wintertime it gets dark at like 4:30 so if you ever said like 9 p.m. you like yeah let's go out for lunch and people just like we used to go out and play basketball in the driveway my parents place at like 8:00 p.m. because it was still bright outside you know like that's crazy a so yeah if everyone is like me and you want to abolish daylight savings just let us know and chat so people I say it's good so I mean I've just told you from a tech guys point you know point of view I know there's like reasons for daylight savings isn't it mainly with farmers and stuff the you know yeah I don't know I I I just hate it when I've got to work cross-border with people in Sydney and Melbourne and they're like hey we'll take a call at 1 p.m. and then one PMS like they call me at lunchtime I'm eating lunch and they'll be like what wait swampy I'm like Oh daylight savings really we're a bit like those are just I mean from the Gold Coast like Sydney's to almost do south of you right yeah like it's not like you're going west or east but you're still switching time zones because you're just going closer to the South Pole it's just what really it is really it's one of the most confusing things in oz men is this daylight savings from Queensland and New South Wales to Victoria which is all straight line we're all in the same time zone yeah it's just super weird so other than that so we got rising 526 hundreds still selling like a juggernaut and then we got the newly the newcomer the 1600 af someone secured this is sold out that someone secured one for $85 for me and they're shipping it to me so nice of you guys they want me to check it out especially with these new Zeon's right the 12th they're not new but they're used but they're v3 and they got the turbo unblocked and so you got that 12 core I can't wait to get that 12 core but man the shipping delays are so crazy right now like I gotta wait apparently it's an extra like 30 to 40 days on top because the reason why there's a massive like there's two reasons write it customs in your country is going to be holding the stuff up longer that's one reason for like shipment delays there's another reason is apparently over in China all like the district to district is shut down so like you get something shipped from China it takes so much longer to actually leave China with with our old mate Co V so yes yeah I was um I clicked on that page that you linked my interest so it shows aimed here as in five 1600 guys that and that's it yeah if it doesn't show it says AF and the code like on the right why D something's like AF box AF is the what you look for I see right so like why don't they just put AF late in the day because now like you have to I mean I know that we do the name is just weird I mean it created a lot of buzz to people who exactly are seen right tech enthusiasts it create a lot of buzz but the average person is gonna look at that girl yeah what it's a refresh right it's on the 12 nanometer it's basically it's basically 2600 the words add like no one's exactly gonna know what it is unless they pull it apart or they got access but apparently my guess of it having this the first gen controller is accurate like that is what people are saying is true because it's the same size it's basically everything's the same just the mm had a firmware update and that was it and then I copped a heap of crap for that people were same old crap man like the internet you get over it after a while but yes it's the whole reason you put out opinions and curve balls is to get people thinking and talking and discussing so yeah let's get over to this refresh we got the refresh here with the gonna get rid of this add yes I do trade currencies but not with IG so why are you giving me an IG ad that's why you're getting it cuz you don't yet do it wise will just say hey guys today's video is freely sponsored by at went away wait came back let me try it okay there what you alright so they're refreshing right but they're adding a ten core twenty thread not ten nine hundred K which is weird because isn't there already a ten nine hundred like on the exit oh yeah ten nine you know the ten nine eighty is like the high end and then that's ten nine yeah don't they have already like a ten nine hundred on x29 own if you could check that out for us refresh CPUs it's just extra nine i refresh CPUs right it's really good yeah let's see but these are on mainstream those they're mainstream right right right you know this is Xu yeah this is executed but I'm trying to see what what are the names at the yeah hey G so do you say Zedd for ninety or Z for ninety I cesium oh yeah bro I follow you there hey I cuz I'm from Australia I meant to say Zed like I meant to say said for ninety and people like dude you're from also you guys they said I'm like no I like Z for naughty better rolls off my tongue better just like I like that I like saying sold or better than thought oh yeah so I mean I'd love to see you say sold it now and you say so I be I say sorry I say can you say solder can you say solder solder I mean I know it's like Sam and Solomon like I know there's like a convention to say it correctly and salmon I think it's a correct way to say it but like there are still people that say sallman or salmon and no one you know okay no one simply excuse me hey dude isolation did you see least I so Lisa walk behind you then she was but she didn't look happy no behind the door yeah she just she looked in she didn't look happy so tell her I said sorry oh yeah yeah oh maybe the baby's going hots I don't know he was cool with me I mean I had I had baby duty when she was cooking dinner I took care of you too she drew the short stick he's probably losing his temper now huh you had that handled so what we got here is the Tet so they basically the naming scheme is my biggest product like yeah sure we got a refresh we want to see 10 Nana me the Intel looks like they're in a world of trouble there already and we've already discussed this so many times in the past but they're naming what are they doing with this naming like I circulated the AI 510 400 F is the perfect example this CPU is going to be one of their champions right it's got 6 cores 12 threads it's got a low TDP it's gonna come in at a good price I'm assuming but they're calling it an i5 like that's like why don't they make up a new naming scheme like the z5 or like the z9 or yeah it's about tradition they want to they want to make sure there's name recognition and it's really tough to break that cycle when you've got decades well not decades I mean they just basically tell them people hate goodbyes and i7 2600 this is the ten nine hundred k yeah that the h EDT version is a ten nine hundred x that is literally the only difference I mean apart from subtle changes particularly 10 cores 20 threads this is a ten courtship - right so yes they've got ten yeah they got 10 cores 20 threads it basically looks like yeah same thing just add 2 cos 4 threads the thing is no one's really going to be upgrading to this because the 9900 ka k f as well as the KS and stuff they're all still the gaming kings like there's no going to be no difference they still they still need a fixing prices though man like that's the biggest thing about Intel right now it's pissing me off is like I hate I honestly it's not that I don't like Rison I just hate only recommending Reisman because anybody that asks for any leg modest budget it's like ok ridin 5 2600 that looks like best bet but I tell that almost everybody on a budget under $1000 that's doing it because it's like give me something that I can freakin recommend you I have like I have not seen a bit of that in the street like I have been hearing a bit of that in the same man like yeah cuz it rosin is better value like you look at 37 I mean unless you go like all true budget like you do like you do like the Zeon's and stuff like that like I'm just not as familiar with those and frankly you've got to know kind of what you to get the right boards and the right you know others look there's certain conventions that you have to follow but with Rison it's pretty straightforward it's a relatively new CPU so people don't feel that you know apprehensive about it and and that's I mean they're dirt cheap like eighty five bucks for a sixteen hundred like hey basically yeah yeah exactly how can you say no to that you know for any budget under arguably eight hundred nine hundred dollars like cuz then you can just milk the crap out of that budget on the graphics card you can get yourself free content ETI over four hundred bucks pair that with an $85 six core twelve red you've got you know for seven hundred dollars you've got a killer system like the left that's all it takes that's it we're done chat I'm sorry I appreciate to the choir guys yeah value has entered chat and in tell us let's go yeah so I mean basically when you look at it right it's the Z on the VIII's eons are interesting but with the with Co V doing its damage man with shipping times and stuff that's like it's a good recommendation but how long are you going to be waiting to get your twelve core for a hundred and ten bucks and the benefits of that I'm gonna be exploring that a lot as soon as I get the twelve corium because that's the most fascinating because it sort supports quad channel ddr3 which is super cheap so you will have some other cookie cutter options but at the moment as it stands if you're in the u.s. yeah you should only be buying Rison and like that's pretty much the only recommendation you've got in Australia it's kind of up in the air like it's it's a bit of everything like I still speak to the retailers and they tell me that Intel still sells really well here it just must and NVIDIA and Intel do extremely well in Australia like extremely well in the US I'd say AMD's had more of a cult following in the u.s. more than anything I think there's it's got some really strong roots there because I noticed even the FX days like even in bulldozer days they were still selling well in the US like they'll still sound pretty well yeah they were no yeah that was my second ever build that was for this channel about five or five years ago an FX 6300 build and I bought it just based on core count that was literally the only reason I bought it it's like okay well I can get six cores out of an FX 6300 so you got I would this is when I was kind of still a new kind of experiment figure out what actually was wrong with the CPU for why it was only costing 99 bucks versus 130 that the core i3 was a 4150 at the time yeah and then you're done good yeah and you realize like there's there's actually I mean there's such a thing as having a slower core and a stronger core and a faster core and and there's also power efficiency to consider and yeah so you know I kind of just I kind of learned by experimenting on my own it could have read the articles and stuff too and I did that but I'd like to see it you know I want to be hands-on but that stuff and yeah there's definitely you got to see it to believe it but you just wanted the thing ever I just be just confessed to the stream as well at the same time you wanted six cores in your computer didn't you the best way to trigger and boy is not that all of they're like this but is some of the real diehards are this way yeah is to tell them that their precious six and eight core chips aren't actually chips with technically they have two separate integer clusters or two separate integer integer cores per cluster and and but even though they share a scheduler in an FPU it's done it's still by definition a two core cluster and and then I come back it's like okay well what do you think about the class-action lawsuits oh man so why do you think Amy felt compelled to give everybody on you know everybody who bought into that yeah what was it they got like 30 40 bucks bag or something like that yeah it's funny I'd wonder how many people claim their refund and what happens to the leftover folks what do you know what happened I'm sure they keep it they got it is well it's a trust fund I think it's a trust so they they allocate a certain amount of money into the trust and then the trust is in charge of dissolving it but once I mean once a certain amount of time I'm sure it's in the claws so it's a clause in the contract no way once that expires that extra money just probably goes back to AMD I mean where else would you send it would it go to the government though technically like that's the thing that's if someone knows in the comments where it would go if the money on that cuz I'm curious to know who would get the money who doesn't claim so that would be C that's my I don't know dude I don't study that finance cynic no I don't know I'm just yeah but if someone's like let's go in the u.s. that would go here maybe in Australia UK be something different but that would be really interesting to find out just I'm curious now all the sudden so a good point though someone did say mister magnet said that the lawsuit had nothing to do with Australia so just a us thing I don't know bit by us I'm talking about the walls of the money leftover say for instance ability action lawsuit in astray of what would happen and right that's an important point though is it like it really I mean they could argue back well they only settled in the US so is it still in a courtship in Australia it is not a courtship at the states right they still advertise it as an a courtship on us sites like on their own website they say it's an a courtship you know so I don't really understand what like yeah what's going on with that how that even works like in my opinion it's a class-action lawsuit and you settle you're just trying to get rid of it but obviously there's no finite like yes or no it is or it isn't because you settled so well here's the thing man he's the thing I'm on the side of that guy well give us that voice again you know what technically it's a to integer chord I'm on his side bro because I flipped some of these things and I put yeah I put eight cause if it's an eight core FX 81 28 core so did I when I sold them yeah that's it so did I grant it back then I didn't really I released a video at one point where we deep dive into and I was like ah but before that I was totally shameless and ickis AMD was saying they were eight core so why can't I that's exactly right hey like I'm just the messenger here we got here what we got here is an uneventful like I just predict like this naming thing for me with Intel new launch is just all it's really trash yeah it's really trash it's just off I think they did need to redesign their whole like they need to get on ten nanometer obviously but all the things they're doing beside that like so now they're technically gonna have a tent did you check that is there already at ten nine hundred already out there yeah those were say so there's a ten nine hundred X which is the h EDT there's a ten nine hundred K the age to ten hundred K is the apparently the Z for seventy consumer-grade what are they doing like you know community people gonna buy a zphone naughty motherboard then by ten thousand nine hundred X and they're gonna be like hey the CPU doesn't fit that's like going to be a realistic scenario now like it's dumb what anyway agree yeah I mean hey it's L like pay me ridiculous amounts of money I'll come work for your company and we'll come get things sorted and we'll give gamers Z on gaming chips new for new ones value budget model um you would be so pumped chipset [ __ ] yeah I'll go with AMD to I care like just pass them Oh nobody wanted me to bad sense you want to give them Xeon chipset base chipsets from jay-z on ya know that a bit like I want to give them they they go to reignite their Z on gaming man that's like you got a really they gotta accept it they could accept it Zeon's better than i whatever i 5r them to be chipsets or you want them to be like more than you say what CP what happened chipset for it so it's cheaper than a manger this is a scary thing why I think x99 chipset so you can go up and look up how much they cost the actual chipset itself was like 55 bucks that's before you even get the PCB and the whole motherboard manufacturers costs you can get an a320 for 40 bucks so you imagine the difference in chipset costs alone that's why I tell people like eh 310 a320 they're good because you're giving the least amount of money to Intel the margin like that's why these chips that exist they're cheaper and inherently to make yeah sure they got these limitations but if you can extract the most out of it technically you're extracting the most factor that's the point right you have to live with the limitations and they're gonna strip it down as far as because at the end of the day they don't want you to buy those they want you to buy the higher-end boards because that's where the motherboard manufacturers also I presume make much I would argue like a 320 risin 530 600 you just get some 3000 X and P megahertz memory that is like you're covering 19 to 5 percent of the market easy in terms of all they need or what all they'd want but they just don't realize it they're gonna go get the next 570 motherboard with PCI 4.0 they don't need anyway yep we can go to rant but we'll go to comments second we'll go to the comment section instead of ranting we'll go to the comment section let's see what they start saying you can pick out the best so ask away guys comments time and then Greg's got to get back to his lovely beautiful wife she man she was walk I could I can tell that man I can tell the footsteps I can tell the walking style I can tell like yeah you're gonna hopefully didn't pick up on the mic yeah you you're gonna cop it off this stream bro you're done yeah smack down yeah I kind of had to either in today we got this live stream we're doing and I kind of gotta be there the viewers love it hey we got questions frame rate question mark frame rates are good next question 4k on epic settings okay epic settings is bad man 4k epic settings you are losing money cuz your eyes but you might notice too much of a difference when 1440p and 1080p so bets on how big your screen is depends on how big your screen is like a true best keyboard for the money ooh Microsoft economic let's pull that up on streetcar can I get it I picked it up for $15 dude picked it up for 15 bucks and I was gonna do a video on this I was gonna do a video like I punched I'm not gonna talk about what I punched but I punched something about two weeks ago and my wrist cocked dude like my wrist cocked and I was like nah man that sucks like basically my forearms are strong I remember back when I was a kid I was using ergonomics and then just doing gym and training and dude I had the strongest punch on me man like it was crazy so I this is true story I got the ergonomic I put it up for 15 Ozzie dollars that's ten US I had nothing to lose right ten us for a Microsoft economic keyboard beautifully sculptured pointed perfectly for your wrists nice wrist rest ah I'm selling this thing on stream forum because I love it anyway we got the I started using this for about four days in my wrists were extremely saw like extremely sore for days after using the ergonomic switching back to it from mechanical keyboards and fancy whatnot and I tell you dude man after those four days my wrist started getting really like fine like I was fine and then I started punching stuff and I was like yeah it's coming back like it's coming back there you go that's a wrist thing right that's like a carpal tunnel like I don't know side effect like when you punch if your risk is that's your wrist not your arm yeah that's like that's so that's just like the tendons or whatever they're just like aren't strong enough anymore because they've been held in a certain angled position there old-timer yeah whatever I've never had that feeling before but I could imagine that would probably hurt my ego just a bit don't do that often like if you ever need to like you don't want to that's what I'm a dude that's what I mean and my boy my boy rocketjump ninja he got just randomly attacked on the beach but I saw there dude he just got a freaking cold car from behind if I said I knew that was getting chased at him he called me up straight after I was like dude this is why you got a you got to be able to defend yourself you know what I mean that's like that's a big priority of mine so yeah genomic 4-thousand I think they got a new model out and you got to keep those wrists healthy because I use the keyboard I use my keyboard a lot being working on a computer a lot and so yeah now I'm back I'm good again I'm good again so if I get attacked on the beach randomly it's gonna be a different story have you ever been have you ever been just clocked in the back of the head yeah I mean it's the teutonic how they hit you yeah they they'll knock out frickin boxers do like you keep them in the right you know you hit them up from the back just below the skull that all yes your brain will cut out just to save it so well that's why man so like but usually people who throw punches like that man they're not they don't yeah they don't work out dude people who actually strong have discipline man and they don't go around starting fights that's what I've found so yeah I've been clocked in the back of the head actually twice when I was younger I got into a lot of fights I was younger dude that's my like rocket jumps like I actually caught from my this month I've actually got to upload after this livestream I actually caught a fight all on stream for my behind-the-scenes patron vlog it's so funny like I was just we were out and were just like I told I like I was like dude just stay away from this gang of like five dudes they're gonna start a fight so we just walked across the street and we just watching from a distance sure enough man like five minutes they just punching some random dude yeah he's gonna be aware of it so that's a good thing at least they came up but I was when I was like a teenager me I gonna do a lot of fight so I was able to like identify all this stuff and yeah so now it's like cool you just avoid danger and the best thing the best investment you can have is a paranoiac spur so if you see five dudes starting trouble today see you later boys like this like soft deck shoes like yeah you just can't run so basically what's come out of his live streams get yourself an ergonomic keyboard and a paranoid get a membrane keyboard so that for that soft impact so that's delicate so you use some Cherry MX is for too long man that clicked for flak just takes a toll you gonna get arthritis thinkers but that's not fight so why is this fight story time no it's not because if we get to access some questions here how much am I missing out on 3,600 if I got 2600 that's actually a really good question because it depends right you're gonna see bench markers a lot of bench markets through thirty two hundred megahertz speeds with the 3600 I've found with a lot I mean sorry 2600 I've found with a lot of 2600 they won't even reach 32 hundred megahertz especially like XM peas out of the box you'll only get to like 3000 megahertz 3066 and so the 3600 however that you can play I've gone up to 3600 I haven't had one 3600 chip that's had a problem running 30 600 megahertz X and P so the IMC's much better but also the seven nanometer and the IPC's better plus the boost out of the box is really good too so for me whenever someone asked me between the two I'm like get the 3600 all the way especially if you're not like know how to tune the things a hundred percent because when you already have the 2600 though like that's the because do you need more that can be said oh yeah come standard question is do you need so like that's that's the problem it's kind of hard to answer a question like that without knowing what exactly your workload is like you honestly see issues that you think could be resolved by the upgrade because a 3600 is basically as close to Intel Intel counterparts as you can get like it's it's almost tit-for-tat like you're not really gonna see again blind test I doubt you'd notice much of a difference in most games if any difference at all but yeah a 2600 is still gonna pull 80 to 90% of those frames I would say ballpark yeah and you're gonna get I mean this isn't Intel for saying anything but yeah I just I don't think if you already have a 2600 I would wait well because I doubt you're not content most yeah that's I mean every time someone else should I upgrade to from this we've got another one like should upgrade to a 10 900k from a 900 a night no because you don't know if you don't yeah if you don't know yourself that you need the upgrade then there's what's the point like you don't actually need it like when I upgraded to the 18 core from the 8 core Xeon I was using before I needed that upgrade I was getting slowed down in Premiere Pro niles smashing these videos together I was like yeah this is the this is the bottleneck now went to the 18 Corum and this thing is unstoppable and you don't have to ask if you mean upgrade I knew yeah and you I needed he knew there was a problem and I was Olivia now store is another thing I'm gonna be focusing on like even though I've got a really good driver samsung pro 2 terabyte in there and via me MDOT - I'm thinking like I was like I'll sand Intel like I went to this storage day and they had some of these really crazy SSDs I'm like look I'd love to try one of those in my main system for editing videos just to see the difference because I think SSDs as well as a big bottleneck for workstations and so that's why I want to test that theory though but like just trial it out because a final render time is like seriously guys final render time is like the smallest part of the equation I can think of when it comes to working most CPUs are gonna be able to do it fine like what you put your computer on render go have a cup of tea or do some other work so for me final render times really wasn't an issue even going from 8 cores to 18 cause it was all the little things in between if I've got two other folders and another application open and I got all this other stuff open I gotta be able to keep moving and keep moving smoothly and if I don't tell you yeah depending on how you have your like what are using right now for your editing rather than until system yeah in some GMT yeah so yes that's what I use and the reason why I use Intel in videos because of the CUDA acceleration in Premiere and then hardware and coding and quick sink for the for the i7 or the i9 so your i9 is a core 16 thread and your eighteen core no 618 call 36 3 right overclocked right where rightful I bet you I bet you my core i9 a core renders faster than your 18 core I wouldn't doubt that you and using quick sync yeah yeah right which is why I in which is why I would question the use of an 18 that's why I don't use the eight like I have an 18 quality because I had it Sony code x-men their CPU yeah you don't use I'm not using all that fancy hardware canucks transcoding staff man see yeah that's like they I remember the making videos like you get transcode it and I want to put on my Dmitriy voice and you could trance code it oh wait you put on the tomato sauce I can't think of the Dmitriy voice right now and get the maximum performance man I'm terrible my Dmitriy voice is off I used to be able to do it really well but now it's bad you don't have a cracker to do it Dimitri's oh god no and I'm like yeah man I'm not sitting there like transcoding 50 files like that's the bad I don't I don't do that no I just it's just rent like I just pull them on my timeline it scrubs faster because it's using the second GPU and the IGP and when I render it renders faster that's literally those are the only two things I use yeah but it I have to have HD you HD Graphics installed that's the only thing the only shops at hardware cannot who's next [Laughter] [Music] it's not necessarily all about core count if you know how to you know if you're utilizing as much of the hardware as you can that's why there is why I don't use Rison yet is because of premiere it's really stressful I would yell Tec es la I would yell it but the problem is I got a headset mic on it's it's gonna like blow the microphone off just pull off my actually should I pull it off and then I'll be off camera no you'll hear Kyle yell it from my balcony alright we'll just do it hang on just wait here oh yeah by the way I know you I know he can't hear what I'm saying right now but like he literally like it's like I gotta go take a piss he just goes right out to his balcony it just takes a piss I don't dude my name is gonna be like why call the cops this Corsair power supply light just went boom do like there was literally like a report yeah I know that all of them uh yeah they hey no ascii no getty dude that's like the whole thing with deals hunting two minutes why i tell my audience you gotta ask for stuff but like the problem is after you do it once people i mean can you say this can you say this can you say this can you say it's like not just one per episode one one curveball for the audience per episode so that's what we're stuck with I just really chat them my head's gonna be down there but also oh well we've got a like she'll these Corsair headsets for the for the stream just quickly yeah yeah I gotta get my virtuosos right so what they're called yeah so I put a pop filter on this one because I did hear a bit of popping last episode so hopefully that's all fixed I gotta watch it back afterwards and save it yeah like perfecting this thing that people were saying the audio is really good coming out of it so I like the fact that you can just move around everywhere and people can still hear you so like you could just keep moving around and a wireless option - it does it does I just I don't do anything wireless when you've got to rely on connectivity so yeah something weird happens and you get but and boy hey guys so anyway you're a beautiful man your wife is lucky what colors will be the last question of the day what kind of computer does she use what computer does mrs. sellers oh okay so she she's kind of in between bills she doesn't use a PC a lot now because of the baby but she used to use a risin seven twenty seven hundred and a fifty-seven or none at that time will be she's oh they it was a I think it was a Vega 56 a IP card I want to say so she was all AMD actually she seal okay AMD fanboy gosh she's actually girl okay yeah yeah her original system that when I met her her system had a core i7 4770k I didn't know that even existed but it's basically like a slightly lower clocked 4770k yeah and yeah she used that to play csgo when she was playing kind of going pro or whatever she was fun and yeah I kind of switched I switched to rising at a time because until it didn't really have any high core count options that were an h EDT that were running really hot yeah I mean she streamed a lot so it just made more sense all right well we've got a what sorry one more juicy question is that ASA kg 25 one key worth $60 used sounds pretty good 25 inches like relatively new I don't know the exact model but I'm gonna say yes and then we've got the super chat great work guys I love this stream of both you make awesome videos do you suggest buying any hardware now if you need an update oh man Kofi is making prices go up so it's difficult to say because usually I'm like well we know the r-tx 3000 is coming get your power supply get your stuff now because when the GPUs come out people build new systems and all that other stuff goes up but the problem is everything like the prices are all over the place now men like GPUs have gone up since two months it's like two months ago right before Christmas was actually the best time to buy those GPU prices were good like really good I'll in Australia especially SSD prices were fine and then all this is hit SSDs have gone up ramps probably gonna go up more - and so yeah I can't really tell you that one man I'm I'm delirious about it as well I got and here's the thing you know I've got guys now on Facebook marketplace here this out I figured this out this morning they followed me on marketplace and as soon as I list something they report my ads so my ad yes and my ad gets demoted to the bottom I know who you guys are now I'm aware of it thank you very much but like it's so petty bro hey I'm slay oh god like seriously the problem with Facebook marketplace 2 is it's tied to you it's tie to your profile so it's not like you can like you know make any profile or whatever start cleaning like it's all tied to your personal accounts the problem on is oh it's bogus it's bogus reports they don't have a system in place to detect spam reports like that's the problem they don't actually have a human so okay these ads this guy's ads fine let's am unit to this crap instead they've just got they allow these haters to come on board it so I'm like yeah anyway so I'll figure it all out in the next couple of weeks I got something in the process but yeah I've been listening to a bit of Rage Against the Machine know your enemy so that's good is that your medium that's not the one you use the most sell is it Facebook well yeah and marketplace is huge man that's the thing marketplace is huge and the thing about it is I'm glad it's happened in a low season anyway this is a real low season so if it happened around Christmas I'd be really annoyed because that's a really good season to be selling but now I'm play I'm grateful they've alerted me of what's going on during low season so now I've got my countermeasures coming in place baby so there you go anyway yeah but that's this this is kind of crap it's like every industry man I was looking for some car parts for my car and like there's like this companies making car parts that company's making car parts and they're all just bad-mouthing each other I'm like it doesn't matter what industry you're in what you're doing you're always in a crab pot bro and you can just never crawl out a like for every crab that's trying to get out to put pulling him back down into the crab pot man like and it's like I don't know anyway I can go on about it all day thank you guys so much for tuning in this week for the episode 2 of tech something and yeah we can love that yeah we just it's it's it's more casual I mean we talk we talk tech at the start of the episode but I'm kind of enjoying more of the free chat with the audience and yeah but that's a but of course people always want to hear our opinions on all the new stuff so new stuff is tied to the new stuff it's all tied together one big web of entanglement so I'll get a thumbnail and a timetable done after this Greg do you have anything else you want to say before we get on out of here do you want another Star Wars question oh god please no I hear one more one more what what planet I was Bail Organa the senator of a Dagobah be older on see tattoo weenie I don't even know who that is I'm just gonna say the middle one that's the second one you said be older on you got it bro you got it yes I know light I'm actually a freaking Star Wars and that's it you knew that you blow a key like I didn't know I'm very good I don't even need to watch anyway before we go as well favorite Sith and favorite Jedi Oh God okay General Grievous yep mm-hmm because he's unique the way that he can manipulate the force as like a kind of a bionic type dude and then mmm mace windu okay yeah I'm going with obi-wan and also Darth tenebrous yeah I should have said I should have said Darth Plagueis low-key Eric and tenebrous was the strongest suit ever lived low-key anyway I heard that Plagueis was the one that was able to prevent other people from dying that's the that's the tail I watched I watched episode three man I rewatched it and it's still my favorite of all time there's no way I don't I love the remakes out of crap but I actually like like what that was a real story there right I mean it was a story but it was real I thought it was a real thing I didn't know that Palpatine yeah was yeah actually yeah he actually existed oh all right Darth Plagueis yes Palpatine that's dead strip yeah that's what I'm changing my answer to yeah all right guys enjoy next yeah we'll catch you guys in the next episode tech something throw on some tech balls thanks for my man Greg for tuning in and we will catch you next time I say it can I say yeah but just wait I'll get us a as well in terms of when the streams come out it's just when me and Greg have time to do them and so they're like there's no set date set time it's just like hey we want to stream for you guys and talk about tech and just try to be more yeah we'll try to be more consistent but I think yeah anyway you can do the outro go for it alright peace out for now boy now one more time dude we gotta get a bit more did you say like do like do like before we go still like a little bit like hey I just got upstairs for a live straight like give us a little bit of a prologue yeah pretty little to this well we appreciate you guys are watching a live stream already start tackling more crocodiles out in the alleyway in Wallabies they say watch out for the dingoes eat your babies happens all the time I hear you do it you end it you gotta end up alright guys alright so I'm gonna do it okay so yeah guys it just got back from up north and I just couldn't stand the people up there you know like they just telling me like yo you got to get this ninety nine hundred K and I was like no I've got it yet like a twenty six hundred for that budget anyway guys with that all out of the way I'll catch in the next live stream very soon peace out for now bye
