in a recent episode of can yes fix it i got donated an x58 dual socket motherboard and also two x 56 77 4 core xeons these are actually the high clocked variants which come in with a pretty high base clock of over 3.4 gigahertz so what we're going to have is eight cores in total and 16 threads and also 16 gigabytes of registered ddr3 memory however when i got this bought in first it initially didn't work and so i had to give it some tech yes loving and this time around we uh put it under the sink and actually washed it off and then dried it and it miraculously came back to life and that was a good thing because i didn't want to waste this whole combo and now that we got it working i'm going to put it to some good use and then we're going to be doing a whole computer build with this motherboard these two cpus and the ram however before we do that there is some concerns going in and that is this motherboard has two uh sockets on them with the screws coming out so they're not the traditional x58 mounting brackets and so what i'm gonna do is since i do have two dead x-58 boards around here i'm going to use the actual pin socket holders from those and put them on this motherboard and that way we'll hopefully be able to then mount two normal budget coolers on this motherboard also on top of that since i don't want to be really spending a whole lot of money on a really expensive power supply i'm going to be testing out both the 8 pin connectors with individual 4 pins which is what a typical say 600 watt power supply will be able to do and if we're able to do that then we'll couple it in a whole build with an nzxt h510 and putting some rgb on this thing and blinging it out with an rx 5500 xt because i feel something like this could go well with a budget graphics card like the 5500 xt though that aside i still do have to go and do all this testing make sure everything works and if it does work then i'm going to be heading down to the hardware store and getting some stuff like coolers and also a power supply for this build so we can hopefully complete it so basically that's my cue to get in the yes mobile and get this crack of lacking [Music] so on both fronts we managed to get a success story in that we've now got holes here to mount uh typical coolers on this motherboard and also the two four pins individually worked in both sockets so we'd be able to buy something like a 600 watt power supply and still get away with using this whole build in tandem of two cpus and 600 watts is still going to be absolutely plenty since both these cpus aren't going to be overclocked and we're only using a 5500 xt which doesn't use a whole lot of power in itself now with that aside let's get to the store and get all the rest of the pieces that we need for this build [Music] so we just got back from the store and ended up picking up two of these they're called the arctic storm 3 they're 35 aussie dollars each so i will say that the snowman is usually my first pick i've actually got some being delivered but they're going to take around another week to get here and so i do want to put this build together now but i also want to try this cooler actually right here because it looks pretty much identical to the snowman except they've put a ring blade rgb fan on so 35 aussie dollars versus around 25 aussie dollars for what you'll pay for a snowman rgb from aliexpress that's the price you pay that 10 premium for not being patient times two which is 20 aussie dollars though we got the drives here 40 aussie dollars for this combo here 120 gigabyte ssd one terabyte backup hard drive and then we've got this power supply here quite interesting because i've never tried a power supply from gamdia's before though it's coming in at 69 aussie dollars so a little under 50 usd and it's got rgb which is going to glow out the bottom and it's a bronze rated power supply and i spoke to the guy at the store and i said look how many of you sold and he said quite a few and i said have any come back and he said no so that usually to me is a decent sign i guess gambias are trying to make a name for themselves and it's got 47 amps on the 12 volt line there so that will be more than enough to power this whole build here and in terms of the total build i'll put a price of usd and aud prices up for you guys so you can tally up how much i've paid here today for all these components and it comes i think a little bit over 600 aussie dollars which would be a little bit over 400 usd that with that aside let's put this thing together and see what we come up with [Music] [Music] [Music] so we're building this pc and i realized we've come into some trouble in paradise here that's easily fixed but it does add cost to the bill which i'm not too happy with but anyway two usb ports on the rear and that's all we've got i mean we do have front usb out as well but there's only one usb port on the front of this well there's a type c as well but this motherboard doesn't support type c though how we're going to fix this is since there's no onboard audio as well we're going to add in a budget fx sound card from creative you can pick these up pretty cheap and it's also got a front panel out audio connector so you'll be able to hook up that front panel audio out connector just in there which this motherboard doesn't have that either and then for the usb ports limited usb ports we're going to solve that by adding a hub which isn't really the best solution but it is one regardless because if you do load these up with too many usb devices and they're draining too much power then it won't the devices just simply won't work but we're also going to add in usb 3. so since this motherboard is x58 error we're going to be solving that by adding in a pcie solution with usb 3 and i had to give this some techies loving because i found it around it was pretty dirty i don't know where i got this or when i got this but hopefully it works [Music] so we've now completed the build and we're trying to install windows but since there's only two usb ports we're going to just use the keyboard and the usb boot but the build looks pretty good though we've got some double trouble in paradise in that i think the usb 3 card that i put in is causing it to have some boot issues and so i'm going to take that out now but while i'm at it i'm also going to reroute this pcie cable from out the bottom there where it's got that little slot i think they'd look a little bit cleaner and also got to reseat the memory since it's only showing with 12 gigabytes of memory at the moment in the bios and now we are finally cleared and good to go and ready to install our games and do some other tests but this was actually a bit confusing in that there's a few things you need to know if you want to go down this super micro x58 route and that is initially when you want to set everything up you're going to have to use the onboard vga connector and not change any settings in the box install your windows get everything set up all your drivers install your graphics card drivers and then after that you can then go into windows and you have to you can disable the onboard vga via the device manager and then in your actual display settings you can show it only on the graphics card itself because what we can see here is this vga onboard graphics is never going away it's always going to remain there and it's going to remain there in device manager too so you can circumvent it and get around it because its max resolution is like hard locked at 768 pixels or something it's not even like full colors as well this thing is ancient but i mean that's not super micros fault they never really intended for some aussie check yes city youtuber years later be using server motherboard with like the latest and greatest graphics card but anyway that aside if you guys want to get this all working you've got to understand that there will be that problem where if you go into the bios and then you change that bios setting to the off board vga and that will enable this then to be the main card where it boots up to the bios screen off the graphics card that will then make your pc not boot via usb not voot not boot via sata not boot by any other devices it'll just pretty much hard lock it and also if you change that bios jumper that we showed before and you set it to disabled that'll also disable your graphics card from showing a signal too so the only way to get this working as we said before is to use the vga connector initially set everything up and then once you're all set up and good to go you can then plug it off your graphics card what this is going to do now is that means that you essentially will boot into windows and it'll be all black before that so once it boots into windows it'll then be like okay graphics card's good to go and the good thing is is our usb 3 add-in card is working and also our sound card is working 100 so this build is good to go now it just took a little while to get there though the reason i think it has this problem is because this legacy card here like a really old graphics card gtx 580 and before they will work fine like you can go off board vga and then it'll boot fine still it's just the newer graphics cards have the updated v biases on them and that causes issues on a lot of these older boards and in this case yes the 5500 xt with that newer bios and the fact that it's a newer gpu and if you've got like a gtx 1660 super or something like that you would still have the same problem in booting up so this is the only way around it really to get these two cpus on this board working on a modern day scenario so hopefully that answers that question if you guys are having troubles like i've had here in the studio that's the only way around it that'll solve it and let's finally get these games installed and do some benchmarking [Music] and finally we are at the good news after all that tinkering and all that problem sorting we now have a setup that's capable of streaming at both 1080p and 1440p so the first game we ran through here is fortnite which when i sell pcs this is easily the most common game that people want to know information about so naturally i do a lot of testing for it anyway going through the fps on this title straight up when we compare it to a 9900k we're really only losing about 10 fps on epic settings at both 1080p and 1440p though stepping it down to the pro settings i think this is what the pros use that's when everything's on low 100 screen resolution with a view distance of epic we saw here the fps picked up to 194 at 1080p and then 166 at 1440p so the 5500 xt and this dual xeon x5677 setup was more than capable of playing this game with even a 144 hertz monitor and the funny thing was is that the memory on this is still only in dual channel because we wanted to utilize all that registered memory that we got in the previous can yes fix it episode that was donated to the channel and if we stepped it up to triple channel we probably get a little bit more fps but also the maximum speeds of this memory and this motherboard unfortunately is only 133 megahertz so if you had some faster memory it would kind of be pointless on this motherboard since it does max out at that megahertz setting now that being said we still got a very smooth experience and when we set it up with obs because we had the second 19-inch monitor we were able to utilize this because these can pretty much be had for like 10 or 20 dollars or sometimes you can even get them for free because people just throw them out and the beautiful thing about it is it has both a vga and display port connector and now where this ties in perfectly with this dual xeon setup is that we have to use that vga output as we said before when we diagnose that problem to initially start up the computer if we want to get into the bios but once we're in windows we can disable that vga port off the motherboard and then also uh set it to the monitor to use the display port off the graphics card so now once we boot up the pc we've still got access to the bus and then once we move over we've still got access to two monitors in windows 10 and so everything is now working pretty smooth and pulling up some of those numbers on what you can expect with a 1080p and 1440p on these pro settings whilst you're streaming with obs is that we got a 146 average fps at 1080p and then stepping up to 1440p we got 126 average fps and the one percent lows were actually pretty good as well though moving it over to the cpu setting so if you wanted to say like look we've got eight core 16 threads it's easily able to handle a 5500 xt and you want to change those encoding settings in obs then doing that we actually saw lower fps at both 1080p and 1440p and you guys can be the judge on which quality setting looks better does the amd 5500xt encoder look better or does the software x264 with the very fast preset look better let us know in the comments section below but for what it's worth this whole setup here is easily geared up towards playing fortnite with smooth frame rates though how well can this setup perform in other titles we'll move over to strange brigade we saw here 83 average fps at 1080p with max settings and this is with the 5500 xt versus the i9 9900k we're only losing out by 4 fps so there's not really a benefit of going out and buying a cpu that will pretty much cost more than this whole setup put together and then moving up to 1440p we saw a 3fps difference though moving over to shadows of the tomb raider here we saw a difference of again roughly 2fps at 1080p where we still got some very playable frame rates with this is the max settings as well 62 average fps and then stepping up to 1440p we've got 41 average fps versus 43. so this setup right here the dual xeon x56 77s and also the 5500 xt does go hand in hand pretty well now of course 5500 xt isn't the best value for money graphics card out there at the moment but it is pretty power efficient which is probably one of the few reasons why i decided to go with this build today and use everything because i wanted something that looked really good but also the power consumption numbers would stay low since those dual cpus and that big motherboard will chew up a bit more power but here's the really good news the power meter even while we're playing fortnite we only saw a roughly around 330 watts utilization which is actually really good but there is one drawback and that is that the idle power consumption is around 180 watts and so this was the last architecture where they had those high idle consumption numbers because after that with sandy bridge they learned to drop it down a lot more and save a lot more power but not to worry because the whole build cost really didn't total that much at all and we've got something that honestly i would be very happy playing games like cs go dota 2 and fortnite and streaming them with really smooth fps though the last thing to go over with this whole setup is the temperatures which were actually pretty good i was thinking i would have to add in two uh ring fans at the front but i realized after i started testing out the temperatures here they were absolutely fine the gpu was going max around into the low 70 degrees while still playing games the cpus were surprisingly in the 50 degree region while we're playing games and even when i stress tested them with ida 64 the max temperatures that we saw were in the mid 70s so they were very well under control the motherboard chipset heatsink uh this was a little bit worrisome because usually with a motherboard like this they're running low powered xeon so the strain on the chipset as well would naturally be a bit lower but i tested out the temperatures and although the heatsink does get pretty hot it's still fine for this architecture where i was going around 60 degrees constant so if you were worried about that you could put a fan on it but after those seeing those temperatures and the fact that we're in summer here in australia i really wasn't that cause for concern once you start going over say 75 degrees on that chipset heatsink then you should start really worrying about putting some cooling on it but for what it's worth it's absolutely fine for now so the best thing though coming out of all this is that you can hear that we're in fortnite at the moment gpu is pretty much getting maxed out and everything like that and the cpu is still getting strained and the noise on this whole build is surprisingly really low so at the end of the day we've got something that runs games really nice it can stream it's also looking really good and the noise is really low and that's about it for this whole setup do let us know in the comments section below what you think of making the most of a donated motherboard with two cpus and some ram getting it back to life and then turning it into something like this and what i'll do quickly is if you want to do something like this with a super micro x58 season motherboard then the problems that we came into was those motherboard sockets initially they had the screw holes coming out and so we had to replace them and we were lucky that we had uh two dead x-58 motherboards lying around we were able to use those sockets and then mount some pretty cool rgb bling-worthy coolers on board so that was the first problem we came into then after that the second problem we came into was that on-board vga setting in the bios where if we turned it to default off-board graphics it then gave us problems where it wouldn't boot at all and so that was a second problem to be wary of and so the way to circumvent this is get yourself a cheap budget vga monitor and if it's got two inputs then you can use the other input off your graphics card and when things boot up you're all good to go it's like nothing ever happened but the third problem we came into was when we're in windows that on-board vga is enabled even if you disable in device manager it just shows up still for some odd reason so what you have to do is disable it in display settings and once that's turned off you're good to go and another downside is since this is a server motherboard it didn't have enough usb ports on board in fact it only had two usb 2 outs so we did fix this by adding a usb 3 add-in which gave us the two additional usb ports and on top of that it also adds usb 3 now to this system which is the old school x58 there's also the need for a sound card since we had no on-board audio with this motherboard too but the good thing is the option like the one we used here today the creative fx that's got a 5.1 out it's also got a front panel audio out and the audio sounds really good on this particular sound card but then the last problem and i shouldn't say it's really a problem it's just the limitation of the motherboard is those 1333 megahertz speeds so setting this thing up is tedious but in the end once it all works it seems like it's working properly now the phantom gaming nzxt h510 case this thing is a looker it's actually really nice i was surprised because i thought i would have definitely had to have added fans in but these two exhaust fans do a really good job of keeping the temperatures down but that's mainly in part due to the fact that we have two massive coolers on the cpus they don't put out a whole lot of heat as we saw with those power consumption figures before and we've got the 5500 xt which in itself doesn't use up a whole lot of power either i've done a review of these 5500 xt's if you want to see that i'll put the link up here for you guys but at the end of the day we've got something now that is worthy of someone who wants to become a fortnight baller so let us know in the comments section though if you had this whole set up would you do some things differently love reading your thoughts and opinions as always or are you just digging what i've done here in today's video but speaking of thoughts and opinions we have the question of the day which comes from bok torinator and they ask should i sell my 1070 ti and get one of these and they're talking about the previous video we did the 5600 xt review i'll put the link also for that up here where i wouldn't personally recommend um it'd be pretty much a side grade going from a 1070 ti to a 5600 xt but basically the 1070 ti at least from what i'm computing all up here even though i haven't recently tested it it should be pretty much very similar in performance to a 5600 xt especially if you overclock it since the 5600 xt with those uv blasters they're essentially an overclocked card out of the box now you'll get pretty much similar performance so it's not really worth it to sell your 1070 ti and get a 5600 xt because they'll have pretty similar encoders on board for streaming and whatnot and you'll also have eight gigabytes of vram versus six on the 5600 xt but you will have a more power efficient gpu i believe with the 5600 xt but yeah basically not really worth it that's just my opinion though with that aside i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon and stay tuned because what we're going to be doing in the next video is testing these two cpus out with that elusive bios setting the pneuma setting and we're going to see what it does to fps well i'm going to throw in a couple of cpu bound titles and see what we get if we disable it versus keeping it enabled so if you want to see that the moment it drops and you're not yet subbed then you can hit that sub button ring that bell to get the videos as soon as it drops here at texas city and i'll see you in the next one very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
