A few weeks ago we did a video on this power supply right here, which i bought off an ebay listing where nearly 300 people had bought this exact power supply. (and that's just off one listing) and we checked out the power supply i'll put the link to that video up here where it turned out to be a very poor power supply nothing like you would expect from an actual 650 WATT power supply however since then i have conversed with game max quite a lot over emails they claim that this and after actually talking to them quite a bit they initially said it wasn't a gamemax power supply but then i said to them basically things like the sticker on the fan inside the power supply looked like a game max sticker and they said well they tracked their orders and they figured they said that basically the company that bought these power supplies uh in australia they'd essentially ordered 350 watt and 450 watt power supplies and then we're essentially re putting the stickers taking the original game max stickers off and then putting on the vp6 50 watt uh power supply stickers that they made up on their own and as it stands i'm actually on the side of game max after looking into this a lot more where the other seller that i bought this power supply off i've tried calling him over numerous days and they just haven't gotten back to me furthermore game max have said that they have stepped up legal involvement and they wish to pursue that against this particular company hello no one is available to take your call please call again hello no one is available hello let me tell you something that is available though and that is the b550 tai chi razor edition from asrock featuring a 16 phase vrm 60 amp chokes 2 oz copper pcb and all that rgb bling to go with it links in description below to find out more but in the meantime it does make me think what is going on with this power spline how did this ever happen because i made the video based on the pretense and this is the thing i'm always going to make content where you guys the viewers come first and when i see complete lies in an ad i'm going to pull that up now there will be some good news here and there will be some obvious recommendations for game max going forward but i do want to apologize as well to game max and say i'm sorry that i didn't follow up directly with the company i just thought when it comes to distributors and suppliers they generally have a very tight relationship and for something like this with a power supply like this to get passed through under a brand's name and actually be a completely different product is a different story altogether so what we're gonna do in game max i said they said to me like what how can we rectify this situation i just said look guys i'm going to do a little bit more digging i'm going to hear both sides of the story and then i'm going to make another follow-up video where and if you can please supply the power supplies that i was meant to be testing in that video so they were kind enough to send us over two of their 600 watt power supplies here the vp series they said look our vp series especially once you go above the 350 watt and 450 watt power supplies they do get a lot better for normal gaming pcs and when we said in that original video what we looked at was that i said at the end of that video that i thought it was a 350 watt power supply so they seem to confirm that and say look you're pretty much right on the money there it does look like it was indeed a 350 watt or 450 watt power supply they just put a fake sticker of the brand name and the actual uh specifications for the so-called vp650 now another thing that does confuse me was that there was actually no vp650 ever made from game max but this is the thing where companies in the past do make particular products for retail and they do make particular products for business to business this is nothing new a lot of different companies in the industry will do this for instance if you guys know c sonic or superflower they'll actually make a lot of power supplies for different companies and then they'll have their own retail models that they released to the customer themselves so one thing i noticed on this original box too is that the label here was actually a sticker over where game act would originally put their specifications for their power supplies and lo and behold this sticker does come off and it does reveal the original models here printed on the side of the box so there's one more piece of evidence that i'm going to show you guys now to say that i think gay max is in the clear though this test i'm going to do this before we even get into testing these power supplies this will be the test that i'm going to do to personally know a hundred percent if game max is in the clear or if this other company is in the clear and that's we're just going to simply peel off this sticker and actually we're going to look at the way that the sticker peels off so this sticker here it just peeled off ridiculously easy so what we're going to try now is peel off the sticker of this power supply right here so when we peeled off these power supply labels this one was definitely a different type of peel as to this one here and i'm talking about the strength and resistance because that means they used essentially a different company or a different way of making these logos right here this one also feels a little bit flimsier and the most important thing is this is actually on a different spot of the power supply whereas opposed to this one was originally on the side of the power supply right here so as it stands in this point in time i'm inclined to believe game max 100 in that they said look it was a 350 or 450 watt power supply we don't know exactly which one it was because we sent over different cartons of that and they actually used the same box the box is pretty much identical to the vp series on the 600 watt so how game max will do it is they'll make the same box for a heap of different power supplies and then just mark it as that particular power supply so that's really sad that this can happen with such strict consumer laws that we have here in australia it's also sad that this can go on and on for months but we will talk about that later and the recourse available in the meantime let's finally put this 600 watt to the test with the gtx 3070 against say a power supply like gold rated 850 watt power supply and then we'll put it against this original power supply here just to see the stark contrast and also things like the ripple which we can actually measure on the new 3000 series cards and now the first power supply up on the test system is our baseline power supply this is the dq850 from deepcool we're testing it with the rtx 3070 with combustor and we're using the rtx 3070s inbuilt sensor just to manage rip uh to actually monitor ripple here with a monitoring program and we see here the worst case scenario it starts off and it's got uh basically has a thing called v droop that's pretty much a common thing if you're putting a load on the cpu or gpu but what we're measuring in between that is once the load stabilizes we can see here the voltages from essentially peak to the lowest point and the more flat this line is the better the power supply is in terms of delivering more stable consistent power in that there's a thing called or it's minimizing ripple or ripple suppression so what we see here with the deep cool is that we've got 26 millivolts it goes from 11.919 volts to 11.945 that's what we measured so a difference there of 26 millivolt also from the wall with this system with a 5800 x 32 gigabytes of ram we were using 356 watts from the wall during this test so that's essentially our baseline this is a good power supply i've tested this before i know it's good let's move on now to the vp600 and we're going to do the first we'll do the standard version that game max sent over then we'll do the rgb version then last we'll finish off with the power supply we used in the original video to see how that fares and here's the vp600 after running these tests the power supply is actually doing really well it's getting about 385 watts from the wall so it's not um it's only using about 20 watts less than the gold rated power supply that we used uh ripple suppression is about 44 millivolts of ripple so it's not doing as good as the job as the deep cool did but i mean for a budget power supply it's checking out i mean the bronze efficiency that they've put on the box does look like it's legit and also the ripple isn't too bad i mean 44 millivolt isn't the best it's nothing to go crazy about but at the same time it's nothing to go crazy about in a negative way too so this one's coming in as expected uh let's put the rgb power supply up now on the bench and give that another i'm giving these by the way i'm doing this for about 20 minutes at a time and uh just letting it run so as to saturate everything and see what numbers we see here also another thing is too is that we will get um v droop as well when we do these tests initially but what we're looking for is the consistent voltage when it's running so vp600 the actual legit one isn't too bad and the rgb version the vp600 essentially it looks like it's got the same amperage on the 12 volt line with 40 amps however because we're adding in an rgb fan for the bling and we're also using modular cables especially on the gpu this is scored in a lot worse than the vp600 without the thrills on board and we got here 11.814 ranging all the way up to 11.892 so that's actually quite a sizable difference in ripple here of 78 millivolts if my calculations are correct which is a lot worse than the 44 millivolt that we had on the standard edition that we just tested before so if anything personally i'm going to say like if you're after a game max power supply just keep it simple don't go for this fancy stuff even though i do like the all-slave black cables 78 millivolt roughly 80 millivolt is kind of getting into that territory of this power supply is not going to be good especially if you want to do a little bit of overclocking on your rtx 3070 which it's more than capable of doing from the wall we got roughly the same power going up to 387 watts and of course that's to do with the rgb leds on the fan there the difference between before and after but when it comes to the actual lowest point of the ripple that's not going to increase the power per se so let's move on now to our last one and that was the vp 350 which was badged by some australian company and trying to scam people we're going to get on to that and see how that performs in this test and lastly here is the 350 or 450 watt we will never know but this power supply went up to 433 watts on the exact same tests here so it is a lot uh less efficient than the other power supplies we have featured in today's video but at least it's not smoking up like it did in the original video we did but that time we were straining the cpu and a heavier graphics card too at the time so we did see more of a load but this time around the millivolt range here has gone to 84 so again you're reaching that level of poor and i mean similar to the vp600 rp rgb but i mean the vp600 standard did do better so with these results we can pretty much give you guys a conclusion now and let you know about game max power supplies and after testing those three power supplies out i can say that the method that i got going on here is a little bit interesting where we're using the new rtx input sensors to measure ripple i think did nvidia ever intend for their graphics cards to be power supply testers that's a funny thing but definitely it beats paying like a few thousand dollars on proper gear to test power supplies but the results speak for themselves here today and that is that the budget power supply that we tested out in the original video that we did was something of a real budget power supply should only really put them in office pcs at best as we saw with the ripple there and as we saw with them being properly a 350 watt power supply but the thing is i would have never imagined that a company would import power supplies and then change the label over and try and deceive people and that's the biggest thing for me is that i i got really angry in the first video and i do apologize to gay max for that and i can't apologize enough i should have definitely messaged them initially and just said hey is this your power supply that's being sold here but i've never heard of a company ripping off a company that's not really that popular to begin with but regardless the company that did this they're basically scamming people and i just hate scamming period and because i see enough of it going on nowadays especially since covert i've seen so much scamming going on that it's just it's so bad imagine a world where you're scamming people everyone's scamming each other right you go down the supermarket and they instead of selling you fresh meat they put a fake label on their fake used by you go home you get sick you then can't perform your job but even then you go to your job and you're so sick you can't perform but you're saying you work the whole world if we did this scamming route it would just be so chaotic so that's why i'm always against scamming and don't get me wrong there's a big difference between scamming and getting ripped off if you're getting ripped off you know what you're getting you go to the apple store you go buy an iphone you're getting ripped off but at least you know what you're getting you've got the specifications there for that iphone you're handing over the money but the thing is with this power supply what makes it so bizarre is it was never a 650 watt it was a 350 watt but it was from game max and it was a game max power supply in the end and if there's any feedback for game max that comes out of this and that is basically this power supply was up for sale for so long which i think if i'd have to justify why i did the video originally i'd have to say that because that power supply was up for so long and so many people knew about it i didn't think that gay max would not see that and then message the seller for them to take it down which i did start to see things unfold and that is as soon as i released the video game max did issue a cease and desist to that uh company and then the sad thing is and the most saddest thing is is that the company has then just gone and changed the listing around they've still got what they're calling a 650 watt power supply for sale and i i mean who do we contact in australia to stop this because what i bought was an absolute scam and i know that 280 other people that bought that listing before it changed over they got scammed as well and i mean how many other people got scammed locally on shop fronts and whatnot the list goes on but if i was working at game max i would just from now on maybe run around and do a scan on ebay and popular platforms like amazon just to make sure that that seller is selling your product and you know that you've shipped them that particular product because gay max did say to me in the email we only shipped them 350 and 450 watt power supplies so if there's anything that comes out of this video it's hopefully that game max can police their resellers a little bit better but at the same time there's one thing that we've always got to be careful of out there and that is just people trying to scam innocent people out of a dollar and that's never going to change i think as time goes on it's only going to get worse and worse and so that's why i'm telling you guys when something looks too good to be true it usually is and so with this power supply that i bought originally it wasn't the real deal well it kind of was but just with a different label slapped on and it ended up not being able to power a rig properly to the point where smoking in the previous video but then in this video it did show that it was even leaps and bounds behind that of the entry-level vp600 series from game mags themselves though if anything game max power supplies the two that i've tested here that came in the vp600 without the rgb without the cables and without all the extra bling on it that is doing better than the one with rgb and so when it comes to power supplies i would suggest maybe not going with an rgb power supply just because you're paying for extras that in this case was actually detrimental to performance which in this case was around 44 millivolt versus 80 millivolt on the vp600 rgb so i'm not sure what is happening there but basically the vp600 rgb i wouldn't recommend it seeing these results but the vp600 coming in at the right price point i can definitely say that that will do well on budget rigs anyhow hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us and if you have any questions or comments about this whole gay max situation then be sure to hit us up with a question in the comment section below speaking of questions we do have here the question of the day which comes from ras scalpium 2009 and they asked well another possible outcome is the aaa titles requiring a thousand dollars of hardware to run may become a thing of the past perhaps more graphically modest games that more people have access to will become the norm video gaming is now mainstream entertainment why not write games to appeal to the masses as opposed to the enthusiast so i'll put the link where this video was talking to up here but basically it's in relation to latest games like cyberpunk coming out where a lot of people can't run that versus games like fortnite dota 2 and even now i've been playing starcraft and i think this trend is definitely mainstream it's not it's something that's coming into effect and a lot of game developers are jumping on it but there is one detriment to that and that is i feel like some of the depth in some of these games just isn't there where we look at cyberpunk and the story that i had i really enjoyed that but if we look at a game like fortnite there's not a whole lot out of just jumping into a battleground and then playing it out with 99 other people but if i look at a game like starcraft 2 i really enjoyed that had the story but it also had the continuance of multiplayer but one thing i've noticed with sc2 is that they've started to bring skins in they've made it free to play so this business model of making something free to play and then just adding in the ascetics on the characters that's definitely something that's going to come into effect basically saying to the players if our game's popular and you want to play it a lot and make yourself custom in this game then you've got to pay money for it as opposed to just playing the game and getting into it for nothing i do like this model and i think going forward it's going to work a lot better and that being said of course the game developers are going to want to make these games for pretty much all the hardware out there but that of course will be to the detriment of graphics and improving graphics as time goes on but for me personally graphics have always come second to game play i think that's the most important thing that i look for in a game and that is just enjoying what the developers made in terms of the game itself anyway i hope that answers that question i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell on the way out and i'll see you next time peace out for now bye [Music] [Music] you
