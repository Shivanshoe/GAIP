gtx 1080 this is one of my favorite used cards on the market at the moment because it's not as bad as a price as say a gtx 1660 super which this will perform better and it will cost less on that market but if we look on the other side of the fence here we've got the rtx 3060 which is coming in stock and the miners are not targeting this as much as say an rtx 3060 ti or an rtx 3070. so both these cards i would consider better choices for gamers even though the prices are still well above especially in the case of the 3060 msrp in the case of the gtx 1080 this was released over six years ago at a shelf price of 599 usd but we'll talk about prices and problems a little bit later and i've even done some under vaulting on both of these graphics cards to see where the sweet spot lies for you gamers so let's take a look at those gaming benchmark numbers [Music] so getting into those 1080p numbers for you guys this is max settings apex legends we've got here 139 average fps versus a 112 on the gtx 1080 now the funny thing about these differences here is that we also get pretty smooth one percent lows and 0.1 percent lows on both the 1080 and the 3060. moving over to horizon zero dawn a title that definitely if you put it on ultra settings like we've done here stresses both these graphics cards we can see that the rtx 3060 does have a comfortable lead ahead of the 1080 and then moving over to f1 2020 and the one percent lows are also moving in tandem to those average fps differences and then another one that we decided to throw in the mix here was pub g and here's where we got 143 average fps versus 168. though the 0.1 lows on this game even years later after this has been launched it still leaves a little bit to be desired with where it was getting i guess down to the 40s even though it's ok for smooth gameplay it's still a bit behind some of those other competitive titles and then moving on to the last title here we have tested out shadow of the tomb raider 119 average fps versus 99 so there is about a raw 20 increase when it comes to gaming though switching things over to synthetic benchmarks like fire strike extreme shows that the gtx 1080 even the msi armor version which was considered a budget choice for a 1080 this was getting 10 182 graphics points versus 10 060 so actually scoring a victory over the rtx 3060 now i've also decided to throw in the under vaulting numbers here because it's going to be an important point that i'm going to make with the under vaulting where i feel like both these cards can benefit greatly from under vaulting moving over to time spy extreme and we've got 3392 on the 1080 versus 4060 on the rtx 3060 and then went under vaulting 3289 versus 3938 now moving on to the power consumption numbers if you wish to undervolt the best tool i use is msi afterburner and then i use river tuna to monitor the power consumption itself and then i also double check that with from the wall power consumption figures where you just whatever these numbers spit out on the software you cannot fake from the wall numbers they are the real numbers that you just look to to see if the under voltage actually working and here is where we had 173 watts versus 163 watts direct draw and then 304 from the wall versus 286 so they were performing pretty similar in terms of power consumption on both the out of the wall figures and the direct monitoring results so if you guys want to undervolt your rtx 3000 or even your gtx 1080 i will link a video up here where you can check it out and then it's pretty easy to do with afterburner and you will get not only lower power consumption numbers but you will get lower temperatures and even then lower noise if your fans are on auto fan speeds out of both these cards so really good to see that both these cards do benefit from under vaulting and it's something that i've actually been taking notice of where i undervolt my own graphics card in my main personal rig because i just enjoy the benefits of that so much but what we're going to see right here with this rtx 3060 this is the azus tough edition this is the version 2 of the rtx 3060 meaning that they have cut down the hash rate performance from the hardware itself so there are people talking about getting around it getting it up to 70 percent roughly of the original hash rates that you would find on the uh non-hashrate versions or in this case the v1 with that uh driver that was released ages ago from nvidia themselves but it's good to see that this still has a crypto mining limit on it for ethereum which is the main player in town even though some people are moving to different crypto currencies i like the fact that this does have some protection just to make sure that it's getting in the hands of gamers to put it bluntly the crypto miners are pretty much pricing out gamers and then gamers are simply not getting involved in pc gaming anymore so as the market expands for crypto mining the market for gamers is actually contracting and so there's a balance to all things but at least this kind of puts the balance at least a little bit back in the favor of the gamer it makes this card a little bit more desirable for gamers versus crypto miners in terms of gtx 1080 that fares a little bit better but again since the prices of the graphics cards have all gone up across the board the gamers will then balance out prices on other cards like the 1080 because the other cards have simply gone up way too much in price so that contracting market means it's just higher prices across all the gpus in the section so it really does suck if you're a gamer right now but at least these two cards if you were to get into pc gaming would be two of the better solutions available for you and speaking of better solutions this is the tough version which is one of the best when it comes to getting the best value out of any rtx 3000 series card where in the past we tested the 3080 at least before it got jacked up in prices and that was the tough series was pretty much a home run from a zeus this is no different with the 360 v2 where we're looking at the fan speeds and i'll pull up the graph for you fan speeds of 59 out of the box the noise was just pretty much non-existent it was whisper quiet and the temperatures were impressive 56 degrees and then we look at the 80 percent fan speeds that's 39 decibels and that came in at 50 degrees and the last is a hundred percent with 48 decibels and 47 degrees and this is all in 24 degrees celsius ambient environment so either leaving it on stock fan speeds at 59 or moving to 80 percent fan speeds would be either the two best choices so if you don't mind a little bit of noise 80 is going to be good if you don't like noise at all the auto fan speeds are going to be absolutely phenomenal though some other features to look at is you have a bioswitch between performance mode and quiet mode in this case if you want quiet mode just under vault the card manually you're going to get much better temperatures and much better performance if you do that even though it's always handy to have a backup bios on the card and then move over to the rear this is something azus and also gigabyte do very well on their rtx 3000 series cards and that is they implement two hdmi 2.1s then you've also got those original three display ports and then lastly we've got the rgb which is just above the top gaming logo and all in all you've got pretty big dimensions of this cooler i'll put them up on the screen and then you've got a single 8 pin pcie which if we saw the power consumption out of the box around 160 watts that's way less than an 8 pin can handle so it's absolutely fine and the final difference between these two cards of course the rtx 3060 does get those newer features like dlss 2.0 and the ray tracing though most games aren't really taking advantage of either of these texts though i find dlss 2.0 to be a big benefit if the game does take advantage of it anyhow that wraps it up with the gtx 1080 versus the rtx 3060 v2 if you guys enjoyed today's video and be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comments section below which of these would you be more inclined to purchase in the current market and why love reading your thoughts and opinions as always for me it's always about price the lower the cards come down the more i'm likely to buy them in the case of the 1080 picking this up for around 400 aussie dollars which makes it around 300 usd is a very solid choice in this market but it is hard to get those deals these are local deals that i'm picking this up on and then in terms of the rtx 3060 i'm actually finding from some of the retailers around the gold coast here i can pick these up under a thousand aussie dollars which is still pretty expensive they'll make it around the low 700 usd but we do pay tax here so if you're in the us you would be wanting to get these under 650 us dollars if you can and that's still double the msrp of what they'll promise that but i know there's a few guys out there that just want to play pc games and both these cards will do a great job at 1080p even 1440p if you want to lower some of the settings but all in all we just got to keep on smiling because we are one day closer to the inevitable crash and when that comes it will be raining gpus my friends do not worry it will come and when it comes i'm going to be reporting on it in mass for you guys until that time we just have to deal with the great gravis cards but just the psyche prices but speaking of something that's not so sucky we've got the question of the day here which comes from jez and jez's question comes with the six core ryzen 5 3600 this time six scores 12 threads and it is overclockable now i am going to pay attention to the overclocking portion because i feel like there's two recommendations to be made here out of the box i'd pair this with a max and rtx 3070 but if you're into overclocking especially on both the ram and the cpu and you know what you're doing then even an rtx 3080 especially higher resolutions is going to be great with a ryzen 5 3600 i feel like the only thing that's going to let you down on the ryzen 5 3600 would be at 1080p and you're a competitive gamer and you're going for the max fps but even then if you knew how to overclock you can definitely get a lot out of that cpu so there's really no cap to this cpu if you know how to overclock it but if you're not going to overclock it a great gpu to couple with it is either a 6700 xt or an rtx 3070 or on the used market maybe an rtx 2080 super i was going to say a 5700 xt but we're not even going to go there that is one of the high priority cards for those roi crypto miners anyhow guys i'll catch you in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to smash that sub button ring that bell and i'll see you next time peace out for now but hey
