in the description below let's get back to the video I'll Express is an online
retailer that was launched back in 2010 and it's very similar to Amazon and also
eBay but there are some key differences the first being that essentially it's
only a Buy It Now website where unlike eBay they have their bidding system as
well as also having the offer system that our Express doesn't have but also
differs from Amazon in the Amazon has its own products that it sells directly
to the public press is essentially only a third-party
reseller platform now alex press is actually owned by the Alibaba Group who
is in the top 10 companies worldwide the only other Chinese company in this list
is 10 cent who have their footings in things like Epic Games so if you play
fortnight and you buy skins and spend money on this game some of that money is
going to one of these top 10 companies though the big differences between
Aliexpress Alibaba and also Te'o bear which are all owned by the same company
is that Alibaba is actually business to consumer and business to business where
as opposed to I'll Express that focuses on the single end customer so you just
buying one thing you may be buying a few things but it's really not for business
to business and then Te'o Barrow is actually very similar to I'll Express
where it's essentially the version that's in Chinese for China mainland as
opposed to al Express which is for the Western world and actually a funny thing
about our expresses it doesn't sell to mainland China and that it's excluded
from the sale zone even though most the sellers come from China themselves so
this leads us to the question of is Aliexpress a scam and I think with that
information out the way we see that the platform is huge it's backed by Alibaba
it's certainly no scam it's bigger than eBay in fact and with that in mind the
platform is no scam whatsoever though what about these third-party resellers
on this platform are you at risk of getting scammed I mean in any platform
all over the world there's always a risk of getting scammed but I'll tell you
about my personal experience now with Aliexpress and that is over the last
five years that I've bought things off this platform I have never once not
received my item so every item I've ordered I've always got it and it's
always come either pretty quick or it's come very slow now with the recent CV
outburst worldwide this has added two shipping delays and I've actually done a
bit more research into this spoke to my local post office and they're telling me
that on the Australian side because I live in Australia the the shipping
delays are actually coming from within China themselves where they're shipping
from district to district and that's adding shipping times to the delays
so basically if you are to get something pretty quick at the moment out from
China and more typically I express there's usually going to be from the
sellers that are living near the docks and the water or the major airports to
ship this stuff out of the country and so things like for instance I did order
three different a320 motherboards and one of those sellers I got the a320
motherboard within two weeks of ordering it as opposed to some of the other stuff
on the desk here it took me over 45 days to get these items so with that in mind
if you're worried about not receiving your item and this is another thing
we're going to talk about here because I used to be over 10 years ago
eBay seller in Japan one thing I noticed when I'll ship in to certain countries
and I will point out for instance I know this happened over in some countries in
South Africa Brazil for example sometimes you would ship stuff out and
it just wouldn't get there and I know it's not a problem with the Japanese
postal system and so I heard stories of custom agents actually stealing the
packages and they're just never showing up to the person who ordered it so there
can be corrupt postage systems within your own country and that's not actually
the sellers fault on a lease presses end however that being said do keep an eye
on one important thing and that is when you order an item there will be a timer
a countdown timer for when you can put in the dispute so if you haven't you
received your item say for instance about 20 minutes before this dispute
time ticks off then you can put it in dispute and say hey I haven't received
my item can I get a refund or can you show me proof that this item has been
sent to me so that's one thing you can do another thing too is and this is I
have had this happen personally and that is if you get an item and it's faulty or
it's damaged so I've only ever had two items that have come in in the past that
have either been faulty or damaged one was a snowman cooler that had the fins
pretty badly bent and so I put in a dispute and I said look what can you do
for me and they actually sent me out a replacement in its place but one thing I
noticed from then on a lot of the sellers selling these coolers actually
started bubble wrapping the Snowman cool package itself to risk it
I'm getting damaged so the sellers learned from that and of course they
took care of me in the process and the second case with the ddr4 memory one of
the two sticks that I bought so I bought 16 gigabytes with 2 8 gigabyte sticks of
ddr4 memory and what are these sticks ended up being faulty and so for this I
had to show proof that the memory was faulty and then I'll express stepped in
and I had to send the faulty stick back and then they sent out a replacement
however this whole process was a bit tedious and it did take about 4 months
in total so that was easily the worst experience I've had on Aliexpress but
regardless in the end I've gotten everything that I've paid for and it's
all been working a hundred percent so if you are on a strict budget and what
you're buying is very important to you then do keep an eye on the dispute
process do make sure you put in something before that timer runs out if
there is a problem however just like eBay with PayPal Aliexpress has their
own payment system called hourly pay which you can sign up and then use your
credit card details or your direct debit details to then use this system of
payment you can also directly use your credit card if you wish to however there
is a problem if you're using cross currency transactions in that you're
buying something in United States Dollars and say for instance my credit
cards in Australian dollars then there will be a fee generally from my bank
however Aliexpress has come a long way in the last few years and they do offer
the prices in the local currencies so if I'm purchasing something from Aliexpress
then I can change it into Australian dollars and then I won't occur any
credit card fees if I'm directly purchasing off my credit card another
thing is to if you are buying not through Ali pay and you're using your
credit card then generally things like your credit card will have their own
buyer protection built within themselves especially if you don't receive an item
within a 3 month period you can then go to your bank and say hey I didn't get
this item here's proof that I didn't get it and then they can lodge their own
dispute through either Visa or a MasterCard on your behalf but I've never
had to do this without Express I've had to do this with something else that I
bought with in Australia from a completely different type of purchase
also some other it Ygritte ease in terms of Aliexpress is warranties you're
generally especially if you're getting this shipped international
your warranty is only as good as your dispute time so after the sellers got
the money if the products been working and then it goes faulty you're generally
not gonna get that one or two year warranty printed on the box because
there's no market essentially for that product and the sellers they're based in
China they're only gonna warranty that product within China so shipping that
product all the way back and then getting it back it's just not going to
happen another thing is too is that sometimes
you can get say for instance Express Mail service which only takes around
five days so it's shipped internationally within a week to your
door you can pay for this service but the seller will just send it via regular
shipping and then it'll take maybe a month to get to you so if you've bought
the faster shipping option which sometimes the seller just won't use that
Express Mail service so it is important to keep track of that if you've ordered
that EMS service and you haven't got it just put in a dispute and you'll get
your money back straight away though if you are buying from Aliexpress then
there's two more things that you definitely need to be aware of before
using this site regularly and that is first of all countries import duties so
for instance in Australia we have to pay 10% GST on any item we purchase and
that's within Australia but the Australian government has also made
itself we're buying off amazon.com or if we're buying off eBay International and
now I'll Express they have to add that 10% GST on their items and then the
overlord I'll Express or ebay then pays that GST to the Australian government so
depending on where you are you may even be up for more as well in terms of
import duties and that is if you import a item with a value over a certain level
for instance in Australia it is a thousand Ozzy dollars which is about 700
USD then if the items value comes in over that you'll have to pay additional
import duties which can get quite substantial depending on the items value
so wherever you are in the world it's important to research your country's
import laws taxes and duties and make sure you do that before you contact the
seller and buy something so you're not getting a guess surprisingly stung by
this charge that you don't know what it is however that being said the
Aliexpress sellers if you so civically ask them in a message when you buy
something you're like hey can you mark this down for me I only think it's worth
X amount of dollars then they can do that
for you generally and now the last but not least point to be aware of with
Aliexpress is the potential to get counterfeit goods now every year
globally over 1.7 trillion dollars of counterfeit products and services are
traded and so this is a huge statistic but what's even more alarming is that
over 80% of this comes from China itself so one country accounting for 80% of
this 1.7 trillion dollar trade of counterfeit products it is important to
know what you're buying before you buy it so in the case of
buying that cheap Louis Vuitton bag if the price is too good to be true then
you know it's definitely a counterfeit so keep that in mind before you buy
things me personally when I buy off Aliexpress I always buy brands that I've
actually usually never heard of or they're their own brand within China
themselves that's offering exceptionally good value for money take for example a
snowman CPU cooler this is a Chinese domestic market product that's now being
shipped worldwide it offers extremely good price performance to the point
where I think it is the best value for money CPU cooler you can get on the
market then we've got budget a320 motherboards this challenger board
colorful board and also this other brand I've never heard of before
onda these are coming in very good price points there's no reason to counterfeit
these goods because you can't literally make them any cheaper than what they're
selling for and then the last one of we've got on the desk is an rx 470 where
it's extremely difficult to counterfeit a graphics card that looks exactly like
it now on the node of counterfeit graphics cards I've never actually seen
a counterfeit GPUs being sold on Aliexpress in recent years I'd say in
the early 2015 stages I did see a few of them but they were quick to weed all
that out off the site to the point where on eBay I actually still see counterfeit
graphics cards being sold and I actually did a recent video in Australia for a
retailer trying to peddle some counterfeit graphics cards so I'll put
the link up here to that video but basically when it comes to buying
products for me personally off our Express I always buy products that
generally are not going to be counterfeited because they're really
good buy money though with that aside this now
leads us to the pros of buying off Aliexpress I simply find myself buying a
lot of cool tech products that offer extremely good value for money
pretty much every month off Aliexpress I'll go on there have a look see what's
good and of course in turn I actually make a lot of content of I'll Express
products for you guys here on the channel
I think some of the manufacturers on this website are offering extremely good
value for money and the good thing is that's a worldwide market so you don't
have to worry about living in a remote area where some local retailers trying
to rip you off and if they are trying to rip you off too much then you can just
circumvent that and go through I'll Express and you can even now buy pretty
much essentially a whole computer that will give you decent value for money off
this website another big benefit in my opinion to Aliexpress 2 is that you can
sometimes get Chinese domestic market products that were never sold to the
west and they come in at really good prices last year for example there was a
cpu called the rising 530 500 X these were going out very cheap in China and
then some of these sellers decided to then sell them worldwide on this
marketplace and they offered exceptional value for money at their 110 USD price
tag shipped though nowadays they've come back on the market and they're pretty
much a lot more than they used to be because there was a block on them there
was sort of certain things that weeded out this gray market good from being
sold in the Western countries and so it's not anywhere near the value for
money that it used to be though essentially if these gray market goods
do pop up in whatever field you like shopping in then they can definitely be
a good buy so with all that out of the way
Aliexpress it's one of those things that I personally have used for years now and
I'm going to keep using it I think it can offer extremely good value for money
and in fact I know it does because I do speak to some distributors in China and
they tell me that how Express is a super competitive marketplace so you can get
really good deals of this site some of my personal favorites if you guys have
been watching the channel for a couple of years now are Xeon CPUs you can
usually get these four extremely good prices and they offer awesome value for
money as well as rx4 70 they're really good buy because a lot of
those are use graphics cards but you can get them for 70 US dollars ship
worldwide which offers an extremely good value for money proposition especially
if your local markets are overpriced and they are saturated with extremely old PC
parts anyhow the last things I will touch on as well before I get on out of
here is the Chinese New Year the Lunar New Year if you guys are buying within
this period you can expect some extra delays because a lot of companies will
just shut up shop for this whole period and won't ship anything out until they
get back to work there's also xi of xi which is my
birthday this is a special day and i'll express
where they give out some really good sales it's essentially like i'll express
is equivalent to black friday so if you are on the website during this time you
can get some extremely good discounts so do stay tuned for those when they come
up later this year then with all that out of the way do let us know in the
comments section below what if your experience has been like on Aliexpress
and also don't forget to hit that like button for us and with that aside we got
the question of the day which comes from Randy bo-bandy and they asked does the
a320 motherboard have Ethernet and RGB headers in terms of a320 motherboards
you always get an Ethernet port on one of these but in terms of the RGB header
most of times you will unfortunately not get an RGB header on an a320 motherboard
you'll probably have to upgrade to the B 450 and even within the B 450 some of
those motherboards don't have RGB headers either so you have to look at
the particular board before you buy it to see if it's got that header and if it
does then you're happy camping and that's about it around here at tech yes
City if you guys have stayed this far and enjoying the content then be sure to
hit that sub button ring that bell you get the content the moment it drops also
sorry about the hiatus there's a lot going on here behind the scenes this
month it I guess it's always a crazy month here take your cities I'll catch
you in the next tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
