if you're trying to get into pc gaming for as little as 10 bucks then can this old architecture named x58 still play games in 2022 well the answer to that is overwhelmingly yes but there are a few drawbacks where in today's video we are testing out the top five games that are played on steam and then pairing that with an rtx 3050 to see if this old but gold architecture can give you a smooth gaming experience though there is more than meets the eye with this architecture so let's get into it are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor s cd keys has you covered for as little as fourteen dollars using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro two links in description below welcome back to tech yeah city and the first game that we're gonna pull up here for you guys is eldon ring this is a newly released game in 2022 and it also is played by nearly a million concurrent players on steam at least when i checked and did the benchmarks and what we see here is that the game does have a 60 fps cap limit now you can get around that limit with some mods but for the purposes of this benchmark today i decided to keep it vanilla and here's where we tested 1080p high settings and what we saw here with eldon ring was that we're getting an absolutely smooth experience at 1080p at 60 average fps and then you'll notice on the graph that we've done two different separate results here and basically we've got this whole configuration here the x56 90 cpu and the x58 motherboard three sticks of four gigabytes of memory which makes it 12 gigabytes of ddr3 in total more on that later and we see here that that gives 59 fps with a 49 and 22 one and 0.1 low so basically in elder ring if you get this older x58 architecture even coupled it with a newer gpu like the rtx 3050 you're going to get a smooth experience at 1080p high settings even though the minimum recommended requirements for this game state that you need a lot newer of a cpu so i guess the folks over at bandai may wish to update their minimum requirements because x58 is still more than perfectly capable of playing this game the next popular title is cs go and here's where the x58 architecture does an absolutely fine job whether it's overclocked to 4.2 gigahertz or whether it's just on the default out of the box settings we're getting 128 average fps at high settings with the rtx 3050 just normally and then overclocked we're getting over 162 average fps this was done on de dust2 so it's a multiplayer map and the 0.1 percent lows were a bit stuttery this is one thing you may notice about this particular benchmark and that's mainly to do with shifting around with certain events say for instance once you finish the round i noticed that it would be like a quick frame spike so i believe these one percent point percent lows in this particular benchmark aren't really indicative of how smooth the game can be where i actually had a fine experience in any of the clutch situations i didn't notice any real problems playing this game so in terms of this x58 architecture it's two for two and let's move over to apex legends a game that is extremely well optimized for pc here on both scenarios you can see that the fps is coming really close 81 overclocked versus 78 one percent and 0.1 low is absolutely fine again this is 1080p high settings so if you want to drop the settings down on the graphics card you can get even more average fps with this particular setup but for all intents and purposes i decided to test on high settings in the games that we're showing here today and then we move over to dota 2 134 average fps overclocked versus 104. and this is where we saw one of the biggest differences between overclocked and out-of-the-box settings and that's mainly because we're not just overclocking the cpu with x58 we're also overclocking the ddr3 memory which is kind of crucial to get the best fps possible especially in 2022. though the last game we're pulling up for you guys is arc survival evolved and this game right here was scoring 82 average fps versus 63 with the default setting so overclocking just like dota 2 on ark survival evolved can make a massive difference though on eldon ring and apex legends it didn't make such a big difference the one thing that i can see from these results is that as time goes by with pc gaming games are getting much better optimized which means that the older hardware becomes even more relevant as time goes on we can see with apex legends there wasn't much of a difference but it was still maxing out an rtx 3050 absolutely fine elder ring was smooth experience both default and overclocked but then cs go dota 2 and arc did respond very well to overclocking meaning that they're more single thread dependent than they are multi-thread dependent on apex legends and eldon ring so with those results out of the way what we can see with x58 if you're looking to play some of the most popular multiplayer titles this architecture can still give you an absolutely fine experience in 2022 and in fact the cpus are so cheap if you're looking even on aliexpress and you want to get it shipped worldwide you can get the cpus for nearly 10 usd that's six cores 12 threads and they usually work absolutely fine because a lot of the xeon cpus were pulled out of servers meaning that they'll run at low temperatures in very cool environments most their life so they generally have a lot of life left in them the x-58 motherboards themselves i'm finding i get these actually quite a bit more now in 2022 and especially in 2021 than i did before that where they were more sought after now i'm finding people give these away i actually have found quite a few x58 motherboards in dumpsters and been given them for free and also in particular this one here on the table this actually got traded in for someone who is upgrading their pc to a higher spec pc they just said i could keep the motherboard and the cpu on the ram so you may have people around you or you may have particular locations where people will give this kind of stuff away and if you see a motherboard like this one here and it's coupled with say an i7 920 then you can upgrade that cpu to something like an x5650 xeon for extremely cheap and then extract a lot more performance out of this architecture so since x58 is over a decade old there are some drawbacks to this architecture the first of those being the power consumption where on idle when we're not overclocked we get 118 watts max draw and then if we're overclocked we get 140 watts and then if we're running benchmarks that power consumption difference pretty much scales all the way to the top there in unigene heaven where we saw with the rtx 3050 overclocked 296 watts max and then out of the box default settings 272 watts so another drawback with this architecture since it is old is that you don't get access to not just avx2 instruction sets but also avx which can be required for certain games out there on pc however it is quite rare to come into one of these games as we saw with the top five multiplayer titles that are on steam at the moment none of these games required either avx or avx2 making this an absolutely fine configuration for playing those games however you can run into titles that do require this and then they just won't simply boot at all so that is a drawback then there's also no pcie gen 3 this is actually gen 2 even though the results here today with an rtx 3050 were absolutely fine coupled with the fact that a lot of these boards won't carry usb 3 or actually true sata 3 either so there are some speed limitations with x58 but when all said and done it does a fine job of gaming though the final thing to talk about and to look out for with x58 is of course again related to that age where if the motherboard has just simply been used heavily then it may not have much life left in it and that also goes for the cpu and the ddr3 memory too the one easy way to check is to just look at the general overall condition of the motherboard see if there's things like rust or perhaps bulging capacitors which would indicate that it doesn't have much life left and then also if there's heavy oxidization aka rust on the metal that could mean that the thing may not work properly either anyway guys with that aside i hope you enjoyed today's video on x58 and the cheap xeon cpus even in 2022 you can still get a good gaming experience and especially if you want to put in a bit of time and overclock you can extract a lot of performance out of this architecture if you come into this and you're looking on a tutorial on how to overclock then i've got one that i can link and put the link for up here for you and that will just get you going in terms of getting a basic like we did here today 4.2 gigahertz overclock which is relatively easy if you've got a decent cooler though also i look forward to giving you guys more content with x58 where some of you have emailed me and asked me to check out the numbers that linus tech tips actually got in a video where he tested it with an rtx 3060 ti so if you guys want to see that do let us know in the comment section below love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day which comes from you jay they ask listing untested gtx 1060 untested gpu i do not have the hardware to test this no refunds check sellers other listings literally sells pcs for a living and can't test one gpu now even though uj is making a bit of a joke this is actually a really good thing and a really good hint to look out for if you're looking for a graphics card or any pc part for that matter and then the person selling it saying it's untested and then you go to their profile and you can see that they're selling quite a few pcs so they know what they're doing with the hardware it's very easy for them to check if that part works or not then they're selling it untested because perhaps they know it's broken so this is one of those things that yes definitely look out for that when i buy my untested hardware for instance i always know the seller that's selling it and whether it's genuinely untested or not as opposed to someone who especially my for instance i got a lot of broken hardware here but i just sell that broken i wouldn't sell that untested because i know it doesn't work but unfortunately in the land of pc gaming there is quite a few scams that can pop up from time to time this is one of those things to be careful of so great question of the day there from uj and with that aside if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and also if you want to become a member behind the scenes which i'll start ramping up some of the vlogs again very soon i just got pretty sick in the last month so the content has been a bit slower than it otherwise would but if you want to join for as little as a dollar a month and support the channel then i'll put the link in the description below to become a tech yes member and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
