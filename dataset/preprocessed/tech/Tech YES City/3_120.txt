So you're in the market to build a new 
pc then perhaps an apu is a solution   that you will be looking at so in today's 
video we're going to test amd's new 5700   g and compare it against the likes of a gt 1030 
as well as an rx 550 2GB and then on the cpu side   we're also going to compare it against some 
eight cores to see where exactly this apu or   i think amd calls it cpu nowadays would 
fit in in today's market let's roll those   gaming and productivity benchmarks 
and then get back to the hotspot so analysing those gaming figures first of all 
if you are in the market to get something that   can play games at 720p or 1080p and still give 
out decent frame rates of course depending on the   title and depending on the settings used we're 
in the games that we tested today we were using   low medium and in case of cs go we did put 
some high settings on but we were getting a   very smooth playable experience at these 
resolutions and in fact the performance   was coming pretty close to that of the gt 1030 
and also the rx 550 however we got to look at   the price point of those two graphics cards in 
that at least where i am locally the gt 1030 is   readily available on shelves and it also comes 
in with a very cheap price point in that it's   not being scalped by crypto miners due to it 
not being favorable to crypto miners in that it   can't make them much profit same with the ap use 
they're not really going to be targeted by crypto   miners which makes them an excellent choice for 
gamers who see the msrp they see the review and   they want to go out and get that performance 
and not overpay for it and so on one hand i   probably should put the box and the 
apu on that hand we've got the apu   giving out decent performance but then on the 
other hand we've got the 8 cores and 16 threads   and so that does raise the price if you're 
looking at it just for that graphics portion   and to play games where i would suggest perhaps 
looking at maybe the ryzen 5 version or the ryzen   3 which i think the ryzen 3 has been announced 
but it's yet to be released so if you're looking   to build a new pc and you want to get into gaming 
and you want to keep the cost as low as possible   and still get a decent playing experience 
then i'd say the ryzen 3 version of this apu   would be the best choice for you but that being 
said this is a ryzen 7 and you are getting eight   cores 16 threads of performance and there is the 
zen 3 cores that they are using they're the same   cause that they're using for instance in the ryzen 
75800x though they are using half the level three   cache and so this is the drawback of going for the 
apu over the cpu but that said you are saving 90   dollars if you wish to go for the apu which does 
make it an interesting option in that aspect alone   where we can see with the benchmarks that we 
ran here today cinebench r20 corona benchmark   as well 7-zip that the performance numbers were 
coming in a similar league to the 5800x minus   the exception of the 7-zip benchmark which does 
heavily utilize cash as opposed to the cpu caused   directly when it came to that particular benchmark 
so in terms of clock speeds the cpu portion itself   will boost up to 4.4 gigahertz all cores and then 
for the single core boost i measured here going up   to 4.65 gigahertz keep in mind this is with the 
race stealth cooler which does come included if   you decide to purchase the 5700 g but if we look 
at the race stealth this will actually be one of   the two critiquing points i have about the 5700 g 
and that is i feel like it's not adequate enough   for the acor 16 threads and that this cpu and the 
dedicated benchmarks will go up to around 90 watts   tdp but of course at these levels even in my 23 
degree ambient environment here during the winter   this was throttling performance when i 
continuously ran the cinebench r20 benchmark   so in other words if we went to summer then 
we would get reduced performance if we were   coupling it with the ray stealth cooler and then 
it would be advisable to perhaps go out and buy an   aftermarket cooler if you wish to get the most out 
of your cpu and also in the past amd have included   with their eight core cpus the likes of the race 
prism and also the race spire and i feel like a   race spire type solution would be perfect with the 
5700g if they wish to bring back that cbu cooler   which i actually kind of really missed the wraith 
spire that they included in the ryzen 7 1700x   if any of you guys remember that do let us know 
in the comment section below and now the second   critiquing point that i have for this cpu is 
that it's going to tie in with my conclusion and   that is the timing and the release i feel like it 
was launched way after the 5000 series last year   where they had the performance uplift they had 
those new cores everyone was talking about the   ryzen 5000 series but then releasing something 
like this when we know there's other cpus in the   works there's ddr5 coming i do have to say the 
timing of this cpu does seem a little bit weird   and that amd's hoping that people will commit 
to this cpu especially in the likes of the 5700   g based on the performance of the zen 3 8 core 16 
threads will give and i think if people are going   to be spending that much money and they're budget 
conscious then they may want to wait a few months   or even 6 months to see what's around the corner 
in getting a better 8 core 16 thread solution and   even buying something like a gt 1030 in the 
meantime to game it out until the gpu prices   become a little bit cheaper also one more big 
factor to talk about which may deter people   from getting the 5700 g especially the 8 core 16 
thread option of the g series 5000 series cpus   is that it doesn't have pcie 4.0 whereas opposed 
to a ryzen 7 5800x that does have pci 4.0 so this   means if you put in an m.2 nvme solution as your 
main drive and you need those higher speeds you'll   only actually get half the speeds or the max 
theoretical speeds as a 5800 x and an m.2 that   would support pcie 4.0 and also when it comes to 
gaming you will be at a slight but ever so slight   disadvantage it's not really worth writing home 
about with current generation gpus so ultimately   to sum things up for you guys my opinion on the 
5700 g is that it's a good cpu but if it had   been released earlier it would have been a great 
cpu and i feel like the timing of this release   is an important factor especially when consumers 
now know that ddr5 is going to play a big role   into whether or not you should purchase a 5700g 
though do let us know in the comment section below   what you think love reading your thoughts and 
opinions just like this question of the day here   which comes from ivo emoji and they ask how do you 
make it work i mean after burner and cs go mine   doesn't work there like it's the only game where 
it doesn't work so to get afterburner to work in   cs go you just have to go to the properties and 
then go to the launch options and then type in   the command allow third-party software and then 
you can launch it and afterburner should work   after that hope that answers that question and if 
you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying   that tech yes content and be sure to hit that like 
button smash that sub ring the bell to get the   videos as soon as they drop and i'll catch you in 
another tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
