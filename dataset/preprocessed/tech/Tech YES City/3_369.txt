today we're going to be overclocking the 3300 X and also the 3100 and seeing how high they can go on water and another thing is - it'll be using the 280 mil H 115 i RGB Platinum this thing is pretty quiet it's also really good for cooling I mean for cause though we don't have to ask a whole lot out of cooling so if you're in the market for say getting just something a bit better than the race stealth how much more performance could you expect we're gonna be checking out that very soon but what we're doing here is setting up the PCM one thing you can do with if you've got any rising system is make sure you download your chipset drivers this one I got from the AMD website themselves and essentially just squeezes out a little bit more performance you can sometimes get an extra 2% performance if you didn't have these installed first as then you install it and you get that more performance we've also got Hardware monitor here this is just going to tell us especially our all course speeds so with that aside let the overclocking begin y'all if one of your lifelong dreams is to get rid of that Windows 10 needs activation message then you can make that dream come true with today's video sponsor SCD keys you can get a Windows 10 Pro single end-user license for as little as 15 US dollars using the coupon code TYC sk deliver the keys use the instant just copy paste it into Windows 10 activation and then you're good to go links and description below so here's Cinebench our 20 bank stress tested and what we can see here is that the 3300 ex is going up to around four point two five to four point two seven five gigahertz which is higher than what it does on the race stealth and this in ways is to thank the AMD precision boost which is detecting that the CPU is now running cooler so it can boost a little bit higher so it's a really good out-of-the-box system that they're going on with Zen - this was one of my favorite things about Zen - especially if you weren't an overclocker and we can see that here just with the performance of this thing out of the box so what we're gonna do here is see that we need to beat four point two seven five gigahertz when we overclocked but at the same time that's a good base point to start at and we're going to quickly see our score and know that when we go into the bias and then try to manually overclock we've got to go for some higher numbers here so first time lucky with this overclock here 4.4 gigahertz all caused and we just quickly I'm gonna say the best word to say this we just quickly scooped up an extra 130 points in sin avenge on 20 but why stop there let's see where this thing can max out out and go hot on so now we've just finished up here with a Cinebench ah 20 score 4.5 gigahertz which is really impressive this is the highest I have had an old core rise in CPU in the history of the channel here very impressed with this overclock considering it's 26 degrees ambient in here now this is the funny thing about over clocks right there's gonna be spend from Sweden and he's gonna come into the comments section I try and I got my CPU to a 4.6 gigahertz old core what are you doing and my reply to that is like spin stop putting your computer outside where it's like -5 degrees and bring it back inside and make sure you use it at a normal ambient temperature and so basically that's a big factor with overclocks is your ambient temperatures and so 26 degrees ambient 4.5 gig guys I'm super happy with this overclock but of course we're gonna run some gaming numbers now and then switch over to the 3100 and then come back and see the differences [Music] and now we've been spending some quality time with a 3100 and it almost made it through a 4.6 gigadeath past in Cinebench r20 mind you we are going overboard with the voltage and it doesn't matter if we give it that little bit more it's just responding even worse this time around scary thing is when I'm stress testing this it's almost juicing around a hundred watts and that's for a full course so that is not something we really want to be doing if we want to make sure our seven nanometer for core has a long life but with that aside what we're gonna try and do now is get four point five seven five gigahertz or four thousand five hundred seventy megahertz and stress test that in games to see how it compares to the 3,300 X [Music] and now I've just finished overclocking both these chips to 4.57 5 gigahertz they both managed to run in the games and in the stress test at least Cinebench at these frequencies now first thing I'm gonna say is with these frequencies is it's not a good idea to be running this CPU at around 1.4 9 volts day-in day-out I'm just doing this for benchmarks and showing what's possible and the first graph I'm gonna show up here is what is possible and it really took me back and I opened my eyes because this was the first time I've legitimately seen an AMD Zen 2 CPU in fortnight beat out the 9900 KS and this was a really good score I mean it's look it's one FPS it's point zero something percent but it's still a victory and it still shows you that when Zen 3 comes out and if that's got a more mature 7 nanometre or if it's got better IPC we're going to see even higher fps and that could be tout Intel as not only price performance King but performance came too so that was one of the big most exciting benchmarks but then we saw the contrast between the 3300 X in the 3100 3300 X being on that single CC x module did make it a little bit of a difference in both the Cinebench scores and also the gaming benchmarks where it did score just slightly higher FPS as well as slightly higher single core and multi-threaded score in Cinebench 2 so having those 4 cores on a single CCX module versus the 2 cores on 2 CCX modules in this right here they're Rison 3100 is more beneficial to go with the 3300 x ever so slightly it's not a huge difference in games or at least in Cinebench are 20 but it was a little bit of a difference and I guess if you want to go down this route and get the best FPS possible for competitive games then the 3300 X is a nice little CPU I was blown away by how good both these 4 core 8 threaded CPUs are but one thing I will say is we got so close to 4.6 gigahertz but it just wasn't happening at least in my ambient temperatures but talking a little bit more about the practicality of this setup right here it's just not really practical to go with four point five seven five gigahertz day-in day-out and as we said before the voltage that'll make sure work of the chip and probably even like something like a month you'll see a chip degradation at these voltages but another thing too is that we're using a x5 70 phantom gaming ax we're using an HX 1000 watt power supply we're using quite an expensive 280 mil all in one liquid cooler so all that gear together on a $120 and $99 CPU doesn't make a whole lot of sense the value for money has just gone out the window but one thing that it does show you is say for instance you've got a water cooler lying around and you maybe find a cheap X 370 motherboard on the used market you can get both of those put them together get a 3100 and get some really good performance in games or if you've got the extra 20 bucks get in the 3300 X I think both these CPUs are great at that price point $99 120 bucks but at the same time you can couple them with an a320 and use the included cooler and get some really good performance out of the box and I guess that's what kind of I would come out of this video saying is especially with the 3300 X you don't really need to overclock at all the 3100 you may wish to go with the B 450 and you can definitely extract a little more performance out of it you could easily get that to 4.2 gigahertz even on the race stealth cooler but one thing we did see him one thing I will point out and I'll show you this graph right here was the power consumption at five point five seven five gigahertz both having the same voltages same motherboard same everything the 3100 was using an extra 10 watts so some of that will come down to the chip itself but also going across to CCX modules does create more inefficiency at least at these levels where the differences are going to be exponentially worse than they otherwise would at lower clock speeds hopefully I'm making sense and not rambling though concluding this video both these CPUs overclocked extremely well I'm guessing you'd be able to get 4.4 gigahertz on both a 3100 and the 3300 ex day and day out with a decent cooling and a decent motherboard and power supply but ultimately if you are buying you and you wish to extract the most value for money just go out and get a budget motherboard use the included cooler and then just enjoy the thing out of the box because it's gonna still give you some great fps and with all that aside do let us know in the comments section below what you think about overclocking these two Rison chips right here love reading your thoughts and opinions as always I feel personally overclocking at least on era water is really diminishing really fast precision boost and stuff like that is doing a really good job of finding the sweet spot where the extra power consumption was but we didn't even get an extra 10% out of the 3,300 X but the 3100 we did get quite a sizable boost in terms of performance but that being said is it worth it I think not though we do have the question of the day here which comes from Brandon fear d'Alene and they asked thing is in the future are more games gonna be optimized for more cause I saw this in a bit wit video so I'm a bit torn this is a really good question and you usually got two sides of the fence I'm on the side of the fence of by what is best for now and the reason behind this is because I've seen a lot of different games come and go and it's usually the most popular games tailor their games to low-end hardware and this is quite simply because they have to cater to the whole world market and they know that people in for instance third world countries they can't afford a six core 12 threaded CPU will then buy their game because they're gonna get a good experience on it and hopefully that in turn will they may have a couple of bucks on them and they can go and buy some in-game items so they still gonna make money off that person just as they'd make money off the person who could afford that six core 12 threaded CPU and will still enjoy the game regardless so now that we can see what most game developers will want to do we can then sort of ascertain that hey not until we see 6 cores 12 threads being the entry-level CPU that's when will and its widespread of course it's mass spread out there everyone's buying a see score 12 thread CPU even on the use market that's when I feel like we'll see mass adoption to more cause more threads it won't be force-fed and so we're stuck in this place at the moment where four core eight threads and even for course for threads is still so popular in how many people own that PC and that's a potential player base so is four cores eight threads gonna be fine I'd say yes I feel it's gonna be fine for another couple of years yet especially popular multiplayer titles which most people are playing hopefully that answers that question and if you guys enjoyed today's video
