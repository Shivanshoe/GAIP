it is nearing the end of the month here
at tech yes City and that can only mean one thing
and that is used PC parts and getting the best deals on those and so it's a little
bit funny with all these new product launches, you guys have been hanging out
in the comments saying you can't wait to see the used PC parts on of the month and
if you guys are hanging out for it that I'm gonna go the extra mile this month
and find whatever deals I can get and get as much as I can so let's get on
good old gam tree and Facebook marketplace and one thing in particular
that I definitely need is gravis cards I am so hungry for them right now and of
course there's still that trend coming through but we're gonna see if we can
muster up some deals get those used PC parts hunting capes on and let's go for
a ride [Music]
and straightaway starting off with gum tree going through we actually found
quite a few deals here where the first was a 1050 TI and we dropped in an offer
of a hundred and forty Aussie dollars it's the four gigabyte edition graphics
cards are still a little bit overpriced so I think if I can get this for this
money it's decent just like this next deal here which is a gtx 1050 2 gigabyte
i offered a hundred aussie even since it's only the 2 gigabyte edition and
they already came back and said no thanks so we'll keep moving on from that
even though it's just a $20 difference it's all about that continual discipline
here when it comes to use pc parts and getting the right deals next up is in
our TX 2060 super we've offered 580 Aussie dollars they're saying it's like
brand new so if we can pick that up we're gonna shave off some money
especially compared to a price of a new GPU and the movie on here we got a 1660
tough gaming GPU I offered 250 Aussie dollars so waiting
for them to get back to us then there's a 660ti we offered 60 Aussie dollars
still waiting on that just like a GTX 760 here which we've offered 60 Aussie
dollars down on two and then after that as an RX 570 I've put down an offer of a
hundred and twenty Aussie followed by a offer of someone to post me in our x5 88
gigabyte for two hundred Aussie posted and by the way I'm talking in Aussie
dollars so the current exchange rate I'll put that up on the screen for you
because the Aussie dollar is weaker than the United States dollar just so you
guys can get some rough prices of pretty much worldwide of what I'm offering on
these GPUs here then we had a 77 70 where they just listed it for $70 but I
put in an offer of 30 because that's really all the 7/7 70 is worth with one
gigabyte of VRAM being this old they came back and said 50 Aussie dollars so
I'm just gonna let that one sit and then after that is an online 270 which I put
down it's a 2 gigabyte edition so it's a decent card still for 1080p say medium
and low gaming I put down an offer of 60 and they came back and said they need
the cash they want 85 Ozzy so I'm just like let that one sit and then after
that we've got an i7 3770 combo and they're saying that someone else is
coming to pick it up I offered 130 ozzie dollars they reckon the board's possibly
faulty but it does come with a hyper 212 and 21 33 megahertz memory which is some
pretty good stuff in the i7 3770 not too shabby if you're into flippin pcs and
then the next one there is a GTX 970 4 gigabyte they're asking 250 Aussie I
just said 150 Ozzie because pretty much that's what I'm paying for in this
current climate even though before that I was getting
GTX 970 s from like 100 to 120 though then the last deal here is the most
interesting for me person because I message them it's a GTX 645 very similar
to a GTX 650 now these are great little cards for 720p gaming which I've been
putting a few systems together lately on the low end because I just enjoy putting
together pcs on pretty much any budget I really love it and the GTX 650 and the
645 it's really an unknown card so I put down an offer of about 20 bucks they
came back and they said they're like seven of these and then one around $27
for them a pop so I'm like look I'll just take the lot and so I'm going to go
up and see him and they've also got some more parts there that they said I might
be interested in so this is definitely looking really good already but when it
comes to Facebook marketplace we're gonna move over to that now and the
someone with a streaming PC where they wanted $400 for this PC and I offered
300 they came back and said look man I want 350 I said sorry bro on a tight
budget I've only got 300 and they said sure come pick it up so it's got a 3000
G in it but we've also got an AMD a320 motherboard a gigabytes of ddr4 case
power supply rx 570 and a 2 terabyte hard drive so there's pretty fair value
in that I can just pretty much change the CPU over for say a 1600 AF put an
SSD in this thing and we've got a pretty capable gaming PC on a decent budget and
then the last deal that we managed to look up here is an FX 6300 a gigabytes
of RAM cooler and motherboard combo they wanted a hundred I dropped in an offer
of 80 Aussie dollars and they said yes we're gonna go pick that up a little bit
later too but in the meantime we might give leather call and see if we can pop
in before it gets dark basically that's the
cue to hit the yes 'mobile how is my brother from the same prehistoric mother [Laughter] well that's our Sam would you be came
for a little pop in from a late-night visit we're not a late-night which over
maybe 5:20 I'll be there no later yeah I'll get there just by that time like
just man say you know just just be a little bit lenient towards me
all right ladies I'll see all right so you say that bite
[Music] so it's a little bit weird right now but
it's winter so it's getting dark really early and basically ah flares
we got a gtx 960 4 gigabyte edition we paid a hundred and ten ozzie so it's
pushing the boundaries and you know liz is pretty strict on his prices and he
knows his limits and I couldn't really budge him down anymore
but we also got a 12:41 v3z on equivalent to an i7 4770k gig of ram
hard drive for a 150 and a whole pre-built and we also got another
pre-built with an SSD 1 terabyte hard drive 12 gig of ram and x58 i7 power
play case for 152 so we picked up some decent deals there again not the best
but I'm keen to pick up stuff now because the studio is freeing up a bit
and after that he also had a 6 thingy bytes of RAM he did that for 50 bucks
and he also did a 3-1 terabyte hard drives as well Surry 500 gigabyte hard
drives for a pretty good price but right now we're in a bit of a hurry because
we're gonna go pick up this streaming PC that I put the off and down on three
hundred dollars for so they've accepted but I want to sort of start getting
these deals before it gets too late so let's continue the show
[Music] so we now just picked up the $300
streaming PC that they were advertising and is actually a really sad story that
it's so disgusting that I mean I'll talk about it when we get back to the studio
could quickly go to get some of these other deals around here but I have not
heard anything like this the whole time I've been dealing with pcs this is
really like insane anyway let's keep moving because it is getting late [Music]
so we just finished up picking up a GTX 1080 and that was just around the corner
and I picked this up for 420 Aussie dollars so not a bad deal and this is
the third graphics card now I've bought off someone who I'd now consider a
friend I've recently become acquainted with them they sold me a 1060 in the
past and also an Archie X 2060 and the first time they posted a 1060 down
because we are about I'd say eighty minute drive from the Gold Coast and the
second time I met up with him I was doing the potato hunter series actually
but I kind of left that graphics card to the side as it wasn't a potato
whatsoever but anyway we just quickly stopped off here to get a feed really
hungry on the road but we're now got to go pick up these GTX 6-4 fives which
we're getting for around 25 Aussie dollars a pop so we're going to go get
those and also negotiate on the spot on the other stuff that they've apparently
got to see 4:20 and stuff like that [Music]
so we just finished up picking up the seven GT x64 fives and while there they
also had a two fx-8150 s and an F X 970 and a 990 motherboard and they didn't
have i/o shields and I said look would you take 140 for these two boards and
the cooler and the CPUs he said yes so he did us that he also had a 1650
workstation z4 xx but he wanted too much for it and the actual water cooler on it
wasn't working properly so I wasn't ready to take a gamble for 230 bucks on
that considering the it did have 30 gigabytes
of RAM but it was easy C registered and I've already got a heap of that stuff in
my studio anyway and I can get it for really cheap so I did pass on that deal
but let's get back to the Gold Coast now we've got to pick up the final deal and
that is for this FX combo with an FX 6300 a gig of ram motherboard and coulis
seems like this month there's a lot of old bulldozer and stuff coming through
FX chips but hey we can turn those into gaming pcs with these recently acquired
GTX 645 little budget bangers [Music] and now it's pretty late at night but
I'm finally back at the tech yes studio and this last deal for the FX 6300 ended
up just being a cool story so we've got a lot of stories to talk about we're
trying to talk about the the really bad one tomorrow morning when I wake up but
this one right here was I bought a PC off this guy over two years ago I think
and I made the csgo potato part 2 with that PC and he remembered me and he's
he's just appreciative of getting him into the used hustle after that so he
just gave me these two motherboards I was like you know thanks thanks a lot
man just gave me a beer and we had a chat and it's just so cool to see people
are doing really well out of these hustle and more so they appreciate it I
mean you guys are absolutely awesome I wanted to say and I often play I said
man I'll give you money for this stuff he's like no just take it take it really
take it I was like it's so awesome like that is this the the wholesomeness thing
you can do for tech yes cities is just give us some PC prize but besides that
we'll take a look at all this hole right here because as I said earlier it is
pretty late at night and I'm really tired I've had a crazy busy day I was
reviewing some of these motherboards which is still getting through with the
C 490 stuff and lairs also taught us a new trick though with these monitor
stands other thing with PC parts like guys as much as I show what I'm doing on
the channel here I learn a lot of stuff from other people as well so let's
taught us with the span of the spanner trick on these Dell monitors just
quickly put a spanner on the end and you can quickly and easily take off those
clips with ease like you don't need a pliers or anything like that and it's
not tedious at all and I was like wow that's such a cool trick because now
when I silicon a stainless monitor to the back of these it's gonna be
completely flat after I take these here are these little plates out with screws
so and these blue stands are actually really nice too so less was like he was
super excited to give us some stands this time for monitors and I was like
why is that it's just you just add like 20 of them
or so nice alright cool man yeah like I'll take some monitor stands always
love a good monitor stand so yeah also this one's got like CX engraved in it I
thought that wasn't that the code for the streamer guy the ice Poseidon guy
like and someone engraved that in the back of their monitor stand that's like
the weirdest thing I've ever seen and so here we are now the next morning and
this story of what happened with this streaming PC that I picked up off
Facebook was that the guy bought two pieces of
someone and obviously I mean if you guys want to see a video about this too then
I'll I'll make one but I have to get both sides of the story first and all
that and do a lot more digging but from what I was told last night was this
person bought a PC or two pcs with monitors and everything for like three
thousand seven hundred dollars it was like two full setups and the biggest
problem was when he got the pcs both of them didn't turn on and so what he did
was went to a local tech guy and they pulled apart both the PCs and both the
motherboards had bent pins on them so and these were a lot of bent pins
there's no way both these pcs would work normally and so if that's true right if
that's true then the person who sold that is just it's I've never heard of
someone deliberately hosing someone like that for that kind of money and
furthermore he's telling me like the the cables were just all over the place and
one of the rig's the GPU was apparently zip tied to the socket didn't even have
a backplate on it and he had to then the guy the PC shot fixed that for him and
so what he did this was the other PC where he took the motherboard out he put
another motherboard in and he just ended up really just no no it wasn't able to
do what he wanted it to do and I guess that's because it's got a single eight
gigabyte ddr4 stick of memory in the 3000 G and I mean that's not gonna do
much at all even though the RX 470 or 570 that's got in there is reasonably
powerful so I just I heard about the story I was like wow like who would do
that you know that's just it's one of the dirtiest hosing jobs if it's true
that I've ever heard of so what I'm gonna do is we're going to contact the
other party involved and just see what their side of the story is but just I
mean and I told the guy I said to the guy straight away I said this is a big
reason to why I always tell people to buy local if they can't like for
instance if someone buys a PC of me I take him through the PC before I sell
I'm like hey dude he's running a benchmark here's all the system specs
here's a GPU everything like that I even do a cold boot in front of them just to
show them like simulate what it's gonna be like when they get the PC home and
plug it all up so that's one thing you always should be checking for yourself
too if you go buy a PC like I would recommend especially if you're spending
big money don't buy it post it to your door from someone you've never met or
someone who's got no or little feedback or something like that so this is arm
this is the worst story I've heard by far $3,700 dollars is a lot to pay for
two pcs that just don't work and they don't turn on and so the specs in them
originally I think one of them had like an i7 6700 and the other I mean they
came with monitors keyboards you know RGB keyboards and all that stuff but I
mean it's still it's just like wow what what is this like I don't know there's
there's a lot my I think there's a lot more to this story I'm gonna really
start taking deep because yeah I don't know let us know in the comments section
below to what you guys think of this but also what you've in terms of if you're
in your local area what have you heard of some of the worst sort of hosing jobs
that have happened and so I also know someone who contacted
me in Melbourne where someone sold them a graphics card and met them at it like
a service station and they had the box for that great scum but inside there was
like a real potato GPU so yeah always just guys I'm gonna like say this again
recheck your stuff if you--if you're buying these news PC parts check like
it's different with less right like say friends is less I deal with him a lot I
know less he's not gonna hose me and even if something happened where there
was a faulty part I just call theirs off he's like bring it back and I just I
would change it over give you a refund and so that's different and so when
you're buying for the first time just be really careful though with that aside
let's check out these three pcs that we've got here and also we'll tally up
so far what we've got and see who's got back to us with these graphics cards and
stuff because the whole so far has been absolutely amazing that's for sure so
now here's the three pcs here and you'll probably notice something on the channel
lately and that is as the cases are coming out of stock and all this other
stuff that's going on right now with these crazy conditions and times you
notice that we went through like I personally went through the RGB era
where everything had RGB lights on it and whatnot and this PC here is gonna
start signifying a new error for me and that is the weasel error and so what I
mean by that is since this it's got a 120 gigabyte SSD in at 1 terabyte hard
drive that is kind of like it's still 1st gen right so we're gonna take those
two components out we're gonna put in a 500 gigabyte hard drive leave the 12
gigabytes of RAM in there take out this gtx 285 and then put in something a bit
better so maybe a gtx 6 series card or something and then we can put a monitor
keyboard mouse and it be a great little starter gaming pc so just microing what
we've got but this pc here was 150 Ozzie dollars and again for the specs it's
pretty good like it's a pretty decent buy I also have to do is take this like
three things out here then put in a better graphics card and as I said
before change that hard drive and we got a decent decent gaming PC on our hands
another thing is to that it's got two blu-ray discs rewriters in it so I might
change those over for just standard DVD drives because like again I want the
ascetics to look pretty good on this case but blu-ray like blurry dis
rewriters I know they're not cheap like by any means so that's pretty cool that
it came with two of those so now here this PC is we've got a 20-centimeter
look looks like it's a green LED fan at the front we've got 12 centimeter green
LED fan at the back and it's got a Cobra power supply which I've never seen this
power supply before so I got to admit the sticker does look kind of cool but
in terms of the specs and the brand itself I'm not too sure it doesn't look
too half and bad like it look like it'll power this build absolutely fine though
this thing was labeled as a streaming PC and I mean with a 3000 G and a gigabyte
stick of RAM single stick it'll do a few things but streaming is definitely not
one of them so and what we're gonna do from here on it is probably change out
that 3000 G for something like 1600 AF change out the RX 470 movies like a 1660
super add another stick around and then an SSD and we've got ourselves a proper
gaming PC that we can uh yeah turn around so there's that PC that needs
obviously need some techie us love and got a bit of dust on it and stuff like
that but you know I mean for what it what the tech guy did in the guys area
he didn't do too bad of a job of fixing this thing and piecing it back together
to a working PC and now here's the last PC that we got this was from les this
was the T 1700 Dell Precision a gigabytes of RAM he did chuck in a hard
drive with this one 500 gigabyte and we also got a 12:41 v3z on so similar to
like an i7 4770k said before but we just got to take out this GPU now think about
this precision here is there's no real like you'll be able to use like a single
6 pin PCI II adapter for it easy but I think something like with like a 1650
would go well coupled with this build so I'll see what I can do in terms of
spicing this up a little bit or should I say the new meta of using the term
sprucing it up we're gonna spruce this thing up and make it look well actually
we can't really make it look that good but we can sort of make the spec sheet
look good but I'd say for 150 Aussie dollars
it's not too shabby either and then the last part of this deal involves us
getting some hard drives we got some RAM as well from less there was some RAM
thrown in with that last deal that we dropped off to where the guy gave us the
two motherboards and the two FXR six cores and he also gave us a little bit
of extra ddr3 as well so that was more much more than I expected so that was
awesome I mean but coming out of that even in this own video itself you can
see that for every down there will be enough so you just got to stay a focus
stay positive that's one of the biggest messages of tech yes City but we've got
gravis cards we got quite a few of them we got the seven GTX 6-4 5s that's
definitely gonna be the sort of like potato buffer so when I'm putting
together when people just like Brian I want a really cheap PC that's gonna be
the graphics card that will supplement that and then we got the GTX 1080 that's
checking out absolutely fine that gtx 960 for one gigabyte and all the deals
we've got I'll put that up on the screen for you guys but off the top of my head
it's looking at around about seventeen hundred and thirty Ozzie dollars and
we've got a heap of good stuff here this is a real sort of wholesome goodness
month and also less did throw in some mice as well and four monitor stands so
that was always a really cool little bonus I always like getting a little bit
of a bonus if you can but do let us know in the comments what's your favourite
deal going forward with this parts aren't so far and with that said we're
going to go back to gum tree now and see if we got some of those replies from
those other GPU offers that we put in but also see if there's any more GPUs up
for sale because that is the one thing that I'm looking for right now
[Music] so finished up having a look around and
first thing I found was you might are having finally SSD prices have come down
so I went and bought 10 120 gigabyte SSDs
they used to be like around 50 Aussie dollars a pop now they come down to like
36 so that's really good to see that coming down and that being alleviated
but on the other side there's also GPUs and it's hard to get them so what I did
here was look around and I found on eBay like guys this is gonna be an amazing
deal right gtx 1070 over $1,000 a pop like yeah I'm sorry so keen to buy that
one but honestly looking through the rest of
these gravis cards it's just like these there's these overpriced GPUs that just
sit on the market and I've seen them up there for weeks now and sort of any good
price on a GPU I think at the moment any reasonably decent price on a GPU it gets
snagged up straightaway like someone's already on that and so I do have like
there are some people out there now that do keep a lookout for GPU deals for us
but even then I think the last last night I think there was like a 20 70
super that came up for $600 dollars and it got snapped up in two minutes
that's from what what I was told so you can see how it's pretty there's a lot of
people out there that are hungry for deals at the moment so you've got to be
on the ball you've got to be really quick to get any sort of deal at the
moment and yeah that's just what it is like looking around I just couldn't find
any good deals eBay did have this sale where if you use late after pay or
something like that you could get 10% off but I checked that this morning and
it was sad because there wasn't really any good GPU deals around but after that
I I tried to get these 1650s and the deal had just run out so that would have
been decent if I'd got that because I could have got 1650s for around close to
$200 I think so with the 10% discount going off it's
really not worth it so yeah just on the lookout now for GPUs and I got to stay
on the lookout but in terms of people yesterday getting back to me
that didn't happen except for one person with the GTX 760 4 gigabyte and they
came in at 70 Aussie dollars I offered 60 and they said let's meet in the
middle and I'm like yeah you know what $70 for a 4 gigabyte 760 s sort of like
my maximum I will go there but the problem is they message me when I got
back to the Gold Coast pretty much and they will back like the area that we
left last night they were right around there so it was just a matter of them
replying too slow because I'm not going back and doing like a 70 minute drive
just for a gtx 760 now so i did reply and asked them if they could post it
down to me i mean hopefully they can just do it for like 8 bucks or something
postage and yeah maybe we get a little discount who knows but anyhow with that
aside i hope you guys enjoyed this used pc parts hunt of the month unfortunately
to come to like just a real abrupt dry end where i've just checked out there
all these deals and yeah just nothing now like there is no good deals I think
we just sweep tup the market yesterday and just got everything we could tho
those SSDs again I'm still pretty happy about that because that's one thing I
desperately needed power supplies I have been juggling like like I said early
before weasel method weasel theory that's coming in you got to be able to
weasel your way and just pick out the good part sort of mix and match don't be
afraid to juggle office pcs - especially if they've got good power supplies in
them take out the good power supply put in an office power supply no GPU etc you
can just weasel your way out don't be afraid to weasel that's I guess going
into this month that's what it's all about
but if you guys enjoyed today's use PC parts out of the month please be sure to
hit that like button for us but also let us know in the comment section below
what was your favorite deal always loved reading and thoughts and opinions as
always just like this question of the day here which comes from solid st. and
they ask can someone explain the logic that allows a 400 watt power supply to
run a PC that includes a 39 50 X 20 80 TI fans drives ram etc
and it's pretty simple like in that the 450 white power supply that we featured
in that video put the link up to that video up here that was a really good 450
watt power supply at least both for the money and in terms of what its rating
truly is so you're getting all that 450 watts on the 12 volt line which is the
most important when you're running a graphics card and things like your CPU
that's where you want your power to be getting to live it at that rating and so
in this case we weren't overclocking 239 50x we weren't overclocking the 20 80 TI
so we were still able to come in with that power supply and it worked
absolutely fine so there's a kind of logic behind that a lot of the times and
this is a common thing a lot of people do over buy power supplies like I've
seen people buying thousand watt power supplies and coupling with 1660 supers
and you're just really wasting your money at that point like I think if
you're going to go over the power supply for generally a single GPU single CPU I
really solid 650 watt power supply has always been my recommendation and going
forward it will be my recommendation where that's sort of like for me that
personally that's your sweet spot in terms of you get it's going to last you
a while if you get a really good one you just keep upgrading and using that
same power supply for years and years to come anyway
hope that answers that question and I'll catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now but [Music] Oh
