x58, this is the motherboard that is my
personal favorite and I'm gonna be honest with you guys I came into a
bastion of x58 boards recently when I did a parts hunt and I found three pcs
that were just pretty much untested they were really just ready to go in the bin
and I got them for a really good deal and then I pulled the motherboards out
two of which I'm gonna be honest with you guys
I'm reselling because they are really good x58 boards one of them now which is
a mediocre x58 board we're gonna be using in today's build now this bill is
going to be what I would call a bit of a compensator build where we've got the
i-7 6 core (12 Thread) we've got the gtx 1070 eight gigabyte (VRAM) so on the spec sheet it's
looking pretty good and it's gonna be one of those builds that compensates for
say for instance you got a small USB dongle so basically with x58 was the
first generation of i7 that's when you first got hyper threading but even to
this date you can still get a lot more performance out of this architecture
especially if you overclock it and that's what we're gonna be doing today
with this i7 970 you can expect an extra thirty to forty percent performance and
also if you tune and tweak it you can even get more performance after that
which we'll all be doing later in this video
but speaking of x58 motherboard there is a tiered list I like to say that the
more desirable boards which two of them were we had an EVGA for the win SLI
three and also a x58 Zeus deluxe so what you're looking at here is you really
want to use saved motherboards like this that a mediocre they can still do the
job they can still overclock well but they're not that desirable on their own
and so this is the motherboard we're gonna putting in today's build yes it
does need a bit of cleaning but when it comes to x58 motherboards basically the
best thing you can do is look at the capacitors straight up quite simple to
see how good that motherboard is the integrity of it have a look around the
board and the first thing you'll see with the caps is if they have flat tops
on them then it still means that they've got a
good life left in them but also on that note you can see if the board has
generally been overclocked hard or it hasn't so a lot of the times with x58
the reason why the board still lasts for so long is that they were designed so
well but also on top of that a lot of people got these boards and because they
are over engineered and they're engineered for real high-end
overclocking a lot of people simply didn't overclock them so the life that's
left in these boards is still a lot though of course another reason why I
like x58 is triple channel memory even though we're using older ddr3 it's not
as fast as ddr4 that triple channel does make up some of the lost speeds compared
with ddr3 vs. 4 so triple channel we've got 12 gigabytes of RAM being thrown
into this build we're also using a 1 terabyte hard drive for backup and now
the SSDs have come back down in price we can use a 128 gigabyte SSD for the main
OS drive now speaking of the coolers if you manage to find these old NOx your
coolers I find that they've just they last so long and they work so well the
fans as well I've only ever come into one faulty fan in the history of using
NOx your parts but that was on a really really old and filthy build and I'd say
the fan really didn't fail on its own it probably had some external force like
darth sidious or someone dropping coffee on the fan and then it probably caused
it to fail because I just don't believe that the NOx your fans gonna go out on
its own and for the last components we got a V s550 we've put that on a power
supply tester it's given out some great signals which means it's still good to
go and then for the case which is one of the most important parts of a bill
believe it or not we're using one of these tempered glass RGB bangers with
four fans installed and a controller and the control is important on older builds
especially like x58 where you don't have any RGB headers so that in total I'll
put the price of this whole build up on the screen for you guys without aside
let's build this thing up quickly and then we'll go through a little tour of
what x58 can do for you and of course me as well I love x58

[Music] so we've taken off the South and North
Bridge heat sinks on the x58 boards and when you come into an x58 board you
always have to in my opinion clean off this heatsink paste or the dried-up
paste on this one especially here the Northbridge heatsink so we've done that
we've taken it off it was actually very difficult to get off because it's over
the years has become so hard and now we're going to apply some new thermal
paste after we clean this up and then put all the heat sinks back on and
surprisingly with these pads here the thermal pads back in the day they use
some really good ones so they still are fine we don't have to replace these
though if they are all real crumbled up then you may wish to replace them with a
cheap $1.00 pad off eBay or something like that
[Music] [Music]
so now changed the thermal paste on the graphics card the Northbridge heatsink
Southbridge heatsink and the CPU cooler and honestly this is going to now run in
my opinion better than brand-new because the thermal paste that we're using has I
guess thermal paste over the last 10 years has improved a lot since the stuff
they used back in the day so I'm pretty excited let's get this thing built
[Music] so we now got this build torn apart so
we just finished building it and then I realized that the RAM
it wasn't booting up properly so I then took it out and the BIOS is updated to
the latest version I actually did that when I was testing it but one thing I
didn't test was the other Ram slots so what we've got here is a problem where
the slots on the right only these two slots here are working and these other
four slots aren't recognizing memory and this does happen from time to time with
certain faulty boards so essentially this board in this current state is semi
faulty but what I'm gonna try and do now is take the CPU out try and just I guess
clean the pins and then clean the back of the CPU see if that can make a
difference as well as cleaning the RAM slots out and see if we can at least get
dual channel to work as at this stage we're only got single channel and that
unfortunately will affect our fps in games quite a bit
[Music] and that is what it's all about around
tacky-ass City we now have three sticks across those three DIMM slots in
triple-channel and it is being recognized in the bios so that was a new
method I just quickly did now on the channel and people always wonder like
dude how do you know all this stuff how do you come up with these things
I just trial and error I did not know if me putting a very sort of like stiff
soft brush across the pins with multi-purpose spray was going to work I
didn't know that and I just tried something new and it ended up bringing
these two channels back to life here so that's just the power of doing this kind
of stuff and my guess was it's either a very slight micro Bend on the pins that
happens so we were stroking against the pins and that helped I guess very softly
alleviate a problem if they may have had that or the tips of the pins themselves
got a slight bit of corrosion over time so either way we've now got it all back
up and working absolutely fine this board is ready to finally be put back in
the system and it's good to go let's get it underway so the builds up and running
finished we've downloaded our games except for cod which every time I try to
install a battlenet game you've got to like delete the folders in the main
folder and then scan the game and it rig downloads more I wished platforms were
honestly more like Steam and you play games just install when you copy and
paste them so easily but anyway rant aside this PC we're
gonna run a preliminary benchmark without it overclocked and then we're
gonna see the numbers and then we're gonna come back and start overclocking
it and then re benchmark it [Music]
and here we are back with overclocking our i7 972 4.2 gigahertz now 4.2
gigahertz on X 58 is pretty much a standard overclock especially for these
chips right here which is the 32 nanometer but one thing about the i7 970
is that it's pretty much considered on these 13 and 6 cores pretty much the
garbage bin and that it's the worst bin you can get compared to the X 56 50 cos
for example and also the i7 990 X's so getting these two 4.2 gigahertz is
relatively easy you can do it in around 10 minutes and also considering since
we've got like real bottom-of-the-barrel memory we're just sticking with 1600
megahertz now going past this if you want to go to 4.4 gigahertz you'd
probably want some better cooling but also some better memory to but for what
it's worth this is a solid overclock especially for some quick gains and
games I could probably spend some more time tuning the core voltage on the CPU
dropping that a little bit before what it's worth
let's get these benchmarks done [Music]
and here we are now finishing up with the benchmark it's actually bright and
early in the morning where I crashed out just yeah you just get really tired
sometimes you like no I'm going to bed not spending any more time with these
computers and that's exactly what I did I just crashed down then woke up was
thunder charged got into it did the overclocking and stuff like that so what
we've got here before and after is really interesting because we can see
with warzone we gained like literally like 50% FPS going from 128 average FPS
to 171 and the 1% in point % loads responded accordingly and then f1 2019
saw a pretty similar boost in that the average frames went from 115 to 154 now
comparing that to the 10 900k that scored a little bit more in f1 2019 and
also in warzone it got a bit higher as well but there wasn't like a massive
difference you could still play absolutely fine 144 Hertz monitor on
both these titles now one thing about warzone - we did have to play it in safe
mode for some reason and it's just this game I don't know what it is like it
depends on the config and the way you set it up sometimes you just come into
problems with it when you're installing it on new machines I always seem to come
into problems with it I wish like battlenet would fix the copy-paste of
games as we just said earlier in the video but anyway enough of that
fortnight was a weird sort of mix here where we didn't actually gain much FPS
at all we went from 240 to 218 but then move over to the 10 900k we gained a
substantial amount of FPS going up to 384 so this is the game that did expose
a big difference between the latest and greatest
and also the x58 system though the s-58 system for what it's worth
let's go over this because we were using 12 gigabytes of mediocre memory versus
32 gigabytes of seal 16 3600 so I think I'm looking forward now ever more so to
an x58 comparison and perhaps we'll just do an ultimate showdown in 2020 x58
versus X 79 versus save for 2,700 X 1600 AF and then we'll throw the 10 900k in
there just for the the limit on what's going to be imposed because now that
I've got some really good ddr3 memory for this stuff I want to see how high we
can go and of course I want to get that Z on the X 50 675 now that is pretty
much the best CPU for x58 motherboard so if you're gonna get one of these
motherboards and you pick especially if you pick one up in a deal like we did on
the channel here you can get some really good value for money out of this system
now for me personally like I said earlier in the video I do resell x58
boards if I know they're really good quality because people even after 10
years we can see the FPS here even after 10 years X 58 is literally like one of
the best investments you could have made in tech in your life ten years later is
still going strong is still playing games absolutely fine and a lot of those
people out there that have owned this system for say 10 years they're probably
just like they're multiple might go faulty over that time and they're like
well I'll just replace the motherboard so you re selling a motherboard
especially a good x58 board there is a good market out there for people who
want to buy them not just people putting gaming two pieces together price
performance pieces like we do here on the channel is actually people we just
want to replace that board and so those x58 boards are still very attractive as
we saw the results here but also another thing is I've mentioned in the past
overclocking this particular platform is a lot of fun and there are a lot of
other variables as opposed to the new stuff especially with Mike risin
precision boost overdrive them and precision boost it just works so well
that there's really not a whole lot of point in overclocking manually and then
we move over to the Intel site on Z 490 and if you want to get a bit more out of
that you're gonna see massive power consumption increases and it's still
just a matter of locking in CPU voltage and single cause so overclocking I feel
like the older stuff like X 58 is a lot more fun it's a lot more challenging but
once you get your head over it it's actually big gains as well as we saw
here you can get around 40% 50% FPS extra FPS if you tuned both the CPU of
memory and even the Ankur a lot more so a lot of fun with today's Rick and in
terms of the i7 970 worst case scenario for X 58 you go grab that X 56 75 if
you're serious about X 58 and you want the best day on with the best overclock
and surprisingly the temps were okay to temps power consumption we were getting
around 330 watts while we're playing war zone and the temperatures were around 70
degrees on both the GPU and the CPU so that Knox were that little NOx will cool
with the duel fans pretty quiet and also doing a great job of handling this
overclock at 4.2 key codes but as we said before
overclocks yeah you can get a little bit more but you're gonna spend a lot more
time and another thing is - if I do sell this system I'm not gonna be locking in
a 4.2 even I'd sell it maybe at 4 gigahertz because I know that's gonna
work 24/7 I'm not gonna have any problems with the person saying hey my
system is crashing even if it's in summer
once in a blue moon or whatever so 4 gigahertz is definitely gonna be 24/7
stable but 4.2 is what most people can expect
and then 4.4 4.5 it's pretty much an enthusiast overclock on x58 now of
course the memory if you want to really get the most out of this get some decent
memory but even the 12 gigabytes we had it today a triple channel did do an
amazing job look with all that aside if you guys enjoyed today's video then you
know what to do hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comments
section below what's your experiences with x58 2020
have you come into one have you seen any deals on it or are you just all about
going with that new Rison or even the new Z 490 stuff Lovering your thoughts
and opinions as always and get under the question of the day and
this comes from toad or tank off and they asked I want to buy a Zeus p68 x58
da socket 1366 shield I saw it in eBay but do you know any other way and I'm
guessing they're talking about the IO shields that sometimes when you buy a
board you're gonna lose them and the problem here is is that if someone's
very selling an IO shield they're generally gonna want a bit of money for
it like at least 20 bucks because they know someone needs that and they know
they're prepared to pay that and also at the same time the person selling that
has to make it worth their time so IO shield is one of those things there's no
real other way around it unfortunately because they're all made unique to that
motherboard there's no real generic Bioshield that you can get I mean there
might be but even then it's still gonna cost 10 bucks and it's gonna look a lot
Messier so in terms of if you lose the IO shield and you want to replace it
unfortunately you're pretty much gonna have to cough up the piper on eBay
that's pretty much the only method I know of personally in terms of IO
shields that I've got lying around here I could take a look for you personally
as I've got so many of them over the years with all the motherboards that
have been faulty and I've thrown out I've managed to keep the IO shields
around so eventually I wanted to make like a tech yeah city wall with IO
shields so that was the plan but yet in terms of getting around that there's no
other way anyhow I hope that answers that question
and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that content then you
