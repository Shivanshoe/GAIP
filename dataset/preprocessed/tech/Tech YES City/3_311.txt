today is going to be a little bit of a
different video where i'm going to be helping one of my good friends
review a new monitor from samsung and this is
their 1440p 240hz panel
because i'm very curious about this monitor because
not only is it a new for the industry but it's also
a new for people who have high-end hardware and
are they going to be able to run this and i'm also going to be testing it out
playing on it but also testing for things like
input lag which is a huge one in the gaming community
and also response times which i'm using the camera that i'm filming on now to do
this sort of intro for you guys we're going to be using that to shoot
and see how good these response times are as well while i'm at it i'm also
going to check out the colors on this monitor
and then test it against two other monitors that have been sent over here
this is a 144hz 1080p panel from aoc and then there's a 4k 60hz
panel from benq and we'll go over all the
differences here and just give it to you guys straight
is it worth it to get samsung's new monitor or should you just be saving
your money well in this case probably a lot of it
there is only one way to find out and that is to jump in the tech yes mobile
with our little fun contraption here isn't it cool like i'm wearing a
intel hoodie and i got a little ryzen box here
it shows that we can just all get along in the world of pc
oh yeah let's get those results for you guys [Music]
[Applause] [Music] we just landed at the rocket jump ninja
studio here where we've got the odyssey g7 32-inch on display now this i played
a game on this already and it's actually really smooth
the curvature is one thing you either like it or you don't
or you're like me you're somewhere in between you don't really care this is
the 24 g2 however 144 hertz ips
we're going to put this to the test very soon and we've also got this benq
4k 60 hertz monitor now it's important to illustrate that
you're either a gamer or you're not a gamer
and that's what this one is right here this is the 10-bit panel
supporting dci p3 standard and the good thing is that all three panels
in today's video they're all freesync or g-sync in the case of the odyssey that
is g-sync enabled so let's check out the juicy
numbers first where apparently the odyssey has a 1
millisecond response time and very low input lag and for a va
panel that's actually pretty impressive if
that turns out to be true where you're getting
better colors than tn but having those extremely low response lines which you
do need at 240 hertz anyhow let's roll it let's get into it and here we are now the next day back at
the studio i did a lot more testing than i thought
i would be doing on these monitors i guess once i
get started i want to go through everything tip to
toe and then give you guys just my honest thoughts and opinions and
straight away one thing i noticed across all three of these monitors in today's
video is that the black equalizers on all of
them are just essentially gamma boosters they don't really do much i have seen
this setting done right on different monitors but the
three monitors here today don't do black equalization
good at all which i think is a new feature it's coming in and it can work
really well if it's boosting those darker areas
especially if you're a competitive player
the one thing about the g7 this is the odyssey comes in two flavors 27
inch and 32 inch now the 27 inch will actually come in
cheaper than the 32 inch but will have a better pixel density
so depending on how far you're sitting back you may wish to go for the cheaper
27 inch versus the 32 inch but there was some
anomalies i found with this monitor first of all
the one millisecond response times written on the box they aren't
really one millisecond when it comes to real-world gaming experience
in counter-strike this is the test that i usually do for just real-world
response times what we saw here was on the fastest
response time overdrive setting we were getting around three milliseconds
response times which is very good for a va panel
especially this is the fastest times i've seen for a v8 panel
coming very close to that of tn panels that i've tested here
but for instance on my aorus kd25f when i put that on the max overdrive setting
which i'm comfortable with it's about one to one
and a half milliseconds response times very quick in terms of how it responds
in games though another thing is too the colors
on this don't look as good as an ips and they
look very very similar if you're sitting on this
front on which you're going to be gaming on the one thing the va panel does do
better than the tn panels is it does have better viewing angles does that
aside continuing on with the g7 it is g-sync supported though having
this technology switched on i noticed a very strange problem
occurring i haven't seen this in the history of testing monitors ever
and that was parts of the screen were reacting
and other parts of the screen just weren't working at all
and this was happening in cs go and so with that i'd recommend leaving the
g-sync turned off on both the software side and the nvidia
control panel and on the monitor itself so for the response times they're very
impressive for a va panel especially at 240hz you need
fast response times otherwise you're going to get kind of like a blurrier
image which is going to be bad for your eyes
the three milliseconds on the fastest setting is where i'd leave it at with
the gaming numbers i didn't notice any bad artifacting or
overshooting on this setting however the input lag there is a little
bit on this monitor i'd say it's roughly around five
milliseconds even though it's really not going to make much of a difference i
feel like in 2020 when all the competitors are getting
this between zero to two milliseconds i feel like samsung could just edge it
down ever so more when i know they're capable of
doing it though on the note of input lag turning on the g-sync on this monitor
did add roughly on average around three milliseconds input lag
so there's the g7 out of the way the magical land of 240 fps 1440p
gaming was i super impressed by it and i'm gonna be honest with you guys
it's nice i'm not gonna lie but i am waiting for oled
to hit gaming monitors oled has the perfect lighting or
more near perfect lighting that your eyes need it's got a mix of
better greens and reds versus blue in the back lighting
and it's also got some of the fastest response times to that of near being
instant so that technology i am just really
hanging out for it to hit mainstream 24 inch 27 inch or even 32 inch gaming
monitors but who knows when that's actually gonna
come though one more note of the color profiles out of the box for the g7
they did do a pretty good job of making this thing relatively color accurate i
mean it's not perfectly accurate if you're a
professional video editor you definitely wouldn't
want to use this monitor as your main video editing monitor unless you
calibrated it but if you're getting into video editing
and mainly gaming this monitor will do the job so next up
now we have the aoc 24 g2 now this is an ips panel 144 hertz
1080p and you've got the best thing is the price
which is 300 aussie dollars roughly or in the us you can get these things for
around 150 usd now one thing i'm going to say straight away
for this price point the stand is actually very impressive
four-way adjustable height tilt swivel and horizontal and vertical so
that in itself is as a feat when you're giving out an ips panel that does
perform pretty well i mean we're looking around at roughly a six to seven
millisecond response time you'd want to leave this on the fastest
overdrive setting and then you've got input lag which is extremely low i'm
measuring around 15.9 on average milliseconds which is coming very close
to that of the best model that i've run through here and that is the
kd25f for morris so that was getting the lowest frame i've seen of seven
milliseconds this scored eight milliseconds so if
anything you're looking at roughly a zero to two millisecond
input lag on this aoc monitor very impressive then you've got the ips
colors then you've got the viewing angles if
you need it and again not really going to make a difference
though if you're sitting in front of a monitor playing games
however the next part about this panel is that when i
it's got a setting called motion blur reduction just like the g7
but this is doing it a different way it's got red frame insertion where
it's got about five milliseconds off and then it's got about 2.5 milliseconds on
so the brightness will be reduced greatly as opposed to the g7 which will
take a hit of around 33 brightness where that's got 3
milliseconds on to 1.5 milliseconds off so in my opinion this is one of the
perfect gaming monitors to get if you like value for money and if
you're a bit more enthusiastic than 60 hertz
in the magical land of pc gaming and to be honest 1080p
24 inch it's where a lot of professional gamers
still play their games at having too big of a screen is not
always a good thing especially if you're too close to it where your peripheral
vision can't see all the details going on at
the screen at the same time which leads us to the last monitor here
this is the benq ew 3200 now this monitor
is very pricey it's coming in actually more expensive than the g7
it's a 32 inch ips but this monitor here i'm going to highlight
in the world of pc where there's different strokes for different folks
it's got a 10-bit panel so if you're editing videos in 10-bit
you're going to see that come out on this monitor where you're going to get
much more accuracy to then down-sample that to 8-bit later
to give the viewers the best image possible in the videos
but besides that this ips panel i got to say there's something about it out of
the box the colors look absolutely gorgeous and
they're actually very close to being calibrated
by the x right system so there wasn't much of a difference at all
very little difference as opposed to the aoc which is a little bit off same with
the g7 but you could still get your work done
on those other two monitors but this is where the band q monitor
comes into play where you need those accurate color profiles whether you're
on macbook or whether you're doing a rec 709 profile you've got those
saved into this monitor from the get go another thing is too all three monitors
in today's video do have relatively good brightness it's
not the best i've seen but it's certainly far from the worst
but for me personally these brightness levels are more than enough
especially if you're spending every day in front of this panel and you've got to
work with it however hdr modes on these monitors and
really it's more just a color profile on these pictures where if you want that
more saturated contrasty look you're going to get it on this panel in
particular where i actually prefer it with the
colors out of the box i think it looks gorgeous for a 4k panel and in fact even
if you want to do a bit of gaming beside your work this is going to double
down especially if you're playing rpgs or for me i've been playing a bit of
warcraft 3 lately it really just pops and gives you a really enjoyable
experience now another thing going on too
is this speaker system i've got to give kudos to benq
on their higher end monitors they've included a really good speaker system
into the monitors nowadays that i would honestly have no
problems using besides my headphones and getting
a really enjoyable experience so kudos to the audio kudos to the
colors and the ips panel as well as the low input lag which was
actually pretty good coming in close to that of the other two
panels though the response times do leave a little bit to be desired here
ranging in at around 13 milliseconds on average which is fine for a 60 hertz
panel but it's not going to be that great for
fast motion games especially games like call of duty
warzone and stuff like that where you need the faster response
times because everything's moving so quickly anyhow capping over these three
monitors here for you guys the three panels all feature either
freesync or g-sync and to be fair in the case of 60 hertz
that's going to be a pretty desirable feature to have
which i don't see many 4k monitors offering this feature especially ips
panels so it's good to see that bank use included that
even on a monitor with a 10 bit panel another thing is too
some of these monitors aren't value for money plays i'd say the aoc
24 g2 gives exceptional value for money actually i was very impressed with the
value for money that things bring into the table
though the g7 is more of a acquired taste
because it's 240 hertz 1440p you're not only going to need a big budget to spend
on this monitor you're also going to have to make sure
your 2080 ti or your upcoming rtx 3000 or
the new rdna 2 gravis guard is going to be able to handle
this kind of resolution and frame rates as well on top of that is you've now got
your cpu which also has to push 240hz too so in
the grand scheme of things you're going to be spending a lot more
money on not just your monitor but your hardware i'd say in
general expect to spend around three times more
setting up a pc to get the frame rates you want
versus the 1080p 144 hertz option and i'm going to say one thing you're
probably not going to get three times more of an enjoyable experience
so of course the last model to the bank you that's really not a value for money
play at all it's got a specialized 4k ips panel
which is targeting a specialized market and that's about it really i just hope
we can get oled to gaming monitors very soon because
you can probably see my face i'm not blown away
as opposed to three or four years ago when all these monitors were coming out
with high refresh rates i was blown away i want to see
technology progress with that aside let us know in the
comment section below what you guys think of all three monitors in today's
video love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always just like this question of the day here
which comes from andre p and they ask what are you spraying
that you wear a mask for and what i'm spraying usually a lot of the times i'm
using multi-purpose spray this stuff is as the title says multi-purpose you
can use it for pretty much anything it is my go-to spray even over
that of brake cleaner but of course when you're spraying all these chemicals
you don't want them going in your lungs and even the you guys in the past have
expressed concern over my poor little lungs here and i've got to start taking
care of them so hence the mask and hence the uh long
live tech yes city slogan anyhow guys if you enjoyed
today's video be sure to hit that like button for us
and i guess the ultimate question is will i be buying a samsung g7
probably not after just testing it out again i'm going to be waiting for an
oled panel to really blow me away uh in terms of the g7 i love what
they've done they've made the they've made the v8 panel
as best as it can be but it still feels like there's some
glitches that concern me i feel like maybe this panel was rushed to the
market especially in those earlier tests when i
was playing cs go and i saw that weird glitching error
so i don't like it one thing i really don't like around tech city
is when companies use the public as beta testers
they've got all the time in the world all the budget in the world to make
those products hit a hundred percent so why release it at
95 percent when they can release it 100 i just think it would go a lot further
anyhow hope that opinion helps you guys and
i'll catch you in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you
want to see the content as soon as it drops be sure to hit that
sub button and ring that bell and i'll see you next time peace out for
now bye
