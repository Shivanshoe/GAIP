this little pc beside me is actually the most powerful pc i have built here at tech yes city to date and the funny thing is it's also the smallest coming in with a capacity size of 7.5 liters and featuring an i9 12 900 k and also an rtx 3080 ti now you may be stopping me there and going brian putting these components in an itx case is not a good idea the heat is just simply going to overwhelm the components and you're going to be left with one hot massive potato and that would be true except in today's video we are going to be under vaulting heavily this pc right here and we have used some very important components in order to make this build work properly so let's get into it and find out how to make the best mini itx rig in 2022. if you're looking for a feature packed motherboard that won't break the bank then today's video sponsor asrock has you covered with the x570 riptide you get access to pcie 4.0 smart access memory lightning game ports which separate the keyboard and mouse on their own controllers for no jitters and an asrock gravis card holder links in description below to find out more welcome back to tech yeah city and this right here is the new travel pc which features a pc case from aliexpress and when i first saw this case i was thinking well has everything that i want from an itx case it's very small it's also got a handle on top which is very durable and it features clear acrylic sides on the front and back and this was important because i didn't want glass if i'm traveling and that if the case gets knocked around and you could have one massive problem on your hands and so going with the acrylic sides even though it's kind of a cheaper option it does work out better for travel in my opinion now the best thing about this case is it's based off the dan a4 chassis very similar but again has those two different features that i was looking for and comes in with a much cheaper price tag where from aliexpress you can buy this for 75 usd delivered or 85 usd with the pcie riser cable which i do recommend since this pcie riser cable is matched perfectly for this case in terms of its length so the next key components in order to make this happen was the asrock phantom gaming itx b4 z690 motherboard this features an 11 phase vrm with also tantalum capacitors on board and on top of that you've got pci gen 5 you've also got two m.2 nvme slots as well as a real tech alc 1220 onboard audio solution now i did test this outside the case with just the 12 900k and the temperatures were very impressive especially for an itx board but there was a big hurdle in terms of mounting this itx board in this case and that mainly came with the actual cooler that i was using which is the noxua 12 nhl12s and this is a low profile cpu cooler however this is where we came into a big problem in order to make everything work and that was the cooler was 70 mil high and we really only have around 62 mil clearance for our cooler height in this case but what we did here was we did a little bit of a janky solution in order to get this cooler working in that we actually bent the cooler manually down to make it a little bit lower but in the process we were hitting the heatsink on the motherboard so i actually had to remove the whole heatsink covering the vrm on this z690 motherboard and so what this means is that we won't have as good as a vrm temperature that we would like to though since we are going to be under vaulting this won't be a problem in my opinion though after we barely got this cooler to mount with the motherboard we will then face with another problem and that was the ddr5 memory and that we couldn't use any memory with heatsinks on it because we needed as low as a height as possible in order to make the cooler fit over the ram and so in this case we had to go with the crucial ddr5 4800 megahertz memory two by 16 gigabyte sticks and so since this is currently the lowest profile memory i could get for the ddr5 platform it actually ended up just working out just like the cooler though other components used in this build we've got a pca gen 4 m.2 from corsair and this actually can go under the heatsink on the itx board from asrock now if you are using gen4 ssds you will generally want to have them covered with a heatsink but most gen 4 ssds will include a heat sink from the get-go just like this corsair one but since the azroc board does have a heatsink that covers both top and bottom i decided to use that instead and then there's of course the power supply to power this whole build which we went with the corsair sf750 which is a platinum rated power supply with also shorter cables than you're what you used to with a regular atx power supply and this is actually pretty crucial in this build to do this because we have to minimize as much components as we use in order to fit everything in this build though after we had that one side completed there is then the rear spot where you can mount your graphics card in this case says you can mount up to 305 millimeters and we went with the rtx 3080ti founders edition card and this fit absolutely fine with the riser cable just managing to plug in it is a bit of a tight fit but it will work though i will say if you want to put a gravis card that has a wider pcb they may not fit properly inside this case but i would recommend going with the regular 11.5 mil with pcbs and of course make sure the cooler is no longer than 305 mil so booting this pc up straight away if we try to run a benchmark our cpu will get to 100 degrees and start throttling very quickly not to mention the high power consumption however going into the bios we can then lower the clock speeds and i decided to lower the clock speeds to 4.5 gigahertz and also drop the voltage with an offset of minus 100 millivolt and so what this does is it gives the i9 12 900 k less power to work with but it also lowers the clock speeds so it doesn't have to work as hard and so after running benchmarks we were getting cinebench r23 scores of 25 000 points and also getting temperatures that topped 80 degrees so this was a very good sweet spot out of the box however if you do want to fine tune your under volts or overclocks you can download the intel xtreme utility which in this case we did which we managed to fine tune and undervolt the 1200k even more down 35 millivolt which left us with power consumption of around 130 watts which before that we were having power consumption maximizing at about 145 watts so fine-tuning your cpu can get you really good results but another reason for this pretty solid result is also the power supply since it does have low ripple and it is platinum rated it's going to be very good for powering these components whether you're overclocking or under vaulting also while we're in the bios we can lock in the xmp 3.0 profiles which in this case is 4 800 megahertz and that's all these crucial sticks can do even though some other sticks out there can go as high as 5600 on the x and ps as well as 6 000 megahertz since we are dealing with mini itx and we don't have the best airflow in this case we will leave it at that and hopefully it won't have any hiccups so now that our cpu and memory are running fine it's now time to look at the graphics card which is easily the highest power consumption part in this build and actually most gaming pcs so the rtx 3080 ti does use out of the box it will go over 300 watts on default in a benchmark however in this case since we really want to lower the power consumption as much as possible we can get a program called msi afterburner and in that program by hitting control f we can then pull up the curve editor and what this enabled us to do was lower it down to the lowest voltage setting which is 700 millivolts and i found the best clock speeds for this 700 millivolts was around 1620 megahertz now you may be thinking brian you're going to be losing a lot of performance and actually not quite so well pull up some benchmarks on default where the gpu was going over 80 degrees and we were getting here on fire strike extreme we went down from 23 193 points down to 20 634 points so we're losing a chunk of performance here nearly 10 percent and then for time spy we went from 18 736 points down to 7 746 so again losing a little bit of performance but not as much as fire strike extreme and the last benchmark we had here was unigene heaven where we lost a similar amount of performance the time spy whereas 11 400 down to 10 600 points so the performance was maximum a 10 loss however these are the best two parts of under vaulting was our power consumption we were coming under 200 watts on usage pretty much most of the time and actually in fact it averaged out around 160 to 170 watts for a 3080 ti and also the biggest benefit now was our graphics card is running a lot cooler and so it's pretty much sitting at 70 degrees even while some gaming for hours with these under vaults and so the next benchmark we'll show was apex legends where we're getting at 1080p maximum settings 255 average fps and trios and the 1 and 0.1 percent lows were very well controlled and also you might be wondering well brian there's not much airflow in this mini rtx rig and here's where i decided to put the thermo imaging camera on top of this build and the maximum heat points that we saw were really only going into the 50 degree region so this build pretty much having ventilation on all different sides of the case does have it so that all that heat can escape so now we've finished this build and everything's complete everything's stable and i'm happy with everything it is actually time to talk about the problems that i came into whilst building in an itx pc the first thing being was the noxua nhl 12s cooler which i had i had this sitting around for quite a while now at least over a year here at the studio and when i tried to mount it there was only lga 1700 mounting support and so i didn't have a bracket but i noticed noctua does sell a bracket for the lga 1700 series that will adapt your cooler but me being me i didn't want to wait i just wanted to get this build done as soon as possible and actually had access from in the past i've hustled a lot of used parts and you come into different brackets and so i've got a big basket of cooler brackets and what i found was i was able to have this cooler mount perfectly fine with a noctua cooler on and corsair believe it or not water cooling bracket and using those corsair bolts to attach the bracket on the rear of the motherboard then we use the original noctua brackets on top of those corsair bolts and the cooler mounted perfectly actually the mounting pressure was very good and so there was no problems with the temperatures though the second problem we came into was just simply uh this pci gen riser even though it's technically they say it's pca gen 4 is actually i believe only truly gen 3 compatible where out of the box this pc would default with the z690 since there is a pci gen 4 graphics card it would default to pci gen 4 and have above 4g decoding on cam anyhow guys going forward this is going to be my new main pc which if you look at the size difference compared to some of the other pcs i have around here this thing is so much smaller i was actually blown away by how far itx has come in terms of what you can fit inside the case and how well the cases are designed but also how much power you can get inside in general where we've got the 12 900k and the 3080 ti and this little pc right here is actually more powerful than both my main pcs so i was really shocked to see how you can just get so much out of itx nowadays but admittedly i do have to undervolt in order to make this thing work 100 but under vaulting if you guys have followed us in recent months undervolting is something that i'm actually very passionate about with a lot of the newer stuff because i believe in the case of the rtx 3000 series cards as well as the 12th gen cpus and even with amd's ryzen 5000 cpus a lot of these companies are pushing their components to the limit out of the box and so what that means is they're not giving you the best power efficiency out of the box especially if you're coupling it with a very solid power supply so that's what i'm very passionate about now is under vaulting and in this situation we lost i'd say around 10 performance max but we were saving over 33 percent of the power consumption not only that our components aren't going to come into any problems and the temperatures are also going to be a lot lower which will increase the life of the components anyway guys that's it for the absolute beast mini itx pc i'll leave a list of the parts that we used in today's video in the description below and also if you want to build something similar like this then you can also use this video as a guide i'll put the settings that i used in the description below too and with that aside i hope you enjoyed this one if you did be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below if you would change some things in this build what would you do differently love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from kell and they ask do you record all your in-person transactions i buy and sell a ton of stuff on facebook marketplace and i wonder what precautions i should be taking so in terms of recording in person i don't usually do that i will record some transactions with the camera in my car but in terms of the transactions themselves i always meet at someone's address or they meet at my place and that's sort of how we do business where i'm at in southeast queensland if you're meeting someone in a public place you may wish to get some form of hard proof because that in the past the only times i've ever been hosed i was hosed once in 2017 that time i met someone at a gas station and of course the part was faulty and there was no recourse for me and ever since then i haven't been hosed so i always meet someone at their place or at my place and also if they're fishy from the messaging then i also avoid that even in the recent used pc parts hunt we did i avoided a transaction because it just seemed very fishy you can check that out i'll put the link up here and with that aside if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that techies content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell to get the content as soon as it drops and with that aside i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music]
