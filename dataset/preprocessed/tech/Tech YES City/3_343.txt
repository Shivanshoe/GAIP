so you might be in the market for a four core eight threaded CPU and you've been eyeing-off the ryzen 3 3300X and
that's a cpu that represents great value for money we've actually taken a look at
it in a separate video I'll put the link for that up here if you want to check
that out but we've got that in today's comparison
with A B550M steel legend against the i3 10100F and you've everything in 10100F that's not out for sale and I know and don't ask me how I got this thing
just came in and I'm doing some testing but it performs exactly like the i3 10100 it just doesn't have that I GPU portion on board so if anything might be
an indicator of what's to come in a few months if you're in the market for a
cheap i3 though regardless we're testing that with A B460M and the B460 does
have that 2666 megahertz memory limitation we'll talk about that
a little bit later but then we've got the final contender in the mix here this
is the i7 4790k and I picked this up on a used bargain for a hundred and forty
Aussie dollars with 16 gigabytes of RAM and also a one terabyte hard drive so if
you find a good news deal you can't turn that down because the performance
figures I'm going to show you are pretty impressive for this old 4790k but let's
roll the intro and then we'll talk about the gaming benchmarks for you guys more
in-depth and get to a conclusion today's video is sponsored by - Lane -

the coupon code in the description below let's get back to the video so I showed
you guys one quick benchmark in the intro but let's roll through all these
numbers here and then tally up what is going so first game we're gonna pull up
shadow of the Tomb Raider and what we can see here is that the 3,300 X and the
10 100 F do pretty well against one another and they beat out the 4790k but
once we overclock the 3300 X this is even on the B 550 m still legend so you
can overclock this on a B 450 get some similar performance if you have a decent
cooler it started outperform everything here but the 4790k once we gave it that
better memory the 21 33 megahertz CL 9 it did put on one spectacular show here
where it was saying hey 10 100 f it left that in the dust I mean it didn't leave
it in the dust but still for a six-year-old CPU that's a very
impressive feat and then we're moving on to the f1 2019 results and we could see
here that the 4790k with 1600 megahertz XMP out of the box 4.4 gigahertz it does
fall behind the 10 100 °f and the 3300 X now they were trading blows once the
3300 X was overclocked so the i3 did very impressive in this game now for the
GPU we're testing with as you see in the graphs it says up the top there 5700 XT
because I feel like if you're getting a fork or a threaded CPU you're not going
to be going out and buying a 20 atti it's just way too much of a discrepancy
in pricing and realism I guess where you guys have pointed that out in the past
when I've tested this with a 6 core but at least with the 6 core I could see
that happening I could see you getting a new 6 core and maybe a used 20 atti
that's just going on some fluke deal that is a possibility but with a fork or
I don't really see that happening but anyway that aside the 5700 XT is still a
very powerful Jeep you and we can see that in this graph
here where the frame rates are extremely high 1080p high settings and the 4790k
does benefit the most once you start giving it some overclocks and in this
case some tech yes loving which we did we had to do this to get better results
because the 4790k I couldn't overclock it at all out of the box because it just
had that crapped thermal paste on board so we had to deal with it give us some
cooler bar choice liquid Pro and then we came back and it performed even only 200
megahertz high it was still getting pretty hot as we can see with those
temperatures but it wouldn't actually use that 4.6 gigahertz in Cinebench are
20 but we'll get through the gaming benchmarks and we'll talk about all
these extra itty gritties more in depth because we got here call of duty war
zone and here we saw the Rison 330 300 X score the victory in this title though
the i3 10 100 °f and the 3300 X out of the box were trading blows and the 4790k
did benefit from that overclock and it did show some extra performance figures
and then moving over to fortnight this one is a bit of an enigma I'm looking
into this because the Rison 330 300 X benefits greatly when you give it more
voltage because I did I guess over volt it for these tests because you just want
to make sure that overclock works and so what we saw here was 366 FPS and then
moved over to 10 100 F it left it in the dust and then the 4790k came out
overclocked and it came in second place which was actually pretty impressive but
in this game I'm not too worried because it is a bit weird I've really got to
look into this game a bit closer and find out what's happening but one thing
I noticed is with these benchmarks in fortnight in particular is when I do
give these CPUs more voltage more power they seem to love it and the FPS shows
out of the box it might be some kind of voltage deficiency and that might be
leading to lower fps that's what I'm caught of correlating upstairs here when
I look at these numbers may all just be in my head but that's what I'm starting
to see with a trend with overclocking in fortnight but moving on now to Ghost
Recon we saw here victory for the 4790k this was very
impressive that this six-year-old CPU could come in and steal the show of
course once it was overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz with the 21 33 megahertz
memory now of course the last game to run through here is the division 2 we
set this at 1080p high settings and we saw here some impressive numbers a
hundred and forty seven FPS just falling a little bit behind that of the 3,300 X
when it was overclocked so beating the 10 100 F and also beating itself when it
wasn't overclocked but you can probably see how excited I am for this old-school
4790k because at the channel here we focus on the use price performance it's
a big thing that I always tell people to consider because not only can you get
really good price performance but you can also get and have a lot of fun out
of your older gear and that's what I really enjoy with use price performance
I'm constantly tinkering with all these different parts while I build use PCs
and flip them and I personally just really find that this stuff is super
exciting now one thing we will mention here is that this z87 motherboard that
we used is really like it's mediocre at best I mean look at that vrm tiny and it
still managed to pull off a decent overclock and it still managed to lock
in those XMP profiles at 21 33 mega it's absolutely fine now for this memory I
got this in Brisbane on a deal it was a ridiculously good price I got this for
in a previous parts hunt and I'm going to be using this memory with the
upcoming x58 and also x79 comparisons to see how much more performance you can
extract if you have some good bog and ddr3 memory then you pick up on a deal
now with the new stuff right the B 550 and the B 460 will using CL 16 32
hundred megahertz which I believe is the most common memory you're gonna couple
with both these CPUs or even three thousand mega at CL 16 this is the ddr4
Ram in the new market that's outselling everything so I think it's the most
appropriate Ram to using the comparison we're on the B 460 we had to lock it in
to 2666 megadose now this is the limit coming in with h 410 and
for 60 you heard it before it came out and it's in after the effect but as I
showed in the 10400 video you're not losing a whole lot of performance by
going with the B 460 or H 410 if you can get this value 3000 of 3200 makers
memory and quickly I mean it takes like 30 seconds just drop it down to CL 14
and then 36 and command rate of 1 and then on the asrock board in particular I
can't speak for other motherboards on the Azeroth budget boards here they've
got a setting down the bottom where they can optimize the secondary timings so if
you enable that you'll get some decent performance as we saw in the graphs here
and you can use the stock cooler and grab yourself a cheap motherboard and
you're gonna have great price performance especially with the
mid-range grabs guard or if you can pick a graphics card off the use market for
cheap now with the be 550 m still legend it's
a mid-range board and so I could probably get another 75 mega Hertz out
of this CPU which I have done in the past but I use that on a phantom gaming
X which is one of the best X 570 motherboards you can get out there in
the market so I don't see anyone really spending all that premium on a
motherboard just to get 75 mega so we coupled it with a mid-range be 550 we
use 3200 mega at seal 16 lock those timings in for today's comparison and it
beat out the i3 10 100 F now one thing that I'm doing with this comparison here
today is that I do disable spectre and meltdown updates on the intel side of
things but then i leave those patches on with the AMD testing and the reason
being is because on the AMD side of things it actually performs better with
those patches left on enabled as opposed to disabled and then on the intel you
see the exact opposite where they perform better with those patches
disabled anyhow with all that discussion and all that tech talk out of the way
it's now time for the big one the conclusion and we'll show some Cinebench
scores here as well r20 and what we can see here is that the 3300 x does benefit
quite well from the overclock it's growing about 2715 points so it's gonna
be better than these other two for productivity the i7 4790k still does
pretty well for a 4 core 8 thread all those years later if you
bought this CPU back in the day you definitely made a good investment if all
you want to do is play games maybe a little bit of productivity and then
we've got the i3 10 100 F bringing pretty good value just like the 3,300 X
now out of the box this CPU does 4.1 Giga that's all core the asrock bfb even
on default or maxing it to 125 watts it didn't make a difference the maxis CPU
could go on this motherboard and also a z4 91 I've tested that in the past is
4.1 Giga it's all core and then 4.2 gigahertz
single core in Cinebench now here's where things get a little bit weird with
the z87 with the 4790k because back in the day this was the first CPU lineup
from Intel that carried the avx2 instruction sets so with the BIOS
programming they weren't kind of ready for the extra heat that the 4790k was
going to have to endure with avx2 instruction sets and so we can see this
in Cinebench when i tried to put the 4.6 giga that's overclock in which by the
way was absolutely fine in games sure that CPU was getting a little bit hot
but it was constantly crashing out in Cinebench ah 20 and then throttling once
I got the overclocked stable in games it was throttling in Cinebench to that
law or 4.4 gigahertz so there is no setting in this BIOS with the AVX offset
so if you do decide to overclock a 4790k you might just want to be careful on
what workload you're doing because if you come into an avx2 instruction set
you may be unstable but then you're completely stable in gaming so that's
one thing that did hold the CPU back and I even deleted it to get those
overclocks and just double check things because the temperatures were getting
awfully high when I was running the Cinebench are 20 though what about power
consumption and his where we're going to be running the power consumption figures
in games because if we're testing these CPUs out in games we should be showing
the power consumption figures in games and this is where the i3 10100 F did do
quite an impressive job coming in with 337 watts on average and slightly coming
under that of the 3300 X out of the box now decided to test in f1 2019 when I
run these tests in the future I'll just test a randomly different game but this
is the in time I've seen when I've compared the
same price point until the same disabuse the Intel's giving some good performance
figures especially in relation to power consumption whilst you've gaming
now the 4790k out of the box 4.4 gigahertz it's doing pretty good but
once we overclock it does start to run away a bit as with the 3,300 X when we
overclock that starting to run away a bit with these power consumption figures
that's mainly because with the 3,300 X and even though this thing's six years
old the 4790k was practically the first time Intel started really maximizing the
most out of their silicon out of the box and so these two CPUs are pretty much
tuned at their max of fishin C sweet spot for performance out of the box so
you don't really have to do a whole lot more to them unless of course you're
playing 49 that's what the results are showing here and now with all that
information out of the way these three CPUs here all of them performed
absolutely fine with the 5700 XT which I don't imagine people coupling this
budget for cause with anything more than this in 2020 even if you buy these CPUs
now and there's an Archie X 36 T out in six months time it's still going to be
absolutely fine with all three of these CPUs so when it
comes to buying advice I'm going to pull up the same kind of advice that I gave
in the 10 400 versus Rison v 3600 and that is you cannot go wrong if you buy a
10 100 or you go out and buy Rison 330 300 X you're gonna get some phenomenal
price performance for your dollars especially if you couple it with a cheap
a 320 be 450 some 30 200 megahertz sale 16 and you just use the stock cooler you
need great price performance for the dollar same with the i3 10 100 and if in
a few months time there's a 10 100 F you can get that with an h4 10 and some
budget memory and just tune it to that sealed 14 2666 and you're gonna get some
good performance now in terms of buying one over the other this is where I give
my advice because this is what I do personally and that is I buy whatever's
on sale and I've done this for years in Australia we constantly have things like
eBay sales retailers like you might computer Alliance they
have their own sales so if the risin 530 600 or the risin 330 300x
is cheaper than its Intel counterpart I'll go buy that if the Intel
counterpart is having the sale and the risin is not I'll go buy that so when it
really comes down to it if you buy either of these CPUs I think you made a
good choice now in terms of upgrade ability you've got of course the choice
on Rison which I do prefer over Intel that's the ability to overclock
especially on a be 450 so B 450 is lookin really good
even in 2020 where AMD flipped on their decision they're going to allow Xen 3
that's rising 4000 series to work on B 450 so that might be an option for you
if you want to get a four core now and you know you're gonna have to upgrade
after you graduate uni or whatnot it's probably better to go with the AMD
because you've got a good upgrade path but that being said since you're still
on a fork or you're gonna have upgrade paths on both Intel and AMD so keep that
in mind but the biggest thing to look out for if you do think you're going to
be upgrading in the future is spend the extra money now on a good motherboard
that will support what you want to upgrade to in the future say for
instance you're on a four core and you want to upgrade to a 12 core make sure
you get a solid B 450 not the entry-level ones that won't do a good
job of handling that 12 core same with the b4 60s get a really solid b4 60
that's going to support a 10 core from Intel if you want to go with that route
anyhow with all that out of the way we've spoken about the new
recommendations now we're moving on to the used price-performance now of course
this here has no upgrade ability the 4790k for this motherboard is the best
in socket but that being said look at the deal I got on this thing a hundred
and forty Aussie dollars for a 4790k 16 gigabytes of RAM one terabyte hard
drive this is good value this is what use price performance is all about and
the numbers are showing that this is beating out the new stuff by quite a bit
so if all you want to do is get into PC gaming get a basic say a snowman CPU
cooler even out of the box 4.4 gigahertz with sixteen hundred megabits XMP it's
going to do a great job of gaming even in 2000
20 so forth Jen in the use scene it's quickly becoming what 1st and 2nd gen
were a few years ago because of mainly those avx2 instruction sets and USB 3 it
makes it very relevant still in this day and age anyhow is all that out of the
way I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then you know to do hit
that like button for us also let us know in the comment section below what you
think of these 4 calls featured in this showdown in today's video love reading
your thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of thoughts offenses we got
that question of the day which comes from mad Mik 82 and he says yo dude
are you on a pillow ad on TV because if not you have a twin out there and
actually I get told this quite a lot like I had someone message me the other
day like dude were you in Broad Beach that's a local town here on the Gold
Coast and I said no I said oh man I saw someone who looked exactly like you so
I'm I guess I must just have that common face like a risin 5 3,600 you know it's
it's just it's what people see all the time or we can put a 10100 over my face
but I do consider myself more towards a 6 core in my efficiency and processing
power that's just how I've seen things in the
past anyway if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content you want to
see at the moment of drops then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell
and I'll see you in the next tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
