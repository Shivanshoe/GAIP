so on here on the desk we've got an unlikely combo that is a del stand meets a Zeus monitor now these two usually don't play nicely in fact they've never been known to show much affection for one another but what we've got here is a possibility that I'm gonna try today and that is trying this free stand which someone gave away to me because they didn't have the del monitor to attach it to and I'm gonna try and stick that on to this right here which is in a Zeus monitor 19 inch which someone gave me for free as well because they had no stand for it so I'm thinking to myself this might work because in the past I have used silicon before and I gotta tell you guys a story about that but first of all let's go head down the hardware store grab a cheap tube of silicon stick this thing on and then let it dry and then we'll get on the story time [Music] tonight [Music] so now we've got back from the hardware store and we've done two monitors in the same time and we've used the silicon to then put on the monitor stand in the back of the monitor and that's gonna take a few hours to cure I'm gonna give it a few hours at least even though it says ten minutes on the packaging since I've used quite a lot and I'm using it for full strength and that it's gonna hold the monitor to the stand I'm gonna give it a few hours now one thing about silicon you'll notice via some of the footage is that I got an alcohol wipe and cleaned down all the surfaces before I ended up applying the silicon itself and that's because you got to get all the dirt and if there's any oil on those surfaces you've got to get rid of that otherwise the silicon won't do its job properly now after you've done this you might want to put some counterweights on the other side like I've done here that's just to even out the balance and make sure it sticks with full strength because the base of the mana stands quite heavy and if that counter pulls it'll basically undo all your hard work and another thing is to once you're done with the silicon tube if you still got a bit left like I do here which I'm gonna use in the future you then just stick a usain in there and make sure you don't lose your silicon you probably like what's it usain well it's a Usain Bolt so now it's time to talk a little bit about story time and how strong silicon actually is and this is from my experience in Japan when I used to use this stuff mainly in 2016 where I was coming into a lot of things where I just didn't have the spare screws I didn't have the tools necessary to make things stick and I was in a bit of a pinch and at that same time there was also this door in my house and this door was just so creepy it served no purpose I never used it I had numerous different other exits that I could get out if there was an emergency in my studio in Japan and so what I did was I at the time I was using silicon and I claimed down the door edges on both sides and then I silicon the whole door off and about two days later when I came back to it I was like all right let's test how strong silicon actually is and then I'm trying to open this door and I was like barging it because it was a really sturdy door was made of that special plastic that they put in bathrooms and stuff that just doesn't break even if you chuck a hammer to it it's extremely difficult to break and so I'm shoulder budging this door I'm doing like running jump and barges at it and it just would not budge one bit and I was like damn at that point I was like wow this stuff is extremely strong so if I'm shoulder charging this door then I know for a fact these monitors aren't going anywhere with the couple of kilos of weight that it's got on it for it to hold now of course before I did this experiment I told a few friends what I was going to do some of them said dude that's not gonna hold silicon's not gonna do the job and I'm like well let's do this video and let's find out but at the same time it's important to see how this stuff works if you've bonded something via this silicon method of course you don't want to be using the monitor and hanging off it with 80 kilograms of body weight but at the same time if you do want to undo what you've done then the easiest way is to just use a box cutter and you go around it because once you I guess slice the bond then it's just back to normal so silicon it does do very well against raw brute force that doesn't do well against I guess things like box cutters going through it where it'll just essentially slice so easy though that being said one of the two monitors here I tried drilling some holes in the plastic just so I didn't have to use those counterweights that I'm using at the moment but the holes were fine but I just didn't have any spare vasive screws and there's one thing about vase screws they're always a different standard especially to all the screws that you got to come into if your PC building so I'd have to go down the hardware store and yet again buy some more screws if I wanted to mount it via screws so really I just didn't want to throw any extra money at these budget monitors but at the same time I'd be drilling through plastic to make the holes line up and the plastic itself is definitely not going to do as good as a job as a silicon bonded to the metal anyhow with that out of the way let's get back to our monitors but also let us know in the comments - if you've had any funny experiences with silicon yourself I love this stuff [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and now we are at the finished product right here on the desk and this monitor has its own cable management at the back too and it's even tilt adjustable so that's a nice little bonus where the actual monitor itself has a resolution of 1440 by 900 I don't think I've had one of these monitors ever because we can see here the resolution on sixteen by nine usually is 1600 by nine hundredths so very odd resolution if you guys have seen this resolution then let us know what monitor was because this one's a little Zeus nineteen inch from I believe 2008 so it's definitely getting on in terms of its age but we can see from the brightness here compared to the rest of the room and that's like an actual spotlight right there that this thing is still bright it's still got life in it it's still a good little monitor and that's what today's video is all about and that is just making something out of nothing if you come across some of these monitor stands then don't be afraid to pick them up especially if they're free and especially people are giving them away definitely take a few because when I see these things on pythons now I'm gonna be getting these monitors stands in as much as I can because when I get a monitor in like this then I'm just going to attach it via a silicon and it's just quick easy and it's hassle-free and it gives a really really strong bond now if you're doing this I would recommend leaving it for a whole day the stuff that I got I've worked with it before I know it cures after about eight hours but it doesn't fully cure for a good day so since it's the monitor it's not too heavy it's not gonna fall off or anything like that but at the same time do do practice safe practices if that's anything to go by and yeah guys just a little tip in today's video on how you can get free out of nothing and Men I like this is gonna go on a combo now so when I sell a budget combo which budget combo pcs trust me they're in some real serious demand I've got someone picking up one of these very soon late at night so that's how hungry people are for this stuff I can't even breathe when comes to juggling pcs at the moment anyway guys if you enjoyed today's video then you know what to do slap that like button for you boy tech yes city brings you that budget whenever he can and also if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying the content and you know what to do hit that sub button ring that bell but also before I get on a tee we got the question of the day which comes from SD rager and they asked can we get some serviceable decent looking coolers from Intel and this is about yesterday's video where we talked about Intel's 10 gen upcoming desktop CPUs where I completely agree with this that's one thing I didn't touch on in yesterday's video and it's one thing that remains to be seen is what box coolers Intel are going to release on these CPUs because AMD have nailed it not just with the cores and threads in the IPC and the value but they've also nailed it with their included box coolers which do a really good job even from the budget range and then all the way up to the top where they've got those RGB bling coolers with something like the 3900 X for example and even though 3700 X gets that RGB bling wraith prism cooler anyhow guys i'll see you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music]
