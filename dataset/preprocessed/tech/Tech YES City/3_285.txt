but on a serious note these glasses they turn everything red they're absolutely phenomenal it's like you breathing a new life [Music] so we've just finished building this gaming pc right here and you may notice that there's no graphics card and this is actually a reality of what is going on in anticipation of rtx 3000 i'm speaking to a lot of different computer shops and there are a lot of people coming in and just getting everything but the gpu and my answer to this is if prices are good on all components right now except the gpu and accept the cpu because you may wish to also think about holding out for zen 3 which is also right around the corner so that's hopefully going to bring some improvements on the amd side of cpus and so if you can get all these other components like the ssd the ram the motherboard the cooler the case the power supply and they're pretty good prices where i feel going forward especially when these graphics cards the rtx 3080s come back into stock and also the new zen 3 cpus are released you only really got upside risk of all these other components going up in price when these launches happen so my suggestion would be if you can afford to get all the other components right now and you are a hundred percent certain that you're going to be getting an rtx 3080 build happening then it is certainly not a bad idea to go get an rtx 3080 ready pc in the works but also right now one thing we're going to check out which you guys have requested is an under vaulting guide to see how the rtx 3080 stacks up in terms of performance when you undervolt it versus its out of the box settings now i recently took a look at the tough gaming and this thing was very impressive out of the box as well as when you overclocked it i'll put the link to that review up here if you want to check it out so let's quickly chuck this thing into an intel test bed and then chuck it into an amd test bed to see not only how it undervolts but also we'll be comparing some figures against the cpu that we're putting in here the 3800xt versus the 3950x versus the intel [Music] 10900k [Music] uh and here we are just finishing up with undervolting this gpu now i was shocked at how much uh better the gpu was in terms of efficiency after doing this and we really didn't lose any fps at all in fact the worst case scenario we saw was shadow of the tomb raider we went from 83 to 81 fps and then horizon zero dawn we lost one fps and then doom eternal we lost one fps as well however the power consumption in some cases was going near 100 watts less draw and this is pretty much for similar fps so big thanks to you guys in the comments and also the gpu report they're a check publication and they just basically showed what settings they had to give the best results in their video and i just pretty much copy pasted that because it's going to save me a lot of time so essentially you just jump into msi afterburner and then you can just hold shift and drag the whole curve down so the max part is at 1800 megahertz roughly then you can raise up the 805 millivolt section up to 800 megahertz lock that in and give it a go and that's exactly what worked on my settings i pretty much just copy pasted it off this video so full credit to the gpu report for that trick and then of course your power consumption is going to be a lot less when i first started seeing it from the wall i was like whoa is this for real and uh this is definitely one of those times where you will want to undervolt and this is easily the biggest difference i've seen with undervaulting for this card it's quite impressive [Music] so now we finished up with the 3950x overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz tested that against the 3800 xt versus the 10 900k across three different games here at 4k to see what kind of a difference it makes and you're really only losing a couple of fps going from ryzen to intel but of course if we start dropping the resolutions in certain games there may be bigger differences so it all depends on what you want to do but basically what we're seeing just from that test alone is that pcie gen 4 is not going to make a big difference at least for an rtx 3080 but i will be making a separate video for pcie gen 3 versus 4 because i've got some other interesting tests that i want to do with that and i'm thinking something along the lines of a xeon however you may notice from the b-roll that azusa and kingston sent over some of their parts and azus sent over their rog line of case power supply cooler and also their motherboard they wanted me to take a look at it and stress test it and basically see if it's rtx 3080 ready same with kingston they've got some really nice ddr4 memory here and also their kc 2500 ssd which is a real value orientated line of nvme ssd the kingston ddr4 rgb memory this stuff we had four sticks of this for 32 gigabytes in total honestly if i was going with a rtx 3080 or 3090 build i would opt for the 32 gigabytes over 16 gigabytes even if the 16 gigabyte kits were a little bit faster because some of the games now especially if you've got all these other applications open and you're playing games you may need more than 16 gigabytes so this stuff here 3600 megahertz xmp it locked in with four sticks absolutely fine with the 3950x and also the 3800xt so the compatibility is there through the zeus motherboard the kingston memory and the cpus imc it's all good to go but in the meantime we'll check out things like this motherboard right here which is the b550 strix f and testing this out with a 3950x even though we're using a 3800 xt in today's build which is pretty much all you're going to need for 4k gaming once you get 8 core 16 threads you're going to be absolutely fine another thing about the 3800 xt-2 is that it has higher clock speeds than the 3950x and it's actually more of a capable overclocker especially for games it will do a slightly better job than the 3950x however this motherboard we're coming in with vrm temperatures that are under 70 degrees even with a 3950x that's overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz now this thing is drawing 250 watts direct draw power so i'm loading up this vrm with a lot of heat and this motherboard and its design is doing a really good job so if you want something that will handle everything now and even a zen 3 higher stand processor later overclocked then this motherboard is certainly not going to disappoint now onto the memory we did load this up 3600 megahertz over 32 gigabytes across four dimms and on the center bench scores you may notice that they're usually slightly higher and so having four dimms as opposed to two dimms at 3 600 megahertz same speeds will actually give you a slight performance improvement as we can see with these cinebench r20 scores where usually these clock speeds i'll just etch over 10 000 points we see here we're etching over a lot of the times 10 100 points as for the onboard audio they're using the realtek 1220 was surprisingly a pretty powerful headphone amplifier which will do a great job to pretty much any mid-range cans though looking at the frequency response curve 0 to 10 hertz we only had a minus 1.2 decibel roll off and then the rest of the frequency response line was pretty much perfectly flat looking at crosstalk numbers there are minus 88 decibels even at a 100 volume however other things that are checking out on this b550 motherboard is the heatsink designs because we don't have pcie 4.0 on the chipset but it's just directly to the cpu we don't therefore need a fan on the heatsink and also the m.2 temperatures are really well controlled and the speeds at least in this case we had a pci gen 3 ssd those speeds were absolutely fine in conjunction with this motherboard but keep in mind you can get pci gen4 ssds and they will go even faster they'll look at the usb 3 speeds the neck speeds those were all fine when i tested them but you've also got wi-fi 6 included if you wish to use that over a traditional ethernet cable so the motherboard in today's build is probably my favorite piece however moving on to the case this is the helios this thing straight away is a really heavy case it's got these straps on the top which i actually use them to carry the pc around if i've got to move it i would have to say that it's a little bit too big for my liking but it does have tempered glass all around on the sides and the front and the front actually lights up the glass which is a pretty cool look though the most important thing with the case especially when you're going with a higher end build is the temperatures and more importantly the airflow and so testing out this case where they've actually gone with four 140mm fans that are non-rgb these fans do a pretty good job especially when it comes to remaining quiet and also pushing through airflow and so when we loaded up the rtx 3080 tough and we stress tested this gpu with firmark with the glass on versus off and what we saw here was that having the glass on really only gave us a one degree drop which means that the case itself is designed pretty well and since the rtx 3080 tough is dumping a lot of heat just directly in the case having airflow is an important thing so although the case is really heavy and quite expensive it does do its job that it's set out to do but the strix power supply that did a really good job if you want to go with an rtx 3080 or even 3090 then this power supply is going to give you more juice than you could ever imagine as well as you want to overclock say a 3950x and overclock your graphics card this power supply will be able to provide all the what's needed to do that though i will say one thing about the rujin 240 although it's going to be absolutely fine for a 3800 xt and even a 3900x when it comes to a 3950x overclocked the temperatures were going a little bit higher than i'd be comfortable with so i've said this with the 10900k and also the 3950x if you want to go with either of these cpus in your main rig i would personally go for a 280 mil solution or a 360 where i feel like they just do that bit better of a job especially when you're overclocking you want to get the most out of your gear and your power supply motherboard can support it and those few extra degrees make all the difference so now it's time to conclude the whole video and basically if you want to get a rtx 3080 ready gaming pc then by all means go find the deals go get the good stuff and build it up now in anticipation of the rtx 3080 because from all the tests that i've done here coupled with the 120 hertz 4k oled experience i am really really enjoying this stuff it's for me it's just a whole new world of pc gaming and i think and it's honestly for the rare few at the moment who are on this combo they will be able to vouch for it and tell you how good it is at the moment i really am enjoying pc gaming again i just want to go back now and play through a lot of games that i've sidelined because of beforehand just not really enjoying myself on these monitors and i've always been a fan of gloss and i've always been a fan of proper backlighting for your eyes and so these oleds just have all of that combined with the 4k 120 hertz 10 bit factor anyway enough of that rambling aside basically if you can't get an rtx 3080 for now then you might want to put in a 5700 xt and you're probably going to wire 5700 x10 and so on the used market this graphics card has the best resale value believe it or not and that's because it's the most in-demand card for crypto currency miners where if they're cheap enough they'll pick up a 5700 xt or two and then put them on mining where they can tune them and make them more efficient where the rtx 3080 really it's not as appealing as the 5700 xt especially at the moment where it's going over those msrp prices though don't worry i'm sure the crypto miners are sitting there waiting for these cards to come up at msrp so they can snatch them up but in the meantime if you want to play some games and you're in waiting in the queue the 5700st is going to give you really good frame rates for now and then when you're ready and when rtx 3080s are in stock and they're at decent prices then you can trade that over and resell your 5700 x 10. you should be getting some really good value for your dollar still and playing games in the meantime because i know a few people i know actually quite a few people locally here built pcs up in anticipation of getting in the first wave of 3080 and they just completely missed out anyway guys if you missed out on the first wave don't worry there is stock coming i talked about this in yesterday's vlog i'll put the link up here and with that aside if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button for us also if you're new around here and you want to see the content as soon as it drops be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and with that aside we've got the question of the day here which comes from the silly 202 and they asked my question is does it matter that you have a 120 hertz monitor when your gpu can only get you 67 fps i have an rtx 2080 ti i'll get the 30 90 when it comes out and in 4k the game sims i actually play a very demanding x-plane 11 fs or flight simulator 2020 armor etc those in 4k don't even get 60 fps average so what is the point of a hertz monitor to me so to answer this question if you're only getting 60 fps in the games that you're playing then yeah there's practically no point in getting 120 hertz where you're just going to be refreshing the same frame twice of course in a world of technicality you may be drawing that frame faster than you would on a 60 hertz monitor but uh is eight milliseconds really worth all that extra money but on a serious note if you get a 30 90 you definitely will be getting a lot more fps than a 2080 ti and especially if you want to delve into the world of overclocking and then play around with the settings even in those really demanding titles you should be able to get close to 120 fps at 4k and for me personally it's just it's really good i'm loving it anyway hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] yes
