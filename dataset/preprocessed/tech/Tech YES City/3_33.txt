i7 12 700 k tray cpu now tray cpus are a great way to save a few dollars if you're building a new pc and you want to go with a custom aftermarket cooler which in today's build we will be doing so you won't get the retail box and if that cpu comes with an included cooler you won't get that cooler either however in today's build we are going with a higher end option but we're still going to be delivering great value for money so let's check out what we're going to be putting together here today and then we're going to see the before and after because your boy at tech yes city loves under vaulting and maximizing the efficiency out of his builds in 2022. if you're looking for a premium motherboard for your amd ryzen cpu then today's video sponsor asrock has you covered with the b550 taichi razer edition you get 16 phase vrm nahimic audio wi-fi 6 a 2.5 g nick and of course razer chroma rgb links in description below to find out more welcome back to tech yeah city now in today's build the case the 5000 t from corsair and also the z690 riptide from asrock were sent out for me to take a look at and i've been meaning to take a look at them for a while now but i got pretty sick earlier in the month and then after that i had to do some tech yes therapy so at the front here we've got a magnetic cover which includes a dust filter and then behind that you've got three pre-installed light loop 120 mil fans which is connected to the included commander pro from corsair the rgb controller which then hooks up to your motherboard gives you control of all your rgb not just on the case but the fans too then at the top of the case we've got four usb type a ports and a usb type c as well as your audio which is a hybrid 4-pole jack reset button and power button with what i would call a aggressive mix of new and retro from corsair if you guys have bought corsair cases in the past you'll know that some of the curvature is coming back that was on the older style cases that has made its way back into the 5000t and i gotta say the styling from the get-go looks really cool as well as the bottom feet which reminds me of the 780 that corsair brought out quite a while ago i actually did a custom build on it so i'm very familiar with this case and this is going to match our motherboard's color scheme perfectly which is the z690 phantom gaming riptide from asrock it's got a 13 phase vrm as well as having heat sinks on all those mosfets ports so not only is the board coming in with a decent price for a brand new z690 but it's also got ddr4 support instead of ddr5 so you can save money on your ram and so later on when we do some stress testing we'll be looking at the 12700k temps fully loaded up on this board as well as under vaulting and what we can do with this particular mobo though we've also got 32 gigabytes of corsair dominator platinum rgb ddr4 memory and this is 3600 megahertz so it's going to be quite quick great for a 12 700 k to match up for that beautiful snappiness then for the ssd we're going with a p and y pca gen 4 cs21 and now this ssd it doesn't have a heatsink but that's not a problem because our motherboard does include one heatsink at the top here now with any pci gen 4 ssd i do recommend covering it with a heatsink because you want to keep those temperatures down as opposed to a pca gen 3 ssd generally you won't need a heat sink on those but for the cpu cooler we've got none other than the snowman the 20 aliexpress value banger i absolutely love this cpu cooler it's just phenomenal value for money and of course i believe i haven't actually tested it yet but i believe it will keep the 12700k completely under control now for the graphics card we've got the rtx 3060 ti this in my opinion is one of the best newer cards to get in that the 360 ti at its msrp i feel was the best new card in terms of value for money to hit the market but also this 360 ti i managed to pick it up in australia for under msrp though with any rtx 3000 series built i strongly recommend getting a solid power supply and what we've got right here is the rm850i from corsair it is a monster in terms of its power delivery but it's also got very low ripple which means that if we're under volting or even overclocking we can get the best efficiency because our power supply can deliver the power at a stable voltage so our first problem that we have come into after installing the cpu is actually mounting the cpu cooler and this is where the bracket included with the snowman doesn't officially support lga 1700 but we can get around this by mounting the clips vertical instead of horizontal and that will be absolutely no problems at all in the end and i've actually tried this out before and it works just as it would on any other socket so that's one problem we've come into but it's one problem that is easily fixed so you don't have to worry about getting a snowman and being like oh my god it's not going to fit as opposed to some metal bracketed coolers that you'll have to drill holes and do all sorts of janky stuff this is actually a real easy fix [Music] so the second problem we came into was the hard drive cage is mounted forward in this case in its first position we have to take it back and move it back a notch and also pre-install our modular cables on the power supply before we put that in and so that will just take a little bit of extra time because this power supply here the rm850i is actually longer than a lot of say 500 or 600 watt power supplies [Music] and this build is now complete and it was absolute breeze to build in after we moved that hard drive cage and then fitted the power supply everything just fitted really quickly i didn't even need to remove this shroud here for the cables and running them through the grommets it was actually a little bit of room there to do that everything was just smooth sailing the cable management was super easy at the back you've got the included straps or you can use zip ties both are included and you get a lot of them for doing a mighty fine job there's also this airflow mount at the front if you don't wish to use the hard drive cage at all and keep that out you can install this now you may notice there's also two temp sensors included with the commander pro on the 5000t so what i've decided to do is quickly mount one up the bottom and one at the top that way we can check the case temperatures top and bottom since cpu dram and also vrm and gpu temperatures will already be reported in software so it's handy to know how the airflow is going to turn out with top and bottom manual sensors just to find out that information though one thing i am a little bit worried about is there is no exhaust fan included with this 5000 t so we're going to get onto some temperature tests now and then also if we need to see how the build runs with an exhaust fan too and glass on versus off so let's get into those tests [Music] [Music] [Music] put your hands up in the air [Music] so now we're finished up with this build and there is some massive differences that can be had from simple tuning with the bios and also using some software like msi afterburner let's get over those results for you guys straight away where default out of the box running unigene heaven and cinebench at the same time this build went up to 562 watts and the problem with the cpu cooler was the snowman made its match it wasn't enough out of the box to cool down the 12700k where it went up to 206 watts raw cpu power consumption so out of the box the 12700k in my opinion isn't tuned for the best efficiency and that shows when the cpu is going up to pretty much 110 degrees in the software so how we got around this was we managed to go into the bios put an offset on the cpu minus 100 millivolts and then put it down from 4.7 gigahertz to 4.6 gigahertz all core as well as dropping the efficiency cores down 200 megahertz and this then netted us the same cinebench r23 result score actually slightly better with this undervolt but our temperatures on the cpu were now 80 degrees with the snowman and more importantly the power consumption went down to 132 watts so we lost absolutely no performance but also at the same time dropped our power consumption on the cpu by a massive 33 percent roughly now moving on to the graphics card here out of the box will go over 200 watts and then under vaulting this to 1800 megahertz saw it dropped down to around 130 watts so when we re-ran the stress test and running a time spy benchmark showed that we actually gained performance on both cpu and gpu so the power of under vaulting should never be ignored especially with these newer parts where intel amd and nvidia are going for this max performance at all costs sort of scenario and instead i feel like they've left efficiency on the sidelines so i feel like if you're doing a newer build it's very important to take advantage and we recently also did this with a mini itx build that we did i'll put the link up here but now it's time to look at some of the components individually besides the 12700k and the gpu where they run absolutely amazing even with a snowman with 20 cpu cooler once you undervolt them but the 5000t this is the case from corsair coming in at 399 usd or in australia 450 aussie dollars it is a very expensive case actually it's the most expensive case i've taken a look at from corsair so it is asking a lot and i would really only see this case fit for someone who loves the look of this case and loves all that rgb with six individual led light strips the light loot fans the commander which you can control from the software it offers a lot of customization in terms of rgb however i do feel like corsair needed to add in a an additional exhaust fan on this build not just to complete the look in my opinion but also help with temperatures and we'll pull up some temperature results here where out of the box we had the graphics card at 100 fan speeds in a 27 degree ambient environment going up to 72 degrees with the glass on and then when we opened the glass sort of replicating an open test bed setup we went down to 70 degrees and then once we added in the exhaust fan we went down to 69 degrees in that same scenario and then with the glass closed 71 degrees so an exhaust vent will help out and lower the temperatures but also the temp sensors that we added in before from top and bottom that dropped two degrees on both sides the z690 phantom gaming riptide from asrock this board actually really impressed me going up to 68 degrees with those 206 watts out of the box on the vrm the software reported 69 degrees and the heatsink went up to 50 degrees this is quite a lot of power to put through that vrm and it handled it absolutely fine and then moved through the onboard audio if you've got a set of mid-range cans this is going to provide actually a pretty solid experience with crosstalk levels and frequency response curves being absolutely fine though the main star of today's video the 5000t from corsair i'm going to give you guys my thoughts and opinions on it i think it's very expensive it's coming in at 399 usd in australia 450 aussie dollars and this is a very steep asking price for a midsize atx case and in fact recently testing and building in the 5000 d i'm going to say that i personally prefer the 5000d where i think corsair really set the benchmark extremely high on that case in terms of its price and build quality but more importantly it comes down to personal preference where for me personally if you're looking for a larger mid-size atx case the 5000d is not just my favorite case from corsair but it's also my favorite midsize atx case period it has this very clean look to it sort of comparing the 5000d to the 5000t it would be kind of if you guys are into cars be like comparing an r32 gtr with the more boxy look to the r33 gtr with the more curvature sort of look and for me personally i prefer the boxy look i think it's very clean but it's each to their own and in this case if you're looking to get the 5000 t and you love the look and especially if you love rgb then this case will deliver on that aspect but just keep in mind the price differential between the 5000 d and the 5000 t is quite big so it is a lot to stomach and i'd say you would only be going for this case if you've seen what it can do and you really fall in love with the look of it other than that it's not really a value play here from corsair though again back to that critiquing point i would have loved to have seen corsair add in that additional fan but the case itself very high build quality you've got ample room for cable management and there's a lot you can do inside the 5000 t without much effort to get a really clean finish so do let us know what you think of today's build in the comment section below i'll also leave some links for some of the parts that we used in today's build if you want to build something similar and also let us know in the comments what you think of the 5000 t in particular and love reading those thoughts and opinions just like this question of the day here which comes from loyal's review and they asked i was messing around with my motherboard bias and now it won't turn on is this bad and basically if you've been messing around the bias you've probably changed a setting maybe clocked the cpu too high without giving it enough voltage or put in a too high ram overclock and now it just won't boot and so the easiest way to do this is just to reset the pc by turning off the power supply at the back and then leaving that off for say a minute or even trying to press the power button to drain the power fully and then taking out the little circular battery you may have to remove your graphics card in order to do this and then leave that battery out for an additional minute then put it all back together turn it on and your pc should boot absolutely fine if it doesn't boot fine after that you may have damaged something overclocking so do keep that in mind that it's always not a guaranteed thing to be messing around in the bios if you aren't familiar anyway hope that answers that question and i will catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're joining that tech yes
