in a previous video we did here at tach yes City we took a look at the Z 200 workstations series and how you can use them for gaming on a budget but here on the desk we've got the Z 620 workstation now the thing about these is they're generally more expensive if you go on eBay and look for one of these you can be paying up to 350 USD and in Australia 500 AUD and upwards though for that extra money what exactly do you get and how does it differ from the Z 200 workstation series if you want to make a budget gaming rig let's take a look and explain all in today's video but before we do that a quick word from today's video sponsor you're looking for a single and Windows 10 Pro user license for as little as 15 US dollars and use the link below from SCD case wack that coupon code in TYC sk and you'll save yourself 12 percent on checkout you then get your key which is usually instant delivery whack it in click activate and you've now got rid of that annoying Windows 10 needs activation logo links in description below so it all began for this series with the original Z 600 and this was the business counterpart to the enthusiast X 58 which is very dear and beloved in the community of enthusiasts that being said what made this series so special ver say that Z 200 series is that it's supported ECC registered memory and you usually got more memory support in total also since the round is easy seeing registered it is tailored towards people who can't afford to have that very rare once in a blue moon crash though these systems generally had an entry starting point of 16 hundred and fifty dollars and then this series would be superseded by the one that we have here on the desk that is the Z 620 this came in both Sandy Bridge and then later Ivy Bridge formulas where has supported up to 96 gigabytes of ECC registered memory as for the chipset we have the C 602 and just like the one before at the 520 it's essentially the workstation counterpart to the enthusiast x79 there with this business grade multiple as those generally no overclocking allowed however one thing that was cool about this era especially the first raishin of the Z 620 workstation was that it had a FireWire on the front and back which is something that was being phased out in the x58 era but it still managed to make its way to the Z 620 workstation there was also some cool new technologies introduced at this time USB 3 at the front and another cool thing was this was officially when PC a 3.0 x16 slots were introduced despite people telling you that it was actually introduced on AV bridge it actually came out on Sandy Bridge ep so after the Z 620 came the last of its kind the Z 640 and this used the c6 12 chipset which again was the business counterpart to the enthusiasts great x99 now here you saw ddr4 being implemented as well as those v3 haswell's which supported up to 18 cos 36 threads on a single socket solution though the sweet spot here is easily the z6 20s as a z6 hundreds are generally considered outdated and the z6 40s are generally considered way too expensive so besides the negatives of it being more pricier than a z6 200 series it is also a lot heavier so if you plan on lugging this around the land parties or you just like to move your PC and do some exercise with it then this will generally be a bit heavier and could be a bit more strenuous than using say a Z 200 workstation though those negatives out of the way there is a lot of pros about this first being the power supplies fitted in these things in the unit I've got here today we've got an 800 watt power supply it is absolutely massive it'll power things like an RT X xx atti even an OC edition absolutely no problems and now they also on these units use really high-grade power supplies so the efficiency is not only high but the power delivery is also very consistent however if you did follow us on Twitter I did tease something that was really unorthodox and that is I was testing out the sense wise on graphics cards that needed 8 pins because this unit only comes with two 6-pin adapters or at least the model I got here I had to improvise a little bit and that if I use cable extenders they actually weren't long enough and since it's very hard to take off the back panel of this case I then decided to try a new trick and that was just wire up to sense wires and then solder it onto the bottom of the case obviously the test pilot does look a lot worse but it was just a concept that actually ended up working so if you want to get around that 8-pin dilemma like I did here then you can generally get your soldiering iron out and have a little bit of fun another thing that honestly blows me away about these Z 600 workstations is quite simply the cooling even on this Z 620 workstation here the Sandy Bridge era we've got active cooling over our memory as well as to outtake fins which do an extremely good job of cooling when I tested the CPU temperatures we actually came in three degrees lower than leaving the side panel off which means that HP even back in the day definitely contracted someone who knew what they were doing to make this case design and the good thing is the noise is also really well controlled I'll let you guys have a quick listen while we're doing some benchmarks though those GPU numbers another good thing there was that we averaged out at 73 degrees both with the side panel on and off and this is with an open-air msi overclocked edition 980 so the power supply is good the cooling is good and also the room inside allows you to put in those extra extended graphics cards now unfortunately with the unit I had here you may have noticed one more thing and that was I was using a little bracket to support the SSD and that's because the person I bought it off didn't include any of the extra hard drive base so again I had to improvise a little bit but what we've ended up here with is a system if the drives are already installed all you generally have to do is add your graphics card in and you've got one of the easiest pre-built pcs you could make in your life though the last thing to talk about is the actual specs in this system here and what we've got is a Zeon 1620 or basically an i7 38:20 equivalent in that also we can't overclock on this workstation system which is another little negative however it's not that bad of a deal since we do have also quad channel memory on our memory itself so this means we're gonna get a lot more bandwidth and that we don't have to really worry about overclocking our memory per se but of course the CPU speeds I would like to see if I could get a little bit more out of that but for me personally and the 350 Aussie dollars that I paid for this system that's really not a big negative because we're gonna now couple it with the GTX 980 and then run some benchmarks for you guys and then see how that fed against the 9900 K but also the previous Z 200 workstation series that we tested and that was with the gtx 1070 but the benchmarks begin [Music] now sometimes a root PC needs to be owned by a brave man what are you going to say about that daddy well that's why this is my PC and with the benchmarks out of the way we have a system here that is running really smoothly at least with the games and the limitations set by the GTX 980 when it came to f1 2019 the card performed really well at least compared to the other cards in the benchmark and going up to a 9900 Kay really didn't represent any extra fps now the GPU was already being maxed and that was the limiting factor may be able to call a Judi warzone sure the GPU was yet again being utilized to its max potential but it was a far cry from being anywhere close to a gtx 1070 as well as say a gtx 1650 super and a 5500 XT meaning that optimizations for the gtx 980 Neriah for this graphics card but also the cpu was shadow of the Tomb Raider where I couldn't even get this game to run in DX 12 unfortunately but when we ran it in dx11 we did see a lower FPS and then when we stepped up to the 90 100k we did get quite a big boost but it was still again way off that of a gtx 1070 as for the 1% in point one percent loads it was a really smooth experience on this PC so in 2020 this combo right here can still get up and Bowie the idle power consumption was around about a hundred watts and then when we stepped it up to Call of Duty warzone it was juicing around 310 watts from the wall so what we've got here ultimately with the Z 600 series especially with the Z 620 on the desk is something that has great temperatures and then the cases got really good airflow both CPU and GPU temperatures are really well controlled you've also got the option to add more cause if you want to step it up to say an 8 core Xeon you can do that even with a V 2 there's some more good news with this system is since it had windows 7 pro originally that enables us to then activate Windows 10 Pro for free and of course it's a really quiet system in operation the power supply is phenomenal even comes included with a speaker built into the desktop itself though although I picked up this system for a really good deal the Z 600 series is actually quite expensive even to this date and the reason being it's still a flagship system in its class and at the Z 600 s with a flagship of the single socket solution then we have the Z 800 series which is the dual socket system solutions and so what you're seeing here is that people who bought these back in the day for quite a sizable sum are probably still happy with them and that it can still do all the things they need it to whether it's video editing or producing music so instead of that said person going out and buying a new higher end system which will probably cost them a lot of money they then just decide to replace the parts that have gone faulty or of course they may want to get some upgrades and get more life out of this thing so that now leads us to the question of should you consider buying a Z 620 in 2020 and my answer is if you can get it for a deal especially locally then definitely yes it's a clean system runs quiet great temperatures and of course it can support higher in graphics cards which the Z 200 that was more capped out at mid-range graphics cards and another really good thing at least for the Z 620 workstation even versus the Z 640 is that it supports the ddr3 registed ECC memory which is generally really cheap on the used market so you can get 32 gigabytes have it in quad channel and you'll be getting really smooth frame rates with even something like an RT X 2060 Super though with all that out of the way do let us know in the comments section below what you think of the Z 620 you came by one would you pick it up if so why if not why not love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from Devon RAC let's try that again it comes from Devon Reggie Karuna and they asked hey I live in Australia and where did you get a power supply for 10 Ozzie dollars I can only find them for around 60 at least thanks and they're referring to this video I'll put the link up here where I picked up a decent power supply for 10 Aussie dollars but the problem with that was that was over a few months ago and since then the whole market gone completely haywire and that's probably even an understatement so if you're looking for a power supply nowadays even on the used market and it's of decent quality you can expect to pay a bit more than 10 Aussie dollars of course with that in mind if you do come into a bargain then always be quick on that and snap it up anyhow I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you enjoyed this one then you know what to do and also if you stayed this far and you're not yet subbed in you're enjoying that content sub button ring that bell to get the content as soon as it drops and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] and dad man finally this video is finito LD toh do you know what that means in English that means it's finished finally I've found someone who understands my Spanish thank you
