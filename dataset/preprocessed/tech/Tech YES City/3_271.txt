it has been a very long time
since we did the last episode of the $100 flip up challenge and we've had some
hurdles that's for sure when we started this
at the start of the series we then got hit with a massive lockdown
after that we then had a quick taste of success where
we went from episode two to episode three really quickly
and then episode four this is today's episode the reason it's taken so long
to do this episode is because i had three pcs that i traded for the two in
the previous episode and these pcs i'm not gonna lie these
pcs weren't much to work with in terms of
aesthetics let's put it that way so it did take me
quite a while to get the funds that i was
looking for for these pcs so what happened was
the first rig we had we had this aerocool case this strike x case this
white bill with an i7 and a 1060. we ended up flipping that
for 950 aussie and now all the prices in today's
uh series in this whole series is in aussie dollars so
one aussie dollar is weaker than a us dollar so you can do the conversions
or actually i'll put the conversions up on the screen for you
as we go along but we sold that first pc that was the first to go
surprisingly and then the next pc was an rtx 2060
and an i5 9600 kf and i blinged this thing up i cleaned it up really nicely
and so someone contacted me and they said brian would you be interested in
trading three of these pcs that i have for your
rtx 2060 pc and i thought about it at first i was like yeah of course
three pcs for one what specs are we exactly looking at here and then they
said we've got an i5 7500 and a gtx 1070 that was the first pc and
i'm thinking in the back of my mind okay i can flip that pretty easy then
when i saw the other two pcs because they showed me a photo of the first pc
and i was like all right cool then i went over there and the
other two pcs they had decent specs but they were in pretty bad looking
cases i'm not gonna lie these cases i was thinking to myself damn this is
gonna be a pretty tough sell so i cleaned them up as best as i could
but the essentially the second pc was really hard
to sell that was the longest that it took and this is i only sold that this
morning hence why i'm recording this next
episode right now so we ended up selling the first pc out of that trade-in bunch
for a thousand aussie dollars straight away someone actually
came in picked it up they loved the 1070 they liked the look that was the decent
looking rig out of the three then the next one to sell after that was
a gtx 960 and an fx 6300 so this was a six core
old-school fx cpu eight gigabytes of ram and a 960. now
i did have to put an ssd in this thing which cost me another 29 aussie dollars
so i do have to subtract that from my balance of this flip price which i got
500 for which was really healthy and so we
ended up making 470 on that pc and then the last pc to sell was a gtx
1060 and an i7 3770 now the specs were decent
but unironically this pc was the last to sell in my opinion
because it was aesthetically by far the worst it didn't even have a sidewall
actually i had to knock out the side panel on this pc
because it was just scratched and scuffed to the point of no return
and so what we did with that pc is we ended up putting a monitor
and a keyboard and mouse in the combo and so that cost me 50
and so i had to subtract that from the sale price of 800
which is what i got for it so we ended up making 750 on that pc
and honestly in that time as well not only did we have these
aesthetically unpleasing pcs to sell it was also really tough because the
market literally from episode 3 onwards where i'm living locally the market has
just taken a massive and i mean massive dive in terms
of demand and this is due to another trend that i
see going on and i've got to make a separate video about
all this there needs to be a separate video made because
what's going on at the moment is use parts especially where i am at the
moment they're overpriced in general and the new parts are coming in with
such good prices now that it's making the appeal of used
parts a lot less appealing and so there's so
many more factors like trends that are going through with
what customers are looking for and all that other stuff so i will make a
separate video about that but the reason being that it took me so
long to make this episode this time is because the market was just very slow
and i've said this in the past but you do have to be
very patient sometimes otherwise you will end up
losing money but all that aside let's roll
that intro [Music] so carrying on from the previous episode
we had a 145 stash in our sleeve and of course we
used 29 of that for an ssd and we also used
35 for a monitor and 15 for a keyboard and mouse
so we've calculated all that now with the profits that we made from the pcs
and we've now got a tally of 3316 aussie dollars
and on top of that we've still got a small ssd a 60 gigabyte which
i really don't see myself using in this next episode and we've also got a
450 gigabyte hard drive which was in the previous episode we explained
what happened to this drive but the good thing is we've got three
rgb fans 140mm corsair fans and a controller and
we've also got an additional cooler master fan
and a rgb controller so we can sort of play around where i intend to use
that corsair fan kit in this build that i'm telling up right here
so i'm going to detail what i plan to do now because we're ready
to buy an rtx 3080 pc we can build one but i'm not going to stop there because
this is where the market is shifting from it's going from used
into new and with that you can make a little bit of profit
and so in order to survive and thrive we have to initially
adapt and that's what we're doing here where we've pre-ordered an rtx 3080
for 1210 aussie dollars so we've already secured our pre-order
apparently it's coming in the next week which is awesome news and
right in time for what we're going to do here and we've also got a 32 gigabyte
kit of ddr4 memory we've tallied this up for 196 aussie dollars
we've got a motherboard here a micro atx z490 for 199
a 10 700 f for 469 a 650 watt power supply this is the mwes
i've tested these in the past really good power supplies especially
for the doll 75 bucks we've got a case we're going to go with
a little bit of a gamble here this is a case for 78 bucks and we're
going to be adding our own fans in this is an antec
rgb case but i feel like it's got the mesh front there
it can let a bit of air in and since we got the 140mm
support at the back i feel like this case could come out pretty well
and then lastly for the drive we're going with a one terabyte
m.2 from silicon power for 154 bucks which is going to leave our tally for
this build to 2 381 dollars so we still have a massive
reserve pile we're kind of like the warren
buffett now of pc gaming that's what we are we've
got that stash ready to go in case we need it so we can
do some other options along the way but so
basically we have some options here and when i check around and what the
competitors are doing there's uh some places that are selling
rtx 3080 pcs for about i think it's 2 900 and they've got six core 12 threaded
ryzen 5 3600 so i feel like the 10700f could sell
a bit better than these pcs so we're putting this
system together for a really awesome price
and that's the benefit that you're going with now all of a sudden
new parts are just that good to buy and all of a sudden the markets just
swing just like that that's what i said when i decided to
purchase the salmon and avocado sushi for the extra one dollar
as opposed to the chicken and avo sushi for 3.50 so
we can afford that extra dollar now but brian what has salmon and avocado sushi
got to do with picking up pc pots i'm glad you asked well
the salmon feeds your brain the essential fatty oils
that it needs to survive and with that we've found
two two terabyte hard drives for ten dollars each
this is supposedly they work so i'm going to go in the car now and check
them out and if we pick them up then we can even
put one of these in the upcoming build but we've also got now a two terabyte
for another build and we also still want to get a cooler
so i will keep my eyes out for a good cooler that we can match with this build
because the intel uh 10700 f i think it includes the stock
cooler but when we're going with the 30 80 build and of course the cpu cooler
being the center of attention with this build
right above that 3080 i feel like it could use just that little bit spend
that little bit extra to make that bit more [Music] and here we are now on the desk we've
got these two drives right here ten dollar skis a pop and i even tested
them before i picked them up so that was an
epic deal i also got a few more for outside the series as well so in
total i got six of them but i'm using two of these for the series
here today and some other good users i've also
ordered all the other parts in the cart ready for this 3080 pc
when that pre-order comes through so everything is looking like
it's going to plan but now what i'm going to do is i'm going to look for a
few other deals because we still have some
money left over and we've still got a good 900 bucks in
the kitty to make this happen so what we're going
to do now is go on good old gametree and facebook
and see if we can pull up any deals just to even if we can get them for a good
price perhaps we can put together another solid gaming pc in this series
[Music] now
[Music] so we're now finished up on gametree and
facebook and we found a few potential deals here
now with the leftover money that we have it
was like the previous episode where whoever strikes first with the deals
will get the money that i've got sort of thing so
the leftover deals if they get back too slow then i won't
be picking up those deals but what we got here is a potential on a
ryzen 5 3600 they've got bent pins but they're only asking a
hundred aussie dollars for and i took a look at the photo and there's no snapped
pins and now i'm willing to take the gamble here
because i'm pretty good i've had a perfect success rate on fixing bent pins
on ryzen i've gotten really used to it where a lot of you guys have also sent
in your cpus and i've fixed those as well one of them
was really bad to the point where i didn't think i'd get that thing working
and it did work so i'm pretty confident going into this
that if i got this cpu i could fix it and get it working
and of course i offered 80 so i came in with
a 20 under what they're asking and if i get this for 80
and fix it i know it's a bit of a risk but
you got to take the risks to get ahead but the next deal is a really
interesting one because someone's selling three old retro cases
and these things are like 15 years old i think but they're still
brand new in the box and i would honestly love
nothing more than to just do some content
with these cases because i kind of love some of those
old tacky designs that exist especially if they've got those old just really
bright leds which they seem to do in some of those
cases i kind of miss some of that stuff believe it or not and so with three
cases and they're asking 50 aussie dollars i said i'd take the lot
i'm actually waiting for them to organize a pickup date they did say
that we got a deal but it's just a matter of when
i can actually access and get that deal though the next deal we had after that
was an i7 8700 and they're asking 200 aussie i put an offer of 150
so if we managed to snap that up then that could be the head honcho
leading the battlefield in this side project pc
and then the last deal this is the last but not least
it's the ryzen 3 3100 build with all decked out rgb and when i look at it
it's got 16 gigabytes of ram it's got 500 watt budget power supply
it's got an rx 550 which would pull out 120 gigabyte ssd and
what i could do with this if i get it for 400 aussie dollars is i could take
that gpu out and put in like a 1660 super and also
put in this 10 2 terabyte hard drive and
honestly would have a really tight gaming pc for around 700
aussie which would be really good value and so i
think i could flip that easy with all that rgb inside the case so
we're waiting to hear back from them hopefully they take the offer on that
but that side project that is going to be a lot of fun and i
think when we relate that back to the new build
we've pretty much got no risk on the new side of things we get the warranty there
so if something is faulty we can get it replaced for free
that's not going to be a problem i'm buying these all from local places in
queensland around where i live so we're going to
have no problems there in terms of the used parts on this side
project we are taking a bit of a gamble especially if we get the
cpu with the bent pins but i know you guys
will want nothing less from tech yes when it comes to getting the side
project done so that's going to be a bit of fun
hope you guys enjoy that between this episode and the next episode where the
next episode is going to be huge hopefully i can get
two pcs done in that next episode and hopefully
that 3080 pre-order comes in at the expected eta date which is before
the end of this month so i really can't wait to get this done
and i mean i'm surprised that we're kind of
it feels a bit surreal we're already here i mean from episode one
we got the deals and that's what it's all about it's about paying the right
prices being at the right place at the right
time and we've definitely made some good decisions so far now
the market itself is really crazy from when i started this series
i did not intend for 2020 to go down the way it did i don't think
anyone did and so it's just a matter of me just literally
just wheezing my way through this whole ordeal and trying to make
magic happen where especially in the last month
it has been a really tough market it's been hard to sell pcs that's why
this episode has come so slowly because i found it so hard
to move anything for that matter and really you've got to start
competing very hard in this market right now because i feel like it's more of a
buyer's market for pcs especially when you look at the prices
of new parts they have come down a truckload new pcs building them right
now is really cheap especially on the low
end mid range and even sort of like the mid high range
if you're on the high range i know a lot of people
are waiting out for the rtx 3080 builds and they will come in time but in the
meantime building new pcs under a thousand dollars for example
it's a really good time in my opinion where you can get some really good deals
at least on everything but say an rtx 3070 or
3080 because they're going to have some supply problems but other than that i
will say one more thing if you move with the market
and you get in that sort of high turnover
sort of flow then you will be doing a lot better because remember this
if it's a buyer's market then that means if you're a seller for example you're
going to be able to buy parts cheap too it usually correlates well within the
times and the markets that you're in and say for instance a seller's market
then parts are going to be expensive and so it all balances out one another
and right now what you're seeing is the new parts
are definitely balancing out all those overpriced used parts
that are up for sale so a lot of people now are just going to be buying new
parts even if they're pc builders and flippers because a lot
of these stores charge 150 to 200 just to build a pc that's not even in
store windows at least where i am locally and so a lot
of guys are doing this and offering that service pretty much
but they're also tuning the pcs up maybe even delivering them and
customizing them and helping the people out more
so you've got this competition now coming in from the new market which
i honestly i welcome it because i feel like and we're going to talk about this
in that separate video but i feel like the used market is
becoming something a little bit different especially towards the later
half of this year it's becoming definitely so i've noticed some crazy
trends as well so the new market at this point in time
is definitely keeping the used market in check
it's just we're all holding out for that sort of entry mid-range graphics card
to keep the used gpu market in check which that is still out of control
that's the one thing that really needs to be fixed but in the end
the used and the new market they just share this forever
love-hate relationship where they balance each other out
and what comes out of it is just nothing but beauty anyhow guys i hope you
enjoyed today's episode if you did then be sure to hit that like button
also i'll put the tally up on the screen what we've got so far
and now i know there's going to be a few people because this relates to the
question of the day perfectly um they just asked in the xeon video
harold simmons asks why get that if you can get a ryzen and
this is in relation to the 1680 v2 xeon this cpu is definitely more of an exotic
cpu i don't recommend people go out and get this for price
performance it's not one of those cpus and in fact ryzen even the 3100 it's
such a hard cpu to beat it's an amazing cpu four cores eight
threads the latest zen two will soon be surpassed by zen three but i
feel like this cpu is going to be relevant for a few more months at least
until maybe amd releases a ryzen 3 5100 or some cpu similar to that but
as it stands these four cores eight threads they are
really bringing the competition to the market to the point where i think used
cpus in general are pretty overpriced right now and i
didn't think it would come to this but this is what
i'm seeing the new market the ryzen 3 3100
is just bringing really good value for money and it's bringing
really good just usability in that you can get
a a320 low powered low budget board slap it on there 3200 megahertz memory
slap it on there and you've got yourself a really good
price performance gaming pc that honestly
the used market even used first gen ryzen stuff
is going to find it hard to compete with especially for gaming
because you're gonna have to get a better motherboard for that eight core
generally you're gonna have to get a better motherboard for even the ryzen 5
2600 and a better cooler perhaps which the
ryzen 3 3100 that includes a cooler and then you've
got not only that the fact that those cpus
are used and they burn more power too compared to
this little new beauty and of course if you've got
the needs for more cores more threads maybe you're video editing or you're
doing something that needs those more cause more threads
then some of those used options can be great and you've also got the
2678v3 but those xeons and those used ryzen cpus at the moment
they really just for raw gaming performance especially with mid-range
graphics cards right now like a 1660 super or 5700 xt
they're kind of finding it really hard i think
to compete with the 3100s value proposition and that's
what it's about for me at the end of the day it's about getting the raw price
performance for the dollar and the new market is
definitely bringing it so hard and to answer that
question directly harold simmons the 1680 v2
for price performance yeah i would get a ryzen over that too right now
for the 3100 for example unless of course like i said in that video
you got the x79 motherboard for really cheap and you also got maybe perhaps
some other components in a build like a power supply and
some ddr3 memory all mixed in then you could really make something happen which
i have come into this year quite a few times so
that's just that the used market is what it is i don't really
sort of make heavy recommendations for used parts
unless they are readily available nowadays i'll just show you guys what i
get in the deals other than that if i'm making heavy
recommendations on used products i want to make sure there's at least a
bit of stock hope that answers that question it was a little bit more in
depth this time around with the question of the day
i hope you guys enjoy it stay tuned for the next episode and i'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
