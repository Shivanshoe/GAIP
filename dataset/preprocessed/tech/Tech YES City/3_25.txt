if you are chasing an ssd that comes in with a great price and also carries a five-year warranty as well as having the acronis true image software attached to it which allows you to quickly get off a hard drive and then copy all those files seamlessly to the ssd and be up and going with much faster speeds then the wd blue sn570 nvme ssd may be the right choice for you now today's video is sponsored by wd those you guys know i only take sponsorships from products that i believe have merit and this drive certainly has merit when it comes to something that's reliable has a great storage capacity and carries fast speeds and speaking of those speeds here's where i run two different tests with two different programs the first being hd tune pro which then stresses this ssd across a hundred gigabytes this is sort of like a torture test for any ssd that comes through here and here is where the wd blue did well phenomenally well on the read speeds getting over 3 000 megabytes per second across that whole hundred gigabytes then when it comes to the write speeds after about 10 gigabytes it does drop down from 3 000 megahertz down to around 500 megabytes per second so this is absolutely fine if you are a content creator editing 1080p or 4k video where you need those read speeds to be really fast especially as a scratch drive and also if you want to do a fresh install of windows here is where i calculated the time it took to install windows 11 and the wd blue sm 570 nvme also performed really well even better in comparison to the game load times also the second data intensive test was with crystal disk mark and here is where we tested two different file sizes with a one gigabyte and also eight gigabyte test and here's where the speeds actually went above the 3500 megabytes per second advertised on the box so when it comes to advertising i like to see that manufacturers are providing what they say is printed on that box and so wd with this blue sn570 is definitely delivering though the most impressive thing that i thought personally with this drive was those other bench was those other numbers that are showing that the input and outputs per second is extremely high especially for a drive that's coming in under a hundred dollars and also the latency was just as impressive as those inputs and outputs per second making this a very snappy drive for doing a variety of things of course when it comes to video editing if you're a content creator or if you're editing photos this is really going to come in handy to have a fast access time when it comes to moving files around and also accessing those files when it comes to video editing so if you are using an older hard drive or even a 2.5 inch seder ssd this makes a lot of sense to get something that's affordable like the wd blue and also get access to much faster speeds where if we look at the case of the old hard drive things can be very slow to the point where it could break your creative workflow and you may even get other device related issues because things just become so slow and i've definitely seen this in the past with adobe premiere pro where things slow down to a frustrating level and you're trying to figure out what it is so the wd blue if you've got this in your system then you're definitely not going to be wondering if it's your storage that is the problem though speaking of adobe premiere pro if you do get the sm 570 from western digital you also get an included one-month membership trial to the adobe creative cloud and that of course offers more than just a premiere pro you get adobe photoshop illustrator lightroom indesign animator and audition for example of course nvme drives aren't all just about the speeds and lower latencies it's also about lower power consumption too where on my test system i had just the m.2 and then i put a hard drive on later on and the power consumption increased roughly three watts from the wall and i know it's not a huge deal but it's always a decent thing to reduce power consumption especially when electricity prices are going up worldwide the last benefit to an m.2 nvme drive such as the sm570 is that you don't need any extra cables like you would have to use on a traditional hard drive or a 2.5 inch seder ssd you can just simply put this in your motherboard there's also a single sided m.2 2280 pca gen 3 x4 drive so we'll have no problems working on any system that has an nvme m.2 slot all that goodness aside there's really only more goodness when it comes to the sn570 blue and that is you also get augmented benefits like the wd dashboard which allows you to check on the health of your drive very quickly and easily and as we mentioned before there's that true acronis image software which usually comes in at fifty dollars and that's included for five years with the wd blue allowing you to easily copy any drive to the wd blue and make it a true clone or you can just simply back up different files making life transitioning to m.2 nvme that much easier now of course speaking about five years this is my favorite part with this drive is that it's a great value option and comes with that five year warranty now for the blue lineup you can get these in a 250 gigabyte a 500 gigabyte or a one terabyte as we've used here in the video the one terabyte will carry the fastest speeds followed by the 500 gigabyte and then the 250 gigabyte also this drive does use three layer tlc flash memory as opposed to some other drives which may use cheaper four-layer qlc which is much slower than the three-layer tlc featured in the wd blue sn570 anyhow guys that's about it for today's video if you want to check out this drive then i will put some links in the description below big thanks to wd for sponsoring this video out and by the time you see this i should probably be in japan and giving you guys some different kind of content which i'm sure you will enjoy and with that aside do let us know in the comment section below what you think of the blue sn 570 lineup from wd love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from railguard5 and they asked they are letting people visit japan now and to answer this question directly they aren't letting tourists in and i actually am not going there for tourism i'm actually going there to see my son and that's how i was able to obtain a visa hope that answers that question and with that aside i'll catch you guys in the next video very soon peace out for now you
