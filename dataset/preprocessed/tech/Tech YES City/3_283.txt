recently there is a huge amount of users
posting up problems with rtx 3080s crashing
to the desktop and my friend was kind enough to
lend me his non oc rtx tough gaming card which is a
retail sample and this right here is the review sample that asus sent
over so what i'll be doing later on today is comparing
the review sample versus the retail sample in performance
but first of all physically these two cards are
identical and the good thing about the non-oc model 2
is that it's sharing these little more expensive capacitors
on the back just like the oc model now another thing that's been raised on the
internet is that jaystwocents recently posted a video
talking about this whole issue where he references
another youtuber called igor's labs who essentially identified what they think
is a problem in causing the crashing to desktop
issue that a lot of users are experiencing and for
simplicity purposes i'm just going to call these the little caps
and the big caps now the big caps are essentially
cheaper and don't deliver as good of filtration of power
to the gpu as the little caps do and so as this story goes and i will put
a heap of links in the description to js2 census video and also eagle labs
video this story goes that nvidia has a
reference spec for these cards where they're using two
lines of smaller caps in the middle of the gpu
at the back here and then four bigger caps the cheaper
ones on the outer edges and so some of the board partners
have used simply all the six cheap caps and taken out the more expensive little
ones in the middle and so this in turn eagle
believed is causing the issues where you've got
the reference spec design which board partners some board partners not a
zeus some board partners have cheaped out on
and then they're using the reference clock speeds and then that's causing the
issues where it's crashing the desktop and so me personally i just at the
moment i think there's not enough data for any individual out there
to be able to conclude that's the exact issue
and i think in jay's video he nailed it in that it could be a number of
different things right now because one thing i'm going to say is
that this is a completely new architecture
ampere is not touring and when there's a whole new architecture
there is guaranteed to be driver problems and instances where
things will crash to the desktop and even in my review of
the rtx 3080 i pointed out that when i overclocked
it was stable when i was testing games but then when i turned on ray tracing it
was crashing in fortnight and pretty much the exact same spot so
that was obviously a driver problem in relation to the cards themselves and
when it comes to what i think the exact problem is i
think it's this right here the overclocks out of the box i feel like
the board partners have taken these cards
off nvidia and then applied their own custom oc and they haven't had time to
validate them coupled with the fact that it could be
that could be the overclock coupled with the fact that they did use the cheaper
capacitors but for what it's worth i feel like this
is the main problem right here is that the overclocked editions just
haven't had time to properly validate and that's causing
the crashing where i know firsthand i've got a friend of mine
designed by ifr who currently has one of these graphics
cards and he's underclocked it by 50 megahertz and drop the power limit
to 95 just like jay recommended doing if
you're having these problems and that fixed his problems and he no
longer had any crashing after that so if you guys want to fix this if you're
currently having this problem and you want to fix it
you just download msi afterburner i'll put the link for that in the description
below and then you apply the minus 50
megahertz and the 95 power limit so do let us know though
if you do have this problem do let us know in the comments
if it is an oc edition that you're having this problem with versus a non-oc
which is slightly clocked lower anyhow what we're going to do
right now is chuck this retail sample on the test bench and then see how much
of a difference there is versus the oc edition but also see
if the review addition i got sent over is
a cherry picked sample in that it overclocks higher
than that of a retail sample [Music]
and now after testing out the retail sample versus the review sample
i can say that the out of the box numbers
aren't really going to make much of a difference in fact the real clock speeds
that i saw here was 1930 megahertz averaged
versus around 1905. of course they do fluctuate quite a bit the wattage was
also very similar using a little bit more on
the oc out of the box so basically they just
looks like they're giving it a slight boost to clock speeds as well as a
slight boost to the milli voltage and that's how
you're getting slightly i guess slightly higher numbers
if the benchmark permits but i'll throw up some numbers for you guys
here shadow of the tomb raider 4k was exactly the same then horizon zero
dawn was the same thing and doom eternal was the same thing to the point where
the overclocked numbers were pretty much identical so the memory
speeds i managed to overclock them to roughly the same level
getting 10 gigahertz effective on both but the review sample i'm going to give
that some credit here that was looking like
it was a cherry picked sample in terms of how high it could overclock
versus the retail sample which was the non-oc edition but i don't know if that
has to do exactly with azus potentially binning
the oc retail samples versus the non-oc because i don't have an oc retail sample
to compare it to but we can see with the clock speeds this
time overclocking we were getting a sizeable boost on the
oc on the cores on the oc version versus the retail
non-oc version of what it's worth the only time this
gpu crashed out of the application which was unigine heaven
was when i was overclocking the core too high so my guess is with this whole
issue is that it's more an overclock problem where they haven't been
validated properly before they were shipped and so the solution to this is
as we said in the intro is to download msi afterburner down
clock your gpu by dragging the slider down 50
megahertz and also lowering the power limit to 95
and then saving that and then making sure that afterburner opens up when
windows starts as well as making the default profile
that you save the one that boots up with afterburner
and that should stop your crashing because
this is what i've had confirmed by someone who's had this issue
and they've done this and now their card is working 100
but of course that raises the question of what exactly is the issue here
is it the capacitors on the back or is it
more an oc validation now i'm thinking it can be either all but
i'm going to be more inclined to pick the overclocked situation
and those overclocks haven't been validated
and that's what's causing these crashes to the desktops
where they could people could be using these in hotter ambient temperatures
than what they were tested with at the factories and of course when you go
hotter on the ambient temperatures the closer you get to that tj maxx the
more unstable a particular clock level can become
hence the crashing so whatever the deal is uh just like jay
said in his video the difference between 15 or even 30
megahertz as we saw between the average clocks between the
oc model and the non-oc tough gaming model here
that's all it takes to have an unstable graphics card so i'm going to be putting
my money on that in terms of that's the real issue
as opposed to the capacitors sure it's good to have better capacitors on
your cart and i think zeus have done an amazing job this time around with
their tough gaming card i've got the dedicated review up here if you want to
check that out and when it comes to buying a graphics card ultimately the
same price point you're always going to pick the
one with the better components on it that's a given it's just like going to a
car dealer and them asking you okay here's your
brand new car do you want the cheap tires or the more
expensive tires i'm pretty sure like almost everyone's going
to say all right i'm taking the more expensive tires
and so that's exactly what's going on here zeus
have put on the more expensive capacitors
on their rtx 3080s even on their entry level tough gaming
versus some of the other board partners that haven't even followed nvidia's
reference spec and cheaped out on some of the
capacitors i think potential customers when they're alerted to this
they just don't like that in general because there is a reference spec there
and everyone would like to see these companies follow that reference spec
though again what exactly is going on here i cannot tell you anywhere near
100 certainly because i don't have big enough sample sizes
to be able to correlate data and give you even like
high levels of confidence in what exactly the problem is
but one thing for sure is the blame here is definitely
both on the board partners and nvidia i feel like
they needed to validate this whole launch
a lot better than they did and they needed to do a lot more quality testing
it seems because all these problems are coming to
fruition now like we've got the launch problems where you had bots and
scalpers and not enough stock and now you've got
driver issues and potentially now uh clock
issues or overclock issues from board partners not properly getting
these clock speeds right in closing out this video these cards
right here they have both the good capacitors on
them and it's really good to see that zeus
have gone above and beyond to get their rtx 3080s working properly
now in terms of these crashing the oc model could potentially crash to the
desktop just the addition that i have here
exhibited none of that behavior and the non-oc model at least with the
testing that i've thrown this thing through
only crashed when i was overclocking it in heaven
so out of the box this thing is working absolutely fine
out of the box this thing is working absolutely fine
too and with all that aside do let us know in the comment section below what
you think of this whole issue do you think it's
the drivers or do you think it's the clock speeds or
do you think it's the capacitors love reading your thoughts and opinions
