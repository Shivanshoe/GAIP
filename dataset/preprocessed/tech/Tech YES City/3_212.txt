okay we should be live we should be live let us know in chat if we are live and all the audio is good to go so welcome back guys this is the first live stream of 2021 you've got to shake off the uh live streaming at cobwebs and give you guys something interesting to talk about so let us know in chat because i don't know if these streams are working properly or not when i first go live sometimes uh it just like does some okay cool we got some chat coming in it's good g'day welcome guys welcome so today we're going to talk about all the new stuff that was announced at uh ces but mainly the rtx like 3060 and the graphics card situation which i was kind of like amd from what i researched they didn't announce anything like the uh you know like the rx 6700 or something like that i think a lot of us were like okay we want more graphics cards because that is the biggest problem right now is gbus so if you can't get a gpu and we're going to talk about the pricing of this 329 bucks so and you guys are we've got a love heart too already coming in okay chad's cracking already good i should give you guys a love heart back welcome bps customs what's up man did you um yeah i hope things are good all over the world for you guys i hope you're doing well uh this uh new setup you guys are the last video you guys said you love the new fresh tech yes setup going on and um the uh rx 6800 so i announced the giveaway winner on the rx 6800 never replied so then i was i just said to the patrons the patrons really wanted a giveaway so i just said to the patrons we're doing a 6800 giveaway i've got to announce the winner for the 6800 there so i mean if people like you know if you go on for a giveaway and you get announced like i announced it on the last live stream so that was just done live i announced the giveaway winner for the 6800 live and so if the dude's not gonna claim his prize like yeah anyway so for years people like look we need a patreon giveaway so that guy didn't claim his prize so then i was like okay we're just gonna give it away to the patrons so um that was just the first ever so that i don't usually like look to be honest i'm not gonna usually give away like i like to include everyone because yeah all that drama involved with you know patreon and stuff like that but it's um it's uh that's but i'm always gonna be transparent with you guys so we gave away the rtx 3070 pc that was a huge one to a guy in the philippines so he emailed me we got that off to him that was huge like and so i'm all done with uh giveaways right now and also on that live stream we announced some uh a lot of prizes live too so giveaways last month was huge so i'm all out of giveaways so um and then this is a good point like chris chris just raises up in chat why not uh just mail him because i think in ways like i want to give away stuff to people who actually support the channel and watch the videos not some dude who just comes along out of nowhere and says hey i want to win something and then the onus is on me to chase up this guy's free graphics card like i don't know that's just not me man like if i was really into someone's channel and i wanted to win a giveaway i'd be watching their channel like i might i won't enter and you won't see me entering into giveaways on other people's channels that i don't really watch or whatever because like okay that's that's just their channel like you know i don't but if i'm watching a channel i'm really into it if it's a car channel or something like that i'm like okay cool i watch this car channel all the time i give i want to join in for a giveaway that'll you know and so hopefully you'd claim it so that's just my let's all get let's just let's just pick it up though let's pick it up um gpus this uh let's go on to this first topic at hand here so let's move on now too i've got all the specs up right rtx 3060 i couldn't find any um any pictures of this this actual card from what we can see here this is the rtx 3060 right and i was like i was looking for pictures of it and um this is all i could find and that does look like a different uh 3000 series card than what we've got out there at the moment so this one's this one's really really uh different looking in that you can see it's not a 3080 because it doesn't have that x in the middle so they're kind of are they going with just a single fan solution on the 30 60 because that that looks like the only picture i could find but it's coming out late february so this one is like i think at this point in time late february man that's that's another month and a half away it's like 40 something days we need gpus like now this this uh gpu thing is like really heating up and um [Music] it's like we need gpus so this one's coming out late february and then we don't even have a 30 50 or 350 ti yet on the horizon so that one's a little bit that one's a little bit like it's wiring me but we've got some good news because apparently the um we got some good news here with the 30 sorry the rx 570s and four seventies the four gigabyte models and also 1050 tiers we're gonna be doing some videos focusing on these models because the rumors are pretty much true at this stage i am seeing the four gigabyte cards starting to get dumped on the market so that ethereum thing closing up and then uh the dag files getting bigger at least for now is gonna push out the four gigabyte cards and so what you're gonna see is a lot of these i guess there's gonna be a flood of um cheaper graphics cards coming onto the market at least to alleviate the problem until this uh late february situation and possibly if nvidia or amd can get some cards out before then we'll have some really uh really good happy times at least because yeah what i'm seeing with the gpu market right now is just like it it worries me every day i wake up i'm like okay what's going on now and um we'll move over now to like what's going on with aliexpress here is that like cpus are coming down in price right cpus aren't the problem ram is not the problem ssds aren't the problem you can go out and pick up 109 bucks a 3100 shipped worldwide so like everything else is kind of doing pretty well in the market except gpus and so that's like that's the biggest problem right now and i kind of yeah we got to talk about that and this is the one thing like when nvidia did their announcement for the 30-60 it was like why is no one talking about can we actually get one of these cards for 329 bucks i think that's the biggest thing is like where can we buy one of these cards for even close to msrp because with the 3060 ti i know from experience in australia now these things are going over 800 aussie dollars when they first came out it was 699 aussie dollars so that was a uh that was a big thing for me because the prices have just gone up the scarcity of the gpus is going up too so everything's just yeah it's just like i think these companies like especially amd and nvidia need to address the supply problem a little bit more in depth they need to say look we're going to have select retailers that will offer these cards in these amounts at msrp get in quick at least that will be like a solution to say in the short term hey you can get one of these cards at these prices that we're talking about because in the meantime it's just an absolute crap fest out there to try and get a gpu and even people are saying in chat like i'd just be happy with a 5700 xt so i think someone i think people would be pretty happy with just getting a 5700 xt given what's going on at the moment at a good price of course um but the 30 60 uh so i mean i got a 360 ti i bought two of them when i saw the 699 aussie price tag i just snapped up two of them straight away i was like yeah that's that's a good price this is aussie dollars by the way not usd and that was the cheapest ever i've ever seen them for in australia so snap them up get them in hand and then after that they went up in price so uh we're talking about the performance now so this is the funny thing right like video cards have some pretty good leaks about the 3016 you guys probably like how's this thing going to perform and i'm just going to give you guys a straight like quick and easy answer here um cuda core like vram the memory boss is down 25 percent or up 33 depends on which way you look at it you go higher up percentages then you go down it's all just math but the vram this is the interesting thing they're putting 12 gigabytes of vram on the 3060 and that's like that is like as people have talked about this is more this is more than the 3080. and i i don't like have we seen this discrepancy in the past like ever in this sort of like a mid-range card coming in with more vram than the flagship like that one's a little bit that don does sort of make me scratch my head and it's like okay are we going to get a card that has 20 gigabytes of vram on the 3080 side so is that 3080 ti coming and i mean like i i just said like this is the thing i heard everyone was asking me about 30 ti last year and i was like well i just don't see it coming out soon and so the rumors are the 3080 ti's apparently been cancelled or something like this and i'm like guys we can only really work off announcements right and so nvidia announced this 40 days beforehand 40 days before it's coming out they've announced the 30-60 so like are you going to need to get a card with more than the oh wait that's like that's okay i gotta show you guys this holder i just realized like the chat box is covering up all the specs of the 30 and then i'm snapping and snapping and stabbing them i'm snapping okay there we go like that let's have a look there we go that looks a lot better so how is this possible chad's asking how is this possible that the 3060 has more vram than the 3080. it's possible because i'm guessing that gddr6 prices are a lot cheaper than 6x and so i'm thinking amd with their 16 gigabyte display that was sort of winning over a lot of i guess forum debates like it's always good to have more vram i mean whether you need it or not like honestly the 30-60 wouldn't need more than eight gigabytes but putting more on there's always a good thing in terms of marketing so they can always pick up um you know more sales by having more vram there so you're going to see this lead way too definitely you're going to see a 3060 with six gigabytes of vram i think that's coming and that's what video cards were saying in the rumors but in terms of performance we've got less cuda cores here uh to the tune of 25 or like 20 is that 27 less cuticles or something like that and um you got a 25 less bandwidth on the memory so you can expect this thing roughly to perform 25 percent less depends on how hard the boost clocks go i mean these boost clocks look pretty impressive versus the 1.67 on the uh 3060 ti so i'm guessing this thing will come in like they're gonna position it to come in a little bit faster than 2070 super i'd say ever so just edging out a 2070 super that's my guess that's where they'd want it to fit in anyway but the problem is is that how's this gpu my biggest gripe with it is is it going to come in at 329 right because this the 2070 super was uh 4.99 and then this card right here is supposedly 329 but really street prices are going to raise this thing to like 3.99 so this massive generational improvement from the 3000 series card unfortunately due to market conditions isn't going to be realized so this was the big one this was the big one the 30 60 that came out of ces because when i looked at ces we'll talk about some of the other stuff very soon i just wasn't like i wasn't that excited um for laptop cpus which was amd look amd did a great thing with the laptop cpus i just wasn't that much excited for it because i'm more of a desktop guy and even when i go traveling or mobile i do mini itx so like we'll talk about the laptop cpu soon though but what we've got here is uh video cards did announce like these guys are pretty accurate like they're pretty accurate with their some of their leaks i mean some of their leaks are a little bit off but i think that's because nvidia in the last like six months has definitely been playing uh throwing out some fakes there they've been definitely playing the market with some fakes and launching some very uh interesting uh web pages and stuff that sort of like i think the partners have sort of got involved with it a little bit like for instance um there was the galax like we'll talk about the galax thing right there was galax that uh came in with i think it was like a slide where it was like 3080 ti and it was like so obvious that they wanted the public to see this 3080 ti skew right and i was just really surprised because galax i know for one galax is super tight with nvidia because they're an nvidia only partner but i've seen the way like at events i've seen the way galax people have spoke to nvidia reps and stuff and they love each other like nvidia and galaxy so tight there is no way that that 30 tier 3080 ti would have just got casually leaked if that so when i saw that slide back last year i was like yeah this one seems a little bit like an obvious fake so we got a super chat in from matthew lang as well loving the content and decided to hit that donate button uh we're gonna see dab man i i knew this was coming i knew i knew someone would be like yo where's dead man let's get him in the stream all right we'll we'll get all the news done and then i'll give him a call and see if he wants to join up uh in the stream because you guys just yeah we'll get we got to integrate him a bit more in 2021 um and then uh yeah but thanks for the donation brother that was i really appreciate that and uh what's the time in australia right now it's about 1 30 p.m but i i want to hang out with you guys more you guys are saying you love the live streams i just got the new setup done as well like people are loving this new setup i feel kind of proud about my new uh lavender paint that i threw on the wall so apparently it's lavender but people are like no it doesn't come out um who was yeah the giveaway winners we talked about that just before you can just slide back in the uh in the chat um you can go back in the chat and just look at it and the last live stream if you want to see who the giveaway winner was for the 6800 you can just go back to that uh last live stream and watch it get giveaway live um anyway so anyway let's get back to the article so we're just talking about that we'll talk about this talk about that and we'll talk about this and this is the graphics card news so apparently the 3060 was originally meant to be off a um it was meant to have more cuda cores and then it didn't have more cuda cores so this was what we saw here it was meant to have 3 800 and something cuda cores but then they stopped it down on a different die to 3584 and so they're going to make apparently they're going to make the six gigabyte based on the same amount of cuda cores in this but usually if we look at the say for instance the 1066 gigabyte versus the 1063 gigabyte usually they will drop off another cluster and so you'll probably get like 3 000 and low 3 thousands on these cuda core counts here for the 36 gigabyte and then for the 3050 ti and 3050 who knows when they'll come um it's rumored to have a six gigabyte 350 ti as well as a four gigabyte 3050 but man we really need these cards and this is the problem like we've only got a 329 card we really need like a 199 rtx 3050 or something like that so i'm personally hanging out for that and i just don't think it's going to come though but in the meantime i think you guys should really if you want to get a budget pc there's no harm in buying an rx 470 or an rx 570 i think they're definitely the cards that will tie you over if you're on a budget at this point in time so um which so we've got uh tom bala actually a good question like i'm watching the chat like really good questions come up though but tom barlow's like which gpu would you recommend for all the bogan pc enthusiasts out there and um the gpu like for bogans if you're bogan you're probably driving a commodore you're on a budget and a commodore is basically like a it depends on the commodore if it's pre-2000s it's a really uh danger of a car real bad car and um you'd you'd definitely want to strive to get an rx470 or rx 570 and we got a ah medi res ten dollars thank you thanks maddie thanks for the donation brother appreciate that wait is that meddy the medi who uh if that's the medi that i know locally how you doing dude thanks for the donate um and uh so yeah but hold on chat's gone uh chat's going a little bit while here howdy brian how's it going down under how is you should have dab man do phone calls and hustle some good deals that was part of the plan like in the last live stream we talked about all that and we wrote down the ideas of um what you guys want to see and you want to see dadman come on a part sign you want to see uh jadman rates your pc as well and also dadman on a shirt so that was that was uh that was three of the requests that came out but i think it was more like budget and use stuff which honestly i'm more than comfortable i think in 2021 we need more budget than ever because i think the whole market as i've said this before 2021 mark my words it's going to be the year of the two speed also got a is that dkk 50. thanks for the donation johnny hi from denmark i love tech yes made me start flipping pcs and just got my second rx 6800 xt from profit by flip and d all right let's go over to the big screen here and quickly talk about this because this is one that i was thinking about last night this exact same thing and i was like there's all these people like there's all these forums and they go so hard over 20 differences and stuff like that 20 differences and this is the thing that gets me is like you know people sit there for days so i've seen these arguments in these chains on these forums and they'll just go on for days where people are arguing say 10 100 f versus a 3 100 and i'm just scratching my head i'm like man this is not worth a two-day argument they're both relatively good cbus they're both budget they're both going to do the good they're both going to do a good job get whichever's cheaper and so like i'm sort of in 2021 too i'm just going to be taking that more strict easy approach and look at look in hindsight right i copped a lot of crap when the 10-400 came out i copped a lot of chisel for um for saying the 10-400f and the 10-400 were decent buys like if you can find them at the right price go get them and people like ryzen 5 3600. now in australia the discrepancy between a ryzen 5 3 600 and a 10-400 f is like 100 bucks so like that's what i was talking about like you can't see that like no one's got a crystal ball you can't see the future but if the 10-400 f ends up being cheaper than 3600 to a significant margin then go get the 10400 f so and i've copped a lot of crap for that but we also got a um another donation here thanks for the 20 bucks from the witch master i think it will be sometime in may before gpus will actually start coming back into stock mate i've been looking for a 3090 for months if you don't need yours anymore more send it my way cheers me actually i okay i'm going to be i'm just going to be straight with you guys i bought a 30 90 and this is a sad story actually because i haven't mentioned it on my channel i'm going to talk about this story but we'll quickly get through the rest of the donation we've got many again with three bucks think uh fist bump yeah fist bump brother and then we got uh jester angel you didn't ask a question for the 20 but thanks for the 20 brother and then john 5 for the thanks for the fiverr bro didn't ask the question but 39 i do have one spare and this is a sad story because i bought one off of word of mouth now here's a sad thing i don't mind sharing this you know because i got i got dogged man i got dogged over with this deal so anyway i got a uh 3090 30 90 for i think it was like in australian dollars i think it's 2700 or something like that and this was when they had just come out and now out of stock and my guy in ipswich he had said brian you know i've got a 3090 you can have and this guy at a computer store apparently he's like one of the top 100 richest guys in australia or something like that you know like guys got like lamborghinis and ferraris and stuff and anyway he comes up to me shakes my hand and says dude i want this 30 90 i'm like okay cool i'll add on a bit of juice on top you know cut myself 200 bucks for organizing this deal getting you the stock going picking up the card and um and delivering it to you and so we shook hands on it i told him the model he was going to get i told him everything sure cans he's like you know i thought okay because he's a rich dude he's gonna have no problems coming up with the cash and anyway guy ends up completely dogging me so i'm stuck with this 30 90 now and look 3090s just aren't moving man like they're just too much of a premium like if you're in australia man two thousand seven hundred dollars is a lot to cough up for a gpu and even then that's on the better side of the thirty nineties so like they're three grand you know you'll pay three grand for them and so this guy completely left me in the dark and i was just like furious and i was like this is like i was like man is your like you shake hands on that in your word of mouth is that bad like really dude you know so i was just i was just like i was really disappointed because you know you can you can have all the money in the world and still be a complete a to the h to the o to the l to the e and so like after that um i was just like dude don't ever like if you have computer problems don't ever contact me man i don't want nothing to do with you so it goes to show man like this is what i'm saying with you guys like uh there's this whole thing like i think in 2021 especially 2020 a lot of people like talking about finances and stuff like that like you know always remember just to be humble and be a be a normal guy like a lot of you guys in chat are just awesome people and that's why i realized like one of the top 100 richest in australia just being a total douche it's like yeah anyway if that's my that's my that's my first experience with a real rich guy and it's like that's gonna be my last experience man if that's how they treat people it's like so bad man so anyway um yeah so who knows that's uh that's let's get back to the article anyway that's a this is live chat talk this is live chat talk so um let's get back to it so here we go right here we got the 360. so basically with the 3060 i'm i'm keen to hear nvidia talk about like how you can actually get these cards for around msrp because i think that's a big point going forward in the 2021 gpu supply and i think they need to revamp the system and even then i think they need to try and rush out cards like the 3050 and the 3050 ti more than they've ever done because the whole climate of gpus in the world is changing to the point where it's it's never been like this before so we've got stock problems we've got you know and classically companies like nvidia and amd they'll they'll launch the high-end models first the 3090s and the 3080s because they're making the most profit on them and they want to sell them but i think in this climate they're going to be selling anything right so just get the gpus out all of them so if they can do that that'd be awesome so if anyone knows in chat why they wouldn't do that perhaps they're sticking to the old-school strats then then let us know but i think now with conditions being so different in the world i think nvidia and also amd would be in a very much better spot to just rush these lower skus as well so anyway got a five dollar donation from mgpc he says i have the 3080 for the win uh three ultra razon fire 5600 and a gen 4 s10 it feels like overkill how long will it feel this way just grab i mean you gotta like if you that's what i was saying with the 30 like i'm saying this in the thanks for the donation too but i was saying this in the uh in the past with the 3080 it's like it's a different like it's that different tier of gaming and you really want to get the monitor to go with that thing and that's what i was saying with the the 4k oled and i'm going to like i'm not going to stop talking about it because you guys are sick of hearing about 4ko led but pair that thing up with a 4k outlet and it'll bring it to its knees like 4k 120 hertz will show the 3080 it's not such a big graphics card after all but that's what you want to be going for because if you're playing with a 3080 at 1080p yeah you just like your your investment or your money is just sitting there like it's not reaching its peak because your monitors can't even display the frames that that thing can output so that's just that but that'll be overkill for a while if you're playing at 1080p even 1440p so and marco joined now marco's joining chad he's like i'm waiting for the day we find an oled in the scrapyard me too that would be i'll make a video just dedicated towards that but speaking of oled this was what came out of um ces i don't even have the the picture for it anymore but uh lg announced a 32 inch 4k oled so like a desktop monitor that's as best as it's going to get right now there's no word on a 27-inch or a 24-inch oled but uh they announced the 32-inch 60 hertzo led so that they're sort of trying to get into the market of pc desktop monitors but i still think there's that heat problem with oled so that's why they use the bigger pixels on the bigger screens like 55 inch but even then i don't know i hope we can see like a 1080p led that would be really good so um anyway so we got here from i made 2 200 in december flipping good month luckily i have a friend who has a pc recycle so i get great deals yeah if you live clay that's what i mean it's all about if you can find a great source for your deals you're going to be getting some big profits like because some of the recycle shops they just get a lot of stuff in wholesale so if you're if you know a recycler close by they'll get a lot of stuff in and they don't have time to check this stuff man they've got to keep they keep getting stuff in so they've got to push it out so it comes in they've got to get rid of it so even if you get a slice of that every month and you can check and see what's good and what's not and sift out all the good stuff make a gaming pc that's where you're going to get good profits on the flipping and on that note if we go back to like these arguments of um people arguing on tech yeah like this is what i'm trying to tell you guys start like start trying to be an asset to your community whether it's building gaming pcs or putting flipping flipping doing some flipping for your own benefit because i know like there's a guy on the coast here i know him personally he's a really cool dude he's like 16 years old and he's already got himself a super ultra wide monitor he's been flipping his way up he got himself a car recently so you know just giving himself an income that he otherwise wouldn't have and i mean he's still saving people he's saving people a lot of money because the retailers here just rip you blind so retailers will just take you to town hey do you want a five-year extended warranty no no 10-year extended warranty how about it a thousand dollars i've got to get my 10-year extended warranty gotta get it and then the company that gave you the insurance goes bust in two years so your warranty's null and void anyway uh okay so our tv died a few days ago that's the question what was the question sorry uh telstra five dollar donation speaking of monitors 4k monitor recommendation i'm in the market for one yeah like this is the thing i i and i've spoke everyone is everyone who's done this has said the same thing right it's 4k oled man and it's too expensive for a lot of people i know that but once you get once you jump on a 4k oled dude grab yourself like a stand for it push it back way more than you would otherwise have it on a desk and you're going to be loving it once you go outlet you don't go back that's my 4k monitor recommendation and you got the profiles there oled burning no just don't like if you're gonna don't for outlet and burning just don't max your oled to a hundred percent leave it at like sixty percent fifty percent and put on the uh power savings and you're gonna be fine um so we got another donation from chris ssd so that's a sick name dude chris ssd that's i love that name dude i've been watching you since the first csgo potato pc recently picked up a ryzen 9 3900x for 180 bucks had ben pins with us fixing it and made a real good system for 600 aussie coins that's it that's how you do it man ben i've been looking for bent pins and i've been missing out on bent pin deals quite a bit so that sucks but um in terms of actually what i've been doing this month i've been clearing out a lot of stuff i had so much stuff from last year that i'm just clearing out now i'm sort of like in ways i'm fire selling a lot of my stuff just so i can get an idea of what i've got like i want to start fresh in 2021 especially with the deal hunting and stuff like that so i've been clearing out a lot of stuff um and that's one thing that it feels good to sort of like because half the stuff now like i got all this stuff left from a couple of years ago too i still got some pcs i'm like how much did i pay for this i'm scratching my head i'm like all right well i couldn't have paid any less than this so i'll just sell it for this you know with maybe 20 bucks on top so it's kind of good to have that's why you kind of have your your prices set in your head because when you have something that you've maybe been holding on to for a while and you don't know how much you paid you forgot how much you paid for it you're like okay well i probably paid around this for it i can flip it for this and still make a little bit of box and just clear it out have you ever so we got uh singapore dollars five dollars i think they're pretty good singapore dollars are still pretty good i think they're closer to a are they closer to an aussie dollar or closer to a us dollar but thanks for the donation uh have you ever had any experience with prism plus a local monitor brand in singapore that's pretty great also i'm still waiting for cpu and gpus to restock i haven't heard of prism plus um mind you in korea i'll give you guys a look at what i saw in korea i saw some local manufacturers there for monitors they were coming in with some hard value man so i would guess that prism plus would be a decent brand and they bring in harder value that's why they're able to exist so maybe give them a go and see how they go in terms of waiting for gpus and cpus to restock yeah um we'll talk about this just before like you can get um on aliexpress i mean there's like 109 for a 3100 this here i will say tread a little bit lightly this one looks too good to be true and so this guy's it's a new store they've just opened so this store was open since december 21 and they like when you're coming in 91 for a 10 100 f it just seems too cheap like even though you're discounting and stuff when the competition doesn't even have one like for 100 you're 20 something you're 20 dollars cheaper than the competition like i remember and this is how i think this is how i know like this is how you can spot kind of like you can spot like a potential scam i'm not saying this is a scam but you can spot a potential scam is just looking at how much cheaper that than they are than the competitors because i used to sell on ebay believe it or not like with car parts and stuff no one ever came down that much cheaper on a hot product like if you were selling like something that was five years old and it was going out of fashion sure you drop it down a bit in price just to get rid of it but you don't sell a 10 100 f which is quite in demand especially at 100 even a hundred dollars people would snap that up quick quick smart you don't you don't put it down to 90 dollars like what's the point you look at your competition you're like okay cheapest guy is 111 bucks you come in at 105 that way you're going to be selling you're going to be doing well so just be careful of this one in particular like these these listings here i mean i just i would trade with caution especially since you got a thousand for sale right it just seems a little bit too desperate this one here looks absolutely fine um rao yuan store they've got some heap of followers they've been around since 2015. so that one looks pretty good rather 330 100 definitely a good pick up if you need cpus and um definitely need some cpus so that'll be a good hit that'll be a good hit anyway let's have a look what amd did amd they were at the um here they were at ces i think they announced some laptop cpus and i think the h model just to break it down for you guys h's i performance use like their low uh power consumption so these boost clocks here they're i mean that's probably single core boost clock you're probably going to get a bit less when it comes to all core clocks they may even run under three giga gigahertz to get it under 15 watts so here we go here 20 megabytes of level 3 at level 2 cache now i don't generally i'm not a big laptop guy personally because the biggest key difference here is between laptop and desktop cpus is of course our tdp but that spans from the fact that they're using a lot less cache in these cpus and now a lot of performance on cpus is derived from cache itself so that's when you when you see like back in the past you'll have these laptops and you're like why is this i7 laptop nowhere near as good as the desktop that's because the cache is a lot different there's the structure of it and and um that's because so yeah just be careful with laptops that's why i've never been a big fan of laptops and i think in the environment at the moment like international travel is just locked down i've got no need personally for a laptop but i know there's a huge market for it people love it um so if you want to get yourself a laptop amd look they're looking like they're looking like they're going to be uh hitting hard this time around this is the zen 3 this is the zen 3 stuff so this is the good stuff right here and these would be my two picks would be the the max daddy here if you're getting a gaming laptop and then you get the entry one those two look really cool the 5300 you it's like do it's like all in or just like the the little like single bet and and this like hope you hit the jackpot that's that's sort of like my thinking with the amd laptop cpus but anyway but anyway here's i'm gonna ask you guys a question like do you think this is true do you think amd's verizon do you think verizon back when it was designed like 2000 you know when i had its roots in 2014 or starting out uh do you think it was initially designed i'm going to ask you guys in chat do you think ryzen was designed for desktops or laptops first do let me know in chat i'm like i'm pretty sure i know the answer but i i like i've just heard from sources do you think amd was initially designing ryzen for laptops or desktops i'm just going to give you guys a little bit of time chat's pretty smart yeah okay all right answer was lapped yep you guys got laptops yeah they actually designed ryzen with laptops in mind first and then from there they realized oh wow we've got a winner on our hands and they then just made ryzen for everything that's what again that's what i've been told this is the rumors in the in the industry don't don't ask me how i know as well i was told in confidence [Laughter] and um but yeah apparently verizon was initially made for laptops so that's a funny it's a funny story and i think it's got a lot of truth so that was a funny one when i heard that that was years ago when i heard that so um yeah so anyway and yeah bad room it actually isn't a rumor though i got told from someone who designed the cpu anyway i gave 30 80 but okay so we're gonna move on to um 3080 tough base model owners who are still waiting for free upgrades to the 3080 tough oc i didn't know that i didn't say a pc case game man i think they deal with uh steve from harvard unbox more so that's question more directed at steve i think like um i haven't dealt with uh pck's gear that much if anything i've dealt a lot more with ple and m wave both m wave and ple i can vouch for them 100 i actually haven't really had any dealings with pck's gear for ages they contacted me the last time they contacted me was like for the data vac um that was like 2017 or 2018 or something so like um so if you've got any questions about pck ski i you know steve's i'm pretty sure steve's really close with them so like he could probably answer that better than i could but um uh anyone here on the new mobile radeon i don't think like when do they come out so they just announced them at ces and so speaking of cs intel this is a big one let's move on now to intel because intel was like i mean i don't know how to take this like they're going for the gaming crown i don't know what to do with this one like they're going for the gaming crown but they've dropped two cores and four threads so now they're an eight core 16 thread and there's the thing the 10 900k make no mistake make it uh make no mistake about it 10900k is a good video editing cpu so like taking two cores and four threads off sort of makes the 10900k more appealing to people who are video editors and want the intel side of things but even then the 5900x but then they're comparing it to the 5900x and that's got four more cores you know that's all right yeah four more course uh eight more threat damn when you look at it that way it's like you know they really got to do something big man like this one it's good like it's good that they want to get the gaming performance but then the games like the games that they're comparing in here like intel why are you putting these games here like none of i'm pretty sure none of these games are played competitively like i none of these games i've never played one of these competitively or heard someone playing one of these i mean think gears of war 5 maybe but even then you got on ultra settings so like i'd like to see maybe gta 5 online fortnite even cs go like let's have a look at what fps these things can pull because if you're looking for fps especially max fps you should at least have half the titles in here competitive games where in the past i'm pretty sure intel did use the show competitive games in these graphs so this one's got me a little bit like i don't even know man like this is the last legs of intel with ring boss and 14 nanometer like they've got to do something else now they're gonna do something revolutionary look i love ring boss as much as the next guy does still the still the latency king but i mean they they got to do something else and i mean the motherboards look like they're okay they've got pcie gen 4 they've got the next gen usb 20 uh 20 gigabits per second they've got 8 speed dmi link so they're doing some really good things on the the actual 500 series motherboards but the actual cpus themselves is like guys you know you need to do something more you need to dedicate yourselves to revolutionizing like you did with the court ii duo back in the day like i props to intel back in the day with the core 2 duo they need to do that again because verizon's come in man ryzen's come in and ryzen's punching really hard and this is the 5000 series from ryze i mean don't they have like their next generation ryzen cpus in the in the works with ddr5 and stuff like that so it seems like intel is playing one step behind and they they kind of need to do a bit more than that that's just my concern so we got a super chat here from uh sorry two super chats from alex berezin they said hey brian i recently heard of an origin laptop with a full size 3950x with an actual am4 stuck on the motherboard at j's two cents what do you think i mean it'd be nice but 39 like i would love it if they if they had the bias that could be updated and we could get like a 5900 x in there that would be really cool so i saw the 3950x now that like the 5900x exists i would any day of the week go for a 5900x if you can get it especially if you want to do that kind of stuff on that budget right this thing's going to be expensive i'm guessing if you're putting a full sized uh you're putting a desktop cpu and a laptop it's not going to come cheap so if you're going with that kind of budget you kind of then want to kind of go best in slot but i mean impressive i've got to check it out i haven't checked out the video yet look i'm gonna be honest with you guys i started off 2021 and yeah it's been like i've been slowly getting back into it so uh kind of i've been working straight on youtube for like four years and i just i finally this christmas i kind of just had a break i finally just relaxed a bit and um yeah really relax i've been sleeping well that's the main thing so you've got gonna be sleeping well if you're not sleeping well you gotta i think maybe you gotta try and address the stress and the anxiety and stuff like that and that's sort of been on the back burner for me i've been like that's the new walls look the new walls represent that guys the new wall just gives you that hey 2021 we're gonna say no to anxiety no distress even though i probably gotta yeah start making more vids pump out the vid chain so but we got another from another singapore five dollar donation thank you so much mr zulul i'm waiting for a 5600 x and a 3070 in stock but local prices for the cpus got jacked up by a hundred wow to 555 singapore dollars also aud and singapore almost one to one ratio yet makes sense on that ratio but oh man that sucks say yes i'm guessing in singapore like the reason the prices have jacked up is again the retailers know they can charge more for it whether they're actually sourcing it and the price like singapore unless you guys have had some increase in import taxes which i hear in the us i hear you guys are having import tax increases unless you're getting import tax increases in those countries then the prices shouldn't go up especially from retailers and your dollar looks like it's pretty strong it's pretty strong against the usd there's no reason for those prices to go up except the fact that they can push them up because they know demand is that high even from retailers and retailers are getting away with this so um it's one of those things that's just that's what i'm saying to nvidia and was saying earlier in the stream they've got to work on getting this uh like being more transparent with what's going on in the market because you're going to keep seeing more of this where we're going to have 100 bucks price increases because they can they can increase the prices so you know like that's just supply and demand like that is the supply and demand element um and uh and that's what i mean like we talked about this like guys if you haven't watched that gpu video i did on gpu prices not the four gigabyte one where we talked about the four gigabyte focus we talked about the three biggest reasons why all these prices are going up and look stimulus is a big part of that governments are pumping money through the economy and it's going into all different kinds of hands and so the more money there is flowing around the more demand there is for products so like it's and it sucks it sucks if you're a uh someone who's been working and you haven't been affected like especially sucks if you're well it sucks if you've been affected too sucks on both sides but it sucks if you're a dude just nothing's changed with covert in your life like you've been working so you're a construction worker or something and you're into tech and you've been working and nothing's changed and then all of a sudden everything all you can't can't buy anything with your money that's like that's like a reality that's becoming into coming into effect in 2021 um so yeah anyway we've got another five dollar donation thanks a lot brother from towson uh while we're on the topic of the 11 uh 11900k i heard the 1100k was benchmark with 3200 megahertz memory wouldn't that hurt the 5900x results depends on the uh cl latency um 3200 megahertz cl 14 is really good on both ryzen and intel after that like this is the thing right with ram after those levels especially cl-14 especially cl-14 after you go 3200 mega cl-14 you're not gonna gain a whole lot more unless you're doing like special overclocks or you're getting memory and you're getting memory that is ridiculously expensive this memory costs like an arm and a leg to get some of that real high memory that you see in comparisons it's not worth it like you're gonna be getting an extra four percent performance but the memory will cost three times as much as say your 3600 megahertz cl 16 or 3200 mega cl14 so i've always recommended to people just to get um yeah get some 3600 megahertz cl 16. it seems like it's a good sweet spot especially until we get to ddr5 so anyway we've got some donations are coming in heaps guys thanks the witch master again thank you brother you're keeping me we got to get some dad man donations in soon i have to get him down um and you can give him some beer money uh what do you guys think about reviewers getting cpus and gps early in these times of shortages not that i have a problem i just wondered what you think yeah and um that's a good question because the whole cycle is messed up and the companies haven't adjusted to the new conditions they've been following the old model where they think there's no stock problems but these problems exist so i think going into this year i'll probably just be giving away like as i review it can i like can i even do that too i'm going to ask like nvidia and and stuff like that if if they're allowing us to launch like do a review one week before it comes out or something would i even be allowed to give it away announce a giveaway like that but i i just want to start giving away some of this stuff to help alleviate the shortages because yeah it sucks right and that's part of me doing this youtube channel man i was always the the gamer that was uh striving to get the best value and so that that's me man i'm not going to change and i still enjoy you know the funny thing is i still enjoy playing games on an rx 474 gigabyte when i did that previous video that we uploaded i was having a good time and so even though i got like you know the nice stuff has come i've worked worked my ass off for it even though that's come um yeah i still like you still know you never forget your grassroots brothers never forget your grassroots so my biggest my thing is um at the moment is just yeah that these shortages suck and what's the solution for it um i i just think we do the reviews and then just start giving away our stuff it's it's the right thing to do until a stock comes into play i just think that's it because you know especially especially if you have more than one sample especially if you got one more more than one sample so that's just um that's just that so yeah it's it's a crap situation man like the stock problems need to be it's mainly on the gpus too i'd say the cpus like cpus aren't a problem like we're talking like uh we'll quickly get over these donations and we'll talk about stock uh here's a domino's pizza for you and dadman brother brisbane teeth tech thanks so much the 595. you picked the flavor you tell dead man what flavor you want him he eats all kinds of pizzas man he'll do seafood he'll do pineapple on seafood he does not care i'm actually in the same boat i don't care pizza all pizza is good pizza uh next up we've got fedor thanks for the five dollars brother any experience with a one and zx 58 motherboards from express think of pairing them up with x5675 and flipping them on facebook and country i have just got one in actually it's funny you asked that question i just got in a x58 like banger motherboard i want to do some tests on it just wanted to see if it um was going to get a decent fps right 60 fps is what you can be aiming for i mean look the whole high frame rate pc gaming master race thing that's all good but i'd say in these tough times if people are on a budget man they can they can get by on 60 fps that's not a problem uh barbecue meat lovers yeah dadman loves the barbecue meat lovers i'll i'll pass the word on but uh here's the thing with cpus let's get back to cpus so here's the thing with cpus right now right um with like the cpu shortages that's not a thing really like at least where i'm at aliexpress has got these available 109 the 3100 you're not in a bad state for a cpu at the moment it's mainly those luxury cpus i'm going to say they're luxury right 5900x is more of a luxury choice um you're not going to be in a tough spot if you can afford a 5900x you're really not doing it tough um it's if like say for instance if 3100s or 10 100 f's were out of stock everywhere that would be a different story but um that yeah i don't like the cbu thing but it's the gpu side right gpus are messed up gpus definitely as they come in i think we should be giving them away so um but someone said i had they were swearing but someone said we are not aliexpress ebay you know f that we are not uh lucas what are you doing brother lucas what's the solution lucas what's the solution here what's the solution that's all i gotta ask like i don't know he just went off in chat and it like it sort of hit his comment um but yeah if you're gonna guys if you're gonna go if you're gonna go off if you're gonna go angry super angry mode you've got to post the solution within the anger so here's the problem here's the solution and that's what i mean that's one thing i reading comments especially on social media nowadays i see so much like just straight up complaining and it's like what's the solution though we gotta you know be part of the solution not the problem so anyway marco's on it marco youtube had swear words oh marco might have seen it because he's modding anyway 10 400 f like 168 usd in the usa right now yep richard irvine that's a good buy straight up that's a good buy man um and look if you're if you're wanting to get on a newer gaming pc easily your biggest problem is the gpu and that's it so that's uh the cpu thing will review the cpus but like it's mainly the gpus that's the problem so um i hope amd can make some more stock and this is the thing like is amd amd you is there something else we're not hearing about because the cpus are sold out like everywhere on pretty much all 5000 series skus and it reminds me of the 3300x i just don't think there's enough cpus being made i'd love to see the stock levels has anyone got any links to like retailers and how much stock has actually been sold on 5000 series save versus 3000 series same periods of release this the first three months that would be interesting to see if someone's got any um research on that to actually know how many cpus are being shipped out so because i think there's a bit of a crunch on seven nanometer i think that's real because like amd really wants to sell these 5600 x's these 5800 x's they want to sell them but they haven't even announced the 5600 yet which points to um a pretty big stock shortage so but the good news is we've got a 3500 x coming back in stock too i've been hearing reports of people are getting these 3 500 x's it looks like amd put down maybe like a one-year block on the 3500x at least being sold to the us the uk and australia and now that that's lifted people are like yo let's start getting the 3500 x out everywhere great little budget six core six core six threads it's gonna do great with like a um especially an rtx 3060 coming out like if you can get one of them so um please be warned tommy pearson's giving you guys a warning please warn them not to go wish looking for a gpu yeah i've never tried wish before and the only experience i've had with wish is like seeing these youtube videos pop up where some dude bought a gpu from wish and he got completely hosed so like yeah that's my like after seeing like time and time again you see a video of someone getting hosed on wish.com for a gpu so yeah definitely i i'm just going to say based on what i've seen i wouldn't personally buy a graphics card off of which.com so anyway maybe you can get some other good stuff on there but gpus definitely uh avoid that one so um yeah lucas is oh okay lucas brother you got to stop like lucas is just spamming and it's getting hit up by the the filter so here i'll oh man i just wanna like lucas is saying ali expresses evil that's what he's saying and he keeps spamming it like i don't know is aliexpress evil guys i haven't had any evil experiences with aliexpress i mean mind you i've been hosed on aliexpress before definitely been hosed on a one stick of ram and like a case but that's out of like i bought hundreds of things off aliexpress so overall i would say i'd have the exact same um experience on ebay like you know you get sometimes you buy stuff on ebay it's not that great so um yeah i'd say like overall aliexpress is pretty good like i've never really had a problem with it to warrant that it's evil so i i'll express is evil it's like why is it evil so anyway uh we got a donation here from hm2 he's uh donating 10 aussie thanks brother uh sfx sue uh i just call it a sue i know it's a power supply psu same rated wattage as full atx and keep up the budget builds uh the like if you're looking at a small form factor like i know the corsair ones let's look at a corsair sfx 650 that is a true 650 watt power supply but it's more expensive you're going to be paying a premium because they've got to pack in so much quality gear into that small form factor power supply to get it to run like a 650 watt desktop bigger atx power supply but yeah if it's from a good company it's going to run the exact same and in fact you could run like a 3080 or even a 3090 as long as you're not overclocking your cpu or gpu on a 650 watt sfx corsair i know that from experience anyway we got uh donated from malik tour he's uh ten dollars number one fan thanks brother number one fan i love that as anyone anyone else uh number zero perhaps do we have a number zero fan with a jumpy man fist pumping and we got mike here canadian five bucks i have a reference rx 5700 should i do the xt bios flash my cpu is i5 8400 32 gigabytes of ram 4k monitor gpu's still under warranty doesn't hurt man i'd say for the free performance give it a try but it is the reference model so make sure you set a custom fan profile on that because the main thing is you're going to be flashing it it's going to be up in the clock speeds and the timings and stuff like that it's going to be tightening the timings on i think it tightens the timings on the vram i'm not too sure but it's going to be basically making it as fast as the 5700 xt minus the cluster of extra cores that's unlocked because it's hardware locked and so if you do that you want to make sure it's running cooler naturally so that's why it worked on the one that i got in that video because it had a beefy cooler and i got that for a really good price it was a little over like i think it was on sale for like 500 aussie or something and it was a really good flip i flipped that as well that was a really good flip um chris ssd thanks uh another donation coming from 10 aussie aliexpress is good flip to pc with xeon x uh e5 2689 and uh 2070 super and made some good money rain games great although i missed that 2070 super yeah that's what it's all about like you guys you guys are flipping like i think we've built up a whole community here that shows people hey you can build pcs and you can beat your local competition and make some good value you're going to be making money in the process and that's going to be helping you get the best deals as well because you're now going to be looking for deals not just for flipping but looking for deals for yourself and your own personal rigs and that's why it's always about getting a real deal getting a real deal so uh we got 20 from matt have a whiskey but i will actually i'll have a i got some red wine some merlot uh the other night i was drinking a bit of that uh well that uh thanks for the twenty dollars too by the way with that um well that suffice that's my question to you matt will the merlot suffice or do i need to go uh on the rocks with whiskey so but we'll jump over to chat now because i think we're done with the topics um if you guys have any pressing like we're talking about these models here so basically in a nutshell gpus i wish nvidia would directly as well as amd directly address this supply problem more in depth and say look we're announcing these msrps and here's the retailers that we are going to say will sell them at around msrp for because it's just getting a bit too much because people uh every left right and center we don't have any answers we're out in the dark here a lot of the times especially in the us where there's talks that you know 25 percent tariff increases what's that going to do i guess no one would know this better than the companies making the gpus themselves so we've got to raise that and we're going to raise that you know it's one thing that's just being transparent and it's not like i'm not angry at any of these companies i think you know they just gotta like let's it i think times are changing and as we're changing we've got to get a new way of delivering the information and going out there so that's uh that's the gpus in a nutshell but you can look forward to a 30 60 in 40 days uh 12 gigabytes of vram which is weird and i've sort of they didn't need to do 12 then they needed to do eight but obviously they want to make a 12 gigabyte and a 6 gigabyte version then we had intel just like i mean an 8 core 16 thread just to get the gaming title that's pretty much what i'm looking at if you had to pick a price i'm hoping this will come at around 450 but that's wishful thinking i think it's going to come over 500 and then we've got amd with the laptop cpus focusing on that area because i think they want to win that performance crown because they currently got the desktop crown they want to go for the laptop crown now and that's their big and zen 3 we obviously know zen 3 is capable of that so it's an interesting market i'd say the biggest ball falls in nvidia at the moment though with gpus being the biggest problem right now on the market it's definitely one that's affecting us all as tech enthusiasts so this one needs to be addressed so hopefully they can do that on other news at ces uh sony announced a drone like ces like for what it's worth ces was not that great like we're gonna talk about ces like sony announced the drone and i'm thinking to myself man i can't even like we can't even fly drones on the gold coast i think there's like a ten thousand dollar fine if you get uh caught flying a drone so like um now that one then lg announced the uh oled 4k but the this time around it wasn't that great so uh eddie uh eddie klim oh eddie what's kraken ed said goal he donated 20 aussie dollars thanks brother so i picked up a 1050 ti off eddie the other day for a hundred aussie dollars cheers for that brother uh john krause he said i really enjoy these chil talking streams yeah i just want to connect with like youtube actually said to me like earlier this year they were like we suggest you live stream i'm like i'm already live streaming they're like well you should connect with your audience where i'm like i'm already doing the live stream already connecting so it's like it seems like it's just like a a spam email to everyone like they're emailing everyone and they're like you should live stream more i'm like but i started that before christmas i wanted to live stream more to like just to chill with you guys and just talk so and talk about the issues because i feel like there's a lot going on in the tech space right now where people just aren't talking about the real issues and the real issue right now is freaking prices and gpus like that's a big issue and it ain't going away it ain't going away so we got to talk about it and like at least if we can provide solutions to nvidia and amd and say hey look a little bit more like talking about what's going on here at the market because it's an absolute cesspool out here like at least to talk to us and get us through this cesspool because it's it's bad so anyway we got thomas um i can't pronounce that last name sorry thomas came in with the uh 20 euro thanks brother what is the best way to play at lower resolutions with your 4k oled use the internal upscaler sharpening filter in the driver or is there anything besides native resolution just not good enough uh yeah that'd be dlss dude dlss is amazing with the 4k oleds if the game supports it if the game doesn't support it just go 4k low settings try and get the textures on medium or high so go for the textures that's going to make the biggest difference in the game turn the textures up to medium or high and then play around with that fps you can also try overclocking but in terms of sharpening filters i've never been really big on sharpening if you watched i did an og lg guide and i just took off the sharpening every profile i did i took off sharpening at least my eyes can see it it just looks blue like it just looks bad anyway um yeah so there's that advice for that thanks for the 20 euro two and then we got uh zulu thanks man again another five singapore dollars last one for me i'm gonna go out and eat something uh there's no tariff increases happening here it's just the retailers saying we do it because we can yeah and that's then that's up to like uh if you've got regulatory uh government like anti in australia we've got the a triple c you can file complaints with them and just say look this is going too far there's got to be a limit on how much someone can get for just stocking a graphics card in a box and then handing it over and getting cash in their hand so that's that one anyway uh malik tour thanks for the five dollars brother i just bought myself a 3700 x and used some old parts for my brother to build my own pc all in all managed to get 32 gigabytes of ram and a 1063 gigabyte okay sweet i mean i'd say the 3700x is much more capable of gpus uh frame deliverance sorry there's a live stream you gotta think of how you can correct your mis mis orientation of words bad orientation of a sentence so the g the cpu is much more capable than the gpu in this build so you got a little bit of an imbalance there 3700 x is definitely good like you know 2070 super or something like that or a 5700 xt would be much better of a pairing uh but nice build by the way nice build but you can definitely sell a 36 out of 1060 for some good coin right now so eli um thanks for the five dollars brother i really wish they gave direct answers regarding stock updates during the cs keynotes yeah and that's what we were talking about today um maybe you just tuned in a little bit later and that's what we're talking about they haven't given us real and they haven't addressed this supply problem and stock updates and both amd and video need to get on that like it's a big issue right now so i want them personally to do that and address all this because it's something that we're all sort of like hey we're all scratching our heads like yo 30 80 ti's and i mean 30 60 tis are sold out that's kind of like the one that i was 399 usd that was the one that i was like really excited about this uh that's come out so far before the 3080 and the 6800xt they were like my three picks going forward and then even there's they're sold out too so uh we've got uh tech 215. uh thanks for the five dollars the 4.99 i love you brian how long um from scripting to exporting it does it take you to make a video it takes me 12 to 16 hours got to get faster um it depends on the video man um some i think my record for doing a video like an actual decent video was like two hours that's filming to releasing it on youtube and that was like a 10 minute video too so it depends if the information is all in your head see like i was probably brainstorming about that video the night before so like if you definitely you don't like i don't script generally i don't script when it comes to a youtube video i generally don't script the reason being is it doesn't come across like i know some people and there's a thing some people are good at scripting some people make the best videos and they're scripted uh you know take for instance cosmos um from neil that was amazing i watched that series right scripted he did an amazing job um and then like you know some scripts come out amazing but for me it's just scripting does it just doesn't work well when i'm reading off a script it's kind of like i'm droning along as opposed to not reading off a script i'm just talking from the heart and so that's it depends on who you are but if you're scripting i'd say that's definitely going to take up a bit of your time uh but 16 hours is like almost two days for a video depends on the type of video it is sometimes if it's a really big video it can take me two days to do like parts hunts will take me two days from start to finish but i'm doing all the actual parts hunts and hustling from there so um you guys want to know more about the video editing process i generally have um like in in general i've become as efficient as i can be in 2020 like 2020 i became really efficient at editing videos 2019 i was on point two at some stage i was doing like a video every day and i still had time like yeah i still had time to myself a little bit but um yeah i just don't really script so i mean let me know in the comments like let me know in comments do you guys think scripting's a good thing it's a bad thing what's your thoughts on that um i just like to talk from the heart and you know like the problem with not like this is the problem the biggest problem with not scripting you know the biggest problem is that you make mistakes and like this is the thing this is why i've always been scared of live streaming because i'd say something dumb on live stream but so far so good haven't really messed up on live streaming too much i mean i i make technical mistakes but in terms of like uh what i say and stuff like that you guys i guess you guys the the audience that you attract are gonna have uh like-minded thinking like you do and so i think over time of you guys we're all like this community and we're all got pretty similar thinking and if we don't you guys realize okay he didn't mean to say that that way he's probably means this and i've i've been some people have taken words right out of my mouth and then try to make it me like turn it into something i haven't meant and so anyway scripting scripting i gotta get maybe i gotta work on my scripting game anyway uh chris ssd another 10 brother you are feeding me so much coin man i'm not thirsty anymore brother i'm gonna tell you chris i'm not thirsty anymore you just you fed me this time sorry for the spam of donations but i've got a i7 6800k lying around have run out ideas what to do with thanks to the gpu shortage and price problem both new and used keep up the good work uh i would say this would be my suggestion flip that thing on ebay and then next live stream you could probably donate like 300 bucks bro that's getting a little bit all right so i'll go a little bit over there um but you can sell that i think the i7 6800k will go for some good coin it is um broadwell x99 so some people still after those cpus believe it or not so i would go with that one i just go flip it so yeah i mean if you've got a spare if you go if you don't want it anymore i'll take it off your hands i know a lot of the viewers will be like yo hook us up the 6800k give it here man i'll take it but um yeah definitely put that up on ebay and sell it and then you can make some good coin off it i think a lot of people like the i7 tax is just stupid like and i've spoke about this in the past with the i7 tax like we go over to the i mean this one might be a scam so don't go to this but like 100 us dollars you're going to get a um 10 100 f right and that is a 6700 pretty much and i would rather buy a 10 100 f any day of the week than a 6700 why because the 6700 is older now it's got more chances of failing it's got more chances of just clonking out one day 10 100 f is refined as well on that 40 nanometer process much better buy yet you've seen the 6700 um go for pretty much double the price people want the i7 name and that's how dumb the market is in ways like i've sort of scratched my head going into 2021 because in ways i love making price performance rigs but i also do enjoy flipping as well that like the whole flipping situation has just gone flipping stupid right now where you see guys just advertising i7 4790s and they're making mad buck on that you know it's like it's an i7 47 90. it's like not that good so the 10 100 f is much better buy anyway there's all that with the used market let's go over to chat now we're going to talk to you guys wind down the stream thank you guys so much for tuning in as well um and uh 3 600 sold out overnight across canada i have no idea what happened there but uh if you if 3 600 selling out just grab a 10 400 f i mean look you're not gonna be in a bad spot if you're 10 if you if you can't get a 3 600 and you like oh i have to use a 10 400 or a 10 100 f like yeah your life's pretty good and i've said that in the past if you like if the only problem in your in your life right now is the fact that you can't get a 3 600 but you can get it say a 10 100 f or 10 400 you're not doing it that tough like yeah there's people out there doing a lot worse than you so don't worry do not fear um it'll be out it'll be in stock soon enough or maybe they've maybe they're just transitioning so what's the deal with these stock problems that's what i said with amd and nvidia i'd love to see them address the stock problems because intel aren't having intel aren't really having the stock problems that amd and nvidia having is because they're not really making gpus but at the same time amd cpus are definitely pretty uh like they're in hot demand so um okay so what do you suggest to get on the 360 on release will there be a pre-order thing uh what is your best suggestion uh so basically from what i've seen based on experience the sad thing is is like in australia right i can't speak for the us because i'm not in the u.s market i don't live in live in the usa maybe you might want to ask guys like nerd on a budget aussie talks hardware like zach's tech turf like these guys that i know they're constantly buying pc parts in the us so you might want to hook up with them if you're in the us and just tweet them on twitter and say hey dude what should i do for the launch in the u.s or if you're in the uk go find a dude who's actively buying parts in the uk and hit them up but in australia i would definitely just on launch day see a price and if you know that price is good then go hit it up and don't look back and so for instance aussie bargain forums the aussie bargain forums they're always good people will find out the best deals and if you just refresh on aussie bargain you'll see the best 30-60 deal come up on launch day and um in ways the stores are you like was why does the stores want to sell these cars cheap a lot of stores in australia want to get their name out there they want to get the reputation they're hungry for that rep so if they can get a good standing by looking after the aussie bargain forums then from there they're only going to grow their business in australia especially when times change so you know that would be my advice uh wait sit on aussie bargains on the 30 60 launch refresh the browser wait for a good deal to come up and then just go hit it up straight away that's if you wanted a 30 60. so hopefully that advice is good um let's just keep let's keep going with chat and sorry if i do miss questions i know some people are like yo you missed my question this is it and then they they string that song like you know it's the end of the world as we know it i feel fine i don't know the lyrics haven't sung in a while but um would you buy from new egg in australia uh no i haven't bought like it's a sad thing i've actually bought from new egg in australia so it depends if the deal's good i have bought from new egg being in australia and it did work out for me so yes and no i don't buy from newegg that much like i've only bought from them once and that was for like ddr4 memory um anyway uh do you like to watch anime i used to like to watch anime used to when they had a series called bleach and then they ended bleach and i haven't really been into it i did watch the castlevania that was pretty good i was digging the castlevania one but there's some really like there's someone's out there like i used to like bleach bleach was my favorite of all time and um i didn't watch much anime but like nowadays i don't really watch any of it because like it's hard like to compete with what they used to make like bleach was just on another level and then i don't know what they've made since that can beat bleach so if you guys have suggestions for any like anime that can beat bleach then let me know but i just haven't watched um bleach just got announced for a new season oh no way okay okay all right all right i'm excited now there we go okay i'm an anime weeb now there we go yeah baby they better they better bring back biakia biakyo was like my favorite dude like he was the best man biakya bring him back bring him back there we go i can talk anime with you guys that's fine but bleach was my favorite and um i watched the castlevania one that was about it like i don't go into like there's some different there's definitely some different ones out there and i don't like i just man i can't get into them like i watch a couple episodes and i'm just like it's a bit too much for me but um i definitely bleach was the one that i can't believe they're bringing that back man i'm excited now like this is i i in mid-stream i found out we're getting it back man that's that's amazing okay i'm actually pretty excited um okay so all right i'll look at some of these suggestions i'll give them a crack but i'm not a full like i know there's full like i remember i used to watch the filthy frank um you know used to crack on the weebs and that stuff was funny man i don't know some of that stuff was just hilarious but um anyway yeah like i wouldn't say i'm full blown but yeah like i do like a bit of that stuff so it's all right it's not my it's not my kind of thing though um yeah new anime is too much for our boomerage i think yeah i think mr jagent he summed it up a bit too much he summed it up right there but uh i'd say i'm i'm stuck somewhere in between boomer age and um youthfulness i like to be hanging in between somewhere you still gotta understand what uh what's going on right you know what what's going on in the world what's the new meta so initial d ah man like i you talking about the initial d like the anime on initial d i watched a few episodes and i was just like man this is so like so much like his real drifting his initial d and man i'd like initial d was just not for me man like really not for me like i watched i was like what is this crap like that's i mean i know a lot of guys like initial d sorry but like for me it was just too much like you take it like it's like they look it's like these guys are professional scientists yet they're drifting a car and it's like if you've ever met any guys who drift hardcore man they just know the road they just know the car and that's it they don't know the science behind it they're just like bang let's drift um phil winter uh six core six thread ah thanks for the five dollars two brother a six core six threaded chips a good deal the 9400f is 150 in the us right now a lot of places a bit lower and anime is cool i'd say the uh 10 400 go for the 10 400 f for an extra 18 bucks man you're getting hyper threading and it's so much better so like the if that 9400f is around 110 like the 3500x then it's definitely worth it you're gonna be 750 bucks typically i think uh hybrid threading tax like if we look at traditional with an i7 versus an i5 hybrid threading used to be like a hundred dollars so if you can pay 18 for hyper threading definitely get it it's it's going to make a big difference so um that's just my thoughts on that one hopefully that answers that question we've got uh ten dollars in from jacob goodlife he says uh love your vids man help me out and my brother and love your vidsman helped me out with my pc other than the gpu i'd recognize jojo's but that's a bit out there for most oh yeah keep up the content man yeah yeah he's uh okay that's a suggestion thanks i'll have a look i'll i'll check out some of these suggestions no guarantees if i get into it i'll let you know on this uh next live stream what's cracking um generics for the five bucks 4.99 thank you my first super chat ever a year ago i started buying and flipping used parts and systems you and christopher you inspired me god bless you jared yeah he was cool man he was cool i said was nah he's he's cool man i i think i wished him a merry merry christmas happy new year on twitter i haven't really spoken to him that much for a while in a while i would love uh once covert lift that was one of my favorite things i did in america especially in america was me and you did that challenge i mean i'd love it if he would like to do that again because that was that was definitely some fun man i really enjoyed that just in la we're just using his car we're just on the road hitting up deals everywhere just going to some random dude's house and he was kind of like i think he was like brian you know this is the us this is a little bit different than australia you know um and i'm just like yo what's the worst that could happen and now in hindsight i would probably dumb you know what i mean what's the worst that could happen probably you know you probably could have wound up on the gutter you know what i mean and that's um so yeah i mean we uh yi was a bit more cautious than i was but i was like yo deals popped up man 450 watt powers by 15 bucks let's go hit that up and he's like yo this is like the dodgiest area of la and i'm like eh whatever i mean sure the dude's gonna be all right let's give him a chance we rock up just shake his hand like the dude's like oh this guy's got an aussie accent where's your accent like it was all crazy so anyway uh 3.50 from jojo what is the best gpu for watching anime at 4k uh definitely the gt710 brother don't knock it back you get that 15 fps what what fps do they do um animated is it 24 does anyone know what fps they actually do the anime at that'd be interesting anime on 4k yeah and can you even do you even get it 4k like i know it was a joke but like do you even get anime at 4k that's the question um have not seen jar jar binks mug in a while break it off thanks for the five dollars mark um no jar jar is upstairs i gotta bring him all right next stream i'm bringing jar jar mug back for you dude thanks for the five bucks too and thanks for the 350 for the troll as well 24 fps okay so we go okay animator here okay thanks thanks mr flynn anime is made at 24fps there you go so uh 4k 24fps how do you get that kraken i'd say a bit would the gt710 be enough maybe the gt740 gt is that yeah gt 740 might be your card my man might be your graphics card that's just to play it on the safe side and then you use something like um uh vlc and you should get good fps so anyway we'll be wrapping up this stream pretty soon if you guys want to see dead man i'll give him a quick call see if he wants to say hi before because i know some people early in the stream are like yo i want to see dadman on the stream i'll give him a quick ring now see if he wants to come down do you guys want to see him before we check out or have you had enough of this live stream do let us know in chat uh i got the phone ready to go i'll give him a call we'll get him on this is it probably all right hang on let's just give him a call um let's give him a bell see what is going on geez i haven't called man in a while i have to go to contacts okay let's get it going 10 bucks from ivy mike thanks so much brother hey brian just want to blame you for my sting of purchase blame me that's not a blame dude got the gt1 and man i love this car i would love to see more car stuff yeah this thing is just like let's just say hey dab man um do you want to come on the live stream do you want to come down and jump on the live stream do you want to come down and jump on the live stream i'll come down to the studio yeah and people people want to say hi to you don't you don't just quickly calm down you don't have to do up your hair or anything like that all right okay i'll see you soon okay all right cool mate all right bye all right it's popping down guys if you got outstanding questions for dadman make sure you drop them in um okay so yeah the stinger if you got a stinger there's no blame there man the stinger was just an amazing car i think it was the car of 2020. have you seen that the new stinger though have you guys seen the new stinger the 2021 i saw one in the flesh and i was like i like the 2020 2019 model better so like the stinger was definitely if you got yourself a stinger there's no blame there definitely the most amazing purchase you'll ever have on a car i mean it is expensive purchase but like i was like yeah you know got to get this on business loan it up use it as a business card baby business expense um and then you got to tell yeah tesla's i mean tesla is one of the man i've seen that tesla stock price if you guys like we're going from tech now to tesla stock price but have you guys seen the tesla stock price i'm like what is going on there like if you've ever seen a bubble in your life like tesla stock price that's a bubble so anyway i mean i've seen some like yeah that's my thought on tesla but i've been buying some kia stinger stocks man everyone getting a kiss stinger so okay what is a stinger do we not have these in the us you should have them in the um you should have the kia stingers in the us i believe you guys get the four wheel drive versions too that would be like hell of fun man that would be really fun to get one in the um in the us with the four wheel drive we only get the rear wheel drive versions um so yeah oh that's probably why the stock prices went up um if linus did a video on tesla so did you get a p you're talking about the p 106 are they're the mining cards you like you can't like can you game on a p106 in 2021 because the biggest problem was the drivers on them i found the drivers you had to get a custom driver and that was just like so you try play for instance say you try play um cold war like um uh call of duty you're not going to be able to play that on a p106 because there's the drivers yeah so i'm pretty sure it's a complete potato nowadays unless you're playing old games so come over and say hello dadman to the to the stream he has come down early so here we go you guys have your questions so we got live stream we got the camera i'll give you the hot seat if you want do you want the hot seat yeah just come and sit down so here we go guys we're gonna be closing up the stream after you guys have they got questions for you too okay here we are yeah all right so jump in closer there's the microphone there so you're just going to talk close to that and um so what are they what are they what's their questions has brian been a good boy lately ha ha no he has been yeah there you go hey i have been mate so x so you've got a five dollar donation now someone said tell dab man he owns he owns me i owes you a 30 90. see if he even knows what a 3090 is do you know what a 3090 is no i don't know okay he doesn't know what a 3090 is um we've got another donation here for you so there's 5.69 he was just in harvey norman and they had an i5 10th gen and a gt 710 for a thousand bucks oh so harvey norman's trying to rip someone off what do you think about that oh it's hard to say sometimes it just depends on the circumstance you know because sometimes uh you can actually look at something i think it's that price when it's some other price sort of thing so it's very hard to say but that is a rip-off like the gt-710 so they're just trying to rip someone off but you know but sometimes harvey norman would would you consider it to be hardly normal uh well that's that's just the nickname hardly normal but yeah it's probably hardly normal because he sells so much care ah we're gonna have some yeah we've got some beer money too what's your favorite beer that they're we're getting some beer money in right now so what's your favorite beer well there's there's two two great choices i mean i like victorian better vb oh they'd be fantastic yeah yeah and uh sometimes someone was easily going to scoff at that so there's we got a beer called victorian bitter down in australia and it's a love or hate generally i don't i actually don't mind it so uh that and then so that's that's your favorite beer bb uh yeah one of my favorites i thought you liked corona better well corona's second i'd say later in second year yeah okay and so we've got another five dollar donation sorry to bring up drama but did you know chris banned me from his discord once after i got scammed and used by his discord members oh so someone got scammed uh oh okay that's a sad one i'll um so oscar if you want to tweet us just tweet at us and tweet like tweet me and chris in the same line and tell us what happened and like put up some screenshots on twitter and i'll uh i'll i'll reply to that and see what's going on there like you shouldn't have got scammed and how much did he do like how much do these guys do you out for you know what i mean yeah that's true what's the damage yeah it's very hard to sort of yeah it's one i hate getting scammed you know i mean what scamming's wrong like look i think in australia there's a lot of people every day someone's getting ripped off right i think ripoffs are part of the aussie culture but like uh scamming's not cool you know what i mean like wouldn't you say scamming's a bit out there well scamming is just a form of thievery that's all it is and uh i mean i don't want to be too critical but don't forget our ancestors and things like that i mean australia australia was settled by thieves and it's only gotten worse so what can you do oh geez it's only gotten worse eh yeah we'll put it this way uh the industry oh yeah i mean everywhere you turn somebody's trying to rip you for something yes yeah it's it's it's horrific really but then again i suppose in one respect it keeps you on your toes it keeps you on your toes yeah yeah yeah you become very aware of everything and you've really got actually sometimes you can actually project predict it coming you know you can't okay so you reckon oscar's on his toes now he's weary of it no he's hard to say so he said he got scammed for five hundred dollars that's quite a bit that's a lot of money this goes quite a bit just just for one scam yeah that's not a that's not a ha that's hard that's a hard hit yeah yeah um all right we'll tweet tweet at us oscar show us what you got on twitter man i'll i'll uh reply to that because the chris the chris that i know wouldn't do that man that's that's what i'm saying chris always been a straight up guy this way there's a lot of decent people out there yeah and uh it's just these well you've got a big percentage of uh i want that and i don't want to work for it sort of thing and that's where you get the scamming yeah yeah no well i know chris he works hard so uh alex uh berezin he's rubble he's pro he's um rubble was that russian 100 rebel hard to say hey dadman does beer give one a heavier hangover in australian hot climate uh well not really not really it all depends on how many you drink so yeah i mean it's pretty good though like i find i don't get hung over on beer it's mainly the whiskey like when i hit the whiskey in the wine for some reason wine does me harder than whiskey well wine's one of those things that takes a long time for your body to get used to because it's for some unknown reason you're sort of praying to a decent headache but put it this way if you enter headaches well you probably go for the spirits okay so mr malik he asked what car do you drive dad man uh well i drive a ute uh holding rate aa hold on it's been actually a good year it's been fantastic because uh what engine does it happen again uh it's got a one point uh no two point a two point four two 2.4 i think i can raise the mic volume too because we're talking a far so i think that should help so um it's got a two okay so it's got a different engine in it yeah so i'll put it this way uh well it's got a holding badge on it but then again it was it was probably made in japan anyway by isuzu yeah is a brilliant manufacturer yeah there's no two ways about it yeah so okay so someone asked um what's your favorite game dad favorite game i've always enjoyed playing chess yeah yeah i thought it was chess yeah i've always enjoyed it and uh you you can always work out some strategic moves you know say five or six moves ahead to sort of corner that position you know so that's what i mean you've got to be able to see where things are going in the future right exactly right yeah exactly right absolutely well put it this way you hit the nail on the head there apparently because that's what i mean that's why that's why i don't get scammed because i'm constantly playing chess with some of these dodgy folks online well there must be one prawn ahead of him or something yeah i'm on one pawn ahead you reckon that oh definitely yeah that's how you don't get scammed play chess yeah okay so we've got alex he donated another it's russian rubles you've done a hundred russian rubles for you he said it's uh thanks for the laughs i totally agree it depends worldwide so yeah well thanks very much uh yeah that's very much appreciated someone asked what crime did dadman do to end up in australia well i wasn't didn't you didn't your dad escape the um the ukrainian no no he was in the uh american army or some damn thing you know like he got mixed up with some of these blacksmiths [Laughter] so we we just got shipped off to australia one way or another didn't we no not really weighed up yeah and then we learned to then we came up so have you ever rode a bike someone asked have you ever rode a bike uh motorbike yeah i have yeah i've ridden a few yeah yeah yeah you've just got to be very careful in the acceleration and the clutch for a reason all that sort of stuff otherwise i mean i've always liked fast cars fast everything you know sometimes you just about tip the thing on yourself if you give it too much yeah yeah yeah so that's it um what nationality are you dad australian you're first generation third generation because no way no no in your fit and your [Music] fifth generation now i don't even know how to do the generations okay so are the bushfires over yeah they actually are we haven't had bushfires this year well yeah yeah well apparently they've kicked off again victoria or something so okay oh they have again yeah yeah yeah is the gold coast under lockdown no no brisbane's under locked down the gold coast isn't so did that did they lift that uh no no they yeah they haven't oh hang on they lifted it it's just happened yeah so what are your thoughts dad about miners stealing the rtx 3060s from gamers so basically what's going on in the world right now is a situation where people are buying up graphics cards to use them to compute crypto currencies and they're taking them away from gamers oh that's uh that's not right yeah that's not right well the only thing that i like i've talked about this in the past and basically there's a more efficient technology available yeah but they don't use it because they're greedy that's in a nutshell so anyway no that's true yeah so but actually what people have got to realize i mean technology is developing that fast that all these little increments pop up in the meantime until people find out what's going on you know and uh i mean even in the engineering field and things like that they've already developed anti-gravity aircrafts so yeah yeah i mean that's something you're probably thinking yeah think of the aliens will be up to but i mean it's just developing so quickly it's just amazing and a lot of these things i'll tell you what it's just putting a different edge on things and uh you know like they'll probably manage to fly to mars i know fuel very shortly you know with that sort of technology so that's just the way it goes very nicely uh so jacob sullinger dead man my family from southern california says hi he says we love your special guest appearances on tech yeah city oh and the women love you down here in southern california oh yes yeah yeah the women love you down there mate oh the very best everybody but that's why you don't go to america because if you went there you wouldn't be able to walk would you and all the females would just be piling on you wouldn't they uh well put it this way even walking around town here you stop somewhere and somebody walks up and starts talking to you and this and that i mean i mean i'm a very friendly person but sometimes you wonder why the hell did she walk up to start talking about it yeah you've got to be kind and polite and some people are very friendly some people are very nice that's what you've got to try and quickly thoughts on the usa the new usa president when i talk about politics no i'm not very politically orientated but the whole thing is you never know the potential of each person sort of thing i mean uh trump did a good job restructuring everything in america you never know biden hasn't had a chance to do anything so he might be a good one i don't really know so yeah i just leave it at that so yeah that's what i mean i don't really talk about it so yeah because um someone's always going to get offended when you talk about politics well anytime you mention politics i mean even australian politics i mean if i brought something up on that i mean a lot of people would be devastated but i mean i i don't really want to edge into it you know yeah i mean there's there's there's good in every every side you know so yeah well there's good and bad in every side just like there's good and bad in every nationality it's the same thing yeah uh what's dadman's favorite meal what's your favorite meal uh i like seafood and you know squid stuff like that and might sound funny but also i like a a nice steak you know with a few chips and stuff like that in the salad yeah always like a chip salad instead yeah well that's that's around about nothing there's nothing special or anything like that it's just the stuff i've been brought up on yeah did you um did you did you surf yeah i used to do a lot of surfing my younger days and the trouble is i hate surfing amongst a lot of people because you've really got to be aware of what's going on around you because you get hit by a surfboard and it just the fingers rips your skull open you know got been ripped through here ripped through there and eventually i thought to himself why the hell what what am i doing punishing myself i want but i still love surfing it's a fantastic sport it really is yeah so we got a two dollar donation from mike he said biden had uh it's basically political like we can't go there otherwise you know people like this is a tech challenge well everybody's got their own opinions i respect their opinions i mean what more could you say [Laughter] yeah that's it so um we would just leave that one there already piping up you know you can see sort of both sides in the comments having a crack at it and um yeah i mean at the end of the day my opinion is i think they're all like obviously we got to this stage so they all didn't do a really good job did they well it depends on how you or how do you actually analyze a good job or a job some person's got this opinion that person's got that opinion and even the opinions are conflicting so when you throw the politics into it well it's probably very confusing absolutely that's it mike donated you another two bucks thank you for giving thanks for your money well guess what i might even end up with a hangover you know so uh hot skulls ask you pineapple on pizza tech yes or no uh i like pineapple but uh i really like these tsunamis and ham and all that sort of stuff on pizzas and a lot of jalapenos and stuff like that you know just uh just uh well make it a real sort of italian job you know so yeah yeah so that's it um brian gave you a taste of kobe's meat i don't know what that means oh there might be some some sort of notation for some type of mate or something yeah yeah we need damn in here his words of wisdom are very refreshing he always has a pure independent view that's what you need to have right you need to have an independent question that's right the whole thing is what what people have got to realize is uh people tell them this this this this and this yeah but that is what they want to tell you to cover up their own sort of misdoings and whatever you know yes i mean uh i was helping out a few people in politics there i was representing the state in technology on what i developed and things like that and uh geez i was absolutely astonished by some of the things that i actually heard but i don't really want to go into it now and i don't really want to say too much because i don't offend anything have you ever had sardines on pizza uh no i haven't no okay i've had it on pizza it does taste really fishy yeah i've had sardines on pizza before yeah um it's not my thing like it's not that big of a thing for me uh when are we getting dad yes city channel that's what people wonder uh well i'll tell you what then i'd bring in a lot of engineering a lot of building projects a lot of stories too yeah and i'll tell you what like i said before if i ever wrote a book nobody would believe it because say oh that's not possible that possibly could not happen or that sort of stuff you know so what did you think of the stinger well the stinger the lovely car absolutely lovely that's yeah that's like i haven't even been that's not even scripted either you know what i mean so uh maddie donates you 10 bucks he says thank you and then mike again he said sorry for the intent oh fan he said sorry to fan the flames yeah that's why we just generally don't talk about because you're just going to fan the flames that's pretty much it oh yeah it's always conflicting right it is i mean two opinions can be conflicting and then and then if somebody's standing by listening to it he misunderstands it and comes up with another another solution that's true it happens all the time you know so that's it yeah so well they're looking forward to your book that man i'll tell you what uh well i have written one around about two or three years ago but i haven't actually gotten to the publisher yet so i'd like to get to the publisher and actually you know uh throw it in motion you know so okay so thomas he says he donates five euro i said if i remember correctly you were a builder is there a building you were especially proud of having worked on what was your favorite project yeah i like working on the uh well high-rise sort of stuff i mean that's what there's 85 percent of my licenses in australia and i can build the highest building in australia and that is uh you know as many stories as possible because most of those licenses are always restricted to you can only do so much like a three-story or a mid mid-range or something like that but i was uh i'm very proud of my achievements and uh i can build the highest uh buildings in australia so which is great well that's it so if there's a company out there that wants to use you know i have done a couple of high rises under my license you know so yeah all right so you've got another two dollars with a thumbs up and then another five dollars oh thanks very much and another two dollars i can see he says do you like the upper torso or the lower torso uh it just depends on what you're looking at that means you're looking at a muscle man and things like that i'm a female on a female oh look i'll tell you what i like both top and bottom yes great question yeah mike we can't really hear you know that didn't that pass it through the filter so i guess it's all right so yeah this is where to go so we started off this uh we started off this stream very intellectual talking about graphics cards but then it degrades to the lowest denominator the most common denominator and that's alcohol and women well put it this way that's probably that's probably a big factor in society the most common denominator that's where it went so yeah that's it so glenn few says it's best to keep politics to yourself it always is yeah and religion too religious the same thing and religion yeah the same thing you just there's no there's no right or wrong like really because it's all perception right that's sure well it depends on how you look at it that's it and i mean there is arguments always on both sides the minute you mention politics or religion you've always got an argument on your hand just like that guaranteed so guaranteed yep that's it and if i put it this way if you if you are you mentioned and you love arguing oh god you've got you've got to tell the topics you can't go wrong yeah and it's uh mike even if you went wrong you'd be right and you got another two bucks it's because dad always has good stories and who's too much who's your favorite actress from my favorite actress uh oh geez that's that's a hard one that's a very difficult one what's his name uh well we've put dolly parton as an actress or something like that she has acted in films but i'd say dolly parton i think she's absolutely brilliant and uh what's your secret to a happy and fulfilled life well the thing is yeah the most most important thing is to actually uh treat other people like you'd want to be treated yourself and that is your number one priority and if anybody needs a helping hand okay give them a helping hand sort this out sort that out uh but then again in some situations where i've helped a lot of people maybe they come back for more and more and more and more and you thank you what's going on this is they're starting to exploit my my kindness you know so i've seen a lot of that too but uh yeah i just try and help whoever i can and do whatever whatever he can for him yeah so yeah christopher donates two bucks he said brian was it was he a wild child was i a wild child no not really not really you know look uh honestly you've always been a good nation guy very good nature joy and we've always gone along we've always discussed a lot of things and uh we've always headed in the right directions you know so yeah that's it so treat others how you want to be treated yeah that's always been my that's always been my motto yeah number one priority yeah so that's it right so if you want to be a complete you know something to someone don't you know expect that to come back to you so that's well exactly right yeah yeah i think that's the good thing about us around tech yeah city we don't you know we won't put we don't put up a crap you know what i mean exactly right that's it exactly all right there we go so all right there's i think the questions are winding down we're gonna wind down this stream because i've got a i've got a video to make after this too okay all right there he is guys you've given him donated thanks for the video thanks very much for everything thanks for the money and i'll tell you what uh you know when it comes to philosophy all those other things they have a few questions for us because i really i really love those subjects and you know being kind to people looking after people and the whole thing that's that's if if the world uh was like that all full time it would have no problems yeah but it isn't like that definitely not all right man thanks very much all the best okay bye all right departing the stream we've got some beer for you later too thanks very much thank you yeah we'll get you we'll get you some we'll get you rock and roll all right see you dad man thanks for coming on the stream so all right there you go guys you got your fix of dead man there it is right there and um universally loved day universally loved so us and we can get a q a so people want a q a with your dad man what do you say about that q a people want to do a question and answer video to both of us i'd like to do that that'd be good yeah yeah in 2021 i've just stopped like i've really stopped worrying about i want to make content that i want to make and the viewers want to see so yeah why not like rather than making so that's why this month we've been going on this tangent of all these sold out parts and what to do about it you know i mean giving people answers on how they can sort of get about it because it's the main topic you know so that's the thing um he's uh marco asked marco's in taiwan he's a friend of mine he asked do you want to come to taiwan uh just depends on what i'm up to for computex yeah i'll tell you what if i could get you over there you should come over with us we'll have a ball yeah so all right so all right see you debbie all right we'll catch you all right love you mate bye mike is uh canadian two dollars another two bucks can you review the 5600 xt and 2021 versus other cards yeah i'll check that out for you definitely uh 5600 xt is a good card i think the six gigabytes of vram at 1080p is a very solid amount of vram just for that sweet spot especially since you're not going to be paying too much for we shouldn't be paying too much for a 5600 xt so that's the whole thing there brian can you look at laptop motherboards on express you can get a ryzen 5 4600 h and rtx 2060 for 420 bucks we can check that right now before we get on out of here let's just have a look at aliexpress and see this stream has gone on pretty long i think the uh i think the music i think i had some music up as well that might have like um that might have uh i don't know what happened okay i was having some music up there so i just yeah i had some music for you guys and then i had to change it back so anyway um it just kept going sorry guys uh that's um 40 so it's a rtx 2060 i think it was 4600 you was it 4600 ryzen let's see the motherboards okay i can't find nothing here motherboard let's have a look i i'm trying to figure out what it was that was going on here in chat so this was the uh i got the 4600h okay uh maybe my maybe my aliexpress is gone where was this okay it's 420 bucks i don't know just trying to think motherboard can't see much here man sorry i can't find this uh i can't find this laptop that you're talking about here but either way man i'm not like i've been talking about laptops for a while here i'm not a big fan of laptops so that's just me with laptops i'm not super super indulgent on laptops i think you always go for a desktop if you can i think laptops are really suited for people at university and stuff and even then i don't have a high powered laptop like if i'm in need of a laptop now it'll be something that's more mobile and i just use my smartphone for that so it's like it's for me laptops are sort of like that niche market but i understand there's a lot of people out there that love laptops and they love them so i was considering getting two for my uh wife and girlfriend okay 5600 x2 yeah they're a good card man definitely a good card you can't go wrong with them so um when it comes to that mic you definitely can't go wrong with that so let's say let's finish up here we'll get some questions on because i got to get like as you see my voice was breaking before that's like we've done a lot of talking a lot of talking um is uh when a dab man he makes hot soup so yeah when's dab in and you're gonna make hot soup we're gonna make some chili soup very soon we'll get onto the chili soup and once we get once we get that done um i'll uh i'll feel exhilarated so the dadman hot soup is a really good thing in the morning like that's i mean i don't know if you're joking about something else but like that's like we actually do eat like really hot soup in the morning so even in summer too we'll do it in summer it doesn't matter what time of the year it is so can you look into datavac alternatives they're hella overpriced at pc gay skier at nearly 200 bucks let's have a look um data vac let's have a look yeah the data like the data vac man when we first looked at that yeah that's gone up and wow 200 for a data back man that's expensive like i remember got mine for i think i got mine for 80 or something us like it was it wasn't that expensive like in the us how much is the data back and is does amazon have them as well like in even in australia oh man they're expensive eh yeah they're like i heard the compu clean is pretty good right if you're in australia if you're in australia i heard the combi i haven't tried the compute cleaner that's all maybe some people have got some um maybe people have got some opinions about the compu cleaner but that's that's coming in a lot cheaper so like 200 is expensive man especially since i know how much they traditionally went for like i'm sure that's a rip that's like that's a big ask man that's a big ask like in the us they're a hundred and six or eight they're 18 81 and so it's a big ask for that you even get a five pack why you get five data backs people like yo we're going through so many data backs we need a five pack of data facts here we need five of them in a box but yeah it's easily like from what i've heard the um data vac is the best is the best uh out of them for out of the bunch for just plugging it into the wall it's easy to clean like i've had mine for years now and i really vouched for it i only had one problem where it was shorting out or something so i had to fix it but other than that it's just been a workhorse uh mind you be very careful with these things the data vacs because if you have something sucked underneath it and it clogs the engine you can bust the engine pretty easy so i've had a friend who busted one so just be careful with that warning for the msi b85 iem 83 boards you will need to apply thermal paste to the chipset package otherwise you'll rack your brain trying to figure out why it is constantly powering down oh is the actual chipset getting too hot on a b85 that's weird so the thermal paste over time performed really well i mean really bad and that's causing the motherboard to shut down yeah usually how many minutes did that take nazgul how many minutes did that take before that happened so you gotta like give people an idea of how long like the symptoms there to look out for did it take five minutes before the board shut off or did it take 10 minutes so um it just depends like it's it's a weird thing because usually like especially on a b85 or a h um h61 and stuff like that sometimes you don't even need the chipset heatsinks on them like those those south bridge will typically sit standing on there's only one chipset but the chipset should be fine so this is down the south that south heatsink sometimes i don't even need to have them on there because they just don't use up much power at all so anyway that's my experience with it so it depends on the board but if that board in particular is using perhaps a really hot chipset then yeah it could be a problem so how many years before you estimate until my 1080 is outdated how many years um i would say this is why i was actually going to make some content on this later this year uh like as time goes on and this is the thing as the gpu market gets more slower we're gonna remember that time is going by to the point where i used to pick up like 600 series cards 700 series cards but they're not really on my radar anymore because they're getting too old they're just actually getting too old the the risks of those putting them in gaming pcs now and actually having them clonk out is a lot higher than it's ever been right as time goes on so we kind of got to usher in a new era where you're looking for these cards otherwise if you look for anything before that you're just really increasing your chances of getting hosed and not even hosed sometimes it can just be like using it for three months and the card just goes out on you um so i'd say with a 1080 you might have like you've got a good like couple of years left in that thing it's fine um i just don't know how long the actual 1080 is going to last for if you're using it full time and that's another problem with the used market like i'm having now is especially like fourth gen now we're seeing a lot of third hand parts not not just second hand parts anymore it's like third or even fourth hand and once they get changed once they change hands that much and the parts have been started up and used heavily stop start stop start shifting environments you know you outlook on these used parts some of these used parts are starting to really not be that good especially when we look at 100 10 100 f so like um anyway so need to check out the metro vac lineup okay so that's all we got so anyway next stream guys we're gonna we're gonna tune things down soon we're gonna tune things down thanks so much for tuning in these streams have been awesome uh you guys just love it when we just chat uh so we do get the topic out of the way there's some topics that i wanna talk about the main thing was the rtx 3060 launch i'm just sort of um open message to nvidia to let's talk about the stock a little bit more in depth and just be a little bit more transparent because they're putting out these msrps and they're just not really like they're getting more unrealistic than we've ever seen before so there's talks of taxes there's talks of this so metrovac that looks like the exact same thing what that looks like the exact same thing as a data back so metric oh wait metrovac oh you're talking about getting the big one i don't know isn't metro metrovac's the same company that makes the databack okay anyway i don't know what i'm i don't know what's going on with that question so uh thanks brian you're the man take care and we'll see you soon in the next one okay guys thanks so much for tuning in and uh we're gonna close this stream off on a high
