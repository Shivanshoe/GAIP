when you put competition and budget in
the same sentence you get tech yes city and today we've
been invited to participate in the xbox game pass for pc challenge
where we have been given a budget of two and a half thousand
usd to build the smallest and most powerful gaming pc possible now today's
video is sponsored by xbox game pass for pc and they have
this game that you're seeing in the gameplay right here called grounded
available now it's the smallest game we've seen yet
and they challenged us naturally to build the smallest
pc to play it and now we just got back from our local pc hardware store where
we've got five components here but we still had to get another three
components at the best prices possible and so what we're going to end up with
today is an i7-10700 k an rtx 2080 ti gravis card in a small mini itx
build let's go check out all these components
how much we paid for them and the price point tally but also if
you guys want to learn more about grounded
and the xbox game pass for pc then i'll put all the relevant links
in the description below let's get into it
[Music] welcome back to tech yes city and these
five components that we just pulled out of the boot here
tallied up to 2 305 aussie dollars now the budget i'm allocated here is two
and a half thousand usd and when i converted that to
australian dollars it was 3578.
so the australian dollar is currently weaker than the united states dollar and
that's the budget i have to go by another thing too is that we have to pay
10 tax in australia which is calculated into all these prices here
that i'm showing you guys but that aside it doesn't matter i'm
still going to do the best i can where we've got a 2080 ti which was on
sale for 1700 aussie dollars it's now gone up
200 since i bought it so that is a really
good deal and i need to get these deals in order to
have the best chance of winning this competition we've also got a h60 to cool
down the cpu a small form factor 650 watt power
supply ld03 mini itx case here from silverstone and
a one terabyte nvme from kingston now the three parts that we've got here
on the desk separated from these five parts
we got on an ebay sale and i managed to find this sale off
aussiebargain.com.iu where if you're paying with a after pay service
you got 10 percent off and so we managed to score a 10-700 k
for 665 aussie dollars making it cheaper than any retailer had it on sale for
now we also don't get a cooler included with the cpu hence why we got the water
cooler for it a 120 mil solution then we've got
the 3600 megahertz ddr4 32 gigabyte kit of g skill cl 16.
this stuff we got it for 319 with 30 off with that coupon and since this
memory is aggressively overclocked to 3 600 megahertz it enables us to
squeeze out more fps especially if we're going to couple that
with the 10700k which we can also overclock then the
last piece of the puzzle is the z490 asrock mini itx we got this for 289
aussie dollars with that sale coupon code delivered to
our door so these three components off ebay all had
free shipping which really made it lucky for me
because when i tallied up the total here we came in to 3578 aussie dollars
making me not have a single dollar to spare so what are we waiting for
let's shrink down that big atx size case into a small
pc that can play grounded [Music] so
[Music] know
i keep [Music]
is i know
you know my body never knows [Music]
so we've now completed the build here and in the back we are benchmarking and
overclocking and we'll talk about that soon
but this build right here the mini grounded pc
was super easy to complete i was actually surprised
how easy this case is to work with the only problem i came into was the cooler
mounted the traditional way was reading the texts sort of like
the wrong way so taking that cooler and rotating at 90 degrees to the left
makes it so we can read the logo properly on it and i got to say there's
a bit of room inside for this build so we can still
see all our components without cables
covering them and another thing is too we've got a push
pull airflow setup here with dual fans on the 120mm
radiator for overclocking the cpu then we've got the exhaust
fan though the graphics card is getting a little bit toasty it is a full sized
rtx 2080 ti and it i would like it to have some airflow from the side here
as this glass is getting quite warm with that aside let's take a look
at what we've done coming into this game to get the best
fps possible so right here we've overclocked our cpu
to 5.1 gigahertz and you may notice only eight threads and that's because we've
disabled eight threads so we've disabled hyper
threading so we've only got eight cause eight threads
and because i've already tested grounded with cpu performance i find it runs
slightly better with hyper threading disabled and that
also enables us to overclock our cpu a little bit higher which i'm impressed
here with the temperatures on a 120mm rad we're only going up to around 66
degrees in the heaven benchmark which is still
pushing out over 500 fps as for the gravis car we have
overclocked that as well but it is starting to throttle because it is
getting pretty hot so hopefully this overclock and this
performance right here is going to win us this competition but
another thing we have done as well we've disabled the spectre and meltdown
updates we've tuned up windows and we're going
to give this the best possible chance we can to win
so let's boot it up at both 1080p and 4k resolutions
and see what fps we can get [Music] so we're in the game we've just started
out but what i want to check out is how much of a difference our overclock on
our graphics card is going to make in this game
so what we've done here is we've hot keyed our two profiles on our graphics
card overclock one which is f8 to default and then the
other f7 to our overclock and we can just lock that in real time
and we can see here that we actually didn't gain
any fps here this is quite surprising we gained about 2 fps i think
so at 1080p high settings this game is currently cpu bound and so
even though our cpu is one of the threads is only going to 70 percent
it looks like we are currently cpu bound which is actually surprising so we're
going to run a big benchmark now even with the overclock gpu and we're
just going to see what fps we can pull so this game right here called grounded
is a new first person either single player or co-op game where you can play
with your friends online and it's basically a survival game where
you're shrunk down to the size of an ant and it's coming to console and pc
with the xbox game pass platform and even though i got early access to this
game anyone can play this now on pc this year
of 2020 now you can play this for free if you've
got the xbox game pass for pc so what we can see through this gameplay
here is that it's such a vibrant huge world
and what we've got to do within here is build craft things and also
fight our way through to get through the objectives and explore more things
to eventually unshrink ourselves back to the size
of a normal human however in order to get to this final objective it is
actually quite difficult and i got to the stage where i found
this oak tree and then a big spider ended up getting me
though before i do eventually get eaten up by that spider
i did play at 1080p and both 4k and benchmark
at high settings at both these resolutions
and this pc managed to do an absolutely fine job i mean
it would definitely want to seeing is it's pretty much one of the best spec
pcs you can get out there for gaming and not only that we've tuned it on top
of that on both the cpu memory and the gpu they're looking a
little bit deeper into this game i'm personally
really enjoying the survivability aspect where you've got to keep eating food
otherwise you'll then lose health and you've got to keep drinking fresh
water otherwise again you'll lose health and there's other elements to the game
like crafting your own weapons i managed to craft a pebble axe i
actually like this with not just uh crafting and
getting more materials you can just block quickly with it and the pace of
the weapon is also pretty good now besides that
there is unique factors to this game where
there's say for instance a stinkbug will be attacking a spider and if you
wish to get the spider then you can creep in and get a sneaky
on that spider so there is really different elements to the game that i'm
personally not used to especially when it comes to
um survivability games they bring in this element of
hey you can take an opportunity to survive
and that's a really cool thing i mean obsidian do this with some of their
original titles i mean if you guys remember the knights of the old republic
two and pillars of eternity obsidian are the
masterminds behind that so i'm definitely really enjoying this game
but with that aside let's get to a conclusion now
because we've finished up testing the fps
with over half an hour of benchmarking here in total
so let's take a look at what we've got but anyway here we are now with the
benchmark numbers all finished up for you guys
and i had to do one thing to this pc and that is
take off the side glass panel that was covering our graphics card
and with this panel off we then got our gpu temperatures
going under 70 degrees which was very good considering
this was with an overclock and this is the noise that you're going to be
hearing whilst you're playing and once we did
this i decided to not only re-test the 4k numbers
but re-test the 1080p numbers and we got around 140 average fps
on 1080p high settings and then at 4k high settings
we got over 70 average fps so i was extremely impressed
by what this pc could do and as opposed to grounded the game
the best thing about this pc is that i don't have to unshrink it
i can keep it small the way it is and with all that out of the way
i hope you guys enjoyed today's shrunk down
mini itx gaming pc hopefully we have beat the competition
i actually won't know until this video is launched
though speaking of launched as you're watching this gameplay grounded is now
officially launched you can get it with the xbox game pass pc
it's 4.95 cents a month during the beta access and this includes
access to all these other games that microsoft has in its large pc game
library you can get access to games like flight
sim and halo infinite these are titles that will be available
on xbox game pass for pc on release and there's also over a
hundred games that you can play today if you decide to sign up and it's
also showing that it's got the sign up for the first month for a
dollar and you can also get access to perks where i'm going to be
signing up and getting access to that spotify offer too that's pretty cool
six months free spotify anyhow i'll put some links in the description below
and fingers crossed that we win this competition i think
that i scored a heap of good deals in order to make this happen and i mean
hitting that budget exactly to the dollar
is something that i've never done in the history of the channel
so hopefully the competition will bring something to the table
to match what tech yes has got and with that aside i'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon peace out for now
bye but also if you've stayed this far and you want to see the content the
moment it drops sub button ring that bell and i'll see
you next time peace out for now again bye i'm just
gonna go shrink myself and get back to this game
[Music] yes
