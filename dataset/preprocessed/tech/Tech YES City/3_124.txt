this motherboard right here is the asrock x570s 
phantom gaming riptide now this board is coming in   at around 180 msrp and it's a refresh essentially 
what's asrock doing releasing a motherboard   all this time after zen 2 boards were launched 
and the original x570 motherboards were launched   back in 2019 and you may be wondering is 
there any difference between an x570s for   example or maybe you see another mod called 
an x570p or an x570x and you'll be wondering   is there any differences between these 
boards and the ones that were released   nearly two years ago and to answer that question 
directly i actually went and asked amd and i said   amd is there any real functional differences 
at the chipset level that would make someone   want to say if they had an x570 motherboard go 
out and buy an x570s and their reply was well   you're getting the same x570 chipset it's just 
that the motherboard partners like asrock msi   zeus and gigabyte they've all decided to 
go and refresh these boards and add these   affixiations on which in different cases may mean 
different things now in the case of the x570s   from asrock the s essentially means silent so the 
only difference between this and say original x570   that was released back in 2019 would be that 
this has no chipset heatsink fan so it's going   to be silent and the s stands for silent and then 
you may be thinking well if you take the fan away   is that going to cause heating issues and 
here's where we're going to do the full review   of this motherboard right after that tech 
yes city intro so let's get it on and go   through all the paces of this board to see 
if it does represent value at 180 us dollars so taking away that chipset heatsink fan is 
that going to make a difference the temperatures   and here's where out of the box we got 60 degrees 
idling and then when we decided to run a stress   test with the graphics card ramped up to full 
and then also run the m.2 slot at the same time   this is where we again saw really no negligible 
difference in temperatures increasing and now this   probably has to do with the fact that the pci 4.0 
lanes are running from the cpu and of course you   can get an extract performance out of the chipsets 
own pci 4.0 lanes if you want to but loading up   a graphics card in the bottom x4 slot is really 
pointless it's just going to add in a little bit   of extra latency and you're going to get worse 
performance so i don't know anyone who would   ideally want to do this but that said 60 degrees 
is a fine number in a 25c environment considering   these chipset hubs are rated to go up to 90 
degrees and they sometimes they were even sitting   around 80 degrees when i was first testing out 
the x570 itself back when i was doing the reviews   in 2019 so it seems like asrock have tuned this 
thing up absolutely fine but going over another   very important part with the motherboard is of 
course the vrm now here's where we've got a 5950x   we overclocked this to 4.4 gigahertz all cores on 
16 course 32 threads so this 10 phase vrm azrox   implemented could handle the 5950x overclocked 
absolutely fine with temperatures going around 73   degrees max in a 25c ambient environment as well 
as the heatsink going into the mid 40s now i do   like to run this test for roughly 20 minutes and 
that will weed out any inefficiencies in the vrm   especially when it's overclocked so if it does 
fail this or the vrm temperatures get too high   then that's a motherboard that you would want 
to avoid at least if you're going with higher   end cpus and especially if you are overclocking 
them now the x570s riptide here has a 10 phase vrm   with 60 amp chokes and also 50 amp mosfets and 
this did the job absolutely fine where we saw   a maximum temperature of 73 degrees and then 46 
degrees on the heatsink and then also out of the   box it took the 5950x to 3.85 gigahertz and here's 
where you're going to draw roughly 130 watts   direct draw and then from the wall 230 watts and 
also show you the idle power consumption numbers   two for those people who want to go afk in between 
working or in between gaming sessions and also one   thing that i like to do is to test the overclock 
numbers versus the stock numbers because that will   also see how well the vrm scales which is one 
thing that i have noticed that some mid-range and   low-end boards do very poorly in the past however 
in case of the riptide it's coming in with a   very good performance figure here on top of the 
fact that it's got an eight layer pcb in the case   when we looked at the ram where i locked in a 3600 
megahertz xmp profile with one t1 t1t this locked   it in first go there's absolutely no problems and 
this is great if you want to play games with some   of the best fps especially out of the box without 
having to waste too much time tuning things in the   bios however moving on to the bios this is where 
this motherboard employs that simple formula   from asrock where they haven't really changed the 
bios in a couple of years but they don't need to   because it's got everything that you would need 
from a bios it's lightweight you can maneuver   in it very quickly you can lock in overclocks on 
ram and cpu very quickly save up to 10 different   profiles and then do other things like tune 
each of the individual fan headers to custom   profiles and then on top of that you can and this 
is one of my favorite things about azeroth boards   control rgb from the bios itself meaning you 
don't have to install any bloatware in windows and   potentially losing some performance whether it's 
in games or productivity now you do have two rgb   headers at the top one of those being a three pin 
five volt the other being a four pin 12 volt then   down the bottom you also share that same formula 
so you've got two of each one at the top one   down the bottom and so far so good for the x570s 
riptide but here's where things surprisingly get   better especially at this price point where you've 
got six pwm fan headers you also got two usb   3 outs as well as a 3.2 type c to make 5 usb 
three outs in total as well as an additional   two usb 2.0 connectors so you potentially have an 
additional nine usb front out headers if you wish   to then you've got eight usb ports at the back 
four of those being 3.2 with one of those being   a type c and the rest type a then you've got two 
3.1 as well as two usb 2's and a 2.5 gigabit lan   solution from realtek as well as a ps2 port 
and a hdmi out and the option to add an m.2   wi-fi if you wish to as well as a bios flashback 
button and then 7.1 audio with the optical out now   speaking of the usb 3 speeds as well as the nik 
speeds they'll both find in my testing and then   on to the audio testing actually showed one thing 
that i haven't seen in a long time and that's the   real tech audio on board that works flawlessly at 
least in windows 11 because usually in the past i   was testing with volume levels of 91 and over i 
used to see the crosstalk leak but it seems like   asrock have fixed this on the x570s riptide where 
you can turn the volume all the way up to 100   and the crosstalk is going to be absolutely fine 
as well as the crosstalk numbers themselves being   minus 88 decibels and this of course is being some 
pretty impressive numbers when we look at that in   contrast to the frequency response numbers which 
were also really impressive too we had a minus   1.3 decibel drop off from 20 hertz and under so 
you're not really going to lose any of those sub   bass frequencies but then from 20 hertz to 2k 
was pretty much perfectly flat and zooming into   the frequency response curves it had extremely low 
jitter which essentially means very low distortion   but after 2k here's where things actually got 
interesting for the audio response where 2k to   10k had a drop off of roughly one decibel and this 
is basically essentially going to make the sound   warmer so in other words this frequency response 
is going to be a little bit colored and that's   going to be a little bit warmer and personally 
i like this but some people might want a pure   flat response curve so that's one thing i will 
point out but then going on to the audio the mic   in port that worked absolutely fine although it 
did have heavy noise suppression so it won't be   good for professional recordings but it will be 
good if you want to play games with your mates and   they be able to hear you clearly on pretty much 
any cheap microphone and there it all is with the   numbers and basically it's time to give you guys 
a conclusion especially based around the price   point of 180 and also i have to say is if you're 
looking for a board that pretty much is solid   in all different areas then this board is going 
to be it of course i would like to see things   like power buttons added on as well as included 
wi-fi however especially when we contrast that   to the 8-layer pcb the impressive vrm performance 
and the impressive onboard audio performance as   well as the feature set especially with all those 
additional usb ports i have to say that this board   is simply a winner in that regard it's got 
everything that i would want from a motherboard   personally especially the price point i think it's 
a very solid board if you're looking to get on the   x570 line and not have a chipset heatsink fan 
as well where traditionally when they released   the x570 motherboards it was only like the 
thousand dollar motherboards that had no   chipset heatsink fans but they also had pretty 
much a motherboard heatsink that would encompass   the whole motherboard itself both front and 
back so this coming into this price point   with the performance i thought was actually a 
very pleasant surprise but more importantly i'm   looking to see asrock continue the riptide formula 
for other upcoming potential future releases with   motherboards i think what they've got here is 
an absolute winning formula not just in looks   but also performance and it's a breath of fresh 
air to see asrock releasing a very solid board   to the market however that being said i will say 
x570 has already been out for quite some time so   how much life it does have left i don't really 
know just yet and with that aside i hope you   guys enjoyed today's video if you did be sure 
to hit that like button also let us know in   the comment section below what you think of these 
x570 refresh motherboards do you think they were   a needed breath of fresh air or do you want to see 
something different in the tech space love reading   thoughts and opinions as always just like this 
question of the day here which comes from owen   mitchell and they ask is it safe to buy x mining 
cards i've always been told to stay away from them   because they're generally thrashed to hell and 
here's where it depends and that's pretty pretty   much the simple answer is if you're going to buy 
a mining card go look at the condition that it's   in firstly all the x mining cards that i've bought 
i've always been able to inspect them physically   and if they're too far gone especially when it 
comes to having rust on the heatsink and perhaps   even on things like resistors and transistors 
then i generally tend to stay away from those   cards as opposed to say a recent deal that i got 
on rx 570s i could visibly inspect those cards   and i was like wow these haven't been mined on 
a whole lot so you can pick up really good deals   from x mining cards but the simplest piece of 
advice would be to inspect the card and if you   can especially see it working as well and see how 
much headroom it has in the overclocks then that   can be another great indicator too but if you're 
buying them online and you haven't inspected them   then i would try to definitely get some kind of 
guarantee that'll work for at least three months   or something like that so if it does fail you can 
get your money back anyhow guys i'll catch you   another tech video very soon if you stayed this 
far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be   sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and 
i'll see you in the next one peace out for now bye you
