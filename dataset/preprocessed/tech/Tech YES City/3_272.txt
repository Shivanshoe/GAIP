behind me here is the widest monitor
i have ever gamed on and this is aoc's agon 49 inch 120 hertz
5k gaming monitor now the resolution is 5120 pixels wide
by 1440 high essentially making it two 27 inch curved monitors with 1800r
curvature stuck together with no bezel and i think
that's the appeal of this monitor if you're looking
to get one of these you're either one of four people i think
or at least i hope because there are other better choices out there
at least for the money for different people and we will get onto that
after we talk about these four types of people first of all
racing sims if you are into racing simulation
this monitor does give you a very good experience
the second type of person would be someone who wants two monitors
but hates bezels in between the third type of person would be someone who
loves extended timelines in music production or editing videos for example
then the last type would be what are warcraft players they seem to love
everything though those pros aren't without cons
and that's one of the things if you've come to this video
you probably want to know what are the downsides
to something like this especially verse competition
and the price tag which this monitor currently comes in at around a thousand
us dollars and in australia it's going to come in
at around 1600 aussie dollars and of course there's the other option
out there that's coming into stock and that samsung's g9 which now has the
updated model has 240 hertz better response times but it does cost
more though the pros of this massive monitor
don't come without cons so let's go into all the negatives on
this thing before we give you guys a recommendation
[Music] so going straight into the response
times which for me personally is one of the biggest things
when it comes to especially a high refresh rate gaming monitor this is 120
hertz and it also supports freesync in the range of 48 hertz to 120 hertz
now the response times here they are at best seven to eight milliseconds this
is on the highest overdrive setting where they
have five different settings here ranging from off to weak to medium to
strong and to boost i would personally leave it
on boost even though you may get some
overshooting and purple fringing i found on this monitor especially when
i was gaming on it on these settings it wasn't distracting and this is one of
the most important things about gaming monitors
and recommending settings to you guys because i have had people come into the
comments section and say person x recommended these
settings on this particular monitor whereas i've recommended different
settings and what it all comes down to is
simply use the ufo tester i'll put the link in the description below
use your own two eyes and then change these overdrive settings
to what your eyes think is best so that's what i do i also test it out on
some games after i feel like the ufo tester
has satisfied what i feel is the best and then make sure there's no
obvious and bad artifacting or noticeable purple fringing for example
though speaking of the response times there is another setting
within this called mbr or motion blur reduction
the aegon 49-inch utilizes a technology that i just call red frame insertion
because when we put the 1000 fps camera on this piece of tech it shows red
frames being inserted from it depends on the
range that you're going with here it goes from 1 to 20
where the 20 has at 5.5 milliseconds of red frame insertion
basically no backlighting and then 2.5 milliseconds of just normal frame
and then the weakest setting one will have it at 6.5 milliseconds of
just normal frames and then 1.5 milliseconds roughly
of red frame insertion though i found leaving this on 20 was a little bit weak
in terms of brightness i found my perfect medium for response
times and mbr on this monitor was a setting of 10 and then putting the
overdrive to max so your mileage may vary but that's just
what i would do if i was using this monitor
as my main though speaking of input lag i measured here two to five milliseconds
of input lag on this particular monitor right here
there seems to be a ever so slight amount of input lag very
minimal of course you're in the exceptionally
good range of input lag when it comes to measuring it on this
monitor the next thing we're going to talk about here is the
hdr which is printed on the box hdr 400 is in my opinion
basically a gimmick where you've got an 8-bit
panel on this monitor it's an 8-bit va panel
and no matter what you do you're not going to get true
10-bit hdr out of this panel even if it had a thousand nits
brightness it would still do hdr a little bit janky
so basically in order to get true hdr content
you want you would want a thousand nits brightness most likely
and you want a true 10 bit panel the easiest way to tell if your
panel is at least capable of working with true hdr is to turn this setting on
in windows if you notice a significant i guess
washed out effect on your monitor then that means
straight away just turn it off don't even bother
with hdr on your panel however speaking of colors
and also profiles here's where things get very good
for the aegon 49 inch in that they've got a mode on here called full enhance
which i think gives the best sort of contrasty
vibrant look if you're into playing rgb if you're into playing rpgs and also
other titles where you really want to enjoy the monitor
this mode will do the job it's also got the srgb mode and when i tested this
with my color calibrator the results were very impressive coming
very close to being color accurate out of the box
however there is one catch to that and that
is it will only do srgb at a hard locked 230 nits of brightness
but basically if you wanted something for content creation
and gaming or splitting two monitors this monitor is definitely going to be a
good consideration in that regard though
speaking of brightness this was also pretty good as well i
measured 479 max without artificially boosting the
contrast which i don't like to do because the
picture is really unusable at these settings and so realistically
the most you're going to get out of it is around 480 nits however there was
some big variance in between parts of the monitor
where we got a 16 variance from the center
to the worst square on the screen ideally you do want to have this at 10
percent or less but at the very worst you want to have
it under 20 percent otherwise your eyes will start noticing a bad experience
though just when it sounds like i was giving this monitor a bit of praise
it then comes in with a curveball and this is with the osd
and honestly aoc this is some feedback for you guys
this is easily one of the worst osd's i have ever used on a monitor period
and the fact that this has come out in 2020 or i think this monitor was
in development in 2019 the fact that this osd
made it onto this monitor really surprises me
first of all there's no d-pad which any monitor coming out in 2020
i'd like to see a d-pad on that monitor itself
but secondly using the monitor like sometimes you'll you'll have this method
where okay you've got the hang of it but then you'll click left and that
won't work or you click right to lock in a setting and that won't work
and it really is one of the most frustrating osd's to use however they do
include a controller and that seems to work a little bit better so if you do
want to change settings on this monitor i do highly recommend
using the controller over the actual buttons on the monitor
itself though there are some extra options in the monitor itself
there's volume control which the speakers are really nothing to write
home about i would recommend either getting
a different set of speakers if you're serious about audio
or a decent set of headphones these are okay for just typical skype calls and
whatnot but if you want to enjoy sound definitely get something else but
the last setting in the osd that you guys will probably want to know about
is their black equalizer or black booster in this case they call a shadow
control it really is just a gamma booster in all
intents and purposes i would just leave this
on the default 50 setting out of the box and even then i don't know why they
called it 50 when there's only adjustments of 10. so
they just should have made it 1 to 10. anyhow that aside going over the
physical attributes of this monitor in that you can adjust it 130
millimeters vertically up and down you can also tilt adjust it and
horizontal swivel and honestly if you want to try put this
thing in a vertical position this stand won't support it and you
would be one of the craziest people out there if
you try to do that but for some reason part of me wants to do this
and then perhaps you'd be called like a surfboard gamer
the monitor is vase amountable though you will need a stand with a bracket
that's smaller than 120 millimeters in a square format
otherwise you will need longer screws to accommodate that
then for inputs and outputs we've got two hdmi in two display port in and also
a usb type c and you can also use this as a
usb hub there was no visible cross hatching
when i pulled up an orange background and also blacklight bleed is very well
under control i really didn't notice any problems when
i was using this monitor and the last thing is it does have a
matte coating and with all that aside now comes a
recommendation for this 32x9 right here
and who is it for that is the biggest question because this is certainly not
for everyone in fact i think it's only for a very
small amount of people because once you start going into the premium range
you've now got very very serious contenders for me personally
i'm using oled 4k 120 hertz that's me if you are in the market for
this you're probably most going to want it
for the ultra wide racing sim experience or you don't like bezels in between
using two monitors i feel like that's where this thing
excels but even then there are downsides to something like this if you watch the
whole review you'll know response times are really far from the best especially
for a monitor coming in with this price tag where the two strongest overdrive
settings were the only settings i would use this
thing on and even then i'd have the motion blur reduction on which
cancels out the freesync and the g-sync or the adapter sync
and so if you don't have it on the strongest response time settings you're
going to get what's called double frame overlay in that one frame
is going to transition into the other and it doesn't look good it's not a good
looking experience especially if you're paying this kind of
money so i would like to see the response times improved though that
being said if you're playing racing sims or you're
playing games that can utilize that full 32x9 then it is a gorgeous
experience another thing is too the osd that
frustrated me i don't know if it's going to frustrate
you but once you've set your monitor up the way you like it
i guess it's like a good thing you're like hey i won't have to come back
to that osd ever again but if you're using the osd constantly and changing
between 32 by 9 for example and two 16x9 monitors
this osd will annoy you anyway guys that's it for today's review
all the pros and cons have been laid out on the table
and ultimately when it comes to a purchasing decision
do the pros outweigh the cons or do the cons
outweigh the pros that's always your decision to make
or at least it should be and in my case for instance i'm using
4k oled 120 hertz as i said before and although that's only 16 by nine it
is 4k so i use that for video editing but it
is 120 hertz and it does have better response times
this however is great for that person who wants that
ultra ultra ultra ultra wide experience though it does have those negatives but
with that aside if you still want to go ahead and get one
then i'll put some links in the description below for you guys
and we've got the question of the day here which comes from inky steve
and they ask why is the windshield on the wrong side of your mic
and this was actually the most common asked question in the previous video
yesterday and for me personally the answer is
justified just from the comments alone where in
the previous video before that i was using this microphone and people
commented on how hideous it looked so i decided to cover up the microphone
so to speak so people wouldn't comment on how
hideous it looked and i guess that worked i didn't get one
comment in the previous video about how bad looking the microphone was
however that was to the detriment of a new problem that arose
and that is yes it was the wrong side around
but perhaps it wasn't [Music] okay i'm done i'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now bye
