the rtx 3000 series this is going to be
a very big one and there's already some big rumors floating around but
nvidia themselves also have this massive countdown where they're pretty much
going to first announce the cards at the end of this month
then mid-range next month we're going to see the cards being released
starting off with the rtx 3090 which this comes back to an early rumor where
the rtx 2080 ti was the first graphics card in the rtx
series to stop production but since then we've got some massive
news and that is all rtx 2000 series cards
have stopped production and so what does this mean
for the gamers but also since i'm a bit of a used pc parts enthusiast
what does this mean for us guys that are flipping pcs let's discuss all
these juicy things rtx and more and even amd's upcoming rdna 2
in today's video in video in nvidia
[Music] [Applause] what is papa loppin ladies and gentlemen
this is so they've stopped production of all these rtx 2000 series cards and what
does this mean from a standpoint from nvidia's side as
a business well it actually means a lot of really
good things when we look at that side and sort of translate
it to what the consumer is going to get and the first thing is is that the rtx
3000 series based on what i'm hearing is going to be so much more efficient
than the rtx 2000 series cards so we can expect not only uh
architectural gains in performance but we're going to see that efficiency with
the node shrink going from the previous generation to
now 7 nanometer and this is huge news because it means
that basically us the consumers are going to be getting
uh better performance but nvidia as well is going to be making more money
per gpu so that's why they would stop all the production of 2000 series cards
because the 3000 series cards is essentially going to make them more
money so with that cynical news out of the way
the stopping of production just means that they've stopped producing cards to
sell to the board partners who then package it in a card ship it in
a container and then sell it through retail channels
but there is still cards that are going to be going through retail channels so
it's not like you're not going to see cards for another month
at all they're still going to flow out but nvidia's basically predicted
that with the or that's what all these statistics and all these models
show is that it's going to be a smooth transition
and as soon as the rtx 3000 is available you'll pretty much have your 2000 series
start becoming out of stock on pretty much all models but that's to say
what we're going to talk about now is what you can do in this situation right
we're going to hear performance rumors they're going to go
all over the place you're going to have 50 percent more
performance than a 2080 ti which of course seems about right given
the 30 90s specs that we're hearing about but we're
also going to see the 3080 i think come in with higher performance
than the 2080 ti and not only that it's going to come in with much better power
efficiency so the 3080 is going to be the card
that's i feel going to be a lot more relevant to most people these
two cards are going to be released first followed by the 37 in the 30 60.
however the time frame between these releases is going to be a lot quicker
than it was on say the 2080 ti versus than the 2070 versus the 2060.
so you will see a quicker release of all these cards and i believe
the whole uh skew and the whole stack will be released before christmas this
year this is where the pricing and the
performance that's still up in the air how are these things going to perform
exactly no one really exactly knows until
they've released so when you see all these rumors
floating around you can definitely say one thing and that is the 3090 is going
to perform the best the 3080 will i believe beat out the
2080 ti and performance but also be a lot more efficient and
possibly even cheaper so it's going to be the card to get i
feel the 38 is going to be the one to get
even though the 3090 is going to be there rumors are it's going to be a very
expensive card so i feel like the 3080 is going to outsell the 3090
and the 2080 ti before it a lot better now these two graphics cards are not
going to really affect the market that much
they're going to be nvidia's flagship cards to say hey we've got the dominant
performance on the gaming gpu side but they're not
really going to affect use prices a whole lot sure 2080 tis
and 2080 supers are going to become cheaper but when we're looking at
mainstream gpus like rx 570s gtx 1660s and all that stuff on the used
market the 38 and 3090 aren't really going to
affect the pricing that much because they're in a
different league of card it's the 30 60 in particular that i
really have my eyeballs on now this is rumored to come out in sometime in
november and if this card's right with the
pricing this is really going to shake up a lot of things
in the used market and what i mean by that is is that currently used gravis
cards at least where i'm at now they're overpriced people are just
asking pretty much similar prices to that of new graphics cards
especially in the likes of a gtx 1070 versus a 1660 super
for example pretty much the same performance but
the gtx 1070 will even sometimes outsell it
for more money on the used market and this really leaves me scratching my head
because one is used it's old doesn't really carry a warranty anymore
and the other is more efficient and it's new so the rtx 3060 i feel is going to
be one of the best cards for shaking up the
market as well as the rtx 3070 of course that's going to definitely bring prices
down of cards like say the 1080 ti as well as
the 2070. so you will be able to get some really good
deals in the next couple of months on used graphics cards that's how i feel
if not you've got those new cards that are going to come through
and really bring that price performance well hopefully
anyhow we're going to go on to the next big question in today's video and that
is should i wait or should i buy now and if
you're this close to a brand new gpu launch
if you're this close to something this big like rtx 3000
i do recommend to all the people around tech yes city i say look guys just wait
see what this brings to the table it's only as time goes on you're only
going to get better in terms of price performance right that's just the way
tech works however that said if you can find a
really good deal on a graphics card then always snap that
up just know what the new prices are the msrps
and if that stuff's coming in around 50 60 percent of that price
that's always going to be a good deal so regardless of whether rtx 3000 series is
out snap up a really good deal don't let
that confuse you to the likes of going out and buying a
new card at msrp so if you are thinking about buying a
brand new pc generally especially for the gpu
do some waiting but there is one thing that i always recommend too with new
launches and that is if you're going to build a
whole new pc go out and buy all the other parts now
so everything except the gpu go get your power supply go get your ssd go get your
ram get your cpu motherboard you can get
some really good deals before these graphics cards are launched
because as soon as they're launched a lot of people will want to not only buy
that card but go out and build a new pc so i don't
know if this recommendation is mainstream but this is the
recommendation that i've stuck to for years
and it hasn't changed so of course the last audience to address here
is the used pc flippers what is rtx 3000 series going to bring to the table
well it's as we said before that rtx 3060 that could really uh
bring a big shake up so if you're sitting on a lot of 1080 ti's or you're
sitting on a lot of 2070s or just these cards that are
susceptible to being at the same performance of a 36
or a 30 70 then i would definitely think about offloading them
in gaming pcs right now if you can because
when that new stuff comes out a lot of the times especially the graphics card i
find a lot of people are always looking at the graphics card
to the point where an rtx 2070 super on the used market is much more desirable
than a 1080 ti even though they perform pretty similar
the 2070 has less vram people are going for the newer graphics cards pretty much
all the time that's what i find with gpus in particular so now we're
going to flip sides to team red the big navi the upcoming rdna 2
which is rumored to come out in november so this is supposedly going to have
performance that's going to beat the 2080 ti which is going to be a great
thing it's about time amd got some higher end gpus out that
really stuck it to nvidia the problem with that is is that the rtx
3000 series is coming out before this november
release date so it does worry me that amd sometimes
in the gpu market i feel like amd's kind of
two steps behind nvidia where nvidia always just have that preemptive move
where they release before amd or they do something before amd
gets a chance to sort of really gain some traction
and so if this is true we've got the november release so amd really have to
stick it to the new rtx 3000 series if they want to gain a big traction and
take away from nvidia's market share but it all remains to be seen in terms of
the exact price performance you're getting
in terms of the exact performance and overclocking and all that stuff
we're all essentially just going to have to wait it out but i will say one thing
these new upcoming gpu launches is probably going to be for me personally
the most exciting thing of 2020 given what's been going on this year so
i'm really looking forward to both these gpu launches
i hope you guys are too and with that aside if you enjoyed today's video then
be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comments section
below what you think about the new 3000 series cards what's going to be your
favorite pick out of the new bunch and why
as well as amd side what do you think they're going to bring with rd a2
levering those thoughts and opinions as always
just like this question of the day here and it comes from g
loop shag and they asked how did you get 221 fps in fortnite with the i5
4440 i have the same cpu on the same gpu and i can't get 144 fps
how so this comes to when we're doing benchmarks on the channel
you've always got to look at the date on that video so this was done
last year and so fortnite has had a massive update since then
i also tested in that video i noticed i tested on high and off
so lately i've been testing on competitive settings
with the view distance in particular set to epic versus
far so if you match all those settings then you should be able to get similar
fps but it won't be the same because i don't know what happens in those game
updates maybe they make it more strenuous on the cpu
especially since they've got all these new maps going on now but the bottom
line is when we do benchmarks especially like a lot of tech reviewers i know
when everyone does benchmarks you have to do fresh benchmarks for that driver
set as well as that particular game update
because comparing your numbers now to numbers in the past is just
it's like comparing apples to oranges so i can't really help you there and
explain how but the how is basically back then
we were getting that fps but now i guess you're clearly not able to get
that fps another thing too is definitely tune up your windows tune up your system
and even tune up your ddr3 memory if you can
and that should definitely help hope that answers that question and if you
guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that content be sure
to hit that sub button and ring that bell to get the videos as soon as
they drop your attack yes city and i'll catch you another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
