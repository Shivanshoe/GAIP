from here in machs the launch of AMD's RX 5600 xt which is coming out with the shelf price starting from 279 USD or in australia starting from 499 AUD we're going to talk about the pricing a little bit later because it is very important to weigh up into this review especially since the r-tx 2060 AMD's closest competitor has dropped their price from 350 dollars - now 299 marking only a twenty dollar difference in MSRP and even then these cards can already be had on the streets for that price that being said this newest installment has the same amount of stream processes as the RX 5700 however it differs in one major factor and that is the bandwidth of the memory has been cut down from 256 bit to 192 and then the memory has also been dropped from a gigabytes of vram of GDD are six to six gigabytes though you guys are probably wondering will that make much of a difference we'll roll those 1080p and also 1440p benchmarks very soon for you however that being said i'm gonna put this out there straight away there is going to be a lot of controversy surrounding this launch especially since what the model we've got here the azuz tough gaming I got this in a few days ago however this morning I got a V BIOS update for this card which changed the performance so I had to rerun all my performance numbers though what I'm going to deliver for you guys now is three different sets of numbers for this card that is one set with before the update which saw the max core clock speeds going to 1650 and also the memory sitting at 1500 megahertz which is pumped by eight times to get your effective speeds and then also we've got the overclocked numbers which I managed to get the memory up to around seventeen hundred and sixty megahertz and then on the core that went up to 1820 max so that's the BIOS limit which actually has the same limits in place of 1860 on the memory and 1820 on the core and that was implemented on the same both the biases before and after so the max overclocking potential on this card hasn't been changed however the most important to come out of today is the numbers you're seeing here will differ and I know this for a fact from other reviewers especially those who got the sapphire pulse edition and that got a memory boost of 1500 megahertz to seventeen hundred and fifty megahertz making it effectively the same memory speeds as an Rx 5700 though the core clock on this model went up a hundred and thirty megahertz same as the sapphire pulse however what you're most likely going to see is that my overclocked numbers in today's benchmarks will be pretty much similar to a lot of those sapphire pulse numbers where after these limits on my OC I didn't get a whole lot more performance though with outside let's roll those benchmarks for you guys and then come back with all the nitty gritty with this model right here [Music] so what we're seeing with these numbers with the 5600 XT is this pretty much trading blows with the RT X 2060 at both 1080p and 1440p the RX 5700 does start to stretch its legs at 1440p and we can see this with the worst case scenario of the rx 5700 being about 5.5 percent faster then this 5600 XT we've got here and then the best-case scenario being 22% in strange Brigade at 1440p when we contrast that to the RT X 2060 we saw the rx 5,700 went out in fortnight at 1440p by 5.6 percent then the worst case scenario was it lost by about 17 percent in strange Brigade at 1080p to the r-tx 20 60s so basically depending on what you're seeing the rx 5600 XT can beat out the RT X 2060 and vice versa depending on the title you're playing but universally here the rx 5,700 did pull ahead of this 5,600 XT even when it was overclocked they're looking at those overclocked numbers a little bit more I was actually really impressed when I first got this card in because the first time that I'd seen an AMD card in a long time have a good amount of headroom with the included air cooler you were getting over a 10 percent performance increase by clicking a few sliders and not only that the power consumption was also still really good and well under control we're out of the box before and after the V vias update it was actually really impressive and then even after overclocking it was still in good numbers running really cool and this model in particular the 5600 xt tough gaming when I did the test I was really impressed zeus have had some backfire regarding their 5700 xt tough gaming and also their 5700 xt strict series where on the tough gaming they originally didn't even put any memory cooling on board i believe however this model here does have memory cooling on board and that allowed it to get temperatures under 60 degrees on the GPU core and the memory also remained under 80 degrees even whilst it was overclocked and then the vrm temperatures were also under 60 degrees in all three differences mario's even when i overclocked in this was leaving it on auto fan speeds which kept the noises really well under control so there was no need to manually change the fan speeds and the best thing about this model in particular was that I was testing it in 28 seat ambience which is pretty hot compared to what some other people show their testing results in there looking closer at this model in particular we've got three DisplayPort outs as well as a HDMI out of the back you've got a aluminium backplate as well as a cooler in total that weighs in at one point zero four kilograms with the two out of fans being 90 mil and the inner fan being 75 mil in diameter we've also got a length of two hundred and 80 ml long and 54 millimeters tall so making it a two and a half slot cooler and then a hundred and sixteen millimeters wide meaning that as Zeus are using a custom PCB for this 5,600 xt which differs from the reference design of I believe a hundred mil and the last good piece of news is that this model only requires a single 8 pin adapter it does have LED lights to tell you if the PCI connector is plugged in properly there's also a white LED light on top that's not RGB from my knowledge because I wasn't provided any software to change it or I wasn't told of anything in regards to that and apparently there is a dual BIOS with this model though you need to get an exe file to change it into a different bar so there's actually no manual switch included which does confuse me a little bit because removing that switch does in ways 2 feet the whole purpose of having a dual BIOS and with all that out of the way it's time to give you guys my opinion on what I think of the 5600 XT right here is it a good buy if it is a good buy who's it gonna be a good buy for and with its MSRP this is what I've heard that 279 is going to be for the non OC models so that's basically going to be for the models that you saw with the graphs today of the before the V BIOS update and if the box has an OSI model on it then it's going to command a slightly higher price the sapphire pulse I heard is going to come in at 289 MSRP USD in Australia about 500 AUD in terms of this azu stuff gaming right here I don't even know how much this thing's going to cost bit of Zeus cards usually command a bit of a premium over MSRP as well and then we've got the RCX 2060s beside it which I already picked up a few of these on an eBay sale for 420 Aussie dollars so that's coming in at $80 cheaper then the MSRP of the 5600 XT and when we look at the prices online now for a 5700 you can get them off Amazon for 320 us and in Australia you can get a 5700 now just buy it now for 530 AUD so for an extra 30 USD or if you're in Australia an extra 30 ozzie dollars - I would actually go for the 5700 over the 5600 XT at these current prices in this current market because that 2 gigabytes of vram is going to be useful especially in the future and especially for a resale for example and also for the performance right now at 1080p and 1440p and we didn't even overclock the 5700 because the main focus for me was these two cards on the table here are TX 2060 and also the 5600 xt so basically as we saw with those market rates I can really only base my opinion on market rates because that's what you're going to be buying the card for and so I feel like with the 5600 XT if it came out and it had a street price of around 260 USD it would be really good value for money I feel like with the 5700 coming under that 350 price point for what you can actually pick it up for and the r-tx 2016 now coming at that advertised MSRP it makes a really tough market for the 5600 XT to stand out just like the 5500 XT you guys said the price needs to drop by about 20 dollars I feel the same needs to happen here with this card at least as we said before based on those prices that you can currently buy GPUs for though that aside there's also another curveball to talk about and that's with this V BIOS update coming back to that apparently the whole first batch of shipments with the 5600 XTS all different models will have that original v bios so you will have to update that v bias if you buy this card to get the extra performance and if you buy a model like that tough gaming and you're most likely gonna want to overclock the memory speeds to get the most out of it so when it all comes down to what the competitors responded the market has responded that now I want you guys to respond in the comments section below as well and let us know what you think about the 5600 XT and all things graphics cards love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of thoughts and opinions we have the question of the day which comes from is not camote sorry if I butchered that pronunciation but the questions really good it relates to what's the standard thickness of the thermal pad that was used to replace the old one from the motherboard any idea about thickness of the thermal pad that's being used on GPUs and this is related to the previous video I did with can yes fix it I'll put the link up here for you guys where I replaced some thermal pads on a motherboard and basically when it comes to thickness of thermal pads they different from all sorts of manufacturers to products especially with Tec you can go from 0.5 mil to 1 mil to 2 mil they're usually the standard sizes that manufacturers use they I have seen some manufacturers use point 3 mil as well so if you are dealing with a lot of use parts and you're changing thermal pads I would recommend buying all four sizes where the pads themselves only generally cost around one or two dollars for quite a large pad which will last a number of changes so for me personally I've got all different sizes on hand and you don't want to put the wrong size on that product for instance if you got a GPU that uses one millimeter pads and you put two millimeter pads on then you could risk the GPU not contacting the cooler properly and that could make temperatures a lot hotter than normal or if you put too small of a thermal pad on and you could risk that memory not being cooled so you definitely want to match the size of the thermal pad you're replacing but there's generally four different standard sizes used I'll put some links in the description below for you guys anyway if you want to check that out and with that aside I hope you guys enjoyed today's review of the 5600 XT I tried to cover all bases for you and I hope I did and if you enjoyed this video and be sure to hit that like button and also if you stayed this far and you're enjoying the content and you're not yet subbed sub buttons down there ring that bell to get the content as soon as it drops around here check yeah City and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
