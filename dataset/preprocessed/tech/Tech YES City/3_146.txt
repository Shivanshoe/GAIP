man i'm going to be getting a gaming pc this 
weekend i'll be playing call of duty fortnite   and f1 with the boys it's going to be so good 
bro i'm going to get that midnight star swag on wait wait wait wait what's going 
on here guys it says gaming pc man did you just shriek because you saw the price 
of windows 10 pro key licenses online yes well   shriek no longer with today's video sponsor scd 
keys you can get windows 10 pro single user and   license activated for as little as 14 using the 
coupon code bftyc links in description below   welcome back to tech yes city and today we're 
going to talk about the gt710 gaming pc that's   going around and i was alerted to this by a few 
people who said brian man check out these ads that   are going on here locally so this isn't not just 
happening on ebay we'll get into the ebay ads in a   second but this is starting to happen locally here 
where i am where people are now selling gt710s   as gaming pcs and this graphics card let's look 
at the gt710 it was released in march 2014.   that's uh that's over seven years ago for a card 
that wasn't even intended back seven years ago to   play games so if it wasn't intended and released 
as a gaming graphics card back then then what   makes you think it's going to play games seven 
years later so back in this era the entry level   card that was made for gaming was the gtx 750 from 
nvidia and also the gtx 750 ti the gtx 750 ti has   about three times the graphics processing power 
that the gt710 does hence the price differential   back when these cards are released the gt710 was 
originally intended just as mainly an office pc   upgrade for people who wanted more display outs 
or of course they didn't have a cpu that had hd   graphics on board say for instance a zeon or an 
fx processor this card alleviated that problem   and easily turned the pc now into a functional pc 
with graphics now we fast forward to 2021 and the   pc reseller on ebay is suddenly met with a couple 
of problems and the first one is that graphics   card prices have gone up because of the current 
crypto boom going around and also the scalpers   are taking advantage of the new cards and so what 
would typically mean for say a gtx 750 or even an   rx 550 or maybe a gtx 950 these are the typical 
cards that would go in your budget ebay gaming pcs   they've now got a resort to graphics cards that 
are still cheap and they can still service this   price point where people are only prepared to pay 
500 for a gaming pc they're still going to service   that price they've got to get those gaming pcs 
flipped because they know there's a market for it   so they've resorted to now getting the gt-710s and 
just straight up blatantly misleading the customer   and just pretty much cheating them out of their 
money but we'll get onto that soon because this   ties in with the second problem perfectly and 
that is in 2021 nvidia has a massive market   share in terms of their dominance over the gaming 
pc industry in that even if we look at something   as simple as a steam hardware survey we see the 
majority of users playing video games on steam   are using an nvidia graphics card meaning that 
if a video graphics card's in a gaming pc then   it's most likely going to help sell that gaming 
pc then what better way to capture that audience   with a gt710 that's got a massive two gigabytes of 
vram on it now of course they could get away with   just putting in a 3000 g that's amd's two core 
four threaded athlon apu that will give you much   better fps than a gt710 forget about the fact that 
if you get this gaming pc it won't even do what   these sellers are advertising which is my biggest 
problem with these ads the first one we'll pull up   here is from an aussie retailer they're selling 
this for 475 dollars and you've still got to pay   shipping i mean you can get a discount at the 
moment wow you get 10 percent off and it's guess   what even with 10 percent off it's still not going 
to play games but what they got in terms of the   specs if we look at the i5 45 90. i've covered the 
4th gen i5s you can actually play these games with   half decent fps but when we look at the graphics 
card it's so bad that it will literally play none   of these games that the person is advertising at 
least not with decent fps and what we showed you   in the intro was me putting a gt710 into some 
of these titles here and not getting anything   close to desirable this wasn't even playing 
these games for instance on fortnite i pretty   much put the settings as low as they could go 
where the game just looked horrendous to play   and i was getting under 20 fps call of duty 
wouldn't even boot up it just gave me an error   and f1 2020 that was so bad to the point where 
i thought at one stage daniel ricardo in front   of me was teleporting but then we've got over 
on this ad here we've got here cyberpunk 2077.   this will not play cyberpunk 2077 just we need 
to stop stop advertising these games in the same   advert as this so-called gaming pc but another 
thing that you have to love about this ad is   when we move over now to the two gigabyte graphics 
card the gt710 that it has 4k support for gaming   look it can't even play games at 720p what hope 
does it have to play games at 4k so as we start   pulling this ad to pieces we can clearly see 
that it is not going to be playing games but   what gets me the most out of this whole pc is and 
this is going to be when we look at a few of these   other ads as well is that they don't even list 
the power supply so yeah you could get this pc   it's got all the fancy rgb lights it's saying that 
it's a gaming pc and you get it in and you're like   okay well it's got 16 giga ram and a 4th gen i5 
if i just change the graphics card over to say a   gtx 970 i'll be getting some decent frame rates 
and i'll still have a decent price performance   pc on my hands i wouldn't have got ripped off 
to oblivion so first of all you've got someone   getting ripped off because they're getting misled 
but then they get the pc in and they're like well   i want more frames because they literally got a 
slideshow in front of them but that's when the   news gets even worse because these sellers aren't 
even advertising the power supplies in in the pcs   and so you're probably going to get something like 
this just total trash so basically what this means   is once you change over the graphics card from the 
gt710 to another graphics card your pc is pretty   much either going to do one or two things it's 
not even going to have the cables there to turn   the pc on or when you turn it on you're just going 
to hear crack snap and pop like that cereal that   i used to eat when you put milk in it now we'll 
give this seller an australia a little bit of a   break because at least he only advertised it as 
a gaming pc if we move over now to the uk we've   got our friends over the uh monarch here they're 
selling it as a fast gaming pc this is where it   gets better they've got a fast gaming pc bundle 
if you get this you are going to be gaming with   incredible speeds right i mean generally that's 
what that's what you'd think fast would do like if   i saw a fast gaming pc i'd be like okay at least 
this thing's going to do 60fps but then we get   down to the specs here and all we've got is the 
same but even worse because he's got the included   keyboard and mouse and monitor and it's fortnite 
they got fortnight and they're advertising that   hard we got fancy pictures and then when we go 
down to the monitor the worst thing is they're   advertising what looks like a 22-inch monitor 
but then we go down to the screen it says here   19-inch refurbished tft and if you guys have seen 
my um parts hunts i'll get 19-inch monitors for   probably around sometimes i'll get them for free 
people just give them to me or i get them for   five bucks and they don't look anything like 
the monitor they're advertising in the photo   second of all we look at the gaming pc 
here instead of advertising a power supply   they just advertise a power cable so that's 
right you're getting a power cable like that's   gonna make any difference for you getting a 
crappy power supply and having to change it out   eventually in the end then the next thing is 
we've got 16 gigabytes of ram i mean i know these   sellers are stepping up their game now they know 
eight gigabytes isn't going to cut it when you   sell a gaming pc it's got to have 16 gigabytes of 
ram because that is a great selling point the more   ram that's in a pc the better especially when 
it comes to a video card like the gt710 i mean   the gt710 even with two gigabytes of vram is going 
to perform worse than a gtx 580 with 1.5 gigabytes   of vram and in fact the gtx 580 could still play 
games with smooth frame rates in 2021 but then we   go over to this is where the fast gaming pc gets 
even more faster and that is with the hard drive   we don't even have an ssd here so when you go 
to boot this thing up and i'm assuming that it's   going to be a used hard drive since we've got a 
used motherboard a used cpu and also an old used   19-inch monitor we're going to get a used hard 
drive now if you've ever used a used hard drive   as a main boot drive you'll know that it is just 
the slowest thing going and in fact nowadays i   wouldn't even do this on an office pc any pc i 
sell here just has to have an ssd in it because   the people i just feel sorry for the people that 
buy these systems and they don't have ssds in them   just like i feel sorry for the people buying a not 
just a gaming pc a fast gaming pc with a gt710 in   it where they're going to get this thing home and 
i mean i don't know what the reaction is going   to be if they're maybe if they're bit off edge 
that day that gaming pc is going out the window   or if they're patient they're just going 
to be messaging the seller and saying   why am i getting slow frame rates so if there's 
anyone out there with some sort of dms about hey   my friend bought one of these pcs and they 
started messaging the seller about why is   it so slow i'd love to read that transcript of 
what happened that'd be very interesting to read   but when we look at the uk seller like look 
compared to the aussie seller this guy is on   his game he's on another level first of all he's 
got a fast gaming pc going on here he's got no ssd   and then he's got fortnite in the picture as well 
as a one-year warranty and then if we look at the   condition he's saying this thing is opened and 
it's never used even though it's just flooded   with used parts so it's totally misleading but 
if we look a little bit closer the person's ebay   seller account they're the computer specialists i 
mean these guys are specialists and they've sold   3 800 units and they're selling pretty much 
between two and three of these things a day   which actually scares me about how many people 
are getting ripped off with these pcs on the   promise that they're gaming pcs put it this way 
if i had a game on a gt710 i just wouldn't game   period i'd even pick up my smartphone and start 
playing games on my smartphone because it would   give me a better experience than what a gt 710 
could give me however we cannot just stop there   this is where things get better from this seller 
because i mean if you thought that paying more   money for a pc would give you better uh specs 
or at least a better listing think again because   we go down in price now from 350 pounds down to 
260 pounds and we've now forget about the fast   gaming pc we've got an ultra fast gaming pc with 
half the memory as before and still the same gt   710 so years later after i made a video on 2018 
exposing this stuff it just seems like every year   there's a new sucker born and they just come 
into the fold and they get conned by this stuff   and i just i i feel sorry for these people because 
they're going to have to learn the hard way   that this is not a gaming pc and it's not 
going to play games especially the games   that these sellers are listing and in fact 
i think the only game that the gt710 could   even barely play was cs go where i managed to get 
over 30 fps but i've managed to get over 30 fps   on things like hd graphics for instance one 
thing about me is i'd never sell to someone for   instance an i3 10 100 as a gaming pc i just sell 
it as a pc or an office pc or a desktop computer   because if i sold that as a gaming pc and someone 
went home with the intention of playing games   i would know that i've misled them or i've scammed 
them and i just couldn't sleep at night and so i   have to raise the question to these sellers and 
that is what goes through your mind when you're   selling this stuff as an ultra fast gaming pc and 
then advertising all these titles about what this   pc can do when it clearly can't do any of that and 
it would probably make for a half decent office pc   with some fancy rgb lights which a said person 
could easily pick up for a hundred dollars so   before getting on out of here i do have to raise 
concern about this whole gt 710 so-called gaming   pc and it just really reflects back on its own 
paradox that it's creating because the sellers   are trying to make the pcs that they're selling 
cheaper because they're trying to rip off the   people who can't afford to go out and buy a proper 
gaming pc especially the current prices and so i   get it with these sellers you want to make profit 
you want to make a dollar but you're doing so in   my opinion with absolutely zero integrity and 
you're just misleading and scamming people and   it seems like years later this thing just keeps 
happening and in fact it's happening a lot worse   than the last time i took a look at the gaming pc 
at least with the sheer volume of sales with this   one seller getting over 3 000 sales on their gt 
710 so-called gaming pc so thanks for letting me   know about this one guys but as time goes on 
and as i guess economic conditions get worse   you're going to see more and more scams and more 
and more things that are misleading pop up along   the way and that was something i started noticing 
crawling up in 2020 but now in 2021 it seems like   all bets are off and people are just going to be 
straight up posting up lies and i don't even know   how ebay allow this crap to happen there should 
be a limit to putting gaming pc in the title   and relating to what graphics card you're 
advertising that pc with same goes for gumtree   and facebook marketplace i'd love it if there was 
some kind of filters which filters this crap out   sure if someone wants to look for rgb pc they can 
find it and they can go get ripped off in that   manner but when it comes to a gaming pc especially 
an ultra fast gaming pc with the gt710 it's just   not happening and i just don't know why these 
sellers are stooping this low and going down to   these levels when they don't have to anyway guys 
hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be   sure to hit that like button for us and also let 
us know in the comments section below have you run   into any of these similar scams recently or have 
you protected some of your friends from the gt 710   gaming pc love reading those thoughts and opinions 
as always and of course if you want to warn people   about this stuff feel free to like and share 
this video because it does help me too but we've   got the question of the day here which comes from 
frank uh bullet and they ask i would be interested   in your thoughts regarding silver and what you 
think will be happening in the near future so   in terms of silver i've been open on the channel 
here i've been buying up a little bit of silver   and that just protects your um hard-earned 
against the thing known as inflation now   i am a little bit scared of inflation because i've 
never personally lived through a high inflation   environment so i don't know the effects as well 
as my parents not really noticing the effects of   when they were growing up through the 70s so it's 
one of those weird environments where you're kind   of going in blind but i do know one thing and 
that is something that's had a store of value   for thousands of years will continue to have 
a store of value so in terms of its price in   the near future i actually not sure it could go 
down it could even go parabolic but in terms of   the next five years silver is definitely going to 
be higher than what it is today and the reason we   came on to stumbled onto silver in relation to 
tech prices if we look at graphics card prices   i think they're going into a much higher price 
range than they should be and so if you want to   hold out and you're still like me you're scared 
of inflation then you can hold on to some silver   for the time being and just ride it out and wait 
it could even take possibly another six months   for gpu prices to normalize or even another year 
but you can hold out if you're afraid of inflation   in that meantime and then sell down some silver 
and buy yourself a gravis card once the price   of graphics cards to silver for example drops down 
now in terms of me investing for the near future i   really usually never get involved in that because 
near future would mean that you're a day trader   and if you guys don't already know you can go look 
up the medallion fund and that is literally like   algorithmic bots that are programmed to take 
money off day traders that's the history   of the medallion fund which was 
developed in i think the 1980s   so just be aware that if you're a day trader do 
step very cautiously in how you trade because   there's always going to be a bigger fish ready to 
take your hard earned just like these fast gaming   pc sellers with gt710s anyhow i hope you enjoyed 
today's video and if you've stayed this far   and you want to see the content the moment 
it drops be sure to hit that sub button   ring that bell and i'll catch you in another 
tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
