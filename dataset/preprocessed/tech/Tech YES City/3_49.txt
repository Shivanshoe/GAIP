what can you do with 100 well the answer to that is actually quite a lot if you're willing to turn trash into treasure welcome back to season two of the 100 flip up challenge where the last time we did this challenge we came into flipping our way up all the way to an rtx 3080 gaming pc and the season ended up finishing with a massive success this time however we are going into a much more difficult market especially because of all the inflation that has occurred since we did season one however that is not going to deter us from looking for the absolute best bargains and starting out this season i have to find something that is going to be netting me a solid profit if i'm then to continue and start making my way up to a high-end gaming pc so with that aside let's check out what's on the market and see what we can get with a hundred dollars and to be frank the first episode requires the best in micro management so let's go see what we can find and hopefully get lucky are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2 links in description below [Music] so we're going to be starting off this one with one of the biggest gambles where we are now in a car park and we've just picked up a deal which we're looking for all morning we're looking for that one deal and i think i have found it it is a pc that's completely like he doesn't guarantee it basically the person who sold it to me i'm guessing that's why they met me in the car park they just don't want to hear about this pc after they've sold it to me now so they have it listed for 100 bucks they said they didn't know what it was and so i offered them 70 dollars since i saw the photos and it looks like it might be a ddr4 error and so if i can clean this thing up and some of these parts work then of course i'll be coming out a bit more than uh 70 dollars so that's what i'm hoping for since they have mounted a massive cooler on it it looks like it could be an i7 inside obviously the gravis car there's no high expectations here but i'm hoping that some of these parts will end up working and i can perhaps turn that 70 into say maybe if i'm lucky 200 so that's fingers crossed if i can clean up some of this stuff right here but it's funny how they met me in a car park i just find that that kind of ironic where the story behind this pc was that they had it sitting in their garage for a couple of years but i'm pretty sure they just pulled this thing from a tip and then they took it home and obviously they're meeting me at a car park now because they just don't want anyone knowing where they live and what not so that's fair enough uh of course there's always that other option where i generally i will never pick up parts that are advertised as working from a car park or a gas station as i've done in the past with a video but this one here when i met up with a guy he said look i don't know if any of this works and so he's just being honest and i'm looking at it thinking well if the parts don't work it's probably because they're not faulty it's just because they've been sitting in a bad environment for so long so what i'm hoping here is that some of the parts do work because it's just dirty and i'm one thing i can do really well is clean these parts up so what we're going to do right now is take this thing home i guess that's what you could call it thing and we're gonna get to work and start cleaning it down [Music] now we're back at the tech yeah studio and here is where all the fun begins where i'm going to pull apart this whole thing and i don't think we can be reusing this case there's no side panels it's banged up but i think if we can restore this noxua cooler and also find out what cpu we've got and see what ram we've got also see what the graphics card is and see if we can get these parts working we'll be sitting on a good individual parts flip here so out of all this in my thinking you're probably like brian you're buying a pc that the chances are like nothing could work and actually if you look at the chances here i would say the chances are that something will work i mean we've got a cooler that's i'm that's definitely going to work we've got two sticks of memory we've got a cpu a motherboard a gravis card and also a power supply so that's six individual pieces the chances of all that being completely faulty is very low in my opinion so when you take gambles with this kind of stuff for me this is actually really good because i think the person selling it doesn't know what works and what doesn't which means that we've got an opportunity here to actually get a lot of value out of this so let's pull this thing apart see what we've got and then start cleaning [Music] [Applause] [Music] so there's some good and bad news after pulling this thing apart the good news is that this is a gtx 980 so i it could have been a 980 or a 970 so it's great if it's a 980 and it works bad news is it was an i5 and not an i7 it's an i5 60 600k i was hoping that it would be either an i7 6700k or 7700k but regardless what we're going to do now is since there is so much debris on this stuff like fur so whoever wherever this was sitting it it was just sitting with like i would guess the amount of fur here dogs that were just constantly molting near the pc so what we're gonna do is before we chuck all this stuff in the ultrasonic cleaner to clean it all down i'm actually going to use some wipes to get all the sort of excess off these parts just so my ultrasonic cleaner doesn't get clogged up and then after that once all the parts are clean we can then turn around and see what works and what doesn't work because i'm not going to boot this stuff up in its current condition because that in itself could risk destroying the parts and also this case we will quickly pull out the fans too while the ultrasonic cleaner is going and clean these fans up [Music] oh [Music] lately [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] so i'm [Music] [Music] so we just finished pulling these parts out of the ultrasonic cleaner i mean just look at these this noxual fan for example this has just come up so clean but what we're going to do right now is since there's still water on these parts i have to go over them and blow out all the water and this takes a good 20 minutes but also i'll have to take things like this little cpu socket cover off this motherboard just to make sure every last drop is out and then after that we're going to coat it all down and finally start turning this stuff on and seeing if it works and then if it does work we've still got another step after that and that is to replace these pads on these heatsinks here because unfortunately they've they did come up okay it's just they've got a little bit too much like micro dust on the edges of the pads and i'm i just i'm not comfortable uh putting that back on if the motherboard works [Music] so just finished drying off all these pc parts and we're going to start testing now with the power supply first because if the power supply works then we can use that as the base to test out everything else like our motherboard our graphics cardo and i'm hoping for the best now because this stuff i mean before it came in to a techies loving session it was looking really bad but now this stuff is looking brand new so we've got some really good news and that is our power supply is working absolutely fine there is some bad news though i don't know which one to plug this sata cable up to since it does have like a black head on it but i tried plugging that into the black port on the modular on this power supply and the whole power supply test is turned off so you're gonna go back watch the video later and then get that side of connection in the right port but it's not that important because with these cables right here we can test all the rest of the gear the next thing to do is patch up our graphics card all the way back up together with new thermal paste and all that stuff but we're going to be actually reusing these thermal pads since one of the sides has a bit of dirt on them but if we just get that dirt off and then we use the other clean side then we should be okay [Music] and now it's finally time for the moment of truth and this is we're just going to go in all in here and test the cpu ram motherboard and the graphics card all at the same time since i was pretty confident after testing that power supply so let's go give me a signal displayport no signal keyboards not lighting up that is right there what it's all about we have the gtx 980 i still do more tests on this but it's giving out a signal we're getting into the bios and nothing is shut off so this is really good news we've got a 6600k 16 gigabytes of ram z170 a zeus i think it's called pro gaming motherboard this like we are in the best case scenario here this is phenomenal because we can now just this is when you get into the first episode and you got 100 bucks and you're riding on this kind of like this is really lucky so oh let's um i'm going to do one more final test and let's hook this up to another pc the gtx 980 because i've got a bit of a plan coming in now on what i'm going to do with these parts because we've got the basis for a gaming pc right here but we've only got 30 dollars left now to get a case and an ssd if we wanted to just do a whole gaming pc flip but let's not get ahead of ourselves let's test this graphics card out on another pc make sure it's like you can install the drivers on it and then it also runs a benchmark and then we'll be in a much better spot so our gtx 980 has installed the drivers absolutely fine and it is running really well actually it's quiet and the temperatures are really good so this is the best case scenario that could have happened today but what we're going to do right now is i'm actually going to film so i'm going to clean these parts up i'm going to fix the motherboard up with some thermal pads and then we're going to shoot a little bit of before and after and then we're going to come back with the master plan here so after cleaning all those parts up and tasting crazy success this kind of success just doesn't usually happen but i'm really glad it happened where i really needed it to count and this 70 dollars that we got here today we're just turning this into that baseline money where i've then got options because coming in under 100 bucks i've really only got one shot to make it work and so the plan going forward now is since that gtx 980 works i mean that alone if i got that for 70 dollars cleaned it up and re-flipped it that would be a great base starting point anyhow but then we've got a motherboard a noctua cooler 16 gigabytes of ram we've also got some sata cables too which i've pulled out and i can use that for a gaming pc and then we got three fans on top of that corsair fence and an 850 watt power supply and there's even a wi-fi card that i'm yet to test and that was thrown in too so the value we got here for 70 bucks was absolutely incredible and the reason we get this kind of value out of this stuff was you just have to take one look at the pc and the photo and you realize not a whole lot of people want to get their hands dirty and they probably don't want to touch this because maybe all the bacteria are in there there might be you know all that fur they don't they just don't know me i just don't care and so i just clean this stuff and i love cleaning it and just seeing what the end product it's like i can visualize what the end product is going to be of course i can't tell if it's going to work or not but that's the whole i guess fun in doing this and so going forward we're going to be selling that gtx 980 so this is going to be my plan because for the next episode we're going to come back and then we're going to have a gaming pc ready to flip and then we'll start off with the next bunch of cash and we can start flipping our way up but what i'm thinking is i'm going to list the gtx 980 for 300 aussie dollars i'm going to try and get close to that and then that money that i get from that and because we've got 30 left over roughly i can then use that 330 to go get a case rgb case an ssd and a hard drive and also a lower tiered gpu and build out a whole gaming pc that we can then use to flip and get ourselves into say over roughly hundred dollars which then gives us a much healthier baseline with more choices and i'm gonna be straight up with you guys i was meant to start filming this series last month but i was looking all month for that one deal under 100 aussie dollars that would catapult me and allow me to sort of have a high chance of continuing the series but i just didn't find that deal last month and this month it came along and that's what it's all about being patient especially if you're on a real low budget and you want to make it work you've got to know what to look out for and unfortunately it is unfortunate because a lot of people i guess don't maybe they don't like cleaning stuff in the pc world they don't like testing stuff out but unfortunately it unfortunate for me is that i find all the better deals i get are just the completely trash stuff and it's always filthy from the get go so the filthier it is usually the cheaper it is and the more potential once i clean it up there is to make profit and that was pretty much this deal in a nutshell here today it ended up just working out perfectly i can't believe everything worked that just doesn't really happen at all here at tech yes city every piece worked so that's just an absolute win starting off with this 100 flip up challenge now of course i will add things you may have noticed in the price list i'm adding in thermal pads i've added in a can of water dispersant i even added in my gas costs i drove 10 kilometers so people want me to start adding in those costs that i incur as well so i will throw those costs in and we're going to start trying to flip our way up to get that high-end gaming rig and who knows how long it'll take but i think the process is going to start moving a lot faster now because under a hundred dollars it's really hard to get something to re-flip and make money on you've got to be patient you've got to wait and that's exactly what we did we waited here like that cobra ready to pounce on its prey and we came up with a lot of prey actually i think we uh bit off more than we can chew that we made up for that for just chewing a lot faster and uh cleaning all the stuff up really quick so hopefully you guys enjoyed this first episode here and we're gonna come back make sure you stay subbed and ring that bell for episode two when it drops because i will give you guys an update on the listing i'm going to put the listing up for the gtx 980 then i'm going to go get the parts and episode 2 is going to be a lot of fun and this series honestly this is what it's all about tech s city this series right here is what i'm all about i've this is one of my most passionate hobbies in anything i do with used stuff whether it's used car parts which i did back in the day or now use pc tech i love turning the trash into treasure especially the dirtier it is i don't know for me the dirtier it is the better it is and it's just it's just absolute bliss man absolute bliss when you get all the stuff working so what an absolute win hope you guys enjoyed this episode if you did be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comments section below if you maybe think i should take a different path of trajectory with the parts that we got here and what would you do so love reading those thoughts and opinions is always just like this question of the day here which actually comes from the previous video we did on the b660 soyo motherboard and it's from crashpilot1000 and they ask good to see that soyo is still kicking maybe they plan a comeback to rival the current big shots and at what soyo brought to the market or soyo i actually don't even know how to pronounce it apologize for that uh what soyo brought to the market with the with these motherboards in six uh sixth generation intel or wait no sixth generation multiple sorry we did 12th generation intel 600 series motherboards what they brought to the table was a really solid board for a really solid price and i think the market really likes that so i can see them if they keep this stuff up and they keep this up with what they're doing with this b60 for example they're going to have a really solid base a user base on their hands people are going to want to buy these motherboards knowing how well they perform especially with non-case cpus and even like the 12 core 12700 f for example that'll work absolutely fine 12 600k that will work fine with these b60s and i think once people realize that wow i can get an entry level b660 board and still get that sort of higher endish cpu and it's going to work absolutely fine it's actually really good then i think people are going to start realizing hey soyo's not a bad brand and so as long as they're bringing the value for money in the competition then they're gonna come out ahead so hopefully that answers that question for you guys and with all that aside i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
