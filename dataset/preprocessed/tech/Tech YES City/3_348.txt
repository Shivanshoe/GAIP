in the last week I've been getting quite
a few messages asking to check out these so-called deals and one of them in
particular really struck me as something that's going to be a new wave of
catching you in and I feel like you're just simply not going to get the product
for this money and there are a few or actually quite a lot of reasons behind
this and we're going to go through a lot of them in today's video but also before
we do that do be careful about buying anything online remember a lot of the
times you're buying off someone that you have never met and you don't know them
at all and so really when it comes down to it they want to take your money and
you want to get the product in exchange for that and of course this leads us to
the first and foremost rule of buying online when it's too good to be true it
usually is and so this 1050 TI ad that we saw here
50 ozzie dollars for a brand new GT x 1050 TI ships now in USD terms that's a
little over 30 USD I'm sure anyone in the US or anyone Australia if this deal
was local and you could go pick it up you'd be picking up the whole lot of
these and then flipping them for three times the price but when we indeed do
look closer at this ad not everything is as it seems to be let's check out the
2020 guide to avoid getting scammed designer ddr4 memory Corsair have been
bringing this with their new Dominator series which is now available in a white
and gold ascetic and I gotta say when you put this in your rig it's gonna
certainly bling things up to a whole new level but also with the thirty six
hundred megahertz kit you've got the speeds to match links in description
below to find out more so let's get straight into this thing Wow 50 Ozzie
dollars this is looking like a bargain of a lifetime but we look at the fine
print here and it says ship from overseas now why the straightaway the
first thing before we even go to the delay and how long you're expected to
wait for this product which is two three weeks you're looking at something that
shipped overseas why would someone be shipping this from overseas to Australia
of places I mean look Estrella is quite a
competitive place for computer parts I'd say it follows closely to the US and I'd
say it even beats out places like the UK and Japan in terms of getting the best
deals on brand new PC pots so straight away my skepticism levels are rising
through the roof when they could sell it to certain countries in Europe for
example that pay a lot more locally for their graphics cards and in fact if you
sold a GTX Tempe to TI 450 ozzie dollars in some of these countries I think the
ad wouldn't even exist the servers would get overloaded so quickly they just get
taken down and you wouldn't even be able to see the ad so for whatever reason
this seller has decided they want to bless the gracious Aziz with this
beautiful deal when we already get pretty good deals now for you guys
overseas who don't know who Cogan is they're a very popular retail in
Australia and they usually offer really good value for money however it looks
like they're starting to get into the business like Amazon when they're
allowing third-party sellers to sell on their website and so this presents
another problem and of course when systems start out especially in the
infant stages they actually present problems for people to come along and
exploit the system now I'm not saying that this seller won't ship you your
product what I'm trying to say is that you want to get this gtx 10:50 TI at 50
ozzie dollars now also another interesting fact about australia when it
comes to online sales ebay is the biggest dog in town and we compare that
to Amazon in the US Japan and UK they have a dominant market share their
Amazon in Australia is having a really tough time gaining market share because
every time they try to do something like that
eBay have like 10 20 % off sales and they're actually really good not to
mention there's already a plethora of competitive eat Ahlers as well offering
really good prices with a trusted established user base so I think the
Amazon and straya they have [Music]
that being said a place like Kogan offering a similar service to Amazon in
Australia is of course a good thing now one thing I will mention is that if you
do want to buy deals like this from places like Cogan I definitely take up
that insurance option where they're going to guarantee that if you don't get
this product you'll get your money back in this case if you are buying things
like this and they're too good to be true then definitely take that insurance
for a few extra bucks but that being said you may be thinking well Brian
there's a good chance that you may get this gtx 10:50 TI for $50 dollars and
sure they might ship it to you but what I'm trying to tell you is that you'll
never actually get it anyhow getting back to the seller at hand with the gtx
temperature TI so we've already established one little crack here and
that is why would they want to sell internationally to a competitive
marketplace already when they can sell to other marketplaces and they could
make more profit another thing is to the international postage itself coming from
overseas to australia is going to be literally over half the cost of the item
so we're looking around 30 ozzie dollars to ship a graphics card internationally
to australia and that's going to bring down their total profits to $20 so we
can already see there that it just seems too good to be true but when we compound
the problem of the shipping itself it's then looking way too good to be true
then we have the next problem available and if anything this will be some advice
for Cogan's website and that is the seller could sell the stuff locally
however we only know that they're selling from overseas we don't know
exactly where their location is I'd love it if Kogan could update the website to
say hey this sellers selling from say Tokyo Japan or they're selling from New
York in the United States we do have no idea where exactly they're selling from
and maybe they're just selling from a location where they've got no local
market or no retail say they're in a real rural area but they have a lot of
stock built up so those two things aside it's really making me hard to trust this
ad before I click on the Buy It Now there's also another quick update in
this video and that is walas on gumtree looking at 1050 TI prices I came across
an ad from another Australian retailer peddling the same graphics card from the
same seller that was on Cogan's website so this is looking pretty bad I'm gonna
in both these retails in Australia and get them to check this out more closely
and then there's the next point this is the final part and that is the price
they're asking 50 Aussie dollars if we look at the market rates for a GTX Tim
50 TI first of all I know for a fact locally if you get a GTX 1050 GI for a
hundred Ozzie dollars used that's a really good deal and most the time they
go for around 150 especially buy it now prices with a shipping box and that's
used if you want to buy these things new they go sometimes for up to two hundred
Aussie dollars which I wouldn't pay personally but the fact is Aliexpress
when we go to a place that is shipping these cards international and they're
readily available the prices are around a hundred and eighty ozzie so for some
reason this seller is selling it under a third of the price that's what's already
established so that should be the biggest alarm bell ringing the fact that
it's just way too good to be true and every time and I'm telling you now over
the whole time I've been buying computer parts when something's too good to be
true in my case it a hundred percent has been when I've
been buying online locally is where I've always got the best deals now in the
past I have tried some of these deals and I've tried to buy them only to be
refunded my money from PayPal via eBay where I've had protection and they've
identified it as a scam and never funded me my money straight away and now the
funny thing about eBay and PayPal one thing I will give them kudos for is they
have worked on their anti scam protection a lot over the last few years
I remember in 2008 I think that was like the last year where people could pull
that kind of stuff off on eBay because after that they started essentially
escrowing the funds and if you escrow the funds you essentially hold them in a
third party in that case PayPal and then once the product ship that's got to the
buyer PayPal will then release the funds to the seller and so this essentially
stops people from getting the money quickly drawing it down to their bank
and then going on a spending spree I remember in 2008 there was this big
famous seller on eBay I do forget in the name of the seller
but essentially they just had all these items at discount prices
literally at half price of already good deals online and now I think they ended
up scamming nearly a million dollars and it ended up getting to the stage where
people just started leaving all this negative feedback if someone remembers
that case in 2008 be sure to link the name in the description below because it
was a big one in the eBay community I do remember this one blowing up and they
did end up scamming a lot of money and that's how the PayPal anti-fraud system
ended up coming into effect anyhow with those three things aside why are they
shipping from overseas why are they not selling locally and also why is the
price too good to be true if those three bells are ringing then definitely stay
away from these deals though what about good practices what some things to look
out for going forward especially if you're looking for a deal now recently I
got alerted by a friend of mine who said Brian I was looking to pick up this 1080
tea I was going for under $400 I think he was negotiating a price of 260
dollars for a 1080i now he knew it was too good to be true and so he offered to
pay the seller with PayPal with buyer protection and the seller kept rejecting
him he said no I want bank deposit now another thing about bank deposit is you
usually never get your money back so if you're buying PC parts on the Internet
do not pay with bank deposit unless you've bought from that seller before
unless you essentially trust the seller 100% to get you your item if not use
something like an escrow service or something where you get some sort of
protection so when it's too good to be true just like the online sale if
someone wants you to pay bank deposit and they've got this price that
encourages such a good deal so soon I would be very skeptical now this is
where it reverts back to local deals if you can go locally and get yourself a
deal that's verified where you can physically check the item you can see
it's working before you purchase it that really eliminates practically 99.9
percent of your potential problems sure back in the day if you're buying a used
car there was ways to band-aid the problem but with technology it's really
hard especially with computer parts to band-aid problems in either works or a
doesn't work and trust me when I say this I have dealt with a
lot of faulty PC pots to tell you when something will work or a doesn't work
especially if you start running a stress test which if you're checking out
locally and you want to be sure of the deal get them to stress test it right in
front of you so when you're buying online from a place you don't know if
it's too good to be true and there's the option there to get the insurance and
it's pretty cheap I definitely get the insurance if it's a private seller
wanting to ship it and they can sell the thing locally you've got to ask yourself
the question of why do they want bank deposit and why don't they want to sell
it locally and what you're gonna see naturally going from here on in is these
problems are going to exacerbate with the current situation going on around
the world put it this way when people start losing jobs money starts drying up
it's a simple equation and so with that you're gonna see more people trying to
be opportunistic but they're doing it in the wrong way and that is they want to
take other people's money on the premise that they're selling them are so-called
bargain so when it comes to getting the best deals you always going to find at
least in my experience the best deals are going to be the ones that picked up
local where you don't have these intermediary services and you don't have
to pay for things like shipping and also platform fees like the platforms we've
mentioned in today's video anyhow the last point I want to make especially in
this point in time is if you're buying things internationally there may be huge
shipping delays this ad on the website said it could take anywhere from two to
three weeks but I've found a special in buying some things I file Express
sometimes they get here in a month but sometimes they can take upwards of two
months to get the product and I've recently experienced that when I ordered
a couple of snowmen CPU coolers and they took over two months nearly three months
to get here and I'm still waiting on motherboards that I mentioned that I was
getting in for an ex ninety nine motherboard comparison they're still on
the way and I've hoarded them months and months ago so the weights from overseas
can be really big especially during these times so do be careful when you
see ads like this but another thing I will say is if you are in the market for
deals always check with a friend always run it through someone who's had
experience dealing with PC parts it's the best way you're gonna get some
feedback on the weather that deal could be legitimate or
couldn't be but hopefully the basics in today's video the advice I've given is
enough to say hey just stay away from these potential scams anyhow if you guys
enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button and also let us
know in the comments section below what are your tips and what are your things
to be skeptical of at the moment especially if it helps people not get
scammed love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this
question of the day which relates directly to 10:50 tea eyes and it's from
Leandro Martin Peralta and they asked I live in New Zealand and I have been
trying to find secondhand GTX 780 eyes load profiles with no luck do you know a
reliable international seller I could get them from
well definitely not the one that we mentioned in today's video but that
being said the low profile 1050 T eyes I've actually only come into one of them
recently in deals hunts but also on that note I only have seen another one up for
sale so they are actually quite rare per se so if you are looking for one of
these especially if you want to buy them in bulk then it's gonna be hard to find
them especially since a lot of the used ones would only be from one-time sellers
and they'd probably rather sell them locally than overseas as we mentioned in
today's video too so I would look for maybe something off Aliexpress that may
be your best bet but even then you're not really going to be getting a good
deal going used GPUs off Aliexpress basically when it comes to our Express
CPUs snowman coolers and a lot of other stuff like x99 motherboards really good
value for money but the GPUs there are real mediocre except of course for the
rx for 70s but they're not low-profile so basically my answer to that question
is good luck I don't know where you could find those deals for tempeh DTI
low profiles from international cells anyhow I'll catch you guys in another
tech video very soon if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that
content then be sure to hit that sub button outrunning that Bell and I'll see
you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music]
