[Music] Probably wondering what i'm doing..? Pfft, that's me praying for a crash, because we are going into a very weird pc market here tech yes citizens welcome back to the 100 flip up challenge and this is this series where i started off last year with 100 aussie dollars and i keep flipping my way up through acquiring good deals on pc parts and then putting together gaming pcs and selling those and then using that budget to keep buying more pc parts and building more gaming pcs and in the previous episode to give you guys a quick summary we ended up selling those two rtx 30 70 pcs and if you haven't seen that episode i'll put the link up here and we also had a budget left over so we sold one rtx 3070 pc for 2 hundred aussie dollars and then we sold the other one for two thousand seven hundred so that left us with five thousand five hundred aussie dollars and then we had fourteen hundred and eighty one aussie dollars left over which leaves us now with a spending budget of nearly 7 000 aussie dollars which is huge we can pretty much build any pc we want at this stage but you guys are probably thinking what's going on with the market what is the strategy right now because i'm going to tell you we did get lucky at the start of this series in that there was huge demand for low-end and mid-range pcs when i started out the series but as time went on prices just became really out of whack for gravis cards you look left you've got an overpriced gpu you look right yet another overpriced gpu so we've had to work our way through a very weird and difficult market but you may have noticed since episode one and up to episode six there has been a big shift in the parts that i'm looking for and the pcs i'm building and we're going to be continuing on with rtx 3000 pcs and the main reason is is because the actual competition from other gaming pc sellers is only coming from people selling gaming pc i'm yet to see someone building up an rtx 3000 series pc only for them to get over it and resell it to the market but what i have seen however is a lot of people reselling their low and mid-range gaming pcs and trying to upgrade so there's competition coming from not just pc resellers but also a lot of other people in the market which makes it hard for me to get much profit out of the low end mid range right now so all that talk aside we've got a juicy deal that has just popped up and we'll go pick that up right now and we're gonna go to the computer store and pick up some components for these builds let's get cracker lacking if you've got this annoying windows needs activation message and you want to get rid of it for cheap then today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 bucks after you use the coupon code bftyc you can get yourself a legit single end user windows 10 license today links in description below so we just finished up at the computer store picking up about two grams worth of stuff here and we've got three power supplies three kits of rgb memory and also two 120 water coolers because they only had one gamdius m1 in stock and this is one of my favorite cases for flipping sort of premium to high-end gaming pcs then we also picked up a gtx 1080 along the way and we got that for 350 aussie dollars so i'm feeling really good going into this episode here but i'm going to say we also got three of these right here this is the i7 10 700 f and i asked them how much are you 10 700 s and they said 370 aussie dollars and i just paused and i'm shocked 379 aussie for an eight core 16 thread that is an absolute bargain but let's get back to the tech yes studio now because what i'm going to do is i'm going to be picking and choosing parts from all different places to make the best value gaming rigs possible where i asked this store here how much their rtx 30 70s were and they said they're coming in from and that's the lowest price from 1300 aussie dollars and i'm like man come on like i remember paying like 9.50 for them and a little bit around that area when when i did the last purchase of the rtx 3070 so hopefully we can i mean we have to pay a little bit of a premium but hopefully we're not paying 350 dollars of a premium so let's hit the road and we're now back at the tech yes studio with this first pickup right here that 1080 unboxing it it looks really clean extremely clean and the good thing is it came with this vr headset thingy majiggy which i'm gonna try and sell separately i didn't even know auris or gigabyte included this back in the day i didn't actually get a 1080 extreme gaming back in the day so i didn't know but we only got one of these athena and one cases because that's all they had in stock and this case honestly it's one of my favorite value for money cases it's just an absolutely gorgeous looking case and i have a little combo where i put it in with the 120 mil and it just gets rid of that single non-rgb fan at the back making just those four rgb fans it just looks really mint now since we got three i7s for a really good price i wanted to try and piece out three rtx 3070 builds and also a 1080 build in our whole budget which i think we should be able to easily do now you're probably wondering what's all this writing on the paper right here and that's the stuff that i still need to get in order to piece out these three rtx 3070 builds and so the computer store i went to msy they only had one of these cases they only had two of those 120mm coolers and they only had three kits of the memory the rgb memory so i still need to get three more kits of the 16 gigabyte 3200 megahertz rgb in order to piece out 32 gigabytes in each build and i also got to get three m.21 terabytes but they had them but they wanted 150 aussie for them roughly a pop and then i looked online and i can get them for 125 so i can save myself 75 bucks just by clicking a few buttons then i'd still need to get two more athena m1s because they're out of them and then i still get one more of those coolers and of course three rtx 3070s which is going to be pretty hard to do but i'm going to leave that till last because that that only gives me one thing to focus on where i can then sit and wait sit and wait and then come into some luck that's what i'm hoping for the 30 70s in terms of this gtx 1080 build however we're gonna go get this stuff ordered online here right now that we need for this new build then we're going to get onto looking for some extra parts to get this build underway [Music] so we just finished up tailing up the second round now of the parts and you probably saw from some of that b-roll that the 30-70 situation is really bad to the point where i think i'm gonna have to try and look for some of these locally and even if i can save a hundred and fifty dollars or something like that then that will be able to piece out these builds but we've got a new tally here after getting 1536 dollars of additional parts and i forgot before to mention that we still needed the motherboard so i bought three z490 motherboards for 537 in total then we got those three ssds that's an additional 375 then we got a another two cases 198 an additional cooler 81 and then there was the three ram kits at 145 and all that stuff will be delivered except for the two cases i'm gonna have to go pick that up still and then we had that 1080 which was 350. and now this leaves us at a new total of three thousand eight hundred and forty five and i did say at the start of the episode we had around seven thousand but it was a little bit under i think it was six thousand nine hundred and forty something dollars so this leaves us with about three thousand one hundred aussie dollars to piece out three rtx 3070s and also a build as well so i think we're kind of in a bit of trouble here in terms of if i just wanted to go build four rigs straight and then sell them i think i may not be able to do that with this budget left over so i've got two options here and that is just go for the 330 70s leave that 1080 on the side and then peace out that build a little bit later or i can just go for two rtx 3070s now and the 1080 piece out the 1080 build now flip that use that money and then put it towards another 30 70. i think i'll go down that route because i want to try and piece out that build tonight where we've got the most important part of the build that is the graphics card so let's get on to now finding a solution here with this 1080 build because i'm i want to get that done because the 30 70 thing i'm going to have to sort of over the next few days i think i have to wait for something to come up either it's been used for a month or two months and try and get that a little under the 1300 asking price because 3070s everywhere i just sold out and if they're not sold out they want literally like 1400 aussie dollars for these things so it's just way too much where i can probably pick them up on the marketplace or gumtree for maybe 1100 1150 if i'm lucky so my calculations are we're gonna have to flip something in order to get that third rtx 3070 so let's get on to it fast forward a few days and we've been waiting we've been waiting we've been sitting idly by and then suddenly rtx 3070 zeus dual bang comes up a thousand dollars i'm pouncing on that right now and also a ryzen 3 3 100 for a hundred dollars double pounds we're gonna go pick up both those deals right now but then i've also got to organize a motherboard some ddr4 memory uh another power supply for this gtx 1080 build so we're gonna get onto that right now but let's hit the yes mobile [Music] and now we're back at the tech yes studio with the rtx 3070 that is one of three that i'm going to need to score at a reasonable price but that build right there we're going to put that together that should tally up to maybe i think off the top of my head around 2.1 k we're going to try and get around 2.8 2.9 for it so hopefully we bring in 700 profit on that one and then we've got this build right here which we're going to piece together with a 16 gigabyte kit i'm going to use this from that parts hunt that i got we got this for 60 aussie dollars and i've also got here a 480 gigabyte ssd we're going to use this this cost me 52 from memory i did get this at a really good price because when i use this in a budget ryzen build where i'm going to pull this motherboard from the build i had to think about this because this for a hundred dollars right here even though it's an x370 it's actually got the rgb on the board itself around the ram slots and a lot of rgb on the board making the lack of rgb on the cpu cooler and also the lack of rgb on the memory it'll sort of accommodate for those weaknesses because believe it or not like you guys are probably laughing some of you guys might be laughing right now but rgb is no joke you've got that stuff on your pc it's going to be selling pcs so we got this here 350 100 100 and 112 we got the case for 55 i think we're gonna have to use one of those power supplies as well we're looking at around like high highest 700s off the top of my head and we should be able to quickly pull this one out and sell it for around high 1100 so there's hopefully around 400 profit there and that's how i'm looking at these two builds already we still have to piece together the other two builds but that's reliant upon me finding two more 3070s as well as pissing out still have to get those other gamdius cases so this is sort of like work in progress here it's getting a lot harder to flip because the desirable parts are getting a bit more scarce and picking up at the right price kind of getting a bit of a challenge but i love a challenge so we're continuing forward let's get these two pcs built out however and see how they come out and i mean man i just like honestly guys this is one of the funnest series i'm doing i love turning that hundred dollars just into more and more money i mean look at what we've done with 100 already and i'm like hoping i'm hoping that i can beat out inflation you know like turning 100 into a few thousand is uh hopefully that's beating the inflation [Music] [Music] so we just finished up the update on this bios here and i was telling you guys this actual motherboard here is really making this build really shine especially for the budget and the money that we paid so definitely picking up the lack of rgb on the ram and the cooler and i'm really happy with it and how it's come out so we're installing windows now but we also finished this rtx 3070 pc and you guys have already seen b-roll of this one it's pretty much the stable pc that i'm running through as it's giving me the best profits and in terms of just sellability these things just sell really quick when i put them up for sale in the last like pretty much every time i've sold a build in this case with this combo like this it's sold really quickly and then this one here will test the market but i think if i do the right shots on this it should go pretty quickly as well because good pcs right now are actually in a bit of shortage in terms of of course the graphics cards being the main component that's pushing prices up so everyone's raised prices but if you can pick up the gpus for a good price then you can pretty much command i guess a less expensive price than the competitors and still make good profits so that's what we're kind of doing right now and i i guess you guys want to sit down before we conclude this episode see where we're at because i'm going to have to pretty much wait it out right now to get some rtx 3070s but we're going to talk about the market in general as well and see what's going on because the market is changing going into this year it's it's just one of those things it's one of those things that we've got to chat about so let's get down into that hot seat so coming out of this episode i was really shocked at some of the things going on in the market first of all the i7 10 700 f that's come down to such a cheap price point i know 11th gen is just around the corner i know that's going to uh give out more ipc and stuff like that but you're still getting an 8 core 16 thread in australia for 379 aussie dollars and that's in even paying tax on it so they're definitely bringing down the prices of their cpus and that role reversal thing we even touched on that a few months ago on the channel that role reversal of amd offering the cause for the for the money now is looking like intel's offering the cause and value for the money which i would have never expected this a few years ago in terms of this dynamic changing and amd's now the performance king and now intel sort of playing catch up and so they're offering a lot more cores and threads for your money now it's just crazy but the 10700f i've used it before i think it's a great cpu and admittedly i'd like to see intel unlock the overclocking now that they're kind of getting pushed into that level where they have to offer more value and so i think they're going to be bringing out overclocking on the memory or at least the 3200 megahertz they're going to be pushing that limit up on the budget motherboards so we won't even have to use z490s and stuff like that going on into the 11th gen if we continue this series going forward but in terms of other parts as well the memory the ddr4 memory the prices are still absolutely fine there power supplies are still good cases they're still fine as well like everything i'm seeing in terms of pricing but graphics cards is messed up and in fact i'd say even some of the prices on the other parts have come down because so many people are buying gpus and not the other parts that the other parts are starting to come down in price at least here in australia i know you guys in the us have all this stuff going on with tariffs and i don't know exactly how that is affecting pc parts i'd actually love to watch another tech tuber who lives in the u.s talk about the tariffs and how they've just even if they don't go through all the meat and potatoes of what the documents say and all that just if they can give a real world experience on what they're seeing with pricing because what i'm saying with pricing is everything but gpus is absolutely fine and it's actually coming down a little bit in price too so that's at least some good news in this messed up world of i can't get a graphics card but another thing is too i think rtx 3070s if you look hard enough if you're just on your computer getting your finger ready on that f5 button you should be able to make some magic happen i made some magic happen here today albeit i think i got lucky came up for a thousand bucks i just straight away didn't even hesitate put in the offer went and picked it up and got that 30 70 and then the 1080 was a good deal as well so we're gonna be making a bit of bank off those pcs and hopefully those flips will bring us into the next episode where i will show you guys what happened all between then and we'll hopefully be able to start off with a new budget or we'll have uh two more pcs ready to go but in terms of the flipping prices and the budget i'll put all that stuff up on the screen for you guys again what we've paid so far in outlaid what i expect to sell these two pcs for as well but ultimately it's just about getting that comfortable profit margin and then of course use that profit margin to move forward and make more hustle and get towards we've already i mean when we look back we've already made the dream rig so now we're just going forward and who knows what we'll buy next if you guys want to let us know in the comments section below what you want to see me start flipping in this series if it's not just tech maybe we can set aside some of this budget and start flipping something else and having a bit of fun because this series honestly man when i do this i just really am having a lot of fun it's uh it's the nature of the the brian easy before the tech yes man and uh he's sort of i've been missing that sort of style it's been coming back lately and i know the content hasn't been coming as much as you guys would like i know people are messaging me on twitter people are emailing me uh and where's the content you know you're right dude and i'm coming back into my gear don't worry we're putting the thing back in second gear now we're going to be putting the foot down we're going to be accelerating the content it's coming back i just had to get myself back into the game and i do this from time to time but this last few months has definitely been the worst that i've had this spell so i've had to do a lot of stuff off the channel and it's taken a lot of processing time put it that way it's like think of it as your cpu's just been bottlenecked and that bottleneck has just had a lot of stuff to process and now the bottlenecks kind of freeing up so that should be the content coming back to your sub boxes but anyway guys with that aside do let us know in the comment section below what you guys think about the market what you think about pricing are things different where you are as well i love reading your comments below and what you think will happen with gpu prices i just think this uh crypto bubble of course it just can't last forever bubbles never last forever people think they're gonna keep going up until they pop and um that's just one thing to be wary of so wherever you do just remember don't put if you're going into crypto hogs i did do a poll for some of you guys and i think like 12 percent were mining crypto which is not like just off your gaming pcs but then things like five percent were pretty heavy into crypto so don't drop more than you can afford to lose that's always the sound stable advice and with that all out of the way we got here the question of the day which comes from edgar friendly and they asked do you remember if and how you managed to control cis fans 3 and 4 and this is on a video that i posted a long time ago and that fx agd65 amd motherboard i flipped that in a build a long time ago that was actually when i started getting into uh making youtube content so actually to answer the question directly quickly i have no clue that's way too long ago for me to remember something about specific but um when it came to that motherboard actually the funny story of that motherboard was that was in a time when i was doing youtube and i was just buying stuff and having a lot of fun building pcs and i'd just buy the stuff and do the videos and then i'd re-flip the stuff after i was done with it and then soon after that we found the used stuff and that just opened up a whole different can of worms where that's where that's really the the start of tech yes city in the as you know it nowadays anyhow guys if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content then you know what to do hit that sub button ringing that bell and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
