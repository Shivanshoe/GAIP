take two that's right let's get the camera okay so use price performance we're gonna look at it and why it's sort of going into this year the latter half of this year it's been so difficult with used price performance because two years ago when i was banging this stuff uh four years ago i was i was just coming off japan when i was banging used price performance man there were deals everywhere you were like you were getting you could go on to your local place and pick up a part and you're pretty much guaranteed to get that double price performance figure that we're looking at ideally when you go with used because you're carrying a risk that inherently isn't there with the new price performance and of course the stuff's used most likely if it's an older generation you're going to lose benefits of whether it's driver support or whether it's power efficiency so there's plenty of reasons to state why used should be cheaper in general anyway but we're going to pull up our benchmark again minus the uh the double looping audio so thanks for pointing that out bro i got i got the young guy he's good he's pointing me out he saved the stream he saved me from myself which i sometimes need people to do so let's pull it up 638 aussie dollars right this is the benchmark because this is a 10 100 f 1650 super h410 motherboard 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory 2666 with h410 120 gigabyte ssd one terabyte hard drive uh led red led fan in that case watt power supply and this will work this will work really well so here it is here that's 638 now for you guys in the us this is going to be about 400 and something usd so this is the benchmark when we go on to marketplace now so we're going to type in gtx 1060 something that's used performs similar to a 1650 super let's have a look at the amazing deals that we've got here 220 dollars um yeah so 225 for this brand new super 220 so i'm just i'm not really seeing where the uh where the actual like deals are at the moment so it's kind of hard um okay use if they're saying the stream's grainy as well can you see it yeah i mean like okay right so as long as you guys can see what's happening on the screen here okay cool all right see we go here we're gonna pull up straight away gtx 1060 six gigabyte 220 bucks we're going to go to the uh live deals cam here hold that up let's go okay so this one right here we're going 220 gtx 1066 gigabyte i mean this is like the same price and so this is the problem of having right now with the uh used uh market in general is that it's just like this stuff is just like it's a 1070 here it is and i mean these guys like i'm not gonna like look if the sellers the sellers are good on them like you guys like if you're selling something you wanna get the most money you can for it right but it's just like the market itself when i go on and do deals hunts lately i've been doing things that are completely different to the mainstream 1060s 1070s and this is because it's just like the prices just aren't that good so in general so we've got here 1060 let's pull up 1070 now we'll search for a gtx 1070 and here is 350 bucks then we've got another 1060 for 200 bucks so like ideally you want to be probably paying around 150 and that's 75 percent or maybe coming in around 65 percent of a 1650 super and that's hitting that okay it's used it's given us decent price performance it's still way over that 50 mark but this is what the market is going for people are buying up these 1060s and they're buying them up in droves so i guess at the same time we've got the six we got the used stuff and it's just like it's not really doing anything in terms of hitting that price performance mark so i'm at a crossroads here guys i'm at a crossroads right and we're going to go to the big screen because i need you guys and your your opinions in chat because i've been speaking to a lot of people lately and they've been telling me that the used market is just not what it's used to be i got some guys messaging me on the dealer they say they're selling up all their stuff they're done they're packing it up with the used price performance and i mean i'm this is where i'm confused right now because this stream is is like i'm a positive dude and i'm all about that positivity but when there's no deals to be had i can't really do deals going forward on used price performance and so going forward do you guys want to see more new content like where we're just cookie cutting new builds together and making all this new stuff because at 600 at 638 bucks i can probably put together this pc um at 638 bucks i could probably put together this pc and then charge a build cost and all the other stuff and probably flip it for 850. and someone's still getting a new pc they're getting pretty good price performance uh they're getting something with a 10 100 that's going to perform similar it's going to perform like a 6700 and uh this is what we're seeing the used market is kind of like kind of like you know it's it's difficult for me because i go out and i go on marketplace and i'm looking for whatever i can and stick into discipline but it seems like there's this other avenue right now it seems like people are going this way and they're like yeah i want to overpay for used parts and that's the question i got like for the guys who are buying up gigabytes for 220 bucks is there any of you guys out there in the comments are you buying these 1060s and then re-flipping them and builds because i haven't really spoke to everyone i know on the coast here is always looking for a good deal and so like this stuff like when we look at say in the past i've seen parts hunts and i've seen these parts that are up for sale and the prices are there those those listings they end up going but i what i want to know is do they go at these prices like is a 1070 still going for 350 bucks because if it is whoever's buying it really isn't getting a good deal especially since they take on that risk of use now here's the funny thing like i had a guy call me up the other day and he said to me he's like brian dude i have my 6700 you're not gonna believe actually that's that's you and the that's you brisbane i t tech that's my man that's br how you doing dude he's in the comments he can tell you about his 6700 it went to bonkers it's gone that 6700 is no longer in existence and he wasn't overclocking it he wasn't thrashing it or anything like that it's just gone that's a 6700 so that's the risk you run when you go with used price performance you can get a cpu that at any given time it can just go and so that's what i'm having like this is sort of going forward we're going to keep doing the the used monthly parts hands that's always going to keep happening that's always going to keep on keep on but i feel like we need to sort of focus on the new stuff now which is weird because we're going to go back to the 638 because of what's going on on the marketplace right now and like we can move over to gumtree and we can have a look here uh 16 gigabytes of ram used this is the exact same stuff right this is the exact this just came up out of nowhere this one we're seeing with the ddr4 memory is that at 70 bucks this is asgard as well we had the brand new stuff here i'm pretty sure for 83 bucks so like you're still buying used memory for 70 dollars that's same stuff so 26.66 so let's just type in gtx 1060. we'll see if we can we can actually see if we can find some good deals price for oh my man my man he's got a c he's firm on the price he's got 150 bucks that was like my threshold for a 1060. six gigabyte my man has got he's hooking up ray all right so tested and working all right so here's the first if i was doing the deals hunt this is how i do it guys you i'd be putting down on this okay i'll be putting down on this this is the first deal i've found so far let's keep on moving along and seeing what we can find so usually i go through i just go through gtx right max price of 200 because we want to sift out all the gaming pcs no one's going to be selling a gaming pc with a gtx graphics card in it for under 200 bucks so what you're doing is when you filter this right here you're going to be filtering out a lot of the gaming pcs that come up and so now we can just look at what parts are on the market and what bargains we can get gtx 9750 i'm usually only paying 100 bucks for these again you're looking at a car that is now six years old let that sink in for a second six years old for a graphics card it's starting to carry big risks so yeah the price performance of it if in a perfect world if that thing is going to last another six years it's good right even at 150 bucks is okay but we're starting to move into the territory of okay this thing is really old and it's 3.5 but now we're going down 770. this is the same thing it's like 90 bucks you're getting a car that's even older now and the 7070 used up a bit more power than the 970 wasn't as power efficient so you're looking at a car that really should you should be paying max maybe 70 bucks for this thing max even that that's even generous so i'd say these two are overpriced i'm going down here at 260. it's like wow why would you waste a good power supply on a graphics card like that so we're going to skip that even at 15 bucks gtx 960 rock strix 125 it's like i'm guessing it's the two gigabyte model not the four gigabyte model gtx 980 wind force okay if you can get this for around 130 140 that's not bad i'll probably put in an offer of that later uh gtx 772 gigabyte here's one here that's come up at a decent price uh 50 bucks i'd probably put in an offer of that so there are some decent deals to be had but you're finding that the stuff and the age of this stuff there is a risk that i'm carrying right now on this stuff so there's an inherent risk to all this and that's the one thing when we're going to keep on talking about the risk here because when you sell a pc you want to kind of be guaranteeing that pc because um otherwise you'll be like you'll be guaranteeing something that if you don't guarantee it hey you're really destroying the used market and the reputation and the second thing is is that if you if you do like sell this stuff it can come back to you man karma is a bad thing so try not to if you i know a few guys i heard some stories here on the gold coast i heard one guy um sold uh recently a gt 1030 pc for a thousand bucks and i like when i heard that i was like damn dude like damn like that's just like next level a gt-1030 that's what i heard from the grapevine and so what i'm thinking is going forward what's in the pc really doesn't matter as opposed to what's on the outside and that's rgb so we are going to go down that route and take a look at it with some experiments but in the meantime i'm still sticking to that discipline so let's go through here gtx 980 i mean it's the anniversary gold edition so i can kind of understand why this guy wants to get 200 bucks for this even though i don't really care about the limited edition in this sense because i wouldn't be collecting this card personally uh we got another 970 here for 150 bucks tempe ti for 155 i'd be yeah so all right we'll go back through that we got another 980 for 200 bucks here 970 for 150 bucks 1050 ti 455 bucks i'd be laying down again 100 bucks on both of these maybe 110 on 1050 ti this here the anniversary edition i don't really need that so yikers yakers here we have a 750 graphics card for sale this one's not too bad i mean after the after the show's over i'll probably whack in or i can just take it on another screen i'll just log in and whack in an offer uh hang on you guys we'll just uh we'll just log in and then whack on another another beautiful offer on the good old gum tree okay yeah yeah that's why i gotta make sure so i mean what working camera yeah we're working 35 bucks there we go everybody's happy we're back in 35 bucks for that um i mean did they say price is firm on this 10vdti okay i found retail price to average around 215 bucks really okay 1050 ti they're not even are they even retailing anymore there's a low profile okay so there's a low profile for 206 bucks but that's a low profile that's for a completely different occasion so i don't look i'm not going to put in an offer because i just don't think he wants to go lower than 155 like i think my 110 is going to look at that and go no way um i'm going to tell these guys here look i'm going to tell these these guys here i'm going to put 100 bucks down on these and then this one here i'm going to put down 40 on this so here you go 100 bucks [Music] 100 bucks so let's just go we're going through the deals guys we're rapid fire here we're rap whoa okay wait wait before i put down an offer of this thing in perfect working order i mean damn wait what do you guys think in chat do you guys think that things oh cool we have a super chat too yeah super chat just a second let me know what you guys think about this gpu should i put down an offer on this gpu should i do it is the question i i like i'm a bit nervous about this one so we got was it buying the bogan of beer [Music] i'll have a beer later i'll have a beer later we actually got the 6800 um we got the 6800 in and that was uh we're doing a review on that now the 6800 i'm gonna be giving that away but yeah like that's what i mean from the photos you can't tell like if that's just like erosion like there's a difference between techies loving and erosion so a lot of yeah a lot of the guys saying past that's my gut reaction too is like this thing's on its last legs so um yeah like my gut says it's just like you look at the bolts they kind of look like they're rusted as well i see that one there that's rusty dusty so this thing's like had a hard life so it's just yeah i'm i'm just i'm gonna pass like that's what i'm gonna start trusting my gut and i always have trust in my goal when it comes to this stuff so like you guys have seen it live right i'm gonna i'm gonna pull that one this one looks alright like the guy's like okay gtx 970 win force he looks like he's he looks like he's a straight up ball of this guy so we're gonna go with that the strix i mean just the general presentation of these came off well that one i saw like okay i think he's showing you the back as the first photo because he's like look it still boots up but so no i just i don't want to put down off of that one because again you got to put in a gaming pc to eventually flip it so it's like what you what you're getting in you've got to get out so you've got to put out so that one's uh we'll miss that we'll give that one a skippy skip stop okay so we're going to keep looking at these cars we're going to keep looking through here 960 for 110 no there's a bit like there's actually a big difference between the 960 and 972 so so that's about it like that's gtx that's all there is like that's it fellas that is deals hunting for you a couple of nine series cars and a seven series card for 200 bucks and a 1060 actually we saw that 1060 before that guy wasn't too bad so he was all right like look i'll just i'm gonna throw in an offer because i mean he's the only guy who's actually priced his card pretty well i'm just going to say like yo can you uh 150 posted because you know you gotta post the thing i'm not driving 120 kilometers for a um for a card like that so and there's my email there too if you guys want to hit me up take your city at gmail pretty obvious anyway back to facebook so or we can check out some ryzen deals too everyone's like okay bro what about ryzen like you gotta be rising it up uh we'll go we'll expand that to 300 because maybe you want to get like a ryzen 5 3 600 a motherboard or something like that um he's got a motherboard i'm not paying 200 bucks for a motherboard because you're not going to really you're only going to get that back on the high end when people like ask for that on the high end right so if you're looking at motherboards uh let's talk about motherboards quickly because this is one thing like when it comes to flipping uh you want to wait up when it comes to motherboards you want to be like usually a lot of times you just want to be getting by with something that'll run with the stuff like don't get a motherboard with a say 5950x and then go with the b450 that could be throttling that's just not cool but say for instance you're going to go put a maximus extreme in this in this build you're not gonna be getting your money back because no one really cares it's like okay i want like a 3600 i want to couple it with a b450 or an x570 even if i want an x570 then i don't really care if it's the maximum six stream so when you go to look for motherboards don't go looking for the most expensive thing unless it's your personal build and you know you want to overclock and you want all those extra capabilities out of the motherboard so when i look for motherboards i'm usually looking for them either with a combo or something that's going to work and give out a balance especially for the price performance so let's get back to the let's get back to the deals hunting here we got a little tv box you guys want a little bit of a tv box actually we'll quickly talk about um before we get back to the deals we could be talking the tv box here you get that if you need a windows 10 coupon code right here is it today's vsp they're making the channel like dude they're keeping the channel alive is scd keys asrock and corsair these guys are the channel sponsors they're keeping me alive during these uh tough times when the you know the views are down and all that stuff uh as are our corsair and std keys they're keeping us alive here they're awesome sponsors too like i just recently blocked out a um manscape sponsor spot because they sent the products over i just didn't like it at all so i'm like look i'm not doing this manscape sponsor spot um was it it's 30 so bftyc yeah so you get that in you work that in there's the bftyc like that and you get 30 discount this is for the month of november and um december and i'll just show that now actually so we um we did this and we said to manscape i was like look i tried their products and i didn't believe in it so when i do sponsor spots for you guys i'm only going to do products that i believe in and so this is one of those they're retail keys we've tested these out they're good and so that's just what we're about we do we do swan spot plugs but they're legit they're keeping it real for you guys let's move back to the uh hopefully the scene is here we'll get back to the deals hunts right about now and then there's corsair with the wave three this is the microphone i'm using right now i absolutely love this thing besides me doing background stuff with the audio loops this mic has been an absolute champion never like never pops those peas it never like clips or anything like that so it's just a really good mic if you want to get into doing voiceovers and uh really giving your viewers a good experience with the audios so let's get back to we're going over to gumtree we're going to look at some ryzen stuff right now because everyone's like okay ryzen ryzen's it at the moment and i'd say ryzen's in like a weird spot right now because intel are coming back like the 10 100 f let's pull up this quickly for a second before we look at ryzen we'll quickly talk about this one 10 100 f 119 bucks 3 100 this is where i'm at ryzen uh ryzen 3 3100 we've got 159 bucks that's the difference of 40 dollars right now between amd's 4 core and intel's 4 core 8 thread so they're both four cores eight threads both relevant cpus extremely relevant but it's you don't ignore what's out there right don't go to one brand and say i'm going on this brand because of the brand like i'm telling you now man those brands they ain't gonna cook your breakfast and if they are i want to come over your place and and start having breakfast with you but but let's uh but let's continue through the ryzen deals so we got a b450 auras elite i think that's the price it is brand new oh it is brand new so yeah okay there it is um it's just basically selling brand new on gumtree which is kind of weird i mean if you get if you get sales off that um good on you we got a 6400 here 200 like don't even know what to do man i don't even know what to do for you guys like 200 bucks for a 6400 this one i don't know how much time i've wasted of my life looking at deals like these just seeing him come through and of course he's upgraded to a ryzen 5 2600 yeah and you can get a riser that's what it says in the text here you can get a ryzen 5 2600 for less than 200 bucks so he should have just said in the ad guys i want to upgrade no i want to upgrade and you guys pay the difference you know then we got 2700x again it's like 2700 x's second gen is with third gen coming into the used scene like i picked up a ryzen 5 3600 i post a photo on instagram we actually got that deal in the parts hunt yesterday we got that in the deals hunt and so that was 30 3600 deals are coming up and they're really good and honestly i'd rather 3 000 than 2 000 if you can afford that premium it's going to be a very good buy if you can get that so here's our 2600s they're kind of hitting at that point where i would try and personally get a 3700 x for around 250 or under and a 2600 for around 160 that's about my going rates for them so when i don't see them coming up at those prices i kind of i don't know we'll go i5 anyway take a look at what's on the i5 agenda oh nope nope we're just going to go through these and then we'll get onto facebook marketplace and then we'll go over to chat we'll talk with you guys after we go through some deals here if there's anything you guys want to see us look for as well drop a comment too if you want to see us look for some of these parts um because yeah there's just there's laptops and like thing about laptops is i don't really do laptops laptops are one of those things where men you got to know a good supplier for laptops which i do know a good supplier for laptops except les is already cleaning this guy out every chance he gets so there's your laptop deals les is just like as soon as a laptop comes up les is all on that um the hp pro desk i'd be paying 100 max that is less i think that is already less i can tell but les is just like he knows he's pro des market so les is owning the i5 market here shout out to les yeah i5 market ain't looking too good man these deals guys these deals we're going through them these deals what deals i5 9400 f again like honestly i would rather attend 100 brand new for 119 bucks than a 10 i mean six cores versus four cores eight threads kind of like they do sort of balance each other out i think the 9400 f will perform a bit better than the 10 100 f but still it's used so 10 600 2 400 f that's okay i mean it's new and unopened that's not too bad i mean see if we can take see if we take 190. so this is little little wesley snipes there on the deals so could you look at r9 390s okay we'll check it out we'll have a look for r9 390s with you guys so we're just showing you like generally like i used to the whole point is like i used to come on and i used to go on gumtree on facebook when i did the parts on so even like 2017 2018 and it was just a treasure trove of parts man like you could find a pc at any price point and get really good price performance but i'm just showing you guys how tough it is right now to kind of sniff out a good deal and so if we do find a good deal then we will pounce on it but we've gone through the ryzen there really wasn't anything like amazing there we've gone we're going through the i5 and there's just nothing that's really popping out except a brand new 10-400 um we will move on to the i7 and see what the i7 has installed for us yeah we'll go back we'll switch the scene back let's have a look yeah i'm reading the comments i'm reading the comments i see you guys we got the r92 we'll go over to chat soon we're just going to finish off like a deals hunt how i would do it in the parts aren't sort of checking out all the different locations different areas seeing what deals pop up and um this is what this is what we're faced with 250 bucks for a motherboard 16 gig of ram 3700 and again we're pulling up we're going to burger back to that 16 gigabytes of ddr4 10 100 f deal with the h410 that's coming in right around this price range and it's brand new so this is why deals like this they might look good on the surface for some people this like i'm sure this guy will sell this like i'm pretty sure this guy will sell it probably for 200 bucks i just wouldn't pay anywhere near that i'd pay 150 bucks for something like this and so that's where maybe my differences are coming into used price performance different than other people other people are buying this i7 combo putting into the gaming pc with fancy rgb lights smacking i7 on the title um putting 16 gigabytes of ram in there but not even putting ddr3 and just sort of like tricking someone so i trust me when i say i know what's going on when it comes to flipping pcs i just kind of i refuse to be like i just i don't believe again this is what i'm saying in the yesterday's part time i kind of i don't know which way you guys want me to go with used parts because this market is becoming something different than it otherwise was so we're going to move over now to marketplace so we've found like we've found a few good old 9 series and 7 series deals we found a 10 400 f potentially let's keep going through now and seeing what we can get maybe there's some old fx deals or something like that fx amd fx you know you never know you might be able to get a banger um combo on an fx chip or something like that so not sure how well anything works okay oh no that's not even i think is that even fx i mean the chipset would be fx but the super user a8 6600 i can't really do much with that uh we got r9 through 390 200 bucks though i you guys looking for r9 390s i wouldn't be um i wouldn't put down 200 bucks on an r9 390. i put like honestly online 390s and 290s should be coming around 100 bucks um so it's just like yeah that's uh someone in the comments like i hate being scummy yeah like there's a difference between like making money and even making good profits on a flip right and there's a difference between that and being like a scum like yeah being like really sort of like it's not like you're not like a scammer right like you're not scamming people but you're kind of like you're in that level of like you know do you want to be in that level like i mean yes borderline scamming some people do this stuff on on like selling pcs borderline scam and i just refused to go there but um let's just keep going through we'll go through ryzen let's have a look i sold i sold a ryzen pc earlier today actually so i was pretty good we sold the ryzen rtx 2060 and uh ryzen 5 2600 someone came and picked it up they were like super happy with it they're like man amazing pc this isn't too bad 32 gig of ram 5700 xt i mean the cable management man like they do that cable management and the orientation of the cooler like this is this has got some good specs in it this stuff is pretty good but you need to like work on this stuff brother like this is just yikes anyway you need to really work on that one but that's not a bad pc like if someone knew how to do like clean that thing up that would be pretty good if you wanted it for yourself uh you put in say a thousand dollar offer you might get a good deal there that's if you're looking for a gaming pc for christmas providing it all works but we got ryzen we got the same situation going on here 3800 x 450 bucks no thanks 3700x 400 bucks 2700x280 this one's okay this one's coming in around that price point so i might just might just say like 150 on this one that's 2600 it's not bad and he said he's owned it for a year comes with a cooler so we'll drop down an offer of 150 so why not [Music] um let's just keep moving let's keep moving through so we found we found one ryzen cpu 2600 for 150 aussie it's kind of okay like again that's kind of like market rates when we look at aliexpress what you can get a ryzen 5 2600 for it's pretty much the same price but i'm not paying the gst taxes and the import fees and the shipping costs so that's what we're looking at there um okay ryzen's pretty much been done let's go through i5 i mean we should check out like yeah we'll check out some ddr4 yeah we'll go through that i5 i'm going to tell you straight away like okay damn man no comment i'm just no comment i'm just going no comment here no comment um okay this is like someone's offering an i5 rx 5 80 16 giga ram let's bring in some value with some rgb competition's getting stiff too that's one thing too competition's getting stiff too people are hungry like people who regularly sell gaming pcs are getting hungry too so that's one thing about the marketplace is you know and i look i like a good old uh competitive marketplace but the deals just aren't there like there's no deals popping up so let's say i5 is completely gone skis we just got guys selling pcs in the i5 region there let's have a look at i7 wow let's see if we can sift through some stuff here nope uh 7700k trying to replace my second pc looking for i oh so he's looking for one okay 111 bucks i was like okay that's all right if we put in a hundred dollar offer on that that's okay i'd get a 7700k for 100 or something but he's looking for one for 111 bucks uh i7 i've got i7x 58 cpus for days what's this one about 61 oh no 6100 h110 it's got 16 giga ram but again it's like they've dropped it down to 250 to 180 they want to get rid of it but like again i and again another thing is i don't really want a low ball too like you know like i'd put in 100 offer on this that was it because i think i've got like an i5 6 gen sitting around that i could pop in there but then you get 16 gigabytes of ram h110 motherboard and an i3 but 100 bucks what i'd pay so depends um other than that yeah so the market is is gone skis on the i5 the iphone the ryzen searches the ddr4 memory let's have a look ddr4 what's coming up here um nothing stand out if you can get used 16 gigabyte kits for 50 bucks which you've done in the recent parts hunts that's definitely a worthy uh purchase but what we're seeing here is kind of like the rams coming around market right now one thing with ram is i'll tell you guys straight up with ram we'll go over the big screen here one thing with ram is is that there is a chance that that ram will be faulty like i've bought a heap of used ram in the past and i'd say one in every 10 sticks if i was to give you guys a statistic off the top of my head one in every 10 sticks would be faulty and so i think some of the guys probably just upgrade their pcs they might toss it aside so they don't even know it's faulty but then other guys might like say okay this one is just randomly shutting down they've upgraded the pc and they don't know what the problem is but they're selling off the parts individually so i've come into some faulty ram it is quite common so again you run that risk when you're buying gpus and used ram hard drives are super easy to check if you're buying used hard drives you can run a crystal disk info you can check out the health of the drives how well they're running for instance i got some 960 pros off ebay five twelve gigabyte versions we paid 290 aussie dollars for four of these drives absolutely phenomenal deal they had about ten thousand hours usage but the terabytes written was like i think it was seven terabytes written in total absolutely nothing so when you check out drives we can do a whole drives video on the future if you guys want to look for used drives and what to look out for and how to get good deals on drives but when it comes to ram and we'll move back to ram when it comes to ram you kind of like um you're kind of like doing yourself in if you if you get faulty ram now marco makes a good point some ram have lifetime warranties if it's broken yet under warranty kaching one thing about that marco is some of the brands are no longer even in business anymore and then some of the brands don't even have like support where you are locally so you've got to go through so many hoops so you like marco's living in taiwan he's got access to like all the servicing centers there it's super easy in taiwan but in australia you walk into a store and you're like where do you even start because they'll be like oh you know you say for instance you've got ddr3 memory with lifetime warranty the storage is going to look at you like uh did you buy it from here and then you're like yeah and then they're gonna say well where's your receipt oh you know five years ago i lost it then you'd be like mate we can't help you we don't even know if you bought it from here or not so lifetime warranties are kind of a little bit if you put it that way so it depends we're getting some super chat hey you jack dixon thank you very much and uh pc tech hustle my first live stream interaction heck yeah love you brian one tickler one tech hustler to another yeah we're doing this man we're doing this but i'm just pointing out like at the moment i feel like i've got to go down more of the new avenue right you know we put together um i think it was two months ago we put together a ryzen cookie cutter build i think it was a ryzen 3100 and it might have been a 1660 super off the top of my head and we put that together like 800 aussie dollars and that thing sold so easy and i made a like i made a nice little profit on that and that was new that was just easy it was all the like there was no hassles i went down to literally like one store picked up all the stuff so like that's kind of like the the used competition like the used market has to compete with that right so i'm trying to find the deals here and we're just not finding a whole lot put it this way so would i buy any of this memory here i'd probably like honestly i'd put down these first few ones coming up here aren't actually that bad so they're a bit of a drive would i drive an hour for just a 16 gigabyte kit of ram probably not but these two here on the guy there's two of them on the gold coast here like i mean i'll put down like 55 bucks oh wait i've already messaged this guy about his ram he was firm yeah movement this is from last month's partner he didn't sell his ram okay all right oops i messaged him last month he didn't sell his ram yet has he dropped the price i think he's dropped the price shouldn't be like yo 60 bucks i'll message him again yeah 60 bro all right 60 bro yeah just see just 60 cash man cash in your hand i messaged him last month so hopefully he takes the 60. uh i'm not gonna go to brisbane for the ram we'll go to this one we'll see hey how you doing pick up incorrect only down the road from me i'll say 55 cash we'll see what they say see what they say we got 55 cash on this one right here so we are making the conversation like there is going to be a little bit of privacy even on a live stream we're making the conversation a little bit private but i put down 60 and we put down 55 big spenders here on the ramps okay they already got back to me not 55 sorry 60 that's that's the highest i'm prepared to go okay that's the highest i'm prepared to go i'm not going any higher than 60 for this rams i'm not ramming my wallet too hard i gotta go i gotta just i gotta take it easy so ssds let's have a look ssd we'll just type in ssd because i know we're probably gonna get a heap of gaming pcs coming up let's just do it yeah we're doing a two yeah we're doing a 200 max so we'll have a look here one terabyte samsung 850 evo okay this is where this is where things are starting to get pretty good um i'll put down like 90 cash because that's you can always use like that works perfectly i mean we can put that to the test we'll take the gamble on that for 90 if we get that for 90 aussie which would be like maybe 65 us or something like that that's pretty good um we'll take a look at some cases too but generally with cases you got to be careful man like i've had so many cases and this is one thing we'll go over the big screen cases is such it's one of those things where it's like you can get a case and it looks great but then you go to click the power button and i don't know if you guys have had this before and the power button is just mounted and it's like it's almost embarrassing i mean the way you fix it is you then use it on a low end build and you switch the reset button for the power button and you just say to the person buying it look man builds pretty cheap instead this is your power button and you're pointing to the reset button that's how you get around that one a little bit of a trick i'm pretty sure a lot of you guys already know that if you've been reselling or buying pcs but um that's that one so cases we'll take a look at cases after this you guys are demanding the cases but let's have a look through the ssds here 4.80 gig 90 bucks let's go back to the big screen and now we'll skip on that on that these are evos and one thing about evo's you gotta be careful with evos guys is evo's rtlc right tlc's tlc mlc pay the premium for mlc especially if you're doing heavy like disc work if you're like loading up 100 gigabytes of um yeah video footage raw files anything that's big file sizes grab yourself grab yourself an mlc drive you'll thank me later cnc background music we'll do that on the next live stream i've got everything set up thanks for the super chat kev too thanks dude we'll do that on next live stream we'll do a cnc just a whole run through on background music yeah our tlc is fine for gaming yeah tlc is absolutely fine for um gaming now pci 4.0 nvme ssds are they worth it again it comes down to the tlc factor are these drives tlc because what they're doing with a lot of these pcie 4 drives is um is they're just putting these big um cash portions on there and then they're getting the speeds out of the benchmarks so like it's one of those things where i'm actually using 860 pros on over sata 3 in raid 0. and my editing experience i crap you not it's the best editing experience i've ever had so you got to look in i'm going to be looking into slc drives as well for editing videos because it's just insane they're too much man be like my christmas wish list would be like an slc drive that would be like my wish wish list so yeah so i'm learning so much for the chat yeah you guys hang out with chat hang out with chat just take it easy all right no stress right we started off this uh this stream with a few technical difficulties i do apologize for that but we fixed it all up and hang around relax a little bit we're going to talk about used parts a little bit more as we go forward and we're talking in chat you guys have always got to get the the stuff cracker lacking and these shirts man this was the business if you guys wonder about the shirts um this is the ones that i picked up uh it's almost like how long ago was that video dude when we picked up i picked up me and dadman went and picked up the you know way more a few months it's like over a year ago i'm pretty sure now yeah dude so i got this this is one of them free shirts yeah i own uh freshly steezed that's my new business that i acquired for a gaming pc so i acquired a business for and these shirts were in there man i was loving these shirts yes it was over a year ago memory is good 2019 yeah so one year four months or five months ago wow that's how long it's been since i've acquired freshly steezed so that's it guys i haven't bought a new shirt ever since i acquired this business for a gaming pc mind you rtx 2070 gaming pc how good was that so anyway we're gonna continue over here uh 240 gig ssd nope nope nope nope nope let's have a look let's keep going through we're just gonna round robin it two terabyte hard drive no no external hard drive that's not too bad if that works like if you need an external hard drive that's not that's not a bad price like if i needed an external hard drive i'd probably go pick that up just say like 25 bucks try and shave four off uh the sm blues they're 139 new i think so that's about the price they're going for new um okay let's check out r9 radian people wanted in the chat to check out r9 radeon we'll check it out and i think it's 390s and 290s but um no no no keep let's keep scanning through this nothing here that i'd go for guys like nothing there in the r9 um yeah this 370 that's sort of like this 370 is like cutting it close i would pick this up i would pick this up for maybe like i'd go in it maybe i'd get this for 50 bucks aussie like that's not a bad deal like i can make that work i'll put in an offer down to 50. see what he says but he's in narang bar that's real i'd have to get a friend to pick that up north so yeah that's far up north man so there's one i found one in the rcm we'll go to the gum tree and then we'll check out okay people wanted us to look for cases people don't want to go to chat they want to see the live like looking for deals i'm up for this man i like i love looking for deals you guys are providing the energies um vegas yeah we'll check out vegas quickly too we'll go to vegas you guys are like in the chat um vega thing about vega is you gotta understand these things are hard to power man there's 300 bucks there like they're the limited editions like vegas i've been close to getting vegas but it was only in the usa when i was over in the us i didn't have a car but i negotiated and then i tried to borrow someone's car because i was at the amd event and i'm just asking guys at the amd event i'm like yo can i borrow a car from someone and everyone's like no i mean rightfully so like i've only really met a lot of these guys online and i was like you know because i want to go out for a deals hunt when i was in um doing the amd live uh when we're over there for i think it's ryzen 3000 launch or something this is ages ago this is when i was over this way before covered and everything so i was over there and i was just asking people like yo can i can i go over there can i just go borrow someone's car into a deals on because i'll because i didn't have cars anywhere for three days and um we found over there with i was like negotiating vega deals and they were hot man vega like if you're in california vega you can get a good price on vega over here like 300 aussie for a vegas 64 now you you're getting in that territory of like i guess that's 1080 performance is it like is vega there would be 1080 ti close to now wouldn't it it's not too bad but you are dealing with a very hot car like this thing consumes power i mean like i would look i'll go down i'll offer him 250 like 250s i'll say 250. there we go i'll offer to do 250 and i'll just you know i'll see what he says if he's keen on 250 for this one i'll go for it that's limited edition that's pretty good in my eyes so there's a vega deal there we found that one um so we got super chat thanks matt uh he says aussie aussie audi i know it's more of a a car show burnout thing but i appreciate what you're what you're doing also i'm from the east coast of usa okay cool cool man thanks for the super chat brother let's keep going with these deal sons let's keep i'm a bit more relaxed now the starters i didn't know how this stream was gonna go the more i went into it but it's kind of cool you guys are like requesting what you want me to look for um and i'm just like i'm going for it now so we'll get back to uh we'll get back to gumtree here r9 radeon we'll see what comes up uh 290x like nope 280 [Music] no no no no no no i do have 300 bucks but again you wouldn't pay more for an r9 or an r7 for 300 anyway so that cap is pretty good i've already put down an offer on this one actually like some of the deals like i i do the parts hunts and especially yesterday's part-time i did throw down some deals on some of these that i sorry did throw some offers down on some of this stuff i just didn't talk about it because i didn't want to blow out that yesterday's parts aren't more than it needed to be blown out uh but some of these deals here i do put offers down but if they're just like if the person doesn't even get back to us unresponsive or they just say like no completely flat out no then i'm not going to bother with it um so let's have a look at vega so people advertising yeah i mean they do have the vega graphics in them fair enough vega 56 no no so there's that that limited edition right we found that limited edition that was pretty good um that limited edition was pretty good what we found before that was the vega card that we whacked down on but let's have a look at cases now this will be the last request then we'll move over to chat for you guys 2080 ti now here's the thing uh we got super chat here from andre thanks dude i've been trying to reach you by email but no reply oh sorry man like my email was like yeah i like this is one thing about putting your business email and stuff out there you look you gotta sift through like you've got your regular contacts and all the guys that contact just put the priority thing there and then a lot of it does get chucked into junk mouse sorry dude if i missed your email like i'm sorry about that hey um thanks for the super chat andre but do just okay if you want to yeah join our discord as well but if you want to send me an email just put like in the cat and put it in caps in the title we'll just put tech yes tech yes tech yes take yes ted yes and in the in the subject and i should be able to see it and i'm like okay this guy really wants to get a hold of me so um fear tech asks can i donate parts yeah we're gonna be doing a hopefully before the end of this year we'll be doing a um can yes fix it again so i've got the po box i'll actually drop it in the description for you in this video or use if you can just do you have the po box po box 546 yeah meringue four two one one yeah sweet as useful drop in the po box for you let's look at these cases though we got right here you guys wanted us to take a look at cases now i've already picked up so retro oh oh let's have a look at this dude like are you seeing is anyone else a house hello how you doing how are you doing how you doing like i don't know is it just me or is like am i liking this i mean look he's charging 100 bucks charging a hundred bucks but i haven't seen a case like this before this is exciting thanks for the suggestion to look for some atx cases here i like the samurai 908 that is yeah is that just is someone saying that that's a sexy guy i reckon it's sexy let's see let's see if he's got more photos here oh man look at that back whoo i don't even know that is like one of the coolest cases i have seen like for a while it's just different right and you don't get these cases anymore because they wouldn't mass bring them to market like they're not going to bring that to market i mean i would buy that but i'd only buy it for 20 bucks like being real why because i i still like to stick to the price performance stuff but that is a cool case 100 bucks 100 bucks man he's asking 100 bucks i must admit for a 15 year old case he's kept this thing in good neck so someone's saying 40 yeah i'm doing 20. i am living in 2005 man you should see my like uh spotify playlist it predates to the 80s 80s like i'd say anything up but actually there has been a few good um bands that we've been rocking through lately it's mainly to do with metal and it's not like mainstream either like there's been some really good metal music that's just been suggested to me and i'm like yeah i gotta get that rock and we'll be doing later on in the month we'll be probably trying to put some of that music in and hopefully not get striked okay yeah right we'll make a tech yes playlist for you guys and then we'll drop all the stuff that i that i'm banging whether it's working out doing deals building pcs i've always got music cracking man that's why we've got like we've got the 5.1 in here we've got the 2.1 i'm not much of a headphone user personally but like when we got we got we got speakers blasting like 24 7. um always got to have music problem is you can't do it when you live stream you get your whole channel get taken down oh yeah logitech speakers yeah but i mean i don't need any now we've already decked out the studio oh just like homage to logitech yeah which pay homage to logitech logitech z let's have a look z5 is sick now they're not the ones you want to go for you want to go for the z263 i think and the z906 let's have a look nah there's nothing but we'll get back to cases sorry rudely interrupted there with the my obsession um r72 so okay so one guy got back to us with the r737 said 50 bucks is okay um so that's pretty cool we'll do that and uh let's keep looking through these cases so this one popped out to me that was the pop out this one here i've built in this thing and man like i'm not too like i just yeah this one's got scratches on it and stuff so like i mean i love this front panel right here that is pretty cool but like a scratched up one oh damn the man down the main shout out i wonder if dan's watching let's stand the man selling that case so erica strike x that's brand new in the box okay that's not bad okay it's like it's pretty much brand new definitely brand new wait he says it's lightly used why is it still got the plastic on it okay i've never seen someone use a case before and keep the plastic on it has anyone in the comments ever done that or seen that like that's actually the first time i've seen someone like use the case properly that's been properly used now look at the photos that ain't worth 40 bucks like i would like i did i get like i see that stuff like people who are dumping like last night we picked up the ryzen um five 3600 deal right we picked up the ryzen 5 3600 dude yeah yeah the guy just gave me two cases he's like dude i'm clearing out my garage and um he just gave me two cases last night so cases aren't one of those things that's in like if you're gonna buy a scuffed up case don't buy it because you're probably gonna if you're doing if you're picking up other deals you're probably going to get people just giving you scuffed up cases so i got two of them last night there was a it was a thermal take and a bit phoenix and we just got given to us so i was like yeah i'll take them i'll put them aside but um let's get back to this one so cases on facebook really like i'm not digging this at the moment i mean someone might like this i know some of you guys love these old cooler master cases this one's the cosmos i think oh i love them they're huge like that's that's a proper hernia magnet like you yeah if you're looking to get a hernia this one will do it and the old fractal cases too like just mass metal like huge amount of metal like you pick them up it back out yeah yeah yeah if you want if you guys are interested in throwing your back out here's the case to do it this one will do it throw your back out with a cooler master cosmos they have been packing a lot less um they have been packing a lot less uh metal in their cases nowadays but that's it now they've got the curved tempered glass so that's different kind of cool that's an interesting case a raven i mean if i was doing an apu build or something that'd be pretty cool that's pretty neat but again i don't know all right that's uh that's gumtree is anyone like really want me to check out any of these cases because i'm just like nothing's popping out to me here [Music] nothing's popping out it's not popping on on facebook put it that way we'll go over here atx case okay all right cases atx case gumtree this is the final deals hunt this is the final deals hunt and then we'll go over to chat we'll try we'll just chat with you guys straight up let's have a look nzxt h510 oh i likey look anything with nzxt and h 500 series you're putting down 100 bucks on that because you put some rgb in that thing people go crazy for it so he's got my hundred dollar offer that's aussie as well so you guys in the states you've got the h510s you got the h510s and they're a good price over in the us over in the aussie they're about 140 i think they're 140 new yeah i don't know my ncx2 i just don't know my nzxt cases too well i just know they sell well okay we got oh we got super chat quickly so it's from andre again thanks dude thanks dude i sent the email subscribed otherwise love your show and love that you give it check give tech a new life yeah man that's another thing too that is the benefit of going with use right i do i do have a uh affinity to new stuff what's that word i'm looking for yeah yeah i do have like i do love my used price performance yeah and i like it's just like honestly guys we'll go over the big screen before we check out the rest of these cases it is getting me down all right it is getting me down that i'm seeing the used market the way it is like people know like and i and this is the i can't hate on the sellers for trying to get more money right it's the coverts a tough situation coverts crap people need money but the used market's just not what it used to be and so here i am like i'm going hard even on a live stream for you guys trying to find deals but i just am like i'm not i'm coming up way empty than what i used to man if you check out some of the deals hunts that i was doing a couple of years ago we were just on fire constantly on fire we were just like boom bringing it off one place to another to another we just constantly fire we had it all lined up people were just keen to sell their stuff at what i'd consider mark but now it looks like there's this whole second train of used stuff and it's like people just like okay i know what my used stuff is worth because people are paying that and we're going to go back to the gtx 1060 argument which we went on before the gtx 1060 argument is everything the gtx 1060 argument states everything right 1650 super 225 brand new just down the road no hassles go pick it up got warranty the 1066 gigabyte should be where i am 150 so we found one guy one guy selling at that price point he was like 120 kilometers away so i gotta get him to post it but um that's the 1060 argument it's like the big mac index right if you're looking at the purchasing power of a currency we're now from this live stream is going to birth the gtx 1060 index it's like because it was i think it's the most is it isn't that the most popular card on steam yes it is yes perfect okay there it is that is that is a new we're birthing that the gtx 1060 index that's going to tell you how good the used market is versus the new market just on average right completely just an average tandem here so of course on dedicated gpus wow okay yeah that's huge okay so ten percent of all gpus sold guys well like dedicate oh no sorry yeah used on steam dedicated gpu users 1060s so we'll check them for 1070s before they'll rip off in the chat um there's also another chat as well um oh thanks for super chat i have this for your trouble my pc is cursed if your pc is cursed you should be saving your money man and upgrading it don't give it to me uh i said an email is described otherwise love your show sorry there was a question after that uh opinions on the 4000d that's right because corsair like dude of course they're a channel sponsor like i love corsair but 4000d is legit we got one here what do you think of the 4000d have liked more um oh yeah okay oh yeah i just went to shut him up right there he wanted he wanted more rgb so there you go if you're an rgb lover maybe the 4000 d isn't your kettle fish but i think it's just such a nice case to build in the aesthetic's so clean it's a clean clean case and that's it so that's why i like that my opinions on the 4000d is actually it's like my one of my favorite uh corsair cases in a long time and that's coming from an air 540 guy air 540 was actually probably my favorite case before that so uh let's keep looking through these cases though we'll get back to the cases then we're going to have a chat we're going to go over the chat for you guys and have a little chat so we've got that nzxt case we we banged on that and right before speaking of this my ear 5 foot why did i not see you earlier air 540 here you are 50 big ones let's see if gavin is gonna take the 50. gavin mate it is your lucky day i have a pineapple so in australia guys we call it a pineapple i have told gavin gav mate you want this pineapple mate it's coming your way so there we go gav has the pineapple so my frustrations beside with the used market will keep looking for deals in the used market okay there's that same arrow uh aero banged up case we're gonna miss that it's missing the front panels too like i hate it when the mesh parts are missing out the front because a lot of the time you can't just bang in any mesh clip-in thing on those cases like i'll show you what guys i'm talking about here um just send me all the 3090s you have mate i'm sure you'll get more the witch master the dude i love the witch slayer and heroes and new earth thanks for the 20 brother uh we got the rts the only rtx 39 i've got is this one here that's the 30 90 founders and like guys like i nvidia sent that over and i was just like wow like i even instead of my review this thing is not a value for money play i was just like i was really grateful that i got to keep this thing and it's going it's my main rig i look is the best thing about uh 2020 for me was this 90 i got to keep it i'm not gonna lie to you guys but i'm not sending any 3090 out i mean this thing is like i'm sleeping with this thing at the moment like metaphorically no okay so these things here you're missing these things these two mesh things i hate it when they're missing because they're so hard to replace and if you find other ones from other cases half the time they don't fit so that's the problem with this one right here um crystal 570 x 220 it's like you know you got to try and flip that and there are some cases coming in like the 570x is definitely going out of the metal where the new meta is sort of coming in with with higher price tags right if you're looking at higher rgb costs you want to whack in as many ring fans in that case as well so that's what the meta is so cases there it is guys there's cases we've pretty much scanned the market we found an nzxt h510 and air 540 and there were the two that we banged down on so let's move over now we're just going to chat with you guys and move over and especially if you want to like pop back if you're like look brian you want to donate um we got the ram so we got the ram as well they've taken 60 bucks on the ram so we've found a an r7 and there's a 370 we've got a 16 gigabyte kit now for 60 bucks so we've found two deals already they've come back to us live stream as well we got live so let's have a look here let's have a look we're going back to the big screen let's go in with chat now we'll be answering questions so keep them let's roll them in let's roll them in dude you're on a 30-70 aren't you for editing on that editing rig you got 37 yeah you said 27 i mean oh my god oh okay [Music] okay so we've got the question here would you build an x99 system with a 5960x using new parts for personal use now like i would use a 5960x i just wouldn't go out and buy one like i mean you've got to go to ebay for that right so you're going to have to go to ebay for a 5960a it's pretty like it's a pretty s this is a specific thing i can't say that word properly i'm so bad okay so yeah 550 aussie dollars this is the going rate for them right because they're best in one of the best in slots for x99 i think best broadwell like 60 what's the 69 69 something there's also another one but 5960x man you're paying a premium for that puppy you're paying a real big premium for it and um and uh raise the volume of the other person talking so you have to come closer to the mic i think yusuf so i i can't he's just talking into this mic so he's gonna have to yell like yeah like that's about it um and x99 like i wouldn't build a build i would just i would not build a system based around this unless i picked up a 5960x for cheap so that would be my my opinion on x99 like the thing is about x99 right you can get the motherboards off aliexpress so you get the money uh you get aliexpress and grab yourself the x99 i personally like the um [Music] uh the one and one this is my like the one with the ddr3 and the ddr4 that board is actually this one here it's gone up a little bit in price it used to be 100 flat it's gone up to 110 but this board was like actually surprised me because it has optical out as well so you get this with a logitech z906 get a 12 core you got yourself an editing workstation fun station the 12 core now 2678 v3 this one's definitely a combo right for 200 bucks you've got a 12 core 24 thread you can unlock it to 3.3 gigahertz or core and you got the motherboard with quad channel you can even whack in ddr3 ecc registered on that and it's actually a really good deal so i mean like ddr3 ecc registered if you know some guys locally i've got guys who offer me ddr3 ecc registered for chips because no one can use it in mainstream gaming pcs so this is where this combo here can really get you can get yourself together a 64 gigabyte rig editing rig for dirt cheap and it's going to do well like it's going to edit 4k 60fps like a beast and so that's with that um we'll go through the questions here so we've got we'll move on from x99 so if i was going to do x99 i would do it this way that would be my personal opinion on it other than that yeah unless you got the 5960x for like nothing or you picked it up for someone who wasn't selling it because the thing is um thing is about this ebay price right here right this is the thing about how i would sell something anyway if i came into a 5960x right i wouldn't put it in a pc either i would this is the this is yeah other people who you know buy and flip stuff a lot now uh this is what i would do with a 5960x i'd see this price here and i'd be like okay well i'll just list it for this guy's already doing it i do what this guy's doing listing it for 500 bucks because someone wants it right if this guy's listing it for this price he knows that someone's buying it with nine watches means people are kind of keen on it with nine watches so i'd be going in with say a 450 or something instead of putting it in a pc you just sell it because it's you're not going to get it back in a pc especially a gaming pc so this guy here he'd probably be sitting on his like he's probably going to be sitting on his alienware pc for quite a long time man like this 1080 ti and this combo here man you knew stuff like your 3060 ti has left it in the dust now uh you got ryzen you know 5600 xl pretty sure would that be the 5960x or i mean you've got a 10 700 f even if that's you know eight cores so you're kind of looking and you're in a tough market if you've been sitting on expensive stuff like this and you just haven't fire sold it so that's kind of like we got a bit too in-depth on the on the x99 stuff let's uh let's keep moving through now so that's one question too we gotta get through a few more questions so let's have a look uh 500 usd for a ryzen 5 3600 gaming edge x570 600 watt evga power supply 256 gigabyte ssd 16 gigabytes of ram hyper 212 3h rgb fans and an nzxt h510 where's the graphics card should you go for it i mean it's okay like i'm saying that nathan i'm seeing that and i'm like that's okay it's not really like a pop-up you've got to go pick it up right now kind of thing i'd try and barter with the guy so you can get maybe 450 for 400 and then you go pick it up 400 be great so just see if they want to get rid of it um that would be my that'd be my call so let's keep moving through the chat here we got so if i wanted to play cold war 4k 60 to 80 fps what cpu do i need with my rtx 2060 or could i do my rtx even do 4k on cold war uh 2060 you'd have a hard time doing 4k cold war so campaign should be like struggling but yeah okay so yeah multiplayer you're not definitely yeah so you you really want the newer cards or like a 2080 ti or 2080 subaru or something like that or 5700 xt least for any kind of 4k gaming you want eight gigabytes of vram at least for 4k gaming that's just my opinion um so we got here from sparks uh hey brian any tips selling pcs i'm doing it for five months and maybe you got some nice hidden tips in your sleeve i did this is the thing all right let's this is actually a good question because it it works in perfectly well what we're um what we're saying here is that selling pcs in the last five months like this year has been a roller coaster and we've actually been meaning to talk about this sort of towards as we're going out of the end of the stream selling pcs this year has just been a roller coaster that's all i'm going to say you talk to anyone who's done it regularly and they're just going to say the same thing absolute roller coaster this year with selling pcs and i just like my tips for you man would be to the photo is the most important thing when you're selling a pc description is pretty important right but the photo is so important so really take your time to get a good photo i see some pictures of pcs for sale and they're just like we saw one earlier in the stream with a 5700 xt i might even be able to pull this up but i do like do i do apologize to the dude in advance like i don't mean to like make fun of him i'm actually trying to help him out um so tips for like this here is just like dude like this is like okay he might sell like there might be someone out there who just wants to buy his pc just to make a point for me saying this on live stream but this is not how you just don't sell a pc like this right it's it's just it reeks so many subconscious messages that aren't good it reeks of hey i'm just too lazy to do cable management i'm too lazy to take a decent photo and so when you take those decent photos and stuff it's gonna show like the photo you know picture speaks a thousand words so the most important thing about um the most important thing about selling a pc is your photo and i've said this in the past man all the tips this is the funny thing i've got some nice hidden tips up my sleeve i don't like i don't i've given them i've shared pretty much everything on my channel i've like i've done everything over the years and in ways it's it's cost me a lot of local profit you know it definitely has cost me but i love doing this right it's my passion i love like you guys in the chat i love chatting with you guys it's awesome to hang out and talk use price performance um i would spend like the discord i got to spend more time on the discord it's just been so busy with the channel lately i think like going over the live stream is the best way for me just to chat with you guys and hang out too so is a xeon e5 1650 v2 and a gtx 10 63 gigabyte a good combo yeah the 1650 v2 should power that thing absolutely fine you could do like a 1660 super in that cpu as well it's a nice cpu avx 2 might come into play in some titles but overall it's not going to be a problem we got what's the best 6 pin pcie gpu i'd say at the moment the 1660 super that would be is that six pin like i think some of them do take a six pin 60 super i think some of them are eight pins some of my eight pin but i think i think some of them are six pen if i remember correctly you can get an five 470 off a six pin two i like the 470 a lot as well but um lately with the 470s and 570s they're coming off crypto benches be very careful because the ones coming off crypto benches now have been mined on a lot so yeah okay so we've got some questions now uh brian what do you agree to sell for a price on craigslist offer up or gumtree when they try to haggle once they get to your house ah this one this one this one's actually a really good question um pj48 so where i'm at on the gold coast right i'd say i dare say on the coast we're a little bit conservative in terms of the overall feel of how the gold coast works i would say that like you don't do that crap man there's rules right since you've grown up there's rules you negotiate before you come and get something so if someone says i'm coming to pick this up now that means they're picking it up for asking price if they say i'm coming to get it now man i've got the cash or if they give you a warning [Music] or a chat or just if there's a fair warning yeah if they're just saying i'm just coming to check it out fair enough you can negotiate on the spot if they're just coming to check it out but usually i'll tell see if someone i don't have time for someone just to check it out it's it's a waste of time like i had someone come i checked out a pc a couple weeks ago i just it sounded like they were really keen but then they come around they your time like i really let people check out a pc but if they want to they say like look i'm coming to get this now i've got cash and then they try and haggle you on the spot i just tell them straight up like mate that's not how it works and i just say look like you know you just don't do that i've actually told there's three people who have tried that in the past try to haggle on the spot i can like if it if they need wi-fi i can generally chuck in um i can generally chuck in wi-fi for them with a wi-fi adapter but that's about it so i'm not gonna do um like haggling on the spot so yeah if someone's trying to do that crap man you just gotta tell them like look bro just jump back in your car start the ignition and just get out of here um so yeah any tips uh so sorry that was i'm going back through the comments someone called greg salazar oh yeah yeah on that on that dell ad yeah better called greg man greg will be all over that so uh do you want to find out actually if you want to queue up questions so i can find them like yeah so we got a zeus r strix rx 570 good price i don't know what a good price for you want a strix five seven you'd probably be paying a little bit more depends on usd or aussie maybe a hundred usd was what you pay for strix rx 570 i was wondering how do you keep benchmarking the same games on so many different pcs and nas helps with that at the moment i use a simple hard drive for that yeah we got different drives and i hate bench like i'm over it like i don't hate benchmarking usually but benchmarking is just like lately it's been so much like here we go here we go again oh yeah so we got the nas yeah and and that's another reason why you see the games that we pick are actually games that we can just copy paste from steam yeah so the games that we're doing lately because there's so many graphics cards coming out the games that we've been picking lately are just like copy paste install off steam and you're good to go it's just like it's getting too much like there's like a graphics card coming out every single week now it's like and it's going to get worse because amd and nvidia amd even and video realized they've realized one thing they can just keep getting free brand recognition by keep trickling out products and i'm i can see it straight away i saw what it was happening with the super i know it's happening now we just got to keep releasing models of graphics cards the more the merrier who cares about confusing the consumer we're getting free exposure we mentioned a national wild marco appears oh yeah yeah true yes somebody say a zeus tour zeus tour zeus tour that's that's marco we're wrapping that we're repping that we got this guys we got this uh so um yeah benchmark in the same game it definitely does suck it's at the moment it sucks so it's it's repetitive um anyway so we got now i i want to build my pc for my cousin who wants to build and play fortnite do you think an i5 you know just you don't have to there's a thing he's mr pikachu you don't have to say i despise fortnite right let's get this out of the way fortnite has made me a lot of bank i love fortnite you know like look who care like fortnite has done so much for the pc gaming community it has done so much for the people selling rgb fans it has done so much for the progression of rgb as well let's stop and like i know people despise the actual game and the mechanics and the fact that it's packed with a lot of kids but they actually it's it's been such a good catalyst for pc gaming and in fact it's such a better catalyst for bringing pc to bringing people to pc over console where they can't get those high refresh rates even like semi potatoes can do more fps than the consoles on fortnite and that reason alone is why so many people come over to pc it's insane so um let's go i want to build a pc for my cousin so what's the gpu a gts 240 oh dude no no way yeah the graphics card i looked at the graphics card the rest of the hardware is gonna be fine dude the rest of the hardware is absolutely fine fortnite yeah just put it yeah see if you can find a gtx like 950 for cheap or an rx 470 especially 470 would be great yeah if you've got a 1650 super new if you just want to um if you're sick of the used market but if he's sick of the used market like you can't find a deal at all but i mean i would go for something really cheap like even a 750 gtx 750 if you can pump like we put in an offer of 35 bucks on one before aussie so it'd be like maybe 20 something usd that'd be a good little card to whack in there if you can get it and that'll play fortnite fine so um do you have much done much with drones i haven't really flown any drones um i design rocket jump ninjas got a drone i personally like i'm so busy with my life learning another discipline which would be drones like you'd have to learn how to use a drone and all this other stuff i mean some of it's easy i have flown a drone before like when i was in japan they're like very hands-on some are very automatic like it depends on the brand mm-hmm like did you always just point some places on the map and smart players okay well i just i don't have to i i don't have time i'd love to do it but just don't have time so now we're going back um oh no the comments i like you know your list oh we got super chat steven anderson thanks for the super chat my man have you ever done open source programming and open source operating systems like ubuntu and linux mint i oh no in university i did programming for like a week and then i just rage quit it wasn't for me man like well that's what i mean yeah you're either a programmer or you're not i think like this is the thing about programming is like i jumped into a programming course it was my first pick at university i was like i got out of high school i was like yeah i'm going to be a video games developer jumped jumped in front of a computer and realized oh i'm not going to be a video games developer no way do you remember c plus plus straight away that's the worst i'm like it's logical but like yeah and i and then they're telling me it's like learning another language and i'm like i'm terrible at learning languages it took me like nine years even to speak conversational japanese so i was like yeah you know but apparently yeah we do i haven't even sorry mark i haven't even had time to look at it yet bro but it's a custom one like it's more of a custom job yeah so it's very very custom thanks marco i gotta look at it like i got actually i'll set that up give good attention to it rtx 3050 question mark rtx 3050. we we all want the rtx 3050 yeah we're all praying like nvidia amd what do you got guys release a low end gpu fix this here let's go back to the screen fix this yeah they're not coming up yeah but just close them oh in case another one pops up yeah yeah i gotcha gtx 1060 [Music] no this is the gtx 1060 index we need this to happen rtx 3050 we need it to happen man even a gtx 2060 60 super or whatever if they want to do something janky with the gtx like thing then please do it but we need something guys we need something on the low end i think a lot of tech enthusiasts are just waiting there like a lot of used like a lot of guys putting together use price performance are waiting for it too because that's a problem in itself that's a problem in itself is there's no parts coming out that are on that low price floor so this whole used scene is just like reciprocating on bad prices it's just like bad price comes up because there's nothing new coming out around that price there's nothing that people are getting buzzed about um rtx 3080 sure that's brought down the price of a 2080 ti like big time that's brought down a price of 2080 ti's like they came crashing down even before the 3080 was released 20 htis came crashing down what was it so i have a 30 80 founders edition with a ryzen 5 3600 is it worth upgrading the cpu when i can get hold of one of these using a tomahawk max before yeah this was funny the guy we picked up the 3600 yesterday off thanks adam for the super chat too yeah the guy that we picked up the 3600 off he upgraded to an x570 in a 5600x now he said in warzone was the biggest difference for him and he was playing on low fps too like he was playing on low settings sorry but like also he only said because he had that it was worth it yeah it was worth it so he's got the same 3080 in the question yeah so there is going to be a difference you will get if you're playing especially playing at 1080p or 1440p you will and especially if you're playing competitive settings and you want to play competitively yeah you're going to get that extra boost out of upgrading from a ryzen 5 3600 to a 5600 x 5800x but if you're playing 4k no like i'm playing like 4k you're just not going to see the difference on max settings and ultra settings and 4k i'm guessing you're going to want to aim for 120 fps which 3600 is going to be very capable of doing so i would um i would just go for um go save that money and get like that in america that bx oled is just so cheap 1200 us man that thing is just going to give you your eyes are going to water and it's going to be like a good water it's not going to be like you're chopping up onions use deals for outlets okay let's check out one like flipping new metal okay let's get back to it flip some overlaps what do we got oleds here meant to be answering questions but now there's this problem he says oled i like my eyes light up like christmas tree i love oleds so that's like dude wow this guy's got a thousand aussie for a 4k outlet like you don't understand in australia oleds are like 2 500 at the moment for the brand new ones yeah like if you want to like if you're going with oled and you want a secondary oled this is your this is your guy right here i'd message him now look at the way this is one of the funniest things too look at the way he's taking the photo he's taken this with like the widest angle camera ever and you can see like it's bending in the middle the tv looks like no it's it's a curved island wait what oh is it cur they made curved outlets yeah what okay mind blown i'm not buying i'm not i'm not putting an offer of that okay i thought i thought the fixture was so distorted that this thing was bending imagine imagine if he bent that photo more like he's got the curve and then he just takes it wider so it just like bends yeah really sell the effect yeah really sell it so if you can get if you can get if you're going with 120 hertz oled like the new c9s or c8s or the cx's or the bxs then um definitely get yourself a secondary i'm on two oleds now so no but they're like you can get one super cheap if you can get one like say for instance in america in the usa you grab a b7 uh 55 inch let's have a look i love this stuff hey like this is kind of like nothing like is that because they won't ship to lg is that because they won't ship 8 000 results oh yeah lgo led yeah we got a super chat too thanks hraven187 your channel helped the biggest aussie drone youtuber get a baller editing set up your discord help the pick the parts uav futures say thanks ah cheers awesome okay awesome yeah man baller you gotta get that baller editing set up man sweet i love hearing that i like hearing that we're helping people out we're doing them we're doing them justice if you're editing the videos long if you're on a monitor day in day out if you're on the monitor like me you're on a model like eight hours a day or something sometimes i'm not because sometimes i'm out deals hunting but if you're on a monitor a lot you got to get yourself an oled man you really got to get yourself an oled like if you can i know they're expensive but you got to get yourself one of these they like this is too much in america damn what's going on with america i was hoping to find an american deal on an oled no but you want to find use like you just want to find someone use yes you're probably going to get a craigslist or something oh here we go we got one here 8.75 bit too much i mean make an offer see i'd probably put in an offer oops my emails like showed hey guys what's up just sent me an email i got i'm gonna get wrecked okay um so 875 here i drop in an offer of like 600 half of the price of a 120 hertz right let's just do it in hertz ratio 60 hertz half the price of 120 hertz makes sense so if you pick up one of these for like 600 us and then have a jewel oled i got a b7 and a cx okay yeah so that's a little bit yeah so that's what you've got yeah yeah no no i don't know anyway so all right back to this stuff kevin burnell thanks for the super chat i mean fx cpu questions still we're still building budget builds or with or just selling on ebay your thoughts got a few now and i'm undecided what to do ah yeah this is that well this is the thing i've been hearing from a lot of people that you can't sell builds man like people it's it's tough times to selling gaming pieces basically like depends if they're hot in your area or not like some places you can sell them super easy ah so cpus like just the cpus i'd sell them on ebay i've heard people get good money for them like i've heard people bragging to me that they're selling fx cpus for like stupid money like 150 bucks for the 8 core yeah 150 bucks for an fx8 core you know a 10 100 and a 3100 will flatten that like it's not even a contest and it's used it's old so yeah i would sell the fx chips on ebay use the rest of the build if you've got a good power supply good case ssd hard drive and all that stuff in there um definitely just like which we can check now for you guys too while we're on live stream um fx 8350 let's have a look what people are selling these for 120 bucks i wasn't far off the mark but some people are selling the chips for you know these guys will get that for it 130 bucks 140 bucks so you can see here it's like the world of warcraft auction market where like one guy's just uncut undercutting the other guy he's undercutting the other guy and so the cycle goes on until we get to a new norm and so that's what it is with used parts when you look at me and my disciplines i'm out of the used market like in terms of when these prices are two hundred dollars for a gtx 1060. i ain't playing ball 150 for that 1060. aussie i'm okay i'm sort of sitting in there i'm playing ball but then you never know you might get the guy who sees it and this is the thing there's a real thing you get the guy who sees the um fx sees the 1060 for 150 and he's like nah bro i'm going to pay you 180 for it like forget your asking price this guy's selling it less than a 200 than the other like the other guy's selling for 200 i'm just going to offer him more than asking and so that's a real thing that's going on in the news parts scene at the moment is people are paying more than the asking if they think like it's an ordinary better deal um mate i sent you a message on uh oh yeah i'll check later thanks cool beans thanks age for the donation dude i'll check it out uh fx 9370 oh that thing's like we're going into toaster territory so i think i think i saw that message just quickly i did see fx in a message i just gotta i'll get back to it after the live stream so i don't like guys i don't intentionally ignore anyone don't worry just if there's so many questions coming in i gotta i gotta um my tunnel vision can only see one thing at a time that's all it is so i do suffer from tunnel vision too i gotta get that made up on a t-shirt i got tunnel vision with a big thumbs up yeah yeah that's it i got tunnel vision and i love it i will apologize for it but i'm not going to apologize for having tunnel vision are you still considering so dennis is still considering trying the used laptop market okay i i do want to i do want to try it like the dude the used laptop market's cracking like it's good i've tested the waters before man there is some good flips to be made in the laptop market it's just the problem is getting laptops for cheap like i know what i should be getting laptops at it's just every time i know guys who sell laptops and and they're all booked out man like they've got loyal customers who i can't compete with because that's the way it is these guys are picking up stuff all the time for laptops and it's just the way it is you've got to wait in the queue like so if i want to get the laptop flipping i got to wait in the queue and then i got to buy say about four or five thousand dollars worth of stuff every week and i've got to be but you'd also have to like realign yourself with the pricing for the same components for like laptop but that's the thing i've got to be moving i've got to be moving so much if i want to be getting good deals on laptops and stuff like you know like as much as i love running around every month picking up parts here and there it's not where the money's at like in terms of flipping properly flipping maybe one month but i love doing the like i love being the inte i love being the messenger between the viewers and all these you know big time flippers who are cleaning out universities and stuff and you know it's like it's good to have that intermediary tech yes is here for you to remind you that used parts at the moment are overpriced that's not in your head that is not in your head don't worry when you're when you're sitting there scratching you're like yo the 10 100 f yeah but that's what i mean like you're looking at now six ring fans six ring fans and an i7 if you're if you're talking about for yourself then you don't even need rgb like you can just get a really good price brand new system well it doesn't help here's the last thing we're going to talk about last food for thought that we're going to talk about doesn't help that a lot of the retailers out there that have the big bricks and mortar stores they are peddling 9th gen stuff still they're pedaling like second gen ryzen still and people go in there and they see these prices they're like 1500 bucks a 9700k and a rtx 2060 wow and then they go on marketplace and they see old mate with his i7 6700 and his 1080 ti and they think wow that's an amazing deal i better get that so the bricks and mortar stores that haven't sold out their old like potato level style like i guess bad value stock i wouldn't say it's potato but they're bad these guys who haven't sold out their old 9th gen start stuff and they're selling it in brand new for really stupid prices they haven't caught on to the new stuff yet these are the guys that are making the used market overpriced as well so there's another catalyst that we haven't talked about so there it is food for thought fellas food for thought um do you have an ex oh so he's talking to kevin so take a seat i'm doing fairly well with laptops but for some reason i find that customers expect just too much support when they buy a laptop off you were supposed to buy a desktop that is true yeah i'm watering suits that's very true um the thing is about laptops is there's inherently more problems with laptops like you're looking at you're looking at a all this heat coming out in a little thin slice piece of piece of bread for one second how you doing too man he's a really he's a he's a cool dude he does some cool stuff on instagram uh i love your instagram by the way i would say with the the laptops right the one thing you gotta remember is it's always important when you meet people in person you gotta tell them like look the reason this stuff is cheap is because i don't offer tech support i don't offer as a one-year warranty like other guys you're getting this used deal you're getting this laptop that would probably cost you 600 bucks at a store you're getting it for 350. that 250 you're saving means that you're kind of sacrificing that bricks and mortar experience and i think that's one thing that you've got to maybe when you're selling the stuff you've got to lay into people um and sure it's it's good to sell stuff and well someone just spammed the chat and their messages got deleted yeah good stuff yeah guys don't spam like come on i'm trying to have a conversation here anyway um yeah so anyway very weird true yeah very weird driver problems oh yeah and then you've got laptop problems inherently where if you do a reinstall of a whole laptop especially if it's a proprietary laptop they've got their whole installs from the get-go where you actually got to use their bloatware otherwise you're not getting the driver so it's weird their laptops that's why another that's a problem with laptops you gotta remember that they're not maybe they'll be like a good windows 10 optimization guide but just for laptops how to get your chipset drivers without going through the work yeah well i'd have to get into laptops more to understand it see i've only i've only touched the surface on laptops and flipping laptops so that's the thing iran tech so sorry iran tech your message got deleted he's oh he's trying to sell his pc in the chat that's why it got deleted come on take your city chat's not for you to sell your pcs man come on i don't do like the whole thing about the tech yes city cities like fight club bro it's like the secret society okay the whole thing about people yeah our discord our discord's pretty late but we're not flipping to each other like you know you're not flipping to each other kind of thing this is it's like yeah it's kind of like you take your cities like your fight club bro that's it you don't talk about it to other people outside you know so yeah you just that's it you gotta like you gotta beat the retailers our goal is to beat the retailers and have a little stack in our hands you know what i mean and live a live a better lifestyle that's the goal of tech yes we got some czar is that south african rand the tsar can you just check that thanks for the donation but i've never seen a donation in the tsar before are they releasing a 30-60 wow that was a really good call south african ran the tsar yeah i do i mean i do delve in currencies i'm not noob thanks for the south african donation my man are they releasing a 30-60 i my guess would be yes like there's going to be a 30-60 right i think there is i don't know like look when it comes to what nvidia um send me out in amd and stuff we only know like generally a week before the stuff's released that's that's it it's generally only a week here's the card here's the beta driver test it here's the nda you can only talk about it at this certain date so i'm not privy to informate like people might think oh he's a tech reviewer he's getting all these lines in early like he knows all this stuff that people don't know yeah well i'm like i'm listening to the rumor and i know there's some guys out there that catch on to the rumors very well i know video cards are pretty damn good for rumor mill like they've been pretty spot on on a lot of stuff um wccf tech they got a pretty big hit or miss ratio like they sometimes get it right yeah i mean and tweak town as well they got they got some good stuff in there anthony from tweak town generally gets a lot of it right he knows where these guys get their information from they never tell me they yeah like they got sources dude i you know and that's the thing they can't like nvidia and amd they're trying they've been trying for years to weed out leaks nvidia's done a pretty good job of it man you saw that with the 3080 launch easy easy with a 38 launch you had people getting fooled by the zotac posting up a troll spec sheet like the night before that's how uncertain people were of the 3080 launch the 360 ti that was getting leaked pretty hard because it was already getting stocked up like the thing about the 3060 ti was is that it's in stock like it's actually in stock i saw it on sale in australia too we'll flip back i saw it on australia uh australia mates um i saw it for 6.99 like there was actually someone selling one for like just above retail so there's ple i've got one here that's probably sold out though pre-order so there's 709 that's pretty good but i saw one from shop in it or something save on it save on it was it sounds a little bit dodgy no they're not man they're on aussie bargain and people were repping them hard like that that was 6.99 like we'll see rtx 26 30 60 ti we'll have a look like i think saveon had in australia for like six nine nine aussie i mean now they're all out of stock like that was like yesterday so you gotta be pretty quick it was this one here it was on for sale for 699 yesterday so they obviously probably had way too many orders and they're like yikes we're gone guys we're gone and within an hour it was our stock and they said okay yeah oh no guys it was bad wasn't it it was bad it wasn't as bad as in stock okay so 749 in stock at umar so 749 like it's not that bad right that is not too bad i'm gonna get like we had 688 that was the cheapest price you'd be able to pick up a 650 360 ti4 that was uh in australia right so you're looking at as well i'm getting what actually galax contacted us they want me to check out their 360 ti so i yeah pretty much this yeah no it's just the one click i see so so we'll be checking this one about um this is not too bad like aussie that's in stock so if you want something that's better than a 1080 ti something that if you overclock it will perform close to a 2080 ti and it's gonna be much more power efficient this is the card to go for for sure so in australia we're not getting like it's funny because i saw some other youtubers like the card you can't buy and it's like well it's in stock like i'm doing a live stream it's in stock right now if you really want it it's in stock and you're not yeah 60 aussie dollars man like 60 versus the worst price not really they're not scalping the crap out of you like it's not too bad so i think with the 3060 ti the reason why it got leaked is because they were building up the stock they weren't dropping this one as early as the other ones because they were waiting to say hey this time we got some cartons full of this like it's like going to a party with a six pack versus a carton of beer you know like your six pack if you drop that on the table everyone's getting one hand from everywhere that six-pack's gone it's like that's how quick it is bring the carton in it's going to last an hour so that's kind of like what nvidia were doing they brought the carton to the table to the party with the 360 ti so there it is so there we go like there's a stock the stock is good like it's in stock right now so the now it goes down to an argument of um now i got told like people are saying in the comments like sector key is saying like the it's meant to be six foot it was meant to be 688 like that's the that's the minimum price like i'm gonna call it minimum price now because msrp is like it it's but you it was 688 from 688 is what i was told and that's included manufacturer suggested retail price i think recommended retail price yeah so msrp is what nvidia suggests the pricing from 688 well nvidia is saying msrp is like 688 gst so 688 gst so that's not too bad right look and it's there it is so it's like it's not the end of the world um i know there's guys out there that want the 3080 the 3080 is so much in demand and that's what we're talking to before with the retailer before i called up the retail in a previous video we were talking about this problem and it was we're talking about this problem right here and 38 everyone wants a 30 80. so it's like now you're in now you're kind of like you're kind of in an argument of okay do i want the luxury option and now you're going to have to wait for it because the 360 is a great car man like really good it's like if i was building a new pc and i was like this is probably the card i'd be going for especially when i saw that 699 deal yesterday shipped because that was in stock [Music] who's selling a used 360 ti already that's a deal it looks like a scam i'm sort of like so you'd have to change yeah you'd easily be able to sell that for 700 like because it's new like it is new you can get it now because you got to pay i think you pay like 15 bucks shipping so it's 715 shipped on that that's that's the cheapest i found it for so um so i'm curious so we got uh john he actually raised a good point i'm kind of curious if nvidia raced to get the 360t out there so people would have uh 3 000 for cybertron 2027. definitely yeah that's a that's a really that's that's like i'd say that's a given right they want so many of these rtx 3000 cards out there and i think actually i was told by nvidia that like i was actually told that they want to get as many 3 000 cards out there so people can enjoy cyberpunk and what because they've really gone to town with the developers on this to make sure it works really hard nvidia i'm sorry uh cyberpunk recommended specs let's see where the 3060 ti pops up that was one of those big city projects well it should be from the horse's mouth directly yeah okay are we still 20 60 30 70 30 80 for ray tracing ultra okay just snap it to the left oh yeah okay okay like that but that's small there we go that'll do man yusuf made up this live stream for us yeah okay trying to save people's privacy but okay yeah he's trying hard man he's trying hard so what we got here um i lied and that's the thing man try harder win faster never forget so when someone calls you a try-hard in the comments section would you get through the spell let's just get through it so 30 70s are recommended ray tracing high yeah high setting so without ray tracing you're looking at a 2060 or a 5700 xd ti is going to run this game really well that's what i think like this isn't like ultra without rotating yeah yeah so i i'd like this is my like i did the 360ti review i really like this card and i mean it's not you're not getting scout like that's the thing you're not getting scout hard on it so this is the middle ground for me i'm kind of happy where this is out of all the launches this year i'm happiest with the 3060 ti and i think if you're a game owner you get a 360 ti you are not going to be disappointed with this thing so that's all i got to say like if you're desperate to get a 30 80 i'd grab one of these and hold out like if you can't hold out for the 38 you grab one of these because the resale value is gonna be pretty much the same as what you paid for it i know so many people who sold 20 series and then had to go out and buy it yeah 1660 ti 980s just to get through oh man the two i comfortable laughs uh so we're super chat from stefan how you doing man uh do you think 2021 will see more downward pressure on new prices or will rising wafer cost send it all in the other direction see 2021 we only did like i only see the only predictions i've made now i've got some guys coming on the comments section going some guys are coming on the comment section of the when i said the prices would come down after covered they were urban you're wrong it's like no i was like right on the money like after the covert boom prices are new stuff prices and new stuff is still very good for now but i'd have to have a rethink on where the market's going because 2021 is anybody's guess right who knows what these companies want to do and what their game plan is going up a little bit i'll probably prices in australia read just yet aussie dollars getting stronger yeah when i when our dollar gets stronger things get cheaper that's natural yeah yeah easy like so our prices this will come down in price this will be like you buy it now 750 is probably like 650 in in two months time if the aussie dollar keeps going up if the lg dollar crowd if the aussie dollar crashes though this will go up in price so aussie dollars you know so everything's tied to the usd because all these companies nvidia amd and intel especially if they were looking at those three they operate in usd that's their base currency for how they operate their business all their balance sheets are in usd so when you're working with usd companies when the prices of your currency goes up or down your prices are going to go for your parts in your country with that trend so in terms of that i can't tell you i wish i could tell you which way the aussie dollar and the us dollar were moving in 2021 i wouldn't be like i'd probably be just off in an island somewhere like i wouldn't have to work a day in my life if i could predict the currency and which way that was going but um in terms of the pc parts and the demand for it right coverts been like this 3060 ti right this being out and being in stock for a few days should tell you something and that is that there's a massive boom rush for this stuff but then after that there's going to be a slowdown and i think going into 2021 you'll see a heated up few months but then after march things will get cold that's my prediction once economic winter properly sets in i think that's when prices of pc parts will go down you remember people remember retailers are competing with each other to stay alive people compete with each other to stay alive when times are tough and that means prices go down because they want to get profit a lot of the stock issues it's mainly only with 30 80 like 30 80 yeah retails like we don't know when we're getting them we don't know anything 30 70 is it like yeah it's usually a two week turn around before it's all down but like 3060 ti is like i'm surprised yeah sold out for every year i'm surprised they're not sold out too actually that's one thing that's one of the best value plays yeah yeah and it's in stock so go back to this that's in stock yeah i thought a bit yeah but it's not there it is so you know i think some of the youtubers jump the gun when they're saying the card you can't buy [Laughter] i just saw some titles i don't know who but i remember just seeing some titles like when i quickly popped up youtube it's like the graphics card you can't buy um the in stock for pickup disagrees with you just just make a video the video card you can buy yeah i mean that's something like youtube nowadays like a lot of it's just like should i i mean i just pandering like i don't know i i just don't like pandering i just you know yeah so anyway um let's get back to some questions guys uh do you think 2021 will bring an oversupply over stock and i mean this is the thing not like you got to remember big corporations in ways especially the guys making the stuff they can have olgopoly opel gopoli set up yeah where they they control how much supply comes out it's like age-old tactics man age-old tactics and that's why i can't tell you guys 2021 like with any certainty because you cut off supply prices are gonna go up that's it it's all about supply in because of 2021 and everything else going yeah to work from home but it's not going to be overstocked but i just got to be more stuck than there is now i mean i just think in 2021 following okay so let's say stock is a constant trajectory right yep so stock supply yeah so they're not cutting off supply if they cut off supply my predictions are way off like right prices will go up if you cut off supply and you're a big manufacturer and you drop supply to make more demand then my predictions would be going off so but if you keep supply steady and you keep pumping those factories out at max capacity which is what they're pretty much on a lot of them are on now yeah 2021's going to see economic winter and with that you're going to be people seeing people not being able to afford gaming pcs as much as they would have so yes prices will come down in 2021 given the supply isn't choked artificially or some magic fire breaks out in the factory so i'm pretty like i said i'm pretty skeptical dude so i always look at things cynical as much as the as much as yes energy come out and come out anytime yeah you gotta always take this part of your brains like do i trust a multi-billion dollar what do you think's gonna corporation in new year with like lockdown do you think it's gonna just from a gut feeling point of view depends man no idea i know one thing i can't that's like you're starting to talk you're starting to go into a whole different topic now and you know do you think it's gonna get better do you think it's gonna stay the same just don't know man i think it's gonna be just a long i think long drawn out slow like it's not gonna be like terrible times but it's going to be yeah it's just going to stay mediocre like you know so anyway um ducks thanks for the super chat brother speaking of supply uh what do you think or know about power supply as being so hard to get right now interesting a power supply i got to check this out for you a power supply is so hard to get like this thing i don't mind just like going no i i just checked this is like this is my okay so it depends on the price like out oh wow okay he's on to something i haven't checked the power supplies recently are we in a bit of a power supply chokeage here oh in stock okay we got people were saying the gigabyte ones were pretty bad but i mean lately i've tried a gigabyte power supply before it did the job but we got we got power supplies in stock hey guys welcome back uh we got a gigabyte microphone here gigabyte chair gigabyte gigabyte speakers just let me write down those notes with my gigabyte pen on my gigabyte oled oh man um okay so power supplies are looking like they're in stock here what what market are you talking about that's the thing so power supplies are fine now like months ago they were bad like power supplies were bad months ago i know that because i covered that but now power supplies like at least where i am now they i'd say they've gone up a little bit in price like i remember the mwa 450 was my go-to power supply for most builds that's went from 49 to 59 i think um so yeah that was mwe 450 was like the stuff and cooler master they like still call me to this day they're like oh man thanks so much i'm like it's a good power supply you send me a good product it's gonna get a good good rap you know um mw i can't find it mw450w it's like my go-to i think it's like yeah true oh let's have a look 69 whoa went up 20 oh no wait no wait that was right okay 59. there it is mwa version 2. so this one's only for australia so if you buy this and take it over to japan you are going to blow it up it's only one it's only 230 yeah it doesn't have the shifter in it so that's it doesn't have the shifty shifty so this is my go-to man there you go that's my go-to 59 bucks gone up 10 so there's not such a big problem for power supplies that's in stock as well there's not such a big problem for power supplies at the moment um as opposed to like maybe in america maybe in america so like maybe in the us let's have a look i think maybe maybe talking about the us hold on 500 watt well 50 of people buy on amazon i think it's statistics but i mean just aries game okay that doesn't mean it doesn't look like a problem to me like they'll even ship that to australia i mean forget that because you're in the us you don't pay that but 48 bucks i mean that's not a great price but it's not a shortage like a shortage you're going to be you're going to be copping it like you're going to be really confident right now like if it's short shortage you're looking at this like 70 bucks right or 80 bucks because people is mediocre power supply this isn't that great but it looks like it's okay it's what i'd go for um especially it's got five star reviews wow with 1100 ratings wow is aries game bigger in the u.s than it is here i don't even know what everything aries game is that just a new print yeah looks awesome so we got from amjad super chat masterful thanks hello from jordan yeah i can't get enough of the pc part signs keep up the great content i think the 360ti is the best value new rtx card i agree that's what i mean i felt insecure man i got some 230 70s we're going to be doing that flip up challenge like in the next two days we got 6 800 review to get through uh and then we got 6900 xt's coming um and then we got what's up rubble oh that's fine hold on the people yeah certainly postcode man yeah people know i'm in holland park who guess that's fine user's like he's one of them so this is not my address printed on the screen that's that's all right like in docs and myself then um so we've got yeah 360 ti is i think the best gpu at the moment in the new market on these new higher end stuff like and this is the thing 36 cci grab one overclock it because it's an overclockable card it overclocks well for the extra watts it's such a good car to overclock that's what i was saying in my review you can undervolt if you want to but 360ti overclocked that thing and then your taste and near 3070 performance really good card man so that's that's my um hit at the moment for that's like and you're thinking 360 ti traditionally you think in 2016 not a high-end card this is getting into the high-end realm now so that's it you're getting into the high-end realm with the 360 ti that's the good thing about it that's why i like it is the 37 worth keeping of course yeah like definitely enjoy your cards i mean if you're talking about if you haven't bought it yet ah okay so someone's asking ryan sees like he's the 37 worth keeping i have my founders edition brand new in the box wondering if i should do a light downgrade no like i mean if you've already got it like you're gonna waste all that time for a lot now yeah founders editions are rare too actually now you said founders dude founders are rare like that's what i'm getting told like locally on the street word on the street if you get a founder's card you're in retail retailers yeah yeah australia only had one wave of founders cards come through and they were rare so yeah that was it there you go so we'll get going through some questions we'll slow this down because it is getting dark outside how long have we been streaming for two hours oh over two hours we hit the two hour mark whew all right thanks for tuning in for so long too guys we kept up some really good you guys are loving this you guys are loving this but i really the the whole point of this stream right i actually wanted to make this stream kind of for it i don't even know what this stream became we just started chatting and hanging out but the whole point of this stream was i wanted to show like the used market really just isn't what it used to be you know like i used to go on there or i used to especially in japan man i can't wait to get back to japan and do some parts hunting over there but even then even when i went back a year ago to japan it was so different to when i was doing it in 2016 2017 right and the thing is it's getting harder for me to do it now like in terms of actually getting good deals because if i'm doing the parts hunt and now i'm like all right guys came up with the 1060 for 200 you guys are gonna like that i know the guys who know their prices out there are going to scratch their head and like brian this isn't a parts hunt anymore this is just a joke and so i'm looking at the the deals hunts like we put down a heap of offers today we put down i think like six or seven offers on things but like that was on like not mainstream stuff that wasn't on stuff that would be able to build a pc with like we're talking a motherboard cpu ram combo that stuff was abundant years ago like i could jump on gumtree find a whole banger pc for cheap i could jump on gumtree find like a used mobo combo with an i5 or i7 for a really good price i could make magic happen out of that and it was so much more fun because i'd be putting together this unique pc and would just be doing some janky stuff with it those days are kind of like drying up now like those days are drying up for used parts and i think going forward i'm going to have to be doing something different where i'm gonna have to be featuring like the new stuff's good man we had that calculator up before where here was the calculator brothers 638 bucks is the entry level aussie dollars right so we're looking at 638 aud to usd that's your 1650 super build case power supply ssd one terabyte hard drive that's the whole benchmark right 470 bucks you can get four cores eight threads brand new 16 gigabytes of ram 1650 super you're gaming for 470 bucks that's the benchmark right now so if you're seeing a used pc for more than that with an rx 570 an rx 580 a gtx 1060 that's got it's like you know i'd i wouldn't be buying that you know what i mean the the guy that the teenager tech yes who was on whatever at the time was eight dollars an hour i think the minimum wage in australia has raised heaps at the time the young tech yes doing that wouldn't have been buying a used pc he would have been buying and building his own new pc i know that guy he still resides in my head at the back and that's what keeps the used pc parts hustle thriving and drives me to do it but how can i do it when the deal when the deals just shored up everyone thinks their i7 is worth 200 bucks it's like 10 100 f why didn't intel just call it the i7 10 100 f like seriously yeah yeah yeah why didn't they just that's it why didn't they skate i7 10 100 f i9 10 7 or i9 10 400 i 11 10 700 i 13. like they would have done me a big favor they would have done all of us a big favor yeah i 256. what is this what is this so anyway anyway time to move to taiwan for a year until the market corrects itself oh marco you want me to come over to taiwan do you guys want me to go over to taiwan [Music] no idea man that's another topic for another day [Music] like i hope we can make a bubble between taiwan and japan that would be awesome i i can't wait to go to both those places yeah i can't wait to go both those places i really are like yeah the used scene over there especially south korea too the used scene was just cracking over there man like those those asian countries are so good now like where i'm at on the gold coast it's like guys are just like hey brian what's up you got some competition and you got it hard brother have you heard of a thing called the f5 key i'm like yeah bro like you know my f5 key gets a little bit of a workout but these guys are banging through keyboards every couple of weeks because they're smashing the f5 key so hard so anyway we're gonna wrap it down guys we're gonna wrap it down what was your relationship ah what was my relationship with the late kevin from tech showdown i love kev man i don't want to get all emotional on live stream man like that's a hard question but kev was like he was just one of those dudes man he was just the dude in the tech scene everyone knew him um he was just the guy who was everyone liked him he's just such a lovable dude man um and i i regret every day not physically i just kept every time i spoke to him man i told him you gotta get out of taiwan and it wasn't because of taiwan like taiwan's a great place it was because he broke up with his girlfriend in taiwan and i know what it's like to break up with someone overseas and have no support network there for you i know what that's like so i told kevin i said you gotta get back to new zealand and just be surrounded by your family and friends i even told him dude come to the gold coast stay at my place for however long you want to stay here for brother i need to see you get good and so that's the hard thing about kevin man yeah he just he didn't like i mean he didn't listen that's like at the end of the day you can lead a horse to water you can't make a drink and that's the thing about kevin's one thing it just it it pains me man i don't mind talking about live stream whatever but it hurts man it hurts because he would have been here today he ain't here anymore man anyway ugh that one yeah that one just it's like at the same time it's like it's frustrating you know it's just frustrating because you know i mean in hindsight you can't do anything right it's his life he's got to make his choices everyone every man has to make his own choices in life but i can just i know what it was i was the only probably one of the only dudes around him who knew exactly what he was going through and what he needed to do that's the hardest thing about kev so that was the thing that eats me it eats me i i mean i did my i did kind of like did i do my best you know should i just like flowing over there and like physically just grabbed him and chucked him on a plane that was the thing because every time i spoke to him and i really laid it into him hard so anyway rest in peace kevin that was yeah he's just he was a good dude man such a good dude too such a such a cool dude man nothing too bad to say about him so anyway let's get back we'll get back to the questions man sorry all right like leslie you're asking like i don't want to go into that stuff man like you're starting to go into personal details man like you know did he fall into that yeah of course he did bro like of course he would have fallen into that state man just like you know anyway let's go back to his attack so i might have to wind this right yeah it's not a good way to end a stream man yeah you can't end the stream like this man let's uh let's get on to like someone give me a good question we'll spin it off do you watch any of joker's videos nowadays no you're talking about joker productions no um anyway you guys some of you og's will know what happened between me like i hope joker could message me one day and just apologize like and just let bygones be bygones but i've never got an apology from it man and i know what joker did so yeah anyway so let's keep going that's another bad note can we end the note can we end this can we end the stream on a good note damn can we end this can we get this stream on a good note okay brian top five deals that you've seen brand new brand new brand new since the used market's not that great what would you recommend buying i'm really checked really yeah i mean the six the 699 it go 3060 cpu's 10 100 f right now yeah gpu would be 1660 super on sale okay yeah what um what ram would you recommend with the motherboard h like that's that's the combo we did it before on the deals like all those deals would be what i get h410 h4 yeah h410 oh we're just showing like live h410 motherboard okay well i didn't i didn't put it all in the cart taylor and thanks for the super chat man oh man i appreciate it that's a good way to end the stream he said i'm handsome thanks dude that's a good way to make the 30ti we got gi pilot 30ti um what are you what's your thoughts i think there will be something like that coming i just don't know when i don't know how i'd say february maybe you'd see a 3080 ti that that makes a bit of sense um where do you flip internationally i can get three fan 3070s for msrp here in hong kong i don't want a person to send me back a brick on ebay oh i wouldn't flip internationally on ebay dude you're asking for trouble whoa not 30 70s either you can get hosed on that man no way so anyway sorry i'm just i'm not paying attention 30 70 here we go h410 asrock motherboard 78 bucks there it is so that's what i mean we had it in here 78 bucks 83 bucks for ram 39 for a case 4500 power supply there is my deals like that's what i'd be going for new parts with a 1660 super instead so maybe they've just got a 1660 super up here uh i'd try and get one on sale for like 299 or something even one on the marketplace there might be a 2016. there might be a 1660 super on the marketplace yeah okay oh we got another super chat we got another super chat chat oh yeah we went to the marketplace i didn't okay why facebook why so we got super chat skasher 777x have you hear have you heard of we buy and what are your thoughts have you heard or heard of we buy and what are your thoughts they're uk based i've heard of we buy they're in australia here they're actually in australia we buy yeah cex we buy they're different i think they're a different thing but they're cex will you buy here they're okay they used to like the problem with we buy in australia is that they take a lot of crap that they don't check properly and then they flip
