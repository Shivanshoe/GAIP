[Music] [Music] here on the table we've got seven Lenovo
om motherboards that I've pulled from om systems now I got these four super cheap
at 15 oz II dollars of pop because they were untested but most recently on the
channel here I have come into a problem in relation to these older OEM systems
and a thing known as bit rot where I reflashed the BIOS and everything was
working fine again so what I'm gonna do here to down the channel is I'm gonna go
through each of these boards individually see if they have problems
before we sort of clean them up and reflash the boss and sort of grab a mini
sample size of statistics from these boards right here but another thing I'm
going to do too is since in the x58 video we had actually a semi faulty
board that we brought back by cleaning the CPU motherboard pins and this was
like a last resort for me I had nothing to lose only one channel of DIMM worked
originally but after we cleaned the pins we got all those channels and DIMM slots
back to working so that was really surprising but I'll show you guys what
we do for that later but we've also got here lastly at age 61
mkay motherboard that i'm going to attempt to bend back a lot of pins on
and see if we can get this working - have you just won the lotto that if so
does e 490 as Ron aqua is for you with its built in 10g Nick onboard Wi-Fi six
ESS save a DAC and an audio solution he's a four ready OLED display and USB
three-point two out at the front and Thunderbolt at the rear and most
importantly an integrated water block to get that 10 nine hundred K to the max
and I can go find out more the links in
description below so we've got some good news here with our lenovo motherboard
the first one this is the M 91 and unfortunately with this h61 motherboard
it doesn't have an option in the BIOS to disable secure boot and we recently
looked at this in a video where we put it build together where it wouldn't work
with the GTX 645 before the update and after the update and this is the same
story with this motherboard but what's weird about it is after we've updated
the BIOS we can use a gtx 1060 so what that means is that ZOTAC are using a
sort of a trick on their v bios to work with some of these older boards in that
these motherboards were only programmed to support a heap of different graphics
cards and if you are off that list for instance the GTX 645 then it just simply
wouldn't boot up and now in the boss itself there is no option to disable
secure boot so you're basically forced to put in a graphics card that will work
or it doesn't work and unfortunately that's what you're limited to but the
good news is and these are these ZOTAC cards right here I'm surprised that this
1060 which was released years after this 2014 BIOS update is able to work so at
least ZOTAC have done some good things on that in that their cards will work
with this m91 lenovo now one thing about this
ThinkCentre h61 is that it does differ from other things centers and that some
of them do have the option to enable CSM disable secure boot but also this one
has a 24 pin as opposed to some of them having that a standard lenovo 14 pin
connector which you then have to get it converted at 24 pin so this one does
have some good and bad news but at least with the bad news we were able to
overcome that thanks the zotac having some good UEFI firmware onboard that's
able to work with this particular motherboard though that's one for one
now with our OEM boards we don't have to clean any pins because everything's
working fine let's move on now to the next one so the next ThinkCentre m-19 story it's
working absolutely fine the dual channel two sticks of memories working fine with
the i5 2400 gtx 1060 is now booting up after a BIOS update so that is now two
for two and in terms of cleaning CPU pins hopefully we come into a problem
because then I'll show you guys that method because basically if you don't
need to fix something I don't recommend fixing something so there's one really
important saying in Australia and that is if it's not fine don't fix it
so we're now three for three with our Lenovo boards here and this is some
really good news already but you may notice there's this arrow of 0 135 fan
failure and basically on these m91 s and also the LDH 61 Lenovo's there's usually
two fan headers on the motherboard itself and so if you don't have both the
fan headers plugged up it will give you our error messages so all you have to do
is basically have two fans plugged in off the motherboard and you will no
longer get this error and there's no really way to get past it because again
the bias is so limited on this motherboard
[Music] so next up here we've got an H 81 Lenovo
this is from the ThinkCentre m73 now this is actually one of my personal
favourites and there's a few reasons why the first thing that it does have those
options in the bio so you can disable secure boot enable CSM so basically any
graphics card is going to work with this motherboard but also the m73 is
generally support the Haswell refresh CPUs so if you come into an i7 4790 and
not just a forty seven seventy then unlike some other OEMs i've had problems
with aces especially HP's where they just won't work and then the BIOS update
isn't there to even get Haswell refresh working this works with has real refresh
and but the only drawbacks is that you need this adapter right here at 14 pin
to 24 pin if you want to use a different power supply and then use something like
a gtx 1060 another hurdle to overcome is in the case of this board right here
there was a password upon booting up the system and the only way to get around
this and at least there is a workaround is to turn everything off put the clear
CMOS jumper in the clear position and then turn the system back on and leave
it on for more than 10 seconds and you will hear a beep coming off this
motherboard once it's beeping two times then you can turn it all off and the
password will disappear because then the boss has been completely reset also
another good thing about these boards is that they're just newer in general the
BIOS build dates almost 2015 so it's really going to be a lot less
susceptible succumbing to that bit rot problem as we spoke about before but
also we've got USB 3 on the back official VR support with those fourth
generation and onwards though on this particular model the only downside is
there's no USB 3 front out though you can get around that by getting a USB 3 2
USB 2 converter [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
so there's some really good news and that is we've got seven out of seven
untested motherboards all working absolutely fine though there are some
things I'll run through with you guys about OAM boards in particular this m91
p and that is even after updating the BIOS you have eight gigabytes of RAM
that works in dual channel absolutely fine so these two sticks right here this
is a king mac stick and a crucial stick and they work perfectly finds
registering is eight gigabytes of RAM and there's no problems whatsoever but
then these two sticks here they I know these work in say a loose motherboard or
something like that but they won't work in this motherboard they just don't work
at all they'll give out a beeping error I'll let you guys take a quick listen and so we can see already the actual
type of RAM used can be the issue and now the last one is the most interesting
because these two g.skill sticks work on their own in different slots so the
memory itself is working absolutely fine there's no problems there but when we
put both of them into dual channel at the same time it still only registers as
four gigabytes of RAM so what we're gonna try and do here is maybe replicate
the scenario that we had in the x58 build and that is we're just gonna for
the sake of it start cleaning the pins and show you guys how you can do it now
keep in mind this is a last resort I do not recommend
usually going anywhere near pins unless you have to whether it be bending them
back which we're gonna be doing pretty soon with that other motherboard or if
it's just in the case of a last resort where you've done everything else you've
tried different memory and you've got some generic are we am stuff that the
green PCB matches the green PCB and you've tried everything else and just
nothing's working so again you've got nothing to lose so what we're gonna do
for this is we're gonna get a little stiffer brush that I got with my I think
I got it with my data back or my vacuum cleaner and so you've got to be very
careful on which brush you would use don't use one that's gonna catch on to
the pins and then start making a mess and bending them because as soon as
these pins are bent there's a big risk that you may not have
your motherboard ever working again so be very careful with pens and I'm just
putting that out there I only do this if it's a last resort so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna now get some multi-purpose spray and we're
gonna spray that on the pins and then start cleaning them very lightly very
softly so we're making sure we're not bending any pins and we're just going to
make sure we give that a little clean and we'll come back and hey maybe it
might fix the problem maybe these since these are only single rank and there's a
dual rank dims maybe that might fix our problem [Music] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] so these pins are now completely cleaned
up and you'll notice we just took things very slowly and we were stroking against
the grain of the pen itself so from a big top to bottom from the bottom left
hand L here and then the top right L would be going upwards and that way we
can fix two things in one and that is if the pin heads themselves have developed
a bit of corrosion over time or there's dust buildup then that will get off that
dust and make the pin contact clean again but also another thing I was told
years ago by the BIOS team I'm not gonna say which company but they said pins can
suffer over time from what's called micro bends so doing what we just did
here can alleviate both issues and it was something that worked in again
yesterday's x58 video I was kind of surprised that it works so well but
we'll give this a go now with the g.skill memory and see if that's any
better but but also another thing you can do is clean your CPU which we did
before and I noticed actually a layer of dirt came off all the pin contacts so
that was good to see and in terms of the multi-purpose spray I get asked a lot
all the time about this stuff and it's something that's sold in Australia and
I'm grateful that it's sold in Australia cause it's like the best stuff I've
worked with in terms of PC parts and something that's just a generic
all-purpose spray overseas the wd-40 is a lot thicker the CRC 556 I believe it
is is a good alternative but that's again sold in limited countries so I
guess we're lucky to have this multi-purpose spray in Australia
[Music] [Applause]
[Music] [Applause]
[Music] and here's the last thing that I'm glad
we did this because it's witness to the power of what we just did so there's the
two sticks of g.skill memory now working absolutely fine and showing up as a
gigabytes of RAM so this just proves that cleaning pens can help in this
situation where otherwise we're only getting four gigabytes of RAM showing up
before but now we've got eight gigabytes so I'm actually really glad that in this
video I had just like the x58 video a real-world example to show you of this
working in practice [Music]
[Applause] [Music] and now with the finale on this
motherboard essentially I Bend all the pins back but the problem was it was all
in wasted effort because the board would boot up it just wouldn't give out a
signal at all I tried different RAM different CPUs but it looked like for
what it's worth it was functioning okay so I'm guessing the board itself was
faulty and whoever gave it to us essentially pulled the CPU out and then
bent pins in the process so sometimes unfortunately all you can do is give it
your best but that being said we can still utilize the battery which looked
like it was fine and utilized these little clips here on the CMOS and we've
also got a win bond BIOS that we can take out and in the future if we come
into a faulty bias we can change it over with this one so not all is wasted and
we have just finished up with that tech yes loving and seven of these eight
motherboards are now working fine I mean that last board the azouz h61
I don't think that was going to work regardless so I did my best to get those
pins bent back but one thing I know from past experience is if there's too many
bent pins it's usually not even worth the time and effort in this case I feel
like that board was inherently faulty before the pins were even bent on it so
that fact that I had to remove CPU the way it did was I'm pretty sure the board
was faulty beforehand but the seven of seven Lenovo boards working that were
untested was a big win for me personally I feel like usually I do come in to one
or two faulty boards but on that note we have done this new method now of
cleaning the pins and I I'm just really excited about this
because it's something that I feel like if I applied this to a few of the boards
in the past that I've tested here I could have got those working again so
it's good to see that things like bit right if you reflash an old BIOS and now
if you clean pins and maybe get some corrosion off or dust off that can help
bring a board that at a hardware level isn't effective working 100% again and
so that's one thing I love doing around tech I see is getting the most out of
that older gear and I know there's going to be people out there that are like why
do you share this stuff and basically fuel your competitors and it's not
really about that at the end of the day I feel like at least the scene I'm
making here on the Gold Coast is a really good one like there's all the
other guys that I know that sell gaming PC's we're all pretty much friends and
we all get along really well and I've found that they use price-performance
community is one of the best to being in tech because there's never really any
fanboy arguments that you get with new parts and basically I find myself when
I'm doing the new stuff and testing all that out there's all these comments that
I just get sick of reading and it sort of pulls me back to the used
price-performance stuff where there's just none of those arguments everyone's
in it for the same reason they want to get the best value for their money and
so it's just a different sort of contrast between those two but with all
that out of the way I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button I guess that's the most important thing you guys
are enjoying the content what do you guys been requesting I do more used
price-performance content so this was one of those things I just thought well
I'll take you guys through me sort of pulling OEM systems apart going through
all the trial and error stuff sort of like a preload to the upcoming can yes
fix it we've got a big episode coming a lot of people have sent stuff in so stay
tuned for that one but with that aside if you guys have tips and tricks of your
own then be sure to share them in the comments if you don't mind I mean I know
some people out there don't like to share their secret sauce as they don't
want to feel the competition but over the years I'd really I just I mean I
started my whole channel off sharing tips and tricks right back when we
started going hard in use price-performance I was just like
well I'll just show the world all this and you guys loved it and so that's the
most important thing you guys are loving the content and we're making an awesome
community around it hopefully we're sharing some answers to
questions that people have had especially if they're on a strict budget
and I'll never forget the person who is on a real strict budget and they just
want to get the most for their money because where they are in the world they
might not be as fortunate as you just remember that and don't forget about
that and without aside we've got the question
of the day here so we'll read that out which comes from Alexa Petrovic and they
asked hey I have a question will you ever do a Windows 10 2004 optimization
if so when will it come out I usually do the windows 10 optimizations every two
updates because I find that's when the major upgrades happen I think 2004
though is the second update where I haven't done the optimization guy for
the one in between so hopefully we'll check that all out I this month is super
busy so I want to get the can yes fix it done I got to get a heap of like B 550
and Z 490 motherboard comparison review is done that's gonna be crazy like I
don't know it must it must just be like motherboard season at the moment because
I've never been sent this many motherboards in the entirety of tech yes
sitting there with that aside I'll catch you guys in the next tech video very
soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content and you're not yet
subbed and you want to see the content the moment it drops then the sub button
hit that ring that bell and I'll catch it in the next one peace out for now
