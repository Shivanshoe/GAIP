I was on twitter the other night and people were messaging me they're like Bryan have you checked out the latest Gamers Nexus video where they tested two sticks versus four sticks on their Ryzen 5 5600x and I said oh well you know i'm super busy right now testing out all this stuff for you guys too and then I went and watched the video and some interesting results, I mean i'm definitely not going to dispute anything and Gamers Nexus does a lot of good testing so if you want to go check out that video guys i'll put the link in the description below for you but I thought i'd quickly do some testing of my own here these are the sticks that i use in my videos recently especially with all the Ryzen Testing. I use two 16 gigabyte sticks of corsair dominator CL16 3600 MHz memory. Now these are dual rank or they're two ranks and putting them in two ram slots will essentially make it dual channel so you've got four ranks over two channels this is typically i find it's the best sort of balance across a wide variety of cpus now if i was to add in another two sticks of this to make 64 gigabytes in total i'm guessing i will probably not be even able to run the 3600 megahertz cl 16 profile but we will test that out later in today's video when we compare this on the 5800 x versus four sticks right here this is some 4 000 megahertz trident z rgb geoskill stuff and we're going to put this four sticks in a motherboard this is only single rank however so there's only one side of the memory has a memory chips on it making it one rank but that being said we're going to be testing apples to apples across the amd cpu then throwing it on the 10900k and seeing what differences this makes versus this however we're going to do a little bit of a twist and that is we're going to save these xmp profiles into the bios and then load them up for this memory right here that way we're getting a complete apples to apples comparison here when it comes to testing out two sticks across two dimms versus four sticks across four dimms so with that aside i am all stocked and ready to go just after this sponsor spot quickly if you want to get a windows 10 pro key license for cheap

below so getting straight into the results now for you guys we've got here four different games tested between the 10 900k and also the ryzen 7 5800x and the thing is going into these results and coming out it's pretty much the same recommendation before i made this video and that is ryzen 75800x for me personally it's the gaming king especially out of the box without overclocking the cpu itself and locking in xmp profiles it's the gaming king it beats the 10900k and then the thing is the recommendations we'll talk about those later but we've got here csgo let's pull that up first and what i'm doing here is i'm lowering the resolution to 1080p it's not going to be 1440p it's not going to be 4k i'm also lowering the settings so what this is going to do is it's going to extract any differences and it's going to make them bigger and if there's differences between the memory configurations they're going to be bigger as well and what we can see with csgo here is that the amd the 5800x is beating the 10900k and it's beating it by quite a comfortable margin but i'm going to throw up another graph within this game because the first graph here we can see that there's no real differences between the memory configurations except the 831 on the eight ranks over four sticks and here's the thing about the eight ranks i actually couldn't get this to work at 3 600 megahertz i had to drop this down to 3 200 megahertz because that's all it would boot up on the 10900k i think it booted up 100 megahertz higher on the amd system but the bottom line is on both systems it would not lock in 3600 megahertz over 64 gigabytes which is another talking point which we'll talk about a little bit later in the video but food for thought here we're going to pull up the spectre patch disabled on the ryzen 75800x and then we're going to pull up the patch disabled on the intel both spectre and meltdown on intel and we can see some performance differences here amd the ryzen cpus have found this in the past they lose performance when you disable spectre so basically out of the box with ryzen you don't have to do anything with spectrum meltdown leave it as it is you're going to get the best performance then on intel you will gain performance benefits by disabling spectre and meltdown which is why i disable these updates on all the cpus that are intel around my studio i don't believe in spectrum meltdown updates i never have if you're a gamer that is or if you're a person with a single end user using this pc at your home for gaming if you're at an office or your business or you're in the server market or whatnot then you might want to leave these patches enabled but for most gamers which is i guess the majority of my audience i'm guessing you'll want to disable these patches because i feel the benefits far outweigh the negatives and let's with that aside move on to dota 2. and what we've got here is pretty much no difference to write home about on dota 2. there was very minor differences but again that can be variance because i'm basically testing in middle and the units are going to interact very ever so slightly different from benchmark to benchmark but the numbers are pretty much the same across the board there's no real distinct winner here between intel and amd either though the 5800x i do believe for what it's worth scored one fps higher on average than the 10 900k though next up horizon zero dawn this one is we're using the in-built benchmark uh this game apparently recently got a big patch as well which helps performance but what we're going to be doing here 1080p lower settings we can see here that this game we actually get a performance boost from going from two ranks to four ranks over dual channel and then we actually lose performance by going with the eight ranks over four dimms over two channels so basically the best configuration for horizon zero dawn is four ranks over two channels whether that's on two sticks of memory or on four sticks of memory doesn't really make a difference because again we're clocking those two 32 gigabyte configurations at the same 3600 megahertz cl 16 timings that's important too now next up the last game we're testing here is shadow of the tomb raider pulling this up there wasn't again a difference to write home about except for the two ranks versus the four ranks and again we saw the same trend continuing as we did with the horizon zero dawn benchmark and that is that the eight ranks didn't perform as good as the four ranks and the two ranks didn't perform as well as the four ranks either so it seems like four ranks over dual channel is your sweet spot for gaming now of course the 8 gigabyte configuration is probably going to be the best but keep in mind this is another twist to the story because the higher your memory capacities are the more strenuous that is on the integrated memory controller so if you somehow magically got your hands on a 16 gigabyte kit of four ranks over two channels you could technically overclock that higher than the 32 gigabyte kit and you could get better results yet again but the problem with that is is that in 2020 i don't believe they do make four gigabyte single sided sticks anymore so i think that's out of stock so if you want to go for a full rank over two channels then you're going to need to go out and buy 32 gigabytes of memory whether it be two sides of one stick making a 16 gigabyte stick or if it's two single sided eight gigabyte sticks and generally you're going to want to buy the newer stuff because it's going to perform better it's going to have the higher x and b profiles so basically in a nutshell summing these results up for you guys we saw the performance increases between the dual rank versus the single rank over the dual channel that wasn't a difference that was bigger on intel versus amd not in my testing here i'll seeing pretty much the consistent gain on both horizon zero dawn and shadow of the tomb raider on both intel the 10 900k as i was seeing on the ryzen 7 5800x now the reason my results may differ if these results are differing to someone else is because i disable spectrum meltdown on intel's side and i've just stated before why i do that so hopefully this video has helped you guys uh i guess process if it's a little bit confusing it hopefully it won't hopefully just breaks down unless you know that it's not that confusing it's just basically rank into leaving where on one channel you're going to be changing between the ranks as the memory is refreshed and so that's going to help with that latency instead of doing that it's going to be ready to go on each rank and so it's going to be ever so slightly faster and in turn that's going to help depending on the benchmark so this is something that's not new in 2020 this has always been a thing since uh four ranks versus two ranks on dual channel was a thing in gaming i've made sure over the last year that i've always tested with four ranks over two channels and i've just tested with the corsair cl 16 dominator stuff and i've used that pretty much in all my benchmarks and the most important thing is there's gonna be three recommendations coming out of this video the first thing is if you're a tech reviewer and i'm probably going to speak on behalf of a lot of other tech reviewers here and that is as long as we're doing apples to apples testing then the recommendations are going to be accurate so if you guys are going into other people's comments section saying oh you didn't use four sticks of memory these results are bad that's not like it's not a cool thing to do because you're basically undermining that person's results and all their testing that they've done when there's nothing wrong with their results to begin with maybe if they've used two sticks of memory and it's only dual rank and their overall their results on both intel and amd are lower than other people's then that could be a cause for investigation maybe but even then they're testing apples to apples and in a lot of cases they could be their recommendations pretty much going to line up with everyone else's they're going forward testing these things there's something i do personally and that's disable spectrum meltdown i know it's a bit controversial but i've just i just state my stance on it and so if the tester wants to do that or they don't want to do that i'm not going to critique them that's their testing that's their way of doing things but i have my testing and my way of doing things and that's not going to change and it hasn't changed then there's a third recommendation you as a gamer what should you do should you go out and make sure you've got four ranks over two channels and the answer to that is if you want the highest end experience so you've got a big hole to burn in your wallet you want to get an rtx 3090 you want to get the ryzen 7 5800x or 5900x or whatever you want to get then yes four ranks over two channels is going to be the best performance overall for you 32 gigabyte kit for gaming now me personally i would recommend going with two 16 gigabyte kits and the reason being is if you want to say you find yourself playing less games over time and doing more productivity you've got the option to add in another 32 gigabytes of ram making 64 gigabytes in total pretty much all my workstations now have 64 gigabytes of ram though if you're on a budget this is the thing if you're on a budget and money's important for you the most important thing on a budget is to make sure you've got dual channel that's the most important thing the second thing is to make sure you've got your x and p profiles locked in because those two things are going to be a bigger performance delta hit than going with four ranks over two channels if that makes any sense so when it comes to buying memory i'd say there's three priorities you want to have the first priority being make sure you've got dual channel second priority make sure you've got the speeds upped x and p's are locked in third priority would be making sure you've got then the last which is sort of like the extra priority making sure you've got that um dual rank over a single channel so four ranks over two channels anyways with that aside i hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comments section below what you think of dual rank versus single rank and have you had some interesting experiences that you want to share in the comments section because i love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this one here it comes from silver werewolf and they say quality costs yes for only amd it seems but for intel in his moment how was the story this amd bias channels uh me like that's the first time i've ever heard that i'm an amd biased channel i think i like to call things down the line and i mean if you look at my recent um ryzen reviews i've checked out the value chart and the 10 400 f is just ever so slightly winning those value charts like i i mean okay i think i wasn't impressed with the 10 900k but i'm i guess i'm more impressed with the 5800x that i am with the 10900k and the reason being is because it's a gain generation over generation the 10 900k wasn't any gains over the 9900 ks or the k in fact you line those cpus up and they're pretty much going to perform exactly the same in gaming so that that sole fact is the reason why i'd be more inclined to say hey the 5800x even though it's not great value for money and you're seeing the results here today right we've compared the 10900k against 5800x 5800x i beat it it's the better gaming cpu so with those recommendations in mind it goes to show that one cpu maker has given you a gain year on year and one hasn't so i don't know what story you want me to tell here but basically when it comes to intel they've haven't given us an ipc boost i think it's for five years running now since sky lake and that's really affecting them it's really hurting them as a company especially for the enthusiast market so intel really need to bring out something new and that's i guess they're doing that with sunny cove they're porting it from 10 nanometer back to 14 nanometer but they're giving the ipc gains and that's the thing about intel why didn't they give us these ipc gains three years ago or two years ago it just these are the things amd are doing that amd have sort of come up now and i guess they're surprising until every generation they're not holding back and now it's making intel um really scratch their heads and say well where did amd come up with this ipc from where did it come from and the answer is it's come up to really i guess it's the tortoise and the hair classical race of tortoise in the hair where the finish line is 20 20. and i guess intel sort of sat at the finish line just before the finish line being the hair and then amd the tortoise with the fx bulldozer is finally caught up anyway there's story time for you hopefully you enjoyed that one if you did and you've stayed this far and you want to see that content the moment it drops then i'll put the uh just hit the sub button ring the bell and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye
