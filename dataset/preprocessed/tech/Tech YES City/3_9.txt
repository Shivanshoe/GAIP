in today's video i'm going to show you how to undervolt your ryzen 5000 series cpus and also i'm going to show you in other tutorials how to do this on intel and also for graphics cards radeon rx cards and nvidia rtx cards so stay tuned for those they are coming where i believe these videos are much more important now in 2022 than they've ever been and that's of course with the rising costs of power consumption going up for instance my friend in australia told me his power bills were literally going to double from 20 cents per kilowatt hour to now 40 cents per kilowatt hour so that's just huge and not only that there's many more benefits to undervolting so my opinion you should forget about overclocking where intel amd and nvidia what these guys do now is with their products is they essentially push them to the limits out of the box on air cooling so if you buy these products they're essentially getting overclocked out of the box without you even knowing and what that does is it pushes them above where they would optimally run in terms of a sweet spot of power versus performance today's video is brought to you by scd keys if you guys are looking for a legitimate single end user windows 10 or even windows 11 pro license key then it's as easy as clicking the link in the description below putting in that coupon code bftyc and you can get these keys for as little as 14 after that discount and once you get the key all you have to do is then copy it and then put it into your windows activation hit activate and you should be getting rid of that annoying watermark in the bottom right hand corner of your screen as well as unlocking more features within windows itself so i'll put those links in the description below let's get back to the video in today's video we're going to bring that back down to a much better level and in turn that's going to save you power but also keep your parts in this case the cpu and the motherboard running cooler and so the benefits to that is just that your parts will last a lot longer and of course you're going to be saving money on your power bill so two programs here on the desktop i want you to download them and that is cinebench r23 and also cpu id hardware monitor these are free downloads you don't have to pay any money for them and so what we're going to do is open them both up and this will essentially one of these programs the r23 that's going to test the performance of our cpu as well as stressing it to the max and then cpu id hardware monitor this is going to connect to the sensors on all the pc parts and it's going to tell us the voltage is going to tell us the power consumption it's also going to tell us the temperatures and if we successfully undervolt we should notice that our temperatures drop and also our uh we'll actually just start running the benchmark here so we click on start cpu multi-core core just left click that click start you can make sure the minimum test duration is just off because what we're doing here out of the box is we're just testing the default cpu clocks and we can see here this is the ryzen 5 5500 it's going between gigahertz and 4.2 gigahertz so that's where this cpu likes to perform on all cores out of the box we see here we're going to around 70 watts straight out of the box 70 watts power consumption temperatures are going over 70 well there it goes to 75 degrees and it's still going higher so getting close to 76 degrees and essentially what we're going to do after this benchmark is finished is we're going to get that baseline score and so when we undervolt we can then compare our score to see how much performance we're losing but also we can see how much our power consumption is dropping so do write this down do write this down here this 4.175 i think that's the average i'd say 4.2 so in this case i'm going to write down 4.2 gigahertz because we want to remember that that's our baseline clock speed and what i'm going to say is i'm going to say okay well amd what they've done with this cpu is they've pushed it to 4.2 gigahertz out of the box and we can see the voltage here 1.3 volts so take note of that 1.3 volt 4.2 gigahertz and so they're pushing it at this level i believe they've pushed it too far and so what i'm going to do is go into the bios very soon and then drop the speeds down just slightly but then drop down the voltage tremendously so here we go here 10 252 points that's our baseline score for this ryzen 5 500 out of the box so now we remember those three things voltage cpu core clocks and our score we can then just hit the reset button here and restart our computer and we're going to hit the delete and f2 keys while we do this and we're going to get into our bios and so i'm going to start showing you guys how to undervolt in the bios because once we're done with this we should have some very very different results to what we're getting out of the box with this cpu and motherboard combo so just hitting the delete and f2 keys we can't kind of want to hit them as quick as possible to make sure that we don't get back into windows sometimes you can miss it and you're just wasting time so now we're in the bios you might be confused if you're doing this on a different computer you may be like well brian my bias looks different to yours and that's because different bias manufacturers msi azus gigabyte and asrock they have different looks to their bios but they should all have very similar settings buried within these biases but what we've got here is easy mode as soon as we boot up our zeus bios we've got easy mode we're going to change this by hitting f7 now on a gigabyte motherboard msi and azrock it might be f2 but you want to get into advanced mode so we can see up here we've hit the f7 key we're in advanced mode and so now we're in advanced mode we've got all these different tabs that we can use the left and right arrow keys to maneuver through and we want to go in this case in a zeus blast we want to go to ai tweaker and what you can see here is i've already locked in my xmp profiles they're calling it docp and this is very important besides the under vaulting that we're doing today you should always lock in your xmp profiles especially if you're gaming it's going to give you extra performance and you're not going to have to pay anything for it so extra performance in games extra performance in different applications all by just locking in this one setting here so we've got 3 600 megahertz that's locked in but now we're going to go down here to our cpu core ratio and we're going to go to here it is right here cpu core ratio we're going to type in 40 and so that signifies uh in blocks of 100 megahertz for 40 100 megahertz and so that'll be four gigahertz so how they do it in a lot of biases that one of these represents 100 megahertz so there it is there 400 megahertz it's weird to say that but that's basically four gigahertz so we've dropped that down now from 4.2 gigahertz which we wrote down before from cinebench and we're putting in four gigahertz and that's just essentially what that's going to do is that's just going to drop the speeds down a little bit because i feel like amd have pushed this cpu again too far out of the box but now that that's locked in we're now going to go down to two actually one more very important setting and this is cpu voltage and we can see this on the screen here cpu voltage we're going to hit enter and you might see different modes here it might be fixed voltage in different biases we're going to go to offset mode that's the most important offset mode and essentially what this is going to do is allow us to still take advantage of low power consumption states so for instance if you leave the house and you want to leave the computer on it's downloading something allow the cpu to down clock still its voltages and down clock at speeds and you can still take advantage of under vaulting when it's fully ramped up so we've got offset mode we've changed this might be on plus we're going to change it to minus here and essentially what this will do is whatever value we set now in the cpu voltage offset here it's going to minus that from the 1.3 volt here so from the box we're going to go a little bit ballsy and we're going to go for okay we're going to go for 100 millivolts but the azus bios is doing it just in raw volts so we're going to go for 0.1 so we're going to type in a decimal and then just one and that'll lock in 0.1 now we can also use the plus and minus arrow keys on our keyboard as well that's another way to go through these voltages but we're just going to go for 100 millivolts or 0.1 volt and after we've locked in those settings there so we've got the 4 gigahertz we've got the 100 millivolts we're just going to go over now here to exit and just go to save changes and exit you may also on pretty much every motherboard it's f10 as well you can hit f10 and just go okay so it's going to tell us we're locking in our cpu it's just going to confirm all the settings and we're like yep that's what we want then we're going to go okay and now hopefully hopefully our cpu doesn't i mean sorry our computer doesn't crash while we're doing this because 100 millivolts straight off the get-go is pretty significant so we're going from 1.3 volt to 1.2 volt and the thing about voltages i know it's a little bit hard to get your head around but when you start lowering these voltages the power actually drops more it's not a linear fashion with cpu voltage so if you up at 0.1 volt you won't be using that same percentage difference in power it'll actually be more in a percentage difference than 1.2 to 1.3 so it's a little bit complicated but just understand 100 millivolts is pretty significant so hopefully hopefully this well we've booted up now to windows so this should be fine but again we're opening up cinebench r23 opening up cpu hardware id and we're just going to run this benchmark see what our power consumption numbers are see what our final score is and see how much performance we're losing so hopefully if we've done everything right we should hopefully get around 10 000 points still we're just going to start off we're going to start it off because hardware id it's taking its time it's taking a sweet time here to load it's like here it is finally it came up uh sometimes that can mean instability too but i i don't think like i don't think it's inst i think it's unstable i think it should be fine it booted up really quickly so we're running the benchmark we're gonna get through it we're gonna see that automatically we've got 56 watts now 56 watts so we're down from i think it was 70 watts and we are down now to 56 watts so that's a significant drop already we're running at 4 gigahertz all cores and we can confirm here with the cpu voltage that's also down and that's the temperatures are down too we i think we're going over 75 now we're at 68. so we've dropped all these three things here but the benefits are really showing on the wattage the most and that that 50 i think it's 57 watts that's getting close i believe to around a it's getting close to around 20 drop in power consumption now are we going to get when this benchmark finishes a 20 drop in performance absolutely not i can guarantee you before this benchmark finishes it's not going to be a 20 drop in performance i believe it might be a few percent worst case scenario i believe maybe 4 i'm hoping it's a little bit less just because our cpus uh got lower temperatures so let's get into it let's see what we've got right here it's finishing up and there's 9 900 points so we lost 300 points roughly 3 percent but our power consumption dropped nearly 20 percent so what we're going to do now is because that ran that benchmark absolutely fine we're going to restart our computer and we're going to do this in 500 milli uh sorry 50 millivolt increments so we're at a minus 100 millivolt we're going to go down now to minus 150 millivolt and we're just going to essentially keep doing this until we find instability and so if you're over say for instance you're under vaulting a ryzen 9 5900x or a ryzen 7 5800x you can apply this same methodology drop the speeds a little bit say for instance the ryzen 7 5700 5800x is 4.6 gigahertz all cores on that benchmark in cinebench you can then drop that down to 4.4 in the bios but we'll explain that a little bit later if you've got different skus of cpus and what you can do let's just try and for the meantime go back now hit f deleted f2 we got into the bios hitting f7 going advanced mode back to ai tweaker and we're going to go minus 0.15 volt and we've we're going to lock that in and we're going to save changes and reset and essentially what we're looking for is if the computer boots up absolutely fine i'm hoping it does we're going to run that benchmark see it runs absolutely fine again and then we're going to go down to 0.2 volt if this all works out so if it does i'm going to be actually one of those people who i believe won the silicon lottery and that's essentially when your cpu is a very good uh chip in that range and it performs better than other chips even of the same model so for instance there might be ryzen 5 5500s out there that only do minus 100 millivolt but this one here it's booting up at a minus 150 millivolt which is very impressive because that hopefully if this runs okay that means our power consumption is going to drop even more but what we're looking out for as well while we run this benchmark is we're looking out for a our performance number so because we're at 4 gigahertz now and we've already tested it a minus 100 millivolt that was around 9 900 points so say for instance we do this test and we see the performance numbers say 9500 well we know now that our cpu is unstable and so we have to actually then go back into the bias and up the voltage a little bit but what we're looking at so far is four gigahertz again running all those cores at four gigahertz 52 watts so we've dropped down the power consumption even more now and it looks like it's absolutely stable at this stage like it looks like it's running through this benchmark everything's fine temperatures are even dropping down more than they were before i think versus the original temperature setting we're down like 10 degrees which is huge especially if you're gaming in summer you definitely want to keep the heat off your motherboard and cpu and um also while we're running this benchmark the pc is in the background and it's barely making any noise so that's the beauty we can also help drop our noises so let's uh let's get this benchmark to run through and complete and also if you guys have any questions or comments about undervaulting then do drop a comment down below if you've got any of your own tips and tricks as well for people getting into this then do drop a comment down below as well because this is just such a good thing to help out in the tech community i believe undervaulting is just so good i'm going to be again doing tutorials for all this kind of stuff what we saw here now um is now wow going back to this 9 947 points so we actually got a slight lift in performance versus the previous score now cinebench does that it'll give you a little slightly different score so our power consumption went down and that was completely stable so we're going to go now back to restart and we're going to go down for a minus 200 millivolt which is incredible if this works uh for instance if it doesn't work then our computer essentially will just crash and we'll get an error message but if it does work then we're going to hopefully save even more power if we can get that under 50 watts i'm actually going to be very impressed because this cpu i believe is a gem it's it's the golden sample of ryzen 5 55 hundredths i got the golden sample fellas i got the golden sample so we're just mashing that f2 delete key we're mashing it we're going hard we're back in the bios here and we're going in now down to this setting and we're going down to 0.2 volt and ignore this yellow basically this yellow if you see the yellow or i think if you type in one see the 0.5 it's red it's like it's dangerous if you're under vaulting it's not dangerous it's only dangerous if you're overclocking so if you're going in the plus there it'll be dangerous but if we're under vaulting it's not going to be dangerous you can't damage parts by under vaulting them at least when it comes to pc parts a cpu on a motherboard if you're doing other crazy stuff like constantly shorting stuff then yeah yeah it can but here we go here offset mode minus 0.2 volt we're going to try and boot back into windows now 200 millivolts now i'm hoping that it'll crash because if it crashes i can show you guys what to do and essentially if it crashes your keyboard might not light up your mouse might not light up if it's got rgb on it um and in that case your motherboard nowadays with b450 x570 and b550 motherboards if it comes into an unstable overclock or an unstable undervolt essentially what it'll do is it'll reset for you so you can get in to the wow i'm actually very impressed that booted up absolutely fine we're going to load up cinebench r23 and cpu hardware id but your computer will automatically reset your bias but if it doesn't you can then go on the back of your computer hit the clear cmos button or you can take out the little circular battery inside the case make sure the power is turned off and it's drained and then you can put it in back in after a minute and that'll essentially just reset your bias at that stage you would have known that you've dropped the voltage way too far because usually you should get instability and it should kind of make it to the bios or just reset itself but if you go too low then essentially it'll it'll crap out where it won't even reset itself because the settings are too far off anyhow we're restarting this benchmark now at minus 200 millivolt and it's working and i'm i'm just i'm shocked we shouldn't get this this is actually incredible we see here 1.1 volt 47 watts and 4 gigahertz it did drop there momentarily that was kind of maybe maybe that's the limit maybe that's the limit maybe our minus 200 millivolts is a little bit too far we did see some kind of drop down there some anomaly there but we'll find out anyway once we get this under volt in we'll find out if it's unstable by again playing some games we'll save this profile in if it works and we can play some games but here it is here 47 watts we've dropped the temperatures down even more and hopefully our score still stays the same please fingers are crossed fingers are crossed i am hoping that that minus 200 millivolts is going to work and there it is we got near that 10 000 point score and we are now using even less power than we were before so minus 200 millivolts is looking relatively stable i'm going to say that this cpu is very close to its [Music] optimum level so it's very close to where it wants to be at in terms of getting that voltage for the four gigahertz however i want to try and get it to crash i want to try and get it to crash so i'm going to go even even crazy like here's crazy we're going even crazier we're going for a minus 250 millivolts under volt and uh if you for those guys out there you know this shouldn't be happening this just shouldn't be happening 250 millivolts actually huge uh this yeah i don't know why this is working even 200 millivolts is pretty crazy that's really good i'm actually already impressed with this but we're going to be mashing that delete and f2 key we're going to be making sure that we get it back into the bios and we're all good so here we are right here f7 we go to ai tweaker and we're going down to the under vault settings here and we're gonna go for 0.25 so minus 250 millivolt we're just going straight for it ladies and gentlemen we're just going straight for it we're going to get into it and we're going to see if this works i'm expecting it to crash i'm expecting the keyboard lights keyboard has lit up keyboards lighting up will we make it to windows that is a different question yeah and we've made it to windows i'm not i'm actually really surprised okay we're loading up cineventure 23 if something crashes while you do this say for instance you load up cinebench r23 it just crashes then you know you've got to give it a little bit more voltage but what we're going here for today is just we're going for that lowest level i actually want it to crash but it's not crashing and we're going to start this benchmark up we got cpu hardware id open once again and we're running this benchmark and we're at 43 watts so when you contrast that to what we initially had at the start of this video 70 watts we're going down now to 43 watts total package that's just a massive deal i think that's close to 40 percent drop in power consumption and we're only down 200 megahertz so that's i mean this is what it's all about when it comes to undervolting right here now keep in mind i do believe this cpu is a lucky sample you shouldn't be getting this good of an undervolt but this is incredible 43 or 44 watts and it looks like it's still just sailing through absolutely sailing through this benchmark right here and so we're going to get that final score and we're going to see that final score we're going to see if it's over 900 points then we know that everything is running absolutely fine and then we can restart the bios i restart into the bios and save this profile wow we we got over 10 000 points so we got the best score of any under volt with the craziest undervolt 44 watts maximum power consumption should we go for minus we're gonna go for minus 300 right now we are going for it we are going to just go ham on the f2 and delete keys but we're also going to go ham on this under vault it's funny though not many people say ham nowadays when it comes to undervaulting it's a sad thing i remember back in the day i was like everyone's i'm going ham man i'm going ham i'm going ham on ham and that was like that's pretty good go ham on him okay so our keyboard is no longer lighting up so this is the weirdest way for our pc to i guess crash is that we booted it up initially it worked fine but upon restarting our pc we actually it crashed it did didn't work so we're gonna hold our power button down now for just five seconds because it's crashed out we're going to restart the pc again if it doesn't boot up then we know that that 250 millivolt under volt was is actually unstable in the sense that the pc doesn't like it when it's booting up or restarting so for some reason we got to the windows and it ran fine and here we are now back in the bus so that's a crash that's what we're looking out for and the bill we were able to get back into the boss now and it it was basically we're teetering on the the level of instability here so 0.25 volt is too much in that it can run the benchmark as we saw before but it's getting too um too in too unstable and that we try to restart we try to do this and that and it didn't work properly so what we're going to now do is go back to 0.2 volt and we are going to save this as a user profile and we'll just call this under volts cpu and xm okay we'll just call this under uh under vault and xmp because there's not enough profiles here so we're gonna save that and then we're going to go to save changes and exit so we can see here we're changing it back from 0.25 to 0.2 and we're saving that in a profile so if we want to come back to this under vault in the future and give it some tweaking we can just load that up in the bus itself and then change some settings but now we're going to get it back into windows and essentially just run that benchmark for half an hour and after that we'll play some games and so this will take a little while i won't drag out the tutorial for two hours so we're gonna go do those things right now and we'll come back with a conclusion and now the final test was for us to run those stability tests and also play some games where i was playing apex legends for a little over an hour and we had not one hiccup so our minus 200 millivolts is our sweet spot for our ryzen 5 500 cpu and what we've seen here is a massive drop in power consumption but when we go back to those performance numbers we saw a very minor drop in performance be around two to three percent so we've got over a thirty percent drop in power and we've only got a three percent drop in performance so you can see here the benefits of undervolting are just massive to the point where not only are we going to be saving power now while we're using this cpu whether it's for gaming or doing work we're also going to be extending the life of that cpu extending the life of the motherboard or if you are on an extreme budget you can then save money and go for say an a320 motherboard and go with that race stealth cooler and go with even a more budget orientated power supply if we're going to undervolt our graphics card too which i will have a tutorial coming out very shortly for other components like radeon gpus rx 6700 xt we'll start on defaulting that and also the nvidia side of the fence the rtx and also intel's 12th gen cpu so we'll get under vaulting tutorials done for you because i believe they're very important now in 2022 and with that aside if you guys did enjoy today's tutorial then be sure to hit that like button for us and let us know in the comments section below what's your experiences with under vaulting have you been under vaulting is there any tips and tricks that you want to share with anyone in the comments especially people who are new to under vaulting and try and steer them in the right direction love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from martin byrne and they ask just got a 2080 ti fe founders edition brand new 600 us dollars did i get ripped off and i wouldn't say you got ripped off on that deal but at the same time i don't think it's a great deal where prices of gpus are coming down a lot especially on the used market there is going to be so many miners dumping gpus i feel very shortly due to the fact that crypto mining is pretty much not profitable anymore and the crypto just keeps dropping by the day so you will be able to get a really good deal i mean we're already seeing finally uh rtx 3060 ti's one of my favorite picks at msrp in the last year that's coming now under msrp on the used market so that's really good to see really good signs for gamers who have been waiting out to get a good deal but in sense of a 360ti i'd rather pick that up off the used market then go pay six hundred dollars for a 20 ti founders but keep in mind that the 2080i is still a great card for say if you're using adobe premiere pro and using it as a workstation gpu fantastic gpu there i just think you didn't get ripped off but you didn't exactly get a great deal hope that answers that question and without aside if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech guest content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you on another tech video very soon peace out for now [Music] but you'll always bye closed [Music]
