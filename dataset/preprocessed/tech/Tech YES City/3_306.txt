tonight tech yes citizens we're going to be building
a pc to play microsoft's new flight simulator now i've heard
that people are struggling to get the fps in this game they are
having problems and this has been going on for forever in flight simulators flight
simulators have always had problems getting really high fps so
don't be surprised that microsoft's 2020 flight simulator
isn't getting you the fps that you want like other potato games like
say for instance valeran or fortnite they're very easy because
there's not a whole lot going on in that game with the engine
as opposed to a flight sim with so many different variables
going on at the same time though if you've got fps
problems the first thing you can try and this is a big important part of
tonight's build is that we've got seven rgb fans in
total three at the front we're going to be putting one at the back
and then three on this 360 mil radiator which can be mounting at the top
so we all know if you're enthusiast tech we all know
rgb gives you more fps and it's going to be giving us more fps in this case
because we're using the i5 10 600 k and that's because flight simulators at
least the ones from microsoft have typically been
very single thread heavy and dependent though we will check that out once we
installed the game but i have a feeling the 10600k coupled
with the z490 aorus pro ax motherboard and 4 400
megahertz ddr4 memory is going to give us the best
shot at getting the best fps on this game but for the graphics card
with the rtx 2080 super here for morris and i'm hoping in this game at least the
this graphics card won't be the bottleneck
at least at 1080p but from what i'm hearing the cpu is the bottleneck in
this game so we're going to give it the best shot
it can and another thing as well aura sent over because they knew i was doing
a microsoft flight simulator gaming pc they sent over two nvme drives to put in
raid 0 because they've heard that these levels they've
got massive levels and they take a long time
to load so if you've got raid 0 that's going to speed up your load times
for all the levels within flight simulator now with that aside today's
video is sponsored by gigabyte and nvidia let's get on with this build
and then install flight sim [Music] and here is the finished product with
seven rgb fans ready to go now we've overclocked
the cpu to 5.1 gigahertz and then we've left it on overnight stress testing
as well as downloading all the games so i decided to download a couple more
games because your first month on the xbox
game pass pc is a dollar so that means you can play microsoft
flight simulator 2020 for one buck like it's actually a really
good deal right now anyhow it's finally time now to start
benchmarking this game okay we've got to download web
[Music] um okay so we've got to now download
another 91 gigabytes of storage after we downloaded the initial 150
gigabytes this is really weird uh yes uh hello
i've just come to australia and i've experienced your
for aussie internet so now this game is installed
we can go from a comparison here from all the way on the low preset to the
medium to the high end and then lastly to the ultra preset
what we can see here is that straight away low settings
is so taxing on this game it's incredible how taxing this game is on
not just your cpu but your gpu too this is a 2080 super it's being taxed at
60 percent and the graphics kind of look like on low settings at the very least
they look like something from back in 2010 so
if you can try to keep the settings on medium or above that's my
recommendation but still you will want to have high-end hardware
to get the most out of this game though if you've got the hardware and
you've got the ability to turn the graphics up and get a decent playable
experience then this game really does come to life
even just flying around in this plane on my beautiful home city of the gold
coast things like reflections off the windows
and then outside just the lights coming on really are reminiscent of
flying at night in a plane like it's scary
how sort of realistic this game can get however this is for me personally where
this game sort of does have that initial wow factor but
it's really is geared up towards someone who
is so enthusiastic about flying me personally i
sort of just benchmarked it for you guys i've built a pc up
but my passion doesn't lie in flying so i'm probably just gonna maybe jump into
this game for a couple more days and then i'm
pretty much done with it unless there's some really
cool sort of like jet fighter stuff that i can kind of get
into and maybe try and do some top gun stuff
and uh pretend like i'm back in the 1980s in that tom cruise film but if
someone's got like a top gun wingman package
i would love to check it out please link it in the description below
because i think that would be the most fun thing for me in this game or if
you've got some kind of dog fights that you can
have going on that would be really cool or if it's just
strictly flight simulators only because yeah i kind of just i get bored and then
i start trying to do tricks and i end up just
doing some really bad crashes like you're seeing on the screen
here the next up here is a game that took me by surprise if you guys
remember way back in the day there was the original mech warrior and i actually
played this on pc and then i went into a lot of different
other games as time went on and now i'm coming back to this all these
years later and there's mech warrior 5 aka mechwarrior 3015. now this game
has rtx and when i was asked by nvidia and gigabyte to do a pc build that
featured rtx i was kind of like well i want to play something that i actually
enjoy like the actual game before we even look
at rtx and this game really wasn't so enjoyable
and then if you want you've got the option to
turn on the rtx features which of course will drop the fps
at 1080p here when we go from high settings without rtx on to high settings
with rtx on we do drop a lot of fps roughly 30 but
of course we do gain visual fidelity from that
and it just makes the game just more immersive especially when there's a lot
going on and believe me in this game there is a lot going on it's extremely
difficult to play where you've constantly got to be moving
strafing left and right watching to make sure you don't overheat
and then making sure that you don't get
overheated by the enemies just laying into you too so even on like a
difficulty of one quarter this game is extremely difficult
so i really impressed with this i definitely want to play it more
after i'm finished up with this video because it's it's just that exciting
and there we have it with the flight simulator gaming pc
that has rgb it actually ran the game well from what i'm comparing it with
other videos out there and the 10600k at 5.1 gigahertz
this is overclocked and the memory speeds are clocked quite high
so if you guys are serious about playing flight simulator then you're probably
gonna have to be serious about the amount of money that
gets extracted from your wallet because this game is very taxing on the
cpu side of things and also on the gpu side too where even on low settings at
1080p it's still utilizing a lot of resources
from 2080 super but one thing i've straight away
realized from this game is you'll either want to keep the settings between medium
or ultra i find those two presets are the best in terms of visual experience
but then if you're in a really heavy city with lots of
cars moving and lots of stuff going on in big buildings
then it will tax the fps even on one of these setups
we had today which is kind of like the best hardware you can throw at it
and we were still going into like 30 fps where if we dropped it into medium
settings we then gained a lot more fps and then depending on the map so
when i was flying on the gold coast the fps was a lot better
so depending on the country and the flight route you take
you will get a lot more fps going down and dropping the settings
but then dropping down the settings to low showed us that the graphics between
low and medium the presets was absolutely huge so my
advice would be if you can stick to medium preset over low
and if you can also take it up to ultra then you're going to gain a bit more
visual fidelity over medium and then high end i found that was very
close to ultra but ultra didn't tax it a whole lot more
than the high settings though another thing i've learned from microsoft flight
simulator is that you should never ask me to be your pilot
because i'm hopeless at flying both in the pilot seat at least in this game
and when it comes to being a passenger irl i'm not a big avid
enthusiast of flying and it's funny because neither is dead man he's always
sort of just never really wanted to fly too much so
that said if you are getting into flying or you're a pilot then you can lose
yourself in this game for most likely days months or even
years because it is just massive where you can make your own
custom flight routes fly over different areas of the world
so it's definitely impressive what microsoft have done here with this game
in terms of the gameplay itself though the optimization of the game itself does
leave a little bit to be desired i see a lot of people comparing this
game to crisis on the internet and it definitely is similar in terms of
needing high-end hardware to run it properly
just like crysis did but if i look back at crisis 3 specifically
that game was very well optimized on the cpu side
at least from my memory where it would max out the gpu
at 100 a lot of the times even on ultra settings on this game i
couldn't see most the time my gpu sitting at 99
percent near 100 percent and so that means that there is a little
bit more to be desired in terms of optimization on the cpu side
and we've got a 10 600 k here overclocked to 5.1 gigahertz with some
high speed memory too so one thing about this game is if you do
want to get the most fps possible then you definitely want to get an
overclockable cpu combo with a good cooler and start getting
into the world of overclocking especially if you're going to sink
hours and hours of time into this thing then it will give you a nice sizable
boost so after that i jumped into the mech
3015 and that was a lot of fun especially the difficulty i found this
game very difficult to play like it had a lot going on
where if you're looking for a i guess a hard to play
mech game that's got the ray tracing involved
and it's got all the graphics and it looks really good and plays really well
then i can recommend this game it's definitely a lot of fun
and then because i'm on my first month of game pass i saw the new battle toads
there and i started to jump into that and
start playing that for a bit so the game's definitely on this
platform at least if you're going to join
for just say a three month stint you're going to get a lot
of value worth out of that game pass in the first three months at least anyway
so there's some really good games on the
platform they're not just cheap crappy games that no one's playing anymore
these are games that are really like in demand and have a high price tag so
it's good to see microsoft doing some good with not just flight simulator
but also the game pass itself anyhow if you guys enjoyed today's video then be
sure to hit that like button also if you want to build a pc similar to this
then i will leave some links in the description below for you and let us
know in the comment section below have you played
microsoft's flight simulator 2020 yet if so what did you think of it
are you into flying yourself unlike me love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always just like this question of the day here which comes from mario stabik
and they ask hi i have a question is it worth
to upgrade from the 750 ti to the gtx 1050 ti
i have a feeling that is not much of a difference and at first i was going to
say no but then i thought about it a bit
more and the temper ti is actually a sizeable upgrade over the
750 ti though i wouldn't go out and pay market
rates for a 1050 ti because they're currently in my opinion
quite overpriced where a lot of people at least where i live
are just going out and buying 1650 supers
brand new off the shelf because a lot of people are trying to ask too much for a
1050 ti so if you can get one for a really good
deal locally whether it's off a friend or off someone
in the marketplace locally where you are then you can snap it up and you will get
a sizeable boost but if you're looking for market rate prices i'd either stick
to say an rx 470 which can be really cheap on the used
market or go with the 1650 super because i'm guessing you're going with a
750 ti or a 1080 ti you've probably got a rig that doesn't
have a high powered sue in there or a leaser in there and you um are
looking to looking just to get a quick and easy
upgrade so hopefully that answers that question
and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that content you want to
see at the moment it drops monitors just run out again that's a
weird one that's two videos in a row now if you want to see the content the
moment it drops be sure to hit that sub button and ring that bell
and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now
