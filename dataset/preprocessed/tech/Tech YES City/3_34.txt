today we're going to be building up four budget gaming pcs and i'm in a bit of a rush here because i got to move some of this stuff and clearing out stuff with the tech yeah studio but if you guys are looking for ideas to build cheap gaming pcs then hopefully this video will serve you well where the first one we had here was we picked this up it's an i7 47 90 and 16 giga ram and a motherboard we got this with a water cooler as well for a hundred bucks so that's a very cheap bare bones combo i have cleaned it up it was extremely filthy but we couple that in with say an rtx 3050 case ssd hard drive power supply we're now gaming for pretty cheap now we've also got this right here this is an i7 uh 3820 x 79 motherboard we picked this up we actually got two of these combos for 70 dollars each so that's aussie dollars by the way so that would make it around say 50 usd and what i'm going to do is add 16 gigabytes of ram i got to add a cooler to this and i'm also thinking about coupling with either an rtx 3050 or going on the used market seeing what gpus are cheap because again we're going to put some pcs together and then the fourth pc will just be another b85 combo where we picked up a motherboard and cpu for pretty cheap so let's go hit the road see what kind of gpu deals we can score because kind of the rest of the components i have picked up in the past have scored some really good deals on and we're going to make some magic happen never pay full price for windows 10 or 11 again but today's video sponsor scd keys you can get activated as little as 15 using that coupon bftyc links in description below [Music] so we just picked up three different graphics cards here the first being a gtx 1070 ti we got this for 250 aussie dollars and they also threw in a corsair 275 white case because they said they were upgrading their stuff so that was a really good deal in my opinion the next one we got was the 1660 super we picked this up for 300 aussie dollars and then the last deal was a 1063 gigabyte we got this for 200 now i'm thinking this is a little bit expensive but the good thing about all three of these deals were they were all local within 15 minutes drive of my place and so that makes the convenience factor right up there but do let us know in the comment section below do you think these are good prices for used gravis guards and with that aside we're going to get back to the tech air studio and get our hustle on and now that we're back at the tech yeah studio we are going to peace out now four builds almost immediately where we've got this one here x79 we're gonna couple that with a 1660 super a snowman cooler and also the snowman coolers nowadays they're not coming with the x79 brackets but when i bought them back in the day i i managed to keep some of these x 79 brackets so sometimes especially if you're dealing with a lot of pc parts sometimes it's good to keep those spares because they can come in handy at a later date then we've got for this a 120 gigabyte ssd two terabyte hard drive and then we're going to be using a uh rgb 60 case for this build and hopefully in total we'll get around 800 aussie for it so minus 300 for the gpu minus 70 20 or 20 20. yeah in my head i'm making profit still but i'm going to be doing these at pretty competitive prices here locally and that's one of the things when i go through this stuff now that a lot of this stuff has been sitting on my shelves for a while i know how much i pay for the stuff in terms of a maximum threshold and that's why i always stick to discipline and always recommend if you guys are buying and selling anything not just pc parts but anything really always stick to that discipline because if you're holding on to too much and you manage to get a heap of good deals at one stage you're always going to not be losing money in the process and i think that's the most important thing for me here is that i've stuck to my discipline i know how much i'm prepared to pay maximum for certain pc parts and that's going to actually help me now in terms of now that i've got to get ready to go to japan i want to just move a lot of stuff and so this is a tech yes fire sale but let's get the first pc built up then on the third then on to the fourth [Music] [Music] so our first build is complete however this one took a little bit longer than usual because initially we couldn't get the quad channel memory to work and then i also noticed when i tried to put the 1660 super in it just wouldn't give out a signal and so that's usually especially around this error x79 it's usually a really early bios that's just not properly configured for compatibility with various parts so i went to update the bios and within the bios there was more problems where you couldn't actually update the bios because gigabytes update utility on this motherboard with the early bios revision just didn't work properly so then we had to make a usb bootable and then that fixed the job and after that the graphics card and the quad channel memory works perfectly the next pc now is going to be what i call the main lead generator this one is going to come in with i think the best aesthetics and then we're also then from that gonna put up a pretty juicy pc so rtx 3050 i7 4770 or 47.90 i got to check what's inside this motherboard it's going to be liquid cooled it's going to have a ssd hard drive and we're going to add in these three thermaltake ring fans that actually got given to me because there was a faulty commander so the commander apparently doesn't work with the usb software just doesn't connect properly it's faulty but apparently the fans still power up they still look fine so it's just going to be essentially static rgb but that's not going to be a problem because we're just going to be making this pc just look good and then from that if we get a lot of interest it sells well then we can use that to say hey we've got this pc that's a little bit cheaper would you be interested in it so let's start building the lead generator [Music] so [Music] [Music] so here we are now our lead pc is all finished everything is running pretty smoothly except these two fans they are getting really loud so i'm probably going to go on the bios and tune them both down a little bit other than that the thermaltake fans are running absolutely fine and we have a build we can finally put up and start generating some leads so we're actually going to list this before we build the next pc and now our next build is the gtx 1070 ti but you may also notice this case right here is actually a pc that i built up for my mom years and years ago and because i recently bought her a all-in-one touchscreen pc in the used parts hunt she just said look uh copy the files over and you can just use this pc and i'm thinking well yeah it's time to use this pc and utilize it with a 1070 ti so this build all up is going to owe me uh 300 because it replaced the all-in-one and then it's also going to owe me 250. so 550 in total is what this build owes me and that's with a 1070 ti and an i7 so all we got to do is get cleaning up and this one could be a decent tidy profit [Music] so we've got a bit of a problem here and that is this pc was initially having some a little bit of boot problems and so what i did was i unplugged all the usb ports and that kind of fixed it but now in windows the keyboard would cut out the mouse and cut out and i thought oh okay is the motherboard on its way out but then i tried an individual usb card add-on with power directly from the power supply and that's giving out the same symptoms where the keyboard just isn't lighting up it's cutting in and out and so this basically means that the power supply is uh on its way out so we're going to have to change the power spline this build keyboard is lining up absolutely fine everything is working perfectly we can do the spam test with the keyboard just to make sure and i mean we're copying files at the moment so this is working really well it was the power supply and a faulty power supply is actually a really rare thing so i'm guessing that's why you think that's why my mom was like yo brian i want a new pc why don't you get me something little did she tell me that she was going to dump some problems my way but that's fine we've fixed this one we're going to finish up this pc now then we're on to the next and just when you thought there was no more problems we did a quick stress test and the gpu is going up to over 90 degrees almost instantly i'm glad this thing still works to be honest so what we're going to do right now is change the thermal paste around on this gpu desperately needs a thermal paste change usually temperature is going that high that quickly is i mean gaming on it for long periods of time sure but usually that's a crypto 24 7 job so i hope i didn't buy this off a crypto miner so what we can see here is there's actually no thermal paste uh covering the middle of the gpu die which is extremely bizarre but regardless of that we're gonna fix this real quick and now we are on the final pc to build out here this is going to be originally it was going to be x79 uh the same as the one that we had before same motherboard and everything except i think the motherboard that we had before i fixed that in a dumpster dive where it got given to me that the pci bracket was all mounted up and this one here i paid money for this one and it already had a i7 38 20. so we're going to put that aside because we have a brand new case here that i didn't even know where this came from but it's already got a 400 watt uh cougar power supply in it which is gonna be perfect for a 1063 gig build and then we're just going to use this msi board with mismatched memory and an i7 4770 so this should turn out okay same deal as last time as well 120 gigabyte ssd and one terabyte hard drive it's time to play for the final the finale hopefully we don't run into any problems like those last three pcs [Music] our final pc is now complete kind of i've still got to add some rgb to the front of the case here i'm going to do that in the morning because we came into yet another problem with this pc and that was to do with the gravis card and also one of the ram sticks so we've changed the ram stick over we have uh also cleaned out the back ports of this graphics card with wd-40 because initially what would happen is it would install and show a signal before the drivers but then after you installed the drives you'd give a black screen so i was actually quite concerned when that happened but then i had to look at the ports at the back i saw they're a little bit rusty and i thought okay we'll give this a go and that sure enough fixed it i mean whether the seller knew about that and tried to do a hose job is a different story but in the end the result is at least that the card's working the pc is working we've got four pcs they're finally working and uh let's close this sucker off so we now completed four pcs and what you guys saw here today was just me juggling problems and this is what it's like with used pc parts if you guys want to sort of get into this gig you can get some extremely good deals but a lot of the time those deals are going to be off the back of having to fix things that a lot of people aren't comfortable fixing and in today's video like we saw four pcs they all had their own individual unique problems and i think the most bizarre was the power supply just on its way out and then it made it look like it was the motherboard that was the problems and so over time especially over time i've learned just through trial and error what to do and how to try these things these quick things to try and fix these problems and it ends up in the end i get a fully working product that finishes and runs the stress test absolutely fine but it's still a bit of a hassle going through all the motions when you get into it and you want four pcs to work and just you you're planning for just four straight sets smooth sailing and every single step of the way you're just coming into a problem coming into a problem coming into a problem and i guess that's just what it's like uh when you're building used pcs but the good thing is today we had a success we're going to flip these pcs now keep moving keep moving i do still have some mainly i've got a lot of motherboards still and cpus and ram especially on the ddr3 side so my plan is to move as much as that as possible before i go to japan so i am kind of selling out all my stuff here i do want to kind of not just have a clean slate which i will have in japan but i you know when i come back to australia i want to have a clean slate as well so because paying all these prices and then say coming back even a few months later the market can change so quickly for instance i'm even seeing now locally rtx 3050s are under msrp retailers that's not even with ebay sales or anything like that rtx 3060s are now down just a hair above 500 aussie dollars and so these graphics card prices are coming down they're continuing to come down and we haven't even seen the mass flood from miners yet and so i'm kind of expecting by september that's when we'll see a massive flood from the miners flooding their gpus onto the market and so you do have to be mindful of that if that does happen you'll see some extremely cheap gpus i've even heard of some people picking up locally here rtx 3060s for 400 aussie dollars so that's even below the us msrp of 329 so it's starting to happen and it's starting to happen very fast so for me personally i'm like okay well i want to just want to move as much of this stuff as possible and i'm being very competitive with my pricing and even if i'm making 50 it doesn't matter better profits a bit of profit because you've got to readjust and you can then move into the new market and make some new profit for instance with that rtx 3060 pc i got that in the deals hunt recently i've got that 3060 i also picked up the ryzen parts and stuff like that i made uh a pure 350 profit on that build so that was just an easy flip going into the new market getting the new deals but anyway guys with today's video i thought i'd just show you a different side of sort of behind the scenes what goes on with tech yeah city i've actually gotta move and get ready now to go to japan because it is a hundred percent confirmed that i will be going there was a lot of medical stuff i had to do not just get the visa but i then had to check out all this medical stuff and get that done and so it was actually i guess in hindsight it's going to sound a bit weird it's actually a good thing that i got covered so the irony the irony is rich sometimes and this time it's rich in my favor so that's sometimes you get unlucky with things and sometimes you just get lucky with other things so everything works out in the end i guess so it looks like tech yes is definitely heading to japan and that's why i'm sort of in a rush we're going to be getting these deals we're going to be picking things up we're just going to be moving in 100 miles an hour but hopefully as well when we get to japan it's going to be a lot of used parts just waiting for me to snap up and see what kind of deals we can get anyhow guys i hope you enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite piece of today's video love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from jerker hudak and they ask what do you use for cleaning the monitors so when it comes to cleaning monitors i use alcohol wipes and then after that i can use a microfiber cloth something like that to just dry off the alcohol straight away so it's just basically clean clean it clean it clean it and then straight away clean off all the uh moisture and way you go you'll have a very clean monitor after doing that i generally don't use multi-purpose spray on monitors one of the main reasons is that it just reacts with some of the chemicals i find on the screen like for instance if some people have previously used alcohol to clean a monitor and then use multi-purpose spray it's just going to be just like an absolute smudge fest it does take a while to clean in that case so that's why i always use just alcohol wipes on monitors so that's why i stick to that i don't use multi-purpose spray because you don't know the history of that monitor and of course if the monitor is new then you're not going to need to clean it too so anyhow guys hope that answers that question and i will catch you in another tech video very soon if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then you may wish to hit that sub button ring that bell and also if you want to hit the join button for as little as a dollar a month get behind the scenes access here tech yes city to some behind the scenes vlogs with that aside i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music]
