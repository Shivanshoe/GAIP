what is crack-a-lacking pop a lot and also smoking and joking tech yes citizens because today we have the used pc parts hunt of the month and we are up here in brisbane city and i have some really good personal news and that is i got my visa to go to japan that is approved so i'm working out the details now there's a lot like it's like fort knox australia i've gotta figure things out on all the logistics side but in speaking of logistics we've had those graphics card prices come right down this month and it's caused a bit of a mayhem at least the new prices are sort of leading to the used prices having to react and that's exactly what we're doing today but the first deal we have managed to organize is an rtx 3060 strix and they wanted initially 650 aussie dollary dues and i'll also put up those us dollar redux for you guys as well so you get an idea of how much i'm paying for this stuff but then i put in an offer of 600 they accepted so we're gonna go pick that up a little bit later and being a strix model of course it's usually the king ding-a-ling of uh graphics card models in that particular model but then we've got the next deal that we're organizing is a motherboard a b450 gigabyte gaming motherboard they wanted 50 aussie dollars for this i put an offer of 40 but they've so far just said yes it's available and i'm like what's your address i'll come get it so hopefully they'll get back to me while i'm up in brisbane but speaking of being up in brisbane we are now just around the corner from lez's place we are going to go check in on him and see if he has any good deals for tech yes citizens [Music] [Applause] sometimes you look in the bottom right hand of your screen and you see this activate windows please and you're thinking well how can i get this done for as cheap as possible with today's video sponsor std keys you can get it done for as little as 15 using that coupon code bftyc links in description below so we ended up just finishing up at lez's place and he had some really interesting products this month where he does have the usual oem stuff but i decided like i've already got a heap of monitors now and a heap of oem stuff that i've been picking up from various different places so i don't really need any more of the oem stuff except he had this all-in-one dell desktop machine and it had a really nice screen on it it's touch screen and it just looks really nice and so i figured well my mum she could use an upgrade in terms of a nice pc on her desk because she always complains to me she's like look i want a nice clean pc she actually doesn't want a gaming pc believe it or not because i built her a gaming pc and she's sort of like she doesn't really use a graphics card put it that way she just uses a pc for solar tear browsing the web emails and uh just watching facebook or something like that so she doesn't need much and so this thing has a six gen i5 6500 500 gigabyte ssd eight gig of ram i just said this thing will be perfect and we ended up getting that for 300 aussie dollars and les wanted 320. so i knocked him down just 20 bucks and then he also had a z170 a gigabyte gaming motherboard and so this ended up uh he ended up initially wanting 80 bucks for it i offered him 50 and he took that so that's a nice board sometimes i come into i7 6700 for really good prices but i never have the boards and so i always know to get if i come across a z170 and it's a decent price to pick it up and then the last deal he had was this acer aspire he kind of checkmated me into getting this if i was getting good deals on the other stuff i had to buy this ace or aspire so this had an i7 2600 it looks hideous and it has eight gigabytes of ram and a one terabyte hard drive and he wanted 124 i said no way i'll give you 80 for this and then he came back and said look let's meet in the middle and i said no we're going to meet in the middle more my way so we did 90 aussie dollars on this one so that's three items in the kitty so far but right from here on in we've got the rtx 3060 strix lined up so we're gonna go pick that up uh there was also another deal just got a message then another deal about the ryzen 5 30 2600 they wanted 200 i put down 140 then they agreed but they're wanting to meet me at a park and then they're like canceling that oh mate i won't meet you to park i'll meet you here i'm thinking to myself what is this bizarre behavior just wanting to meet me at all these places so i'm just going to give that a miss even though the price is decent on the cpu i'm just going to give that a miss i really like sort of erratic behaviors kind of it screams to me a hose job so we just picked up the rtx 3060 strix and when i got there they had it in the box and of course it's just protocol asked them to take it out of the box show me it all and it was all there so sometimes people i haven't been hosed this way personally but i have heard stories of people picking up graphics cards and then they get home with the box and they open it up and it's like a gtx 460 and they're like hey i was meant to buy a 1080 ti here so you don't want to be that person but in terms of other deals we're going to head back to the headquarters right now and i'm going to recoup because a lot of these people like they message me and it was just weird i put out so many different feelers on deals but just people were like yes it's available i'm like okay what time where's the place never got back to me or it was just like hey do you want to meet us at a playground oh it's just parts hunting put it this way parts hunting never gets boring [Music] we're now back at the tech yes studio it is a bit late at night but i had to flip that uh pc the one with the 1080 ti which we did recently in a video where i think i overpaid for that at least when we compare it now to what the market is offering and that's that money there so we fixed that mistake and i believe in the process i made 40 dollars i put it up for 1080 in the end because i just thought 1080ti 1080 or 1080 ti 1080 and then we ended up getting a thousand and ten so maybe it's only worth the gt that's that money aside we fixed that mistake though and that's what like that's what that video was about me fixing my mistakes that i had sitting here at the moment they're moving into this new market and so this is what the new market is offering for me here at least locally that is an rtx 3060 600 aussie that's a strix and also tomorrow we've lined up a 30 60 ti for 650 so these cards are cheap and they're not like i feel in the short term prices may rise up a little bit mainly because you're gonna have a massive influx of gamers that have been sitting and waiting for prices to come down and now they've substantially come down they'll just want to get something to game on so there'll be that initial influx of gamers perhaps it'll pick up a little bit and pricing then it'll come down a little bit later as the crypto miners face the pain but in the meantime of course i can do some good flipping on gaming pcs and that's exactly what i'm gonna do even though i've kind of i gotta get ready to go to japan too so i also was speaking to my boy for a couple of hours tonight too so that was a long long couple of hours of no deals hunting but rightfully so and then we've got this pc from les this thing like do let me know in the comments do you just think this thing is it's like one of the most hideous looking pcs i've seen like seriously a dell optiplex i think looks better than this pc right here that's how bad this thing looks but uh anyway when we put a keyboard and monitor and mouse with it it kind of washes out the picture so people like and if you put the price you know if you make a really good budget gaming pc and the price is right then it'll sell but and then the all-in-one i've already surprised my mom with that she is absolutely loving it and i thought she would and it's just always cool to just i don't know and i haven't even checked the price on ebay yet i'll probably check the price in the morning on what they go for on the market but seriously a touch screen as good as that one was when i tried it i was impressed with the capacitive capacitance is that the right word the capacitance of that monitor and just how well it responded in terms of the touch screen and that's what impressed me the most was how good the monitor was but also how good the touchscreen worked on it too so again wasn't really worried about the specs so much it had decent specs for solar tear and office but it was so much the functionality on was extremely impressive so that was a good little pickup i think do let us know in the comment section below though what you guys think of that all in one do you think it was a decent deal or not though it is really late at night i need some tech yes sleep in order to get that tech yes energy to continue this parts on tomorrow [Music] so we just now ended up picking up the 30 60 ti and i got to say gpu prices are finally coming down to normal levels normal levels is what i'd call it and i'm sort of happy that the normal like yeah what if what if prices become under msrp well that's when i'm starting to get really excited now we're back at the tech yes studio and we've looked around on facebook gumtree scoured the market and there's just really no [Music] and here we are now with the final score of the evening and this is a ryzen 5 1600 af and that's the better one than the ae it's basically a ryzen 5 2600 and then we've got a six gigabytes of 3600mhz memory and also a b450 aorus elite and the cooler as well so all up we got this for 250 aussie dollars they had the listing up to 300 i put in the offer of 250 they came back at 270 but then i just stuck to 250 and that was i just said that was my max and so they accepted and what we're looking at now is really if we look at this right here say for instance we've got this 30 60 strix and if you guys saw just even just a video ago we had that 1080 ti system we flipped that and decided okay instead of uh sitting on that and potentially losing more money we've then just converted what we did there into this right here because this pc right here if i'm putting a gaming pc together this should cost me just under a thousand dollars as well i should be able to put something like this for together for a similar price as that pc and so what we see here is we're going to have a much more contemporary system and it's going to be worth more on the market than the 1080 ti system and the fourth gen i7 so this is uh really what is about here tech yet city got to move fast keep on your toes but also you guys probably wondering what the total for the month is and i'll put the tally up on the screen this month's deals we did score a lot of different epic deals this month though my favorite would have been i'm going to be a little bit weird but i'm going to say that all in one pc it's probably like what brian you've got all this other really cool stuff and you're liking the all-in-one pc it's probably yeah i just haven't used an all-in-one pc for that long so but the real reason i was impressed with that was just so much the touch screen and the glossy screen together it was just absolutely amazing that touch screen i think that's what won me over with that deal but do let us know in the comments what you guys think was the best deal your favorite deal of this month but also you may be wondering what's the go with the used market brian let's get in the hot seat and talk more about that and so i think what we're seeing right now is the used market i think it's a little too early i got in a little bit too early this month where we did pick up some deals but i think if we look at say an rtx 3080 and we type that search term in there's still people sitting there with their used rtx 3080s and whatnot and the retail prices are now cheaper than those 3080s but i guess some of those people will get a bit of a shock when they're like why is my 3080 getting no interest at all and they check the retail price and they're like whoa what just happened and so i'm sort of when that happens you'll see prices of all these uh used components go down because if i'm looking on ebay as well at the moment there's pretty much just sales on a lot of different stuff there's like 12 700 k's there's 12 600 kf's 12 400 f's and 10 700 s all this new stuff is definitely going to put pressure on the used stuff to go down in price and so the new market at the moment looks like it's definitely leading the way in fixing the pricing especially on the used market so sometimes it can be the reverse the used market will fix the pricing on the new market if it goes too out of control and there's lots of used parts going around but this time around it looks like it's the opposite and i think a lot of the deals that i saw up on facebook marketplace there was just some really just crap pricing on a lot of stuff where i was seeing some i5s and motherboards for 200 and it's like why would you even want to bother with that kind of stuff and then this ryzen deal was actually one of the only few decent deals that i saw in terms of cpus and motherboards and of course the person was happy to make a deal with us but recently i have been contacted behind the scenes getting the news for you guys i'm definitely going to be on the front lines this year telling you guys what is up and i'm going to try and take the role of not a journalist i'm going to be a a hustler but hopefully it is just a weird scenario one that i'm going to be staying positive trying to ride through any way i can so if you guys are enjoying these used parts hunts if you're just enjoying the content in general as well be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comments section below what you think of the market right now i know there's the us market people are starting to tell me that prices are starting to drop there so it does look like for some reason australia was kind of leading the way in these gpu price drops but hopefully you'll see that trickle around the rest of the world because i know there's some people in different countries and they're like gpu prices haven't dropped here yet and they're getting a bit frustrated but it looks like that'll fix itself sooner or later but don't worry patience is key it's just like last year when i told one of the viewers manny to sell his vegas 64 for a high price into the crypto market he would have been having an absolute wonderful time now where he could have turned that vega 64 into already a 30-70 ti so that's kind of like a magic trick that i've never seen before but that's one that manny is now comfortable doing and uh he's become a magician though also before i get on out here we've got the question of the day which comes from smile sue with the japanese katakana and they asked wouldn't it be cheaper to buy the og cooler for that 1080 ti instead of a custom one and this comes from the recent video we did with the 1080 ti where we had to flip that asap and that one came with the water block and so that's why i put the morpheus on that because basically with models especially these um custom pcb models of gravis cards in this case the custom model pcb 1080 ti i believe it's a custom pcb if it's not then if it's a reference you might be able to use a different cooler but if in this case i believe it was a custom pcb so if you try and use another 1080 ti air cooler from a different model then it most likely just won't fit because the 1080 ti's were so big and so compact with vrm custom cooling that it's just i've tried it in the past trust me it just doesn't work most the time sometimes it can work rarely but you've mainly got to match the exact air cooler to that exact pcb and so in this case it's a water block so we're kind of out of luck there so hopefully that answers that question and with that aside if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to sub and smash that bell to get the videos as soon as they drop and also if you want some behind the scenes access where we recently uploaded a video going more into the economics and for as little as a dollar a month become a tech yes behind the scenes member and i will catch you guys in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] oh [Music]
