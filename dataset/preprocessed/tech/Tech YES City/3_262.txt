i want my rtx well chances are you're not getting one i had the rtx 3070 dual oc launch video ready for you guys last night at nda lyft but then i was like if something was bothering me i was like no i'm just to wait until the product launches for the end consumer to see what's going on and to at least before we get into this review update the situation on stock and pricing and whatnot and it appears that the same thing has happened with the 3070 that's happened with the 3080 that's happened with the 30 90. and the only way i can see this at the moment is instead of having eight gates going into wonderland you've only got two gates going in but you've also got all these people that suddenly want to go to wonderland and the problem is is that you're going to have a massive queue and so there's that problem right there even though amd have just announced their competing cards it still doesn't matter people just want their rtx 3000 series cards and what i can see at the moment is there will be a few models that will be coming in at msrp this being one of them that's the azus juul but there are other models there that the pricing at least in australia people asked me to update the pricing and they tagged me on twitter and stuff like that and what you're seeing with this pricing is an rtx 3070 in some places of the world say strix for example will cost more even than an entry-level rtx 3080 which really should not be happening and that's not to do with like it's not nvidia's fault and a lot of times it's not the retailer's fault it's actually there's called distributors and a lot of these guys in a lot of different places around the world they're milking that supply chain at the moment and they know because they know demand's so high they're like look we can charge the retailers more for these cards and then the retailers then have to pretty much buck the cost because they've got people who really want to get their hands on the rtx 3000 so that's kind of what's going on if you do see um prices with problems don't go out and straight away just go the retail is ripping me off because it's a lot of times not the retailer's fault and in fact you can see cards coming in at least in australia i saw our cards up for decent prices like there was one up for 809 aussie dollars on pre-order and so if you get in with a pre-order now you'll i guess have a better chance of getting a card sooner than later however with that update aside when these cards do come in back into stock and you can buy one for around the price that i'm saying in this video and you want to go and buy one how is the zeus jewel going to perform now this is not the oc version that's a i guess i'm so used to saying dual oc that i actually had to when i did the original recording i was like damn did i say dulo c because that's what i'm used to testing with these dual cards but this is the not oc and when we pull up the 1080p numbers for you guys we can see that it's coming a little bit behind that of the founders edition so i expect if you do get your hands on oc versions of the rtx 3070 for example then it's going to perform pretty much around the level of the founders card and moving through the 1080p numbers and then onto the 1440p numbers shows the same trend where it's just coming that little bit behind in all the titles that we tested here and then showing you guys the 4k numbers showed the same story now of course is coming very close to that of the 2080 ti trading blows with that of the previous flagship 1200 us card and so the value here is extremely good now there is some worry about the 8 gigabyte frame buffer and basically if you're gaming at 1440p high refresh rates i feel this is where this card is going to be best suited where 4k the 8 gigabytes of vram could cause some troubles for you even in say a year's time especially with the consoles coming out with 16 gigabytes available with at least the ones that are targeted towards 4k and then we've also got amd's option which will be coming in with 16 gigabytes of vram 2. so one of the most important factors about buying a car especially if you want to get one around msrp is you're probably worried about the cooling performance and subsequently the weight and how big that cooler is and here is where we've got a card that weighs in over one kilogram so similar to that in weight of the founders card however the measurements are a bit bigger on all three dimensions so if you do want to mount this in a mini itx case then you will have to be aware of these which i'll put up on the screen for you it does have a metal back plate and on the rear you've got three display port outs and two hdmi outs then you've got two 92 millimeter fans and these do a pretty good job of cooling where i've measured on the performance mode which is the default mode out of the box i measured temperatures coming in under that of 70 degrees out of the box at 73 fan speeds which this seems like the sweet spot for the cooling versus the noise and then if you switch it onto quiet mode the temperatures will get a bit hotter so i personally actually like leaving it in quiet mode but then under vaulting the card where i'm going to say this pretty much in every 3000 series card that comes through here i would suggest undervolting where you're saving quite a substantial amount of power but at the same time you're also keeping your card cooler and quieter so switching to the quiet mode and under vaulting do go hand in hand perfectly for this graphics card right here the zeus dual and so you will taste some very good temps versus noise even on an msrp card so if you want to go the other way with overclocking this is where the zeus dual won't be as good at least as the founders card that came through here where it was a little bit more limited so i would suggest either leaving it out of the box on the performance bias mode or dropping it down with an under vault and switching to quiet mode where both will be very good though i do heavily recommend under vaulting other features unique to this card include some subtle rgb lighting on the inner space of the card and there's a stainless 304 input output shield where you've got three display port outs and two hdmi 2.1 now the hdmi 2.1s you do get an extra one on the zeus cards from what i'm seeing even on the msrp entry level cards versus the standard founders and a lot of the other cards too all the other cars that have come through here have had those standard three display port outs and only a single hdmi 2.1 out so i do like that azusa is adding that extra hdmi 2.1 especially since a big factor at least for me a big plus side of the 3000 series cards is the fact that they can get 4k 120 hertz 10 bit and gaming at this is an absolutely incredible experience even if you're gaming on those competitive games that are easy to run this will definitely do the job at 4k 120 hertz so depending on the settings of course now talking about the ray tracing performance on the rtx 3070 joule it's pretty much the same as the rtx 3070 founders so if you want to put on ray tracing at least at 4k max settings it's not really going to be happening even on the 3090 but i will say one thing fort nightmares that's this latest update that's rolling around it looked incredible with ray tracing on and i'm not going to downplay that but if you want to have ray tracing on i would have some more realistic expectations of lowering the resolution and also the settings and the final thing to mention on the rtx 3000 series is you do get better productivity scores than that of the rtx 2000 series which was already really good in some applications you've got that rtx studio driver and you've got that updated end bank encoder as well as av01 decode and with all the numbers and explanation of the features out of the way you're wondering should i buy the rtx 3070 zeus dual is this the one for me and to answer that is do you want a card that's going to come around msrp at least when it comes back into stock and you're not getting gouge for it and the answer for me is a big yes that's because even though it was slightly inferior to the founders card i feel like this card right here is actually going to be in stock where i'm hearing the founders cards are going to be in very limited supply so if you can get a founder's card for msrp then i'd definitely hit that up but if you can't then this card right here is going to do a really good job of delivering especially if you want to undervolt then you're going to have a whisper quiet card that's pulling in just over 130 watts and at the same time you've got a car that looks sleek it's simple and it's got the extra output at the back which could come in handy anyhow guys i hope you enjoyed today's review if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us and let us know in the comment section below what do you think of this card right here love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and the last thing i will talk about before i get on out of here is the pre-order thing at least in australia you can pre-order cards my 30-80 pre-order has come through i've woken up really early this morning and we're going to start vlogging that for the 100 flip up challenge i'm going to go up it's about a 50 minute drive for me so i'm going to go up and pick that up where the person's message me is like do you want me to ship it out to you and i'm like no i'm going to go pick this up because it's a i guess it's one of those things where you got to be patient and eventually it will come through and i will explain that more in the 100 flip up challenge but in the meantime here at tech yes city if you want to see the content as soon as it drops then don't forget to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
