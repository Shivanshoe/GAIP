[Music] okay okay hi everyone my name is fruit and welcome to today's video where we got it we gotta talk we gotta address something anything something actually there is something if you're worried about the title well good let me explain it's it's high time for change my friends nye is the time for change change is in the air the winds bring change change orders change okay i'm kind of messing around joking but this is actually kind of a big deal which is why i needed you guys here to hear this from me this will probably make a lot of you unsubscribe do i have your attention yet because it's true here's what's happening this channel is going to be unlike what it's been for jesus eight years i have had a lot of people reach out comment complain address and air their concerns about what the fudge is going on with this channel because if you look back through the past month month and a half however long there's been mainly destiny like 98 and so that's why i'm here [Music] i'm sorry because i've created a brand new channel ah another one mr fruit long story but i'll try and do my best to get through it in a second i've created mr fruit plays a brand new channel where all variety is going to be posted meaning this channel is going to stay shooters think destiny overwatch especially overwatch 2 when that comes out i did call of duty pretty much every battle royale and everything that isn't a shooter is now going to be on mr fruit plays so we do more among us i know some of you like omogas trouble and terrorist tap that's all gonna be there game nights indie games essentially everything that i would normally upload to this channel that wasn't a shooter is gonna live over there and i'm kind of spicing up the content doing some new stuff with it i already have a couple videos already lined up through the pipeline i think you guys are gonna really like it i hope you guys watch so that's what i wanted to say if you go over there right now there is a brand new video there's an eldering video i hope you guys enjoy and it's important that this brand new channel essentially hits the ground running because that's kind of the problem that i'm having currently with this channel we are in a unique spot where i have a lot of subscribers and i'm very thankful we have 2.2 million subscribers that's a lot of people but the devil's in the details those 2.2 million are spread across so many different kind of viewers people who like x but don't like y people who only watch z so on and so forth because we have 30 30 over 3 300 i'm not even sure we have a lot of videos on this channel and that's a lot of games and different content that we've covered that has attracted a lot of different people and a lot of viewing habits for most people are they like one thing they expect that one thing and they're gonna watch that one thing looking at you among us back when i started this channel and as i've always done content i've always preferred to do variety it's my passion i'm just not the kind of person who can do one thing play one game i wish i was my life would be a lot easier but i'm not and creatively it doesn't challenge me i like to journey through the landscape of gaming and content and when destiny initially popped off for the channel and we built momentum off of that you know but as i leaned into it and as we grew i pretty quickly was like this is not what i want to do for the foreseeable future i want to do different stuff so i double uploaded an added variety here and there because my goal is always to get people to watch whatever we make because it's just entertaining regardless of the content but that's not how everybody watches videos or wants to consume content so with a whole bunch of algorithmic changes and viewer habits what's ended up happening is we've just kind of fallen out of favor from the youtube gods i've been paying attention to this and it haunts me every day whether or not i look at the analytics so i've tried just what feels like just about everything under the sun on this channel to try and switch things up oh we're just kind of struggling and that's fair this job is all about valleys hills valley's hills it's just currently we're in the deepest valley we've we've ever been in so it's time to switch things up i'm hoping to make it so that when a viewer comes to one of my channels sees content they like they can subscribe knowing what to expect so if somebody subscribes to this mr fruit channel odds are they're a shooter fan and then they know moving forward that there's going to be shooter content or more of what they came here for like destiny or when overwatch 2 releases or a battle royale i enjoy in the future or something i don't know but the devil is in the details and the details in the current youtube algorithm are click-through rate and engagement and ours are pretty poor i'm not blaming you guys it's not your guys's fault but you adapt or die so i'm gonna try this new channel where i put all my variety stuff up there and hopefully hopefully it goes well hopefully it catches on and we can reach a new audience because that's kind of been the problem we don't really reach new viewers so the idea is get the ball rolling on this new channel with a fresh start a fresh canvas make it so that people subscribing know what to expect it's gonna be variety and while there may be a certain series going on or something like occasional elden ring upload or other like trouble in terrace town or something that's not the only thing they're going to get and ideally they see something look at the chain they'll see a variety and they're like okay this interests me this is all just a hypothesis and it could go poorly and it could blow up in my face and if it does i'll i'll be man enough to admit that it failed and we'll try and bring it back to the channel or something because at the end of the day i'm always going to do variety whether or not it's the best thing for me so right now i want to do variety but not at the expense of the channel or the other content i'm currently making so realistically i know we already have this channel we have the more mr fruit i i created a couple years ago that one's gonna continue to live and people like well what's gonna happen more mr fruit more mr fruit was originally made mainly for series and let's plays that i didn't want to put on this channel because those were impacting it kind of the same situation let's plays weren't doing well like long form series okay well let's move to a new channel now just any variety is not doing good okay well let's move it to a new channel see what happens more mr fruit is mainly gonna become pokemon because inadvertently that's essentially what it is anyway the the main community and viewers there mainly care about pokemon so most uploads are going to stay pokemon over there so that channel will get content whenever there's pokemon series now the difference is more mr fruit was always i'll upload there whenever i'm feeling like it and we have something to do mr fruit plays is going to be very consistent uploads this first week probably they'll be like an upload every day or so because one i want to try and get stuff out there for the algorithm to pick up or like you know analytics to start figuring itself out and because uh well it doesn't make money um i have to hit like certain thresholds before i can actually get a return on my investment so there's a lot more to this than you probably think and again i gave you the skinny version i could sit here for like literally hours about analytics i look at research viewer habits uh my guess and other current guesses on the youtube algorithm and what i deal with them day to day but that is more so for me to freak out about and for you guys to just get content and so i think what will be best for both of us is this new channel mr fruit plays so again there's a brand new video there there'll be a link probably like up up there in screen and in the description box below to go check out that channel would appreciate all the momentum we can get initially and then please please please please please let me also preface this don't just go over there and subscribe or click once just to help initially but you're not interested in variety or something i'm so thankful for your support but what i'm trying to avoid especially earlier on are dead subs or numbers now i don't know exactly how it all plays out and it's just again it's theories but i don't want youtube to see this person came to this video once was recommended them later on or subscribed but then never clicked back i just don't want the system to see that initially it's inevitable and it'll happen but again we want as much initial momentum as possible you know i i talk with my youtube partner we have meetings every month he doesn't know the algorithm either but you know we kind of spit ideas back and forth and right now i just think this is the best play so apologies for clickbaiting you but the idea was i wanted to get everybody that doesn't care about destiny right now and came to this channel for variety to see hey i'm not done with variety you can go find a whole new channel dedicated to it we're going to get plenty of it but you might not know that that's happened unless you see this video so i'm probably going to put some disclaimers at the beginning of some videos here and there some community posts because i just want to get everybody that likes the variety over there to know hey you guys weren't for i didn't forget about you trust so if you also know somebody that feels the same way and perhaps they won't see this video feel free to let them know or if you think somebody you know might be interested show them the new channel hopefully in six months a year from now we can look and be like hey that worked out that was a good idea realistically maybe six months to a year from now i'm like okay rip we tried regardless i appreciate all of your guys's support through and through regardless of what continent is regardless what channel it is i love you guys i've just been struggling with the past year year and a half of finding a balance where i'm still able to make content but is also good for business because at the end of the day this is my job but also to where i can enjoy myself a happy medium but just focusing on one kind of content one game nobody wins there because then i'm gonna make worse content frankly i think it'll subconsciously affect me through time and kind of the same thing with variety if i'm just trying variety right now and it seems like the channel is just tanking and tanking which month over month it has for about 15 months that also just hurts my mental mental go boom so i just want to be in a good head space to make good content with you frankly i still think i'm making good content but i i especially know looking back a couple months too it's almost like it's it wasn't said but you can just kind of feel in some of the recordings and that's not okay so mr fruit plays check it out if you like variety if you don't give it a try and support the next couple videos or don't and if you just want to stick around for the shooter kind of stuff because that's what you enjoy well perfect welcome hey hi how are you you don't need to do anything you get to chill so love you guys very much have yourself a fantastic day i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
