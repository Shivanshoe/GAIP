heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to the last spell it's hard it's a very hard roguelike game that just came out i was super psyched for it one it's pixlr you know me i love pixel art it's turn-based strategy which means you gotta think which means we're gonna be a little bit of trouble you know me i'm really excited about it and you know once upon a time we used to show indie games all the time and would do with the let's plays on this channel well the algorithm decided uh they didn't really like that and i still don't think they like that however i just don't care at least right now so we're gonna upload this anyway and potentially some more because there's some other games that have come out recently that i want to make some videos on so if you like it please show some support but otherwise let's get into it all right you'll see me way way down here this isn't my normal spot but um i think this will work as far as gameplay wise if i go anywhere else i think my face came screwing it so anyway obviously some intense music going on here let me actually make sure the game audio is recording it is hydration break some flavored water because feeling crazy so i already played one run and um when i said it was balls hard i mean balls to the wall hard like it's here to just crush your balls and if you don't have balls you'll grow them and then they'll be crushed anyway the story here is they're like wizards obviously of course and all these people were like fighting but there's just one like super duper wizard that was like hiding away trying to figure out new magic and he figured out this like omega spell and he's like oh shoot tries it out boosh destroys a whole kingdom essentially and i was like whoops and turns out a neighboring kingdom almost all the royal family except for the king was in that kingdom and they got killed he was pissed so he got his wizards like figure out what the fudge they used learn it and we're gonna use it and then it essentially became like nuclear warfare except with these magical spells and like the entire world's just ruined now so to make up for it there are what little wizards haven't been put on stakes and you know uh put ablaze they're trying to save everything and give magicians a better name wizards whatever and they figured out a spell to fix it all called the last spell and the way it works is they make this like little well thing and all these wizards have to come and channel their energy and it'll take a while and i guess you go like city to city trying to do it but our objective is to protect the wizards until they're able to cast the last spell tribe once failed horribly it's just terribly so we're lakeberg number one i don't even so i guess there's like more maps which is terrifying to me because that means it's only gonna get harder but would you look at this first off graphics mwah i love it i love it you can um you can zoom out get a feel for what you're working with here uh i am a little terrified i'm not gonna lie to you all but here are the wizards casting their last spell see magic circle this alters where the mages devote their remaining powers in life force preparing the last spell so you start out with three heroes you can set it to easy which was tempting but note this is how they wanted to make the game so that's how we're gonna play it you start with very few buildings intact we um we have one house we have two house which gives us some workers and we have the shop but aside from that it's our heroes it's going to tell us in between rounds where the horde is coming from i believe it's a horde because it feels like they never stopped coming now what i realized was this is truly a roguelite because i'm i'm used to rogue lights or roguelikes you know from the get-go you can make some pretty good progress regardless you know if you're a bit of a gamer ah didn't feel like it with this i was like i don't know if i'm ever gonna beat this but then i realized once you beat it depending on achievements you've done it starts unlocking things so for instance see these vestige walls around the city that was not there the last time i played after i lost it was like you have unlocked small walls around this specific map this time i'm like oh thank god so that's nice so that gives us something but there's tons to the game so we're currently in the deployment phase so i have to get everybody situated before we uh get absolutely mauled but yeah we've got some random people here we have with us geralt of rivia along came this song okay sorry i could get lost so we get rain to people random classes and they all come with random traits so he's a jester as extra physical damage magic damage range damage but less resistance and armor he gets extra daily mana regen actually a whole bunch what the fudge that's kind of nuts uh and then okay less armor so he really doesn't have much armor but he do be vibing otherwise you can equip them with stuff from your stash that you can buy later if you get any they all have little skill trees and perks oh it's great and he specifically is an archer i believe yeah so he's gonna be our leg loss we have here edlin whom is ah wizard i believe i think thief extra move points dodging critical extra dodge less damage honestly pretty good rolls on the perks here though and then we have guillotina wow couldn't have butchered that more if i tried who is a oh i did not have this so this is actually a class i unlocked after losing a hammer class whatever the fudge you want to call design like a blacksmith or something i don't know but you have a rusty hammer which comes with less accuracy that kind of sucks but they probably just do a whole bunch of blunt damage mercenary so oh shoot look at that extra stats no downsides cruel extra critical smoker oh less healing and move points okay that one's kind of really bad but that's okay then they all have their own little thing so there's a lot to learn like i said it's turn-based everybody has their own things they all have action points and mana and move points in each turn that you have to think out carefully um and on the onset it's like oh that can't be that bad until you realize just how many enemies there are you'll see what i'm talking about so uh i'm assuming this is probably yeah all range is melee here not so i'm going to put them up just a little bit further i don't know how far they're going to come but we're gonna have to essentially come to them anyway i'll get the archer and wizard here uh mage whatever we wanna call them so that they don't have to go too far i'm worried that if i go any further they might actually attack me so i am going to end the phase and here comes the horde it's now night spooky and immediately so many freaking ghouls whatever the fudge these things are called they have a name i just don't remember uh so i'm not really about this we can choose who does what when you know none of the order matters and you can only take back movement once you've done something after movement though you can't undo it but i haven't played with this class so let's see what gui guila whatever the fudge your name is does so just bash with my hammer for quite a bit of damage does well against physical armor we have crush uh deals bonus damage or targets affected by stun poison or debuff sure i don't know if we have anyone that does oh but this does target two that's nice and then we have stomp um which does a set amount of damage targets one plus seven this effect applies to the tiles around the skills primary targets oh and it has a really high chance to stun would you look at that that's a nice little ability but we'd have to be right next to them to activate it so i think i'll start with my archer and i know what the archer does because i had one of them before so i think i'm just gonna light them up like this oh and it one shots most of them now but be warned i think by the next night uh we don't one shot like anything it was i'm telling you just went from 100 to zero so fast um don't mean to that okay so i'm gonna move to you now because we might as well get you killing the things you can actually hit so we're going to start with what is this bash yeah donk you lived with four health oh that's fun all right kill you nailed you now i do have some extra ap however i would have to get closer for that and more things will be coming so screw that we're gonna sit here i have an extra ap point so i'm gonna use brace to get some extra armor your turn is done you've you've done well for us my friend now we got a little wizard dude but i think first uh i don't even need to nah yeah let's uh okay not dead whatever not upset about it uh you're out of action points okay if we move right over here we have a multi-target oh great never mind we do not have line of sight on any of them screw us so what if i go over here oh now we got a line of sight in all them but that takes two mana and mana does not come back easily if at all sometimes so just got to watch out for that we'll get one more action point good news we'll take him out we'll kind of reposition here and that'll do it one here didn't move that's fine that's oh see look at this what the fudge oh my god we already got hit it's just oh good okay so once more into the fold i think this is a great time to use our new attack um out of range fudge okay so i'm gonna need you to take this guy out for us okay he didn't die so i'm gonna use some more mana we're gonna hit you here and then you're gonna target all these people so we'll hit you you and you and oh oh i don't have a line of sight of course i know uh well then fudge what uh yeah sure okay so you're dead so now i'm gonna go go goose okay we stunned some people but that was about it oh but if i use this move oh wait a second i could do it again i think this will overkill that so instead i'll just whack you into him you are very dead and i am very afraid i'm gonna have to arm her up again i think oh well first let me bash this dude oh i can't armor up okay yeah yeah that sucks because we're probably gonna get hit but you're fine you'll take it like a champ right hopefully more mana is gonna have to be used here not ideal but don't have much of a choice i think we hit the most targets that's five all right that's a good bit now i need to chip away at the front line here um sure i think that'll actually kill them all perfect we have no more action points but you did us proud very proud of you very proud we're gonna move you here for no apparent reason uh then we'll just uh start picking these people off they're stunned so i don't necessarily need to oh that was your last action point how's everyone at action points yes okay uh i think we're fine good ward you can see this is the this there are 35 remaining enemies and this is the first wave that's what i'm saying so we might kind of get away unsk but trust me it ramps up as if it already hasn't but see i was like oh it can't be that bad but there it does not end so we're gonna practically have to use all of our magic here which sucks the good news is they have a bit of a bottleneck right here really our only saving grace currently [Music] okay how about we use how about you walk over here and you mark mark mark and mark perfect doing great why don't you finish him off and then we'll wait because i could actually give somebody else an extra turn if i wanted to um so i'm gonna move in here or am i i technically don't need to instead i'm just gonna hit you into you whack you come back we're going to hold the choke i'm going to put on my defense even though i don't think i need it and then let's pick off a couple more people here i don't want to use any magic we're going to keep that okay and then i can use transfer to lose one action point but give him some extra movement and one more action point so i'm gonna move and this does a whole bunch of damage but they have a really good chance of dodging it but they didn't pog so we're gonna go back we're gonna end our turn one action point remaining right yeah you can't do anything that's fine okay thank god for this little bottleneck that's all i'm gonna say okay so i could if we kill right here trying to see where i get maximum value with her alt if we're gonna do that archer's already running a little low on mana we only have five so i think i've got pretty much one more use of this and then i'm about tapped they gotta bow out uh so i'm gonna try and hit oh that's good oh that's real nice my man is almost depleted yeah buddy i know that's what we're trying to currently fix oh my you guys are tanky well that's not good so i can move here i don't know how how much more movement will i have i only have two movement after this but it might be necessary so kaboosh okay we actually stun them all that's huge i don't know if they can even move through them so they might just be stuck there that isn't probably how that works and i'm just getting a little ahead of myself and hopeful but i can't hold on that hope then what can i do okay we're just gonna start picking these people off if i have the line of sight i guess out of range okay sick uh requires line of sight okay okay what if i go here screw you screw you screw you screw you get back out of business and nobody has anything else to do we'll move you a little bit you can't move at all let's see what happens here okay they can move through stunned units but it's fine because they didn't get to us now i still have kind of jahuba mana here so i'm going to just go do this again stunned again we'll have two movement after this see is it worth it how about we save her moves and we'll find out in a little bit uh gonna need to get the archer a little bit closer here i'm not gonna use mana here instead i'm gonna use my omega attack and hope it doesn't miss that's why i got closer but i only get two of those a turn so i already used those up and just like that we've practically killed everybody so we might not need to worry about this kill you kill you kill you kill you okay see now i can just come over here oh first night boos killed it because guess what damage dealt or hp lost freaking 33 nothing s rank everybody leveled up everybody likes that with the 30 kills you're nuts man they didn't get anywhere close to the city that's gonna change trust me but because of that we get maximum rewards boom boom boom thank you city i'll take that and this is new what uh i don't know but i guess i get this currency is used for one of the vendors in between games that gives you some stuff for future runs so that's new but that's good to know now we got another wave in coming prepare thyselfs what the fudge okay so we got one towards the last belt looks like we need one two three four five six seven eight nine ten we have to survive 11 more days what if i just said no uh because that's not gonna happen you have enough tainted essence for a trade oh i can immediately trade oh interesting okay let's see what this guy's got yo shut up shut up i already talked to you okay uh so i could unlock the armor maker building crafting some defensive gear for your heroes or oh my god i save and heroes are generated with plus one action point holy jesus that's kind of that's not even what that's insane yes i'm saving none all right well let's level up everybody first so everybody gets a perk everybody has the same perks in each line it just depends on which one you think will work best for them and guiller we're gonna call her g for short good old g um so you're always in the heat of battle so we could get execute for you um executing any enemy with less than 15 health in melee range um question i mean at that point aren't you just gonna kill them anyway like if they have less than 15 health and you may leave them you're going to kill them anyway oh but you can oh it's a skill oh so you could possibly execute multiple i see we could just get extra experience extra armor extra crit uh damage and crit for punch poison damage regenerating move things so the hero didn't move uh i'm gonna go five percent chance no no screw it you know greedy we're going extra xp that's probably terrible idea but it's too late i did it and then we get uh primary attributes so we can get better resistance mana physical damage health or armor i'm thinking man at night might not be a bad idea or we could re-roll but if we reroll we're only going to get three choices gambo okay you know let's just go resistance i'm i'm always in the thick of it anyway so a little reduced damage wouldn't be bad extra health regen even more experience gain wait a second uh stun chance just on everything that could prove pretty useful it's only eight percent but we could bump that up but daily health regen might need to get bumped up because she's gonna be taking the most damage out of everybody because she's closest that was the problem i had this person always needs to be like i had another melee she was uh like a thief she had a knife or something like a rogue i guess um and yeah she always had to be in the fray and so she just took it up the butt frankly uh and it was not consensual geralt leveled up we can give you some extra magic damage which is good that's what you use armor dodge chains mana could give you resistance but i'm currently hoping you just don't have to deal with that because if you're getting hit anyway we might be in trouble so it's only a common but we're going to go with magic damage i'm going to play it safe we could get you extra experience daily mana regen isn't bad gamba probation damage multiplier applied to the damage after each bounce of the propagation skill effect i don't think we have anyone that has the propagation skill effect rip uh screw it experience gained probably a bad idea um okay so what do we want you doing potions can now be used on allies up to 10 tiles away you could be like our support person armor increased um let's do the throw the potion thing yeah that sounds fun going crazy feeling wild and then we have edlin or our legolas oh wait no oh oh wait fudge oh i didn't look i for he's our lego loss oh fudge that's embarrassing because i'll show you why uh i would have picked this trait as long as the hero didn't move during this turn extra accuracy and skill range aha whoops okay papa it's because last time my archer was like this girl so i just i got confused ah whatever screw me so you're gonna want wait does that mean i gave you magic damage i did didn't i oh oh my god whatever i'm throwing uh it's not i was gonna win anyway let's be honest yeah well i was gonna give you this but screw it you know let's just give everybody more xp why not uh so you definitely want magic damage whoops and then ooh extra experience i'm finna act up okay screw it we're just going to experience on everybody why not and that way i can get the perk point i was supposed to get earlier faster uh we get a reward so we unlocked well we get a shoes we can get a iron shield for extra dodge and health regen as well block we could put that on our hammer check a crossbow one hand ranged weapon let's compare that to i don't know why it's comparing it oh oh here we go that's convenient uh base damage is way worse it's only one-handed maybe that's why um but we get extra yeah the range is smaller i guess we'll get multi-hits though oh what are its skills uh ray uh wait debuff freaking we can poison this one does damage and pierces armor or we get blaze which does damage only one target though oh but this does propagation change a portion of damage as well as potential alterations to a random adjacent unit up to max targets after the initial one looks like it does it times three okay oh oh another crossbow except this one is plus damage but aside from that i think everything else is the exact same actually this does just a little bit more damage um i'm kind of chilling with our current bow i'm gonna be awesome we're gonna get this and i'm gonna put it on our hammer girl where you at are you at g character's flight city stash boom put that on you oh and that's good too because it's one-handed yeah we would that's a good thing because you only have yep that's how that works perfect all right i'm the best so we have a hundred gold and a hundred materials currently we can build new structures we can buy new gear what does the shop currently have we could get a better hammer interesting this one does extra physical damage and is well it's just better all around this is tempting in fact i'm buying it i bought it it's too late i'm going all in on her apparently well i'm not looking at this lame common gear i'm only here for the uncommon this one gives extra health but move point penalty but extra accuracy uh this one gives health less reliability but extra okay this one gives extra block but less movement points i mean maybe that's good on like our archer uh we're just gonna do this one armor though for now be cut or this one purchase because there might be stuff i want to do otherwise so is there a way to sell this i wonder i wonder uh buy some new gear um sell okay i think that worked i'm not really sure everything must go it gets refreshed every day so don't worry about it a magic weapon oh wait what is oh compare this with um such who's you're you're the mage right then again yeah so this one to sexual reliability but the skills might just be sicker a lot of propagation stuff honestly i'm kind of down how much is this 23 script hey i said i wasn't gonna buy more and then i bought more look at me go i'm nuts character select we're gonna give you that and then we're going to go back to this oh nope nope nope that gives me four perfect okay now i have some workers so what workers can do is like destroy buildings and i can choose to either get more gold from it or more materials materials are important for city defenses which i'll show you in a second um we're gonna have some attacks coming here soon so you gotta gotta use the old noggin you guys know me not good at that we can upgrade the houses to increase worker level i need some gold for that though so i'm gonna use one to get me just a little bit more gold doing so allows me to upgrade this just gives me another worker i'm thinking down the road you know and then if i use all four here i could get extra materials and gold i'm gonna do that i'm not gonna use many of the materials now but next wave believe me we're gonna want them i'm gonna i'm gonna still build some though don't get me wrong so i'm gonna make some wooden walls very rudimentary uh 15 each something like that ain't bad um trying to think and then just build some of these pretty easy to break uh this i need to destroy do i get it back oh my god i don't get the resources back screw me the reason i did that is um otherwise so see i'm gonna make a gate okay because otherwise our hammer chick wouldn't have a way to get back if she needed to so this gives us a kind of uh defense wall we built that uh so i think it's time we start deploying position your heroes all right g you up front you know geralt of rivia yeah all you let's be honest all of you guys are sitting behind the wall except for you i'm a little afraid they might be able to hit her so i'm gonna put it right here and here we go pray to jesus mazel tov friends okay they're already starting to come from the side i kind of hoping they would have funneled here more looks like nope they're going right here thank god for these random walls ah fudge so it begins now i didn't read what this weapon does so i probably should giant range the whole jesus two to ten ignores fifty percent of the target's resistance right right okay weakening touch uh decreases resistance and damage and i yeah i don't even think it does damage but that's not the point it's pretty good fireball pretty self-explanatory five targets yes please or lightning strike even more damage but only one target but this one propagates nine times holy brat okay well here's what we're gonna do to start we're gonna bring you over here because we gotta get these runners they have increased movement speed and we don't like that we still one shot for now thankfully so we're gonna do that i'm gonna try and save i don't have line of sight oh he's out of range i'm gonna try and save our spells for when we see even more people trust me they'll come let's uh knock some of your armor off there same deal here um let's actually see how much damage could you do girl i don't think enough how much this this would only give us two movement afterwards i feel like she's just kind of got a chill which sucks but nothing else she can do otherwise she's just going to take a licking and we can't afford that yet so i could debuff them all but well that is tempting but no i because i don't know if it can how far it'll train into the smoke or whatever the fudge so uh requires line of sight of course it does because i guess the the barricades we put give you line of sight but i guess these omega walls don't uh so here we go that should give us line of sight that's decent enough damage i love the little animation on this thing though not enough to kill anyone right now which is unfortunate we're not one-shotting anybody but we're doing the job we're gonna end our turn i know our hammer lady didn't do anything g's just chilling but that's all she can do that's so many people they haven't even told me how many enemies are left because that's just how many there are left they're like you ain't seen nothing yet so now we gotta start using our mega skills this fireball is nice this lightning strikes nice all this is real nice i'm gonna be honest um debating just kind of sending this in and seeing what exactly happens this costs three mana though and we're really not gonna get much of that back so let's hope this does well propagate probably get holy it's not bad because then i can come right here skadoosh they're all stunned so that gives me some time come over here and bash this dude in and then uh end up killing this guy okay she's chilling now i think it's time we got a little ham with our archer here oh ham though is the question that looks pretty good to me worked out pretty well let me kill the runners uh i'm gonna go for the omega on the big armored guy okay we hit we have another one but we're out of action points you have two left how do we want to do this uh we can finish you off way out yonder and i'm gonna weaken your armor perfect two heroes didn't move that's fine 87 damage what the fudge even with all my armor and stuff they didn't care at all holy brap okay that sucks so i kind of need to i'm gonna kill this dude so that i can get more value from her omega skill right here that's big uh we could even do it again but we won't get as much value so i could whack like this and wax like that but then the problem is we're going to get kind of well pooped on frankly let's see what we're doing over here how much remaining you got you got 11. this boy be chilling um so let's do as much as we can there this guy is a direct path to us i'm gonna do my omega attack it hit pog and i think i have to do the same here okay we're gonna move him over just a little bit you don't have much left friend uh but i might just have to give her best go we're gonna hit him with a fireball or weakening touch it's not bad honestly i'm going with that let's go with the weakening touch over here okay so they they all got decreased stats i'm pretty happy with that uh don't do that okay so we'll whack those guys this thing is still alive magic so kill that and then you my friend are probably gonna take a good bit okay i think he might be out of range but i'm not sure you have one more action point let's kill that guy because i think he could get to us that's all reaction all right pray for us she's gonna get hit 87 what the fudge okay they're hitting the walls not cool but we kind of have them funneled can't believe this guy's still alive all right good lord there's so many of them okay jesus we're gonna god we're gonna have to start lighting them up huh let's get as many of them as we can okay we needed that uh immediate threats out of range oh fudgies too close that's not good um i have to waste this on him i really don't want to do that okay i'll come back to you we have pretty much one omega attack left i think we just go lightning strike i feel like we don't have much of a choice give me some good propagation i've seen worse let me try and clear a path for our friend here okay okay now you're gonna go right in the thick of it i know trust okay the workout uh if we go here whoosh what's stunned very nice this one isn't which is tragic so we'll do that we'll hit over there you're gonna come behind the gate pog totally playing that um and then fudge i have to use this on you and i'm gonna have to use this on him because i think he can three movement yeah he's gonna hit us so i'm gonna have to back up a little bit how far that's a good question i'm gonna go like right here and in the turn wait what what the fudge oh my god wait how did he thought they moved so far yo what where the fudge did this thing come from is she's gonna like single-handedly ruin everything okay i can hit him from here thank god all right we go stupid okay you sir go away all of you can die thank you i really need to hit this oh my god god this arch is so sick okay we have a little bit of magic left but i need to save some because we will not regenerate all of it before the next round yeah isn't that fun so let's see what sheik do first and then we can get clean up i guess on the rest whack over here maybe whack here whack there uh and then armor up because you're kind of stuck but now she can try and clean up to help you i think i don't have line of sight okay you're you're dead you're dead you're dead you're at action points okay now i think i'm gonna come back so that i can assist with this wave all right what we see here is is what we get it's what what's left so that's the good news bad news i suppose you we're going to save your mana from here on out if we can so what if i let's see how much damage we do here i'm willing to use her mana quite a bit because she's actually going to get a lot of it back anyway so let's see what we do here mostly stunned she doesn't have quite enough movement to finish that off unfortunately and i could move her up to finish that but if i do i think they're gonna start whacking her and i don't want that so let's see finish this guy i'm gonna omega that dude hit him pog uh a lot of armoreds that's not good so i'll use my magic because i think magic does that no i think blunt is what mainly ignores that whatever uh so i'll just omegahem and we got him pog finish you finish you well shortly all right and then i'm going to not do that i'm gonna debuff you guys oh it takes two minutes never mind uh feels bad i'm actually gonna undo that so i can come over here finish this off so we don't have to worry about that come back over here and we prepare for the next round we're doing it mr krabs okay you're coming over here freaking boosh yeah stupids and then gaboosh and caboose dodged there we go like the heck no magic damage pierce this fool oh my god we're the best oh we're so good okay damage 32 even less than last time by one point but we take that um didn't even touch a building excuse me didn't even touch a building uh by some miracle let's freaking get it so we get more rewards which we desperately needed and i get a whole bunch more tainted essence to spend that's an s knight two well that was easy wait a second ready oh okay boom we're already double the good news is they're coming through where i already have some walls so i don't have to well i could repair them probably won't even bother but yeah now i have to split up my three heroes in like what a prowess has been accomplished oh really oh yeah what up lady blah blah i already talked to you why am i still out that's what i'm saying shut up okay gather 500 materials unlocks the scavenger camp building passively generating some materials yes please and then go over to this shady man shady entity whatever and we're going to definitely get heroes regenerated with one action point i have to hold it i don't have enough for the rest um so i'll just invest what i have look there's 83 favors we get i have two percent see that's nice so there's tons more to grow and expand uh because i ain't getting anywhere to finish in this night let me tell you let's start upgrading this is our hammer lady let's remember what we're doing here uh i want to increase resistance yes please resistance reduction flat reduction applied to the resistance of targeted enemies um okay damage five percent increase or isolated this resistance reduction kind of sounds cool let's go with that now perks we can debuff an enemy stun chance ooh i like that killing enemy gives us more of that essence stuff the hero didn't kill anyone blah blah blah leap frog allowing to jump over neighboring enemies to get better positioning uh let's go with stun chance for her you like that well i quite like that okay this is our archer mr fruit archer so probably range damage yes confirm i'm not even going to try and reroll accuracy that's nice i'm like yeah i'm actually gonna we're just gonna give me that okay now i'm gonna go with if you didn't move my bad buddy should have given you that earlier that one's on me and then you are wizard so no no we don't want any of that really ooh magic damage that's what we like i should have gotten you some more mana momentum modifier applied to the bonus damage and the momentum skill effect i don't think he had momentum could give you more experience gain okay yolo were rerolling skill range plus one interesting you know i'm gonna go with that and for perks i don't know what i want to give you maybe give you extra armor and stay next to a building or you could buff somebody you didn't kill anyone propagation bonus but less damage but more multi-heads uh it's not bad because we could just weaken people you know what maybe we'll try that might take a little too much five head for me but never know unless we try all right we get a reward oh we could get a rare one which gives us better reliability and opportunistic it gives us just a flat damage that does more or skill transfer which we know before extra action points blah blah and then the multi-hit okay but i guess you just do wait i don't what i guess it's because it's one-handed so we could give you something else i guess that's wait so could we give you two wands we could get this gives us better health less movement but better critical and additional but this gives critical and health and then just way more damage overall kind of like that kind of like that chief [Music] but then we're we technically don't but like i'm not gonna put this on we already got armor no is that just a shield it might have been just a shield it's true she won't get dodge chains but we could just give her more health critical and she gets less move points yellow i'm i'm getting that i regret nothing someone go to her character sheet city stash give me that we'll sell the other thing uh all right how much we got decent gold decent materials gonna sign some workers um i'm gonna actually upgrade this so that we get another worker so now we have some six to work with let's see what is for sale extra dodge chance and armor that's pretty nice that's a direct upgrade i'll buy that we're gonna sell that all right so we're gonna give you some better armor my friend then we're gonna sell that screw that um now do i want more gold because we could upgrade this increases the level of available items anything else but oh you know we could just build new structures so we do scavengers camp gives some materials when production is complete and it increases passively a temple which regenerates health that's pretty good mana well regenerates mana well that's really good and shop i already have one oh you can only have one let's get a little bit of gold why don't we three of our workers no let's figure out which do we want to go with health or mana maybe mana uh where do i want to put it um right here what is this okay so i have to use one worker for this but boom your man is restored now i only have two so let's go for more materials to defend ourselves here because it's about to get the dicey and apparently i've accomplished another prowess i'm not what have i done exactly use 20 workers oh the house building adding some workers to the haven oh now i can build houses oh fudge i would have done that right now oh dickens let's see how much that would cost uh house is 55 women did the six park that's nice uh can't worry about that though now though but see that's something we could do like another time um i cannot repair these bit of a bummer but i can repair or i can just upgrade you if i upgrade you is your health restored no okay that was kind of a peg of me but now it's an omega wall so think about it like that let's build some defenses need some basic walls if i've learned anything i thought they're coming here they'll probably like eight bajillion people over here uh so i'm gonna do one wall we'll have a gate here along here but then i'm just gonna do the basic little things over here we're gonna need to reinforce over here get some walls you need to move my friend build some defenses okay it's practically all my materials oh and then one one last thing that's why i did this a gate now the main problem is how do we split this up because there's no telling oh like how many people would be where all right uh one two three looks like they all have about the same space okay i'm gonna put her on the wall i'm gonna put the archer over here and then i'm gonna put the mage in between because she is the most range so she can kind of pivot depending on where they all start coming from and i think that's all i can do so pray for me all right here we go this is where i lost last time and i lost horribly all right what do we have here oh you're already getting hit oh they have archers now oh great what the holy jesus i was like oh there's not that many people over okay which one do we prioritize that's a great question um looks like you're just gonna have to fudge me you're only gonna get one movement after this girl balls oh it can't okay then undo that see it doesn't hit the ones in the fog i thought it might it does not so screw that um whack you all i kind of i don't like that runner but we got one uh i'm gonna head back behind the wall i think [Music] um i think i have to yeah you we're gonna have to be careful with how we use your mana um in fact we don't even see that many yet which is sad to say so i i think i'm gonna hold and instead you're so are you kidding uh i could have just done less resistance huh okay so i'll just do that scroll you boners um and then hit you as much as i can all right leave me you have quite the task ahead of you don't you godspeed friend um yeah let's just go ahead and do that we see now we're not i'm not even killing the runners all right i gotta omega this guy pray okay the omega at least still kills him and now i kind of gotta get rid of these archers too don't i i have no more ability points though two action points remaining i know she does i'll armor her even though it doesn't matter oh my god all the runners are just oh these suck the walls oh my god they've already been breached i have to stop these runners what the man okay let's start with uh this guy and pray that this poops on him not quite as much as i'd hoped uh might have to just come over here now and help but the sad oh my god you only have two action points left huh okay let's see what we can do here i can already tell you uh whatever it is it's not enough but oh hey all right i gotta whack you it'll whack you guys um and whack all you guys oh fudge i just didn't think about the fact that i can hurt my own walls oh that sucks yeah boss that sucks oh [Music] all right kill that one archer and then we're running all the way over here now see problem is i gotta stop these runners this blocks my line aside anyway uh okay we got one got the other now i think i'll hit him with this this hits four this hits five all right you're at action points can i finish you or not finish i mean hurry all right all right they're in what's a holy fudge they're hurting the building ah you can already see the city's already panicking fox 60 enemies left sweet moses lord above um worst part is he can't even shoot these well at least this one um kill you come over here could lord there's so many of them that's that's not even right what and then she's supposed to hold this down by herself i can't do my omega attack because i'll just wind up killing the rest of my things oh no i might just have to hit but if i is it really worth hitting my thing for it um screw it screw it man good luck we're gonna run you back hopefully nothing can reach you i'm sure something will but staying optimistic we could fireball a lightning strike gotta be pretty careful with how we use mana here but i think this certainly calls for it you have a little bit left in the tank let's finish off you guys now you got to get back from the other archers uh get you over here finish you off weaken you oh we gotta kill okay don't ask why and we did it i don't know how g's gonna hold the fort down here she's trying her best oh the city panics reduced for some reason guess because they're currently not in the city well this guy is but where what the fudge like i don't even think it's possible to stop this oh my god we got all these dogs man i have to hope i one shot this dude thank god whack all of you oh it's not enough whack you good luck g okay we're gonna we're gonna freaking lightning strike again because screw me propagate as much as you can good uh we got runners over here kill all that we can not enough okay i'm gonna omega attack here or like right in front of me so i swear to god if i miss okay um and it kind of feels like i just need that wow i don't know how i killed you just get some kills i'll worry about you in a second all right uh we don't need to worry too much about moving all right g i believe in you wait what that runner's almost in oh my god oh fudge okay well looks like we've seen all the monsters that are left though okay somebody has to do something fun you'll get a city panic oh jesus oh lord there's a fire g by some miracle has kind of almost staved this off by some miracle indeed um how many action points you're gonna left um uh whack you whack you gee you're not you are a literal g s fudge we have to stop this um kill you he doesn't even kill the runners oh boy i don't know i don't even know if i can get line of sight on you all right well rip me okay all right what the fudge man all right out of range of course okay how how much movement you got i think this is the best way kill dodged that is can't quite explain just how bad that is for us all right now if this thing dodges okay all right kill you come back here kill you all right we're almost there i think careful oh didn't even get through the armor you're nuts hit the walls whatever at this point i don't care ah okay wait a second wait a second i think i might be able to squeak this one out okay i'm just gonna freaking that's pretty good uh you are an absolute legend let's just start with that what what did you just whiff point blank is that what you just did that just happened oh kill this thing all right unfortunately actually there we go okay you don't have a lot of mana left i have to try and keep some of that alive so all right he is i can't let them kill this building though i just spent so much money making it uh i don't think she dies here i really don't i think she's fine so kill this guy um kill that guy all right this little tome thing is as i say that barely didn't finish them off okay eight people left though here we go it went through the armor but not a lot important thing they're not hitting my building so okay this could be much worse much worse and just like that oh no i'm out of no okay i can't move anymore but we'll finish you off next time uh you're gonna point blank that bring movie over here point blank event uh heavy kill in how many three enemies left no two okay i just didn't update them so in that case come over here screw you screw you and we're almost there one more turn oh i can feel it you deserve this kill let's go holy ac progress i probably won't survive the next night but i made it three nights and then maybe i'll make it four and then i don't know hp lost 84. g is nuts what can i say an a-rank we'll take that not as bad as it could have been i'm pretty happy with that frankly that's an a rank we don't get a free weapon that sucks but we got a lot of tainted essence i feel very tainted all over night three boom good lord now they're coming from here and here well you know what i think with that we're gonna end it here we can uh pick this up in the next episode if you guys are interested or if this does well enough please engage with it because i'd really like to make some more and then maybe this can be a little mini series i don't know or i'll come back and just finish this run or something i don't know we'll figure it out or maybe this is the last one and if it is game is dope feel free to check it out it's balls hard uh and it uses a lot a lot of my brain power i've just never played a lot of turn-based strategy games so uh you probably tell i'm not the best but even with that said it's a ton of fun so i want to thank you all much for watching have yourself fantastic have yourselves a fantastic day i'll talk to you in the next one very well you
