hi do you hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the channel and today's video we're going to be playing game of life 2 again because you know what i woke up and i'm like wow i hate my life so instead i'm going to escape the video games and play the game of life and also hate my life that wasn't really much of escapism but also before we get into that i do want to mention i've seen some comments especially since i've been doing more of the full cam people have been like what's in your mouth do you have whatever something some let me show you it is a splint it's not a retainer or anything and that's because i got a messed up jaw you might know about it uh if you listen to the podcast or i did some updates and videos a little while ago uh starting around october my jaw was completely locked i couldn't eat i couldn't chew it'd been getting worse and worse so it turns out long story short the top my jaw is deteriorating and on top of that i have a much smaller upper jaw and it's within and they might have to just expand my whole entire upper jaw and like i'm gonna break it or something i have no idea and then on top of that i've displayed to try and correct my bite to bring my jaw forward and then after that we're gonna do something to fix my teeth and who knows what this is going to look like and who knows it was going to fix and this is something super rare that you normally don't see and much older man so if this is how my jaw looks in my early 20s how nora's going to look at 40 and 50 am i even going to be able to eat oh man it's so anyway let's get to my other virtual life oh oh what is it welcome to the fantastical map of fantasy we get to live life in the olden times the spinner i forgot about the spinners hey i was last last time so this makes
