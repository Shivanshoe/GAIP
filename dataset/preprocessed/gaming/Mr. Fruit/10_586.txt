hidey-ho John my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to call duty modern warfare and I've got to come forward with you all and tell you I have done a terrible terrible thing I decided to finally unlock all the weapons I hadn't including the crossbow fully level it and get Damascus and that's exactly what I did and I wish this pain upon nobody else learn from my mistakes you probably have a great question which is why yeah mmm-hmm that that is a wonderful wonderful question well I never bothered to fully upgrade a new weapon that wasn't a base gun I just thought I had to fully level it and then I'd get Damascus nope you have to complete every challenge gold it - then get Damascus whatever you know that's that's not what I'm here for in my torturous time this is the build I suggest at least for my play style 28 strand cable for both velocity xrk thousand two hundred pound with the damage range and bolt velocity increase attack laser for that 80's same instability and my and steadiness F attack speed grip for the 80s speed and sprinter fire speed and sleight of hand because using this without sleight of hand is painful and using a width sleight of hand is a little less painful but make no mistake still very painful the best way I could describe it is I enter the match with a civil war musket and everybody else has modern firepower that's what it's like using the crossbow and it's great guys I'll uh my favorite weapon I love it so much it's so good all right looks like we're joining the game in progress okay okay wow I actually haven't seen the Damascus crossbow and I have to admit aside from the fact that my screen is just gray it looks great now what I'm using is is a neutered Marchman rifle in in about every aspect there is literally no reason to use the crossbow except for being a living meme that's really the only time I would ever suggest this you're gonna notice I try it God increased bolt velocity because anything else and the bullet or the bolt rather takes just like why would it take so long don't ask me but I mean just shooting from like one end of shipment to the other you have to account for drop like like sorry what I'll get my aim back though you got to be very snappy very quick to shoot and you got to be right on target there is no forgiveness like what pretty sure I should have had that but whatever did not mad I'm just disappointed that's another one of my favorite things about the crossbow for some reason unbeknownst to me hold on all we're going for the truck oh shoot that disrespect Roy see little red school oh okay hold up mr. fruit you're kind of on a tear right now and you are under percent correct hold up they're gonna be spawning right you know and see anything oh my god they're all hiding in that little [ __ ] in container with it oh you didn't see me god no he doesn't he was looking at the edible coke death alright well oh there we go ahead shot Tater Tot it's so hard from this distance to having to account for like you have to leave them like why is that I think you got a cow came where thing where are they going oh not like this oh my kill streak almost keep it alive Oh Don I always forget to put on like actual kill streaks because right now I mean yeah I just have this absolute meme of a lot out okay but here fudge hold on well let's see that's the tough part you find any more than one person just got to pray to God that you have time to load the next bolt which is like never cuz it takes so freakin long man like this is with sleight of hand so imagine the absolute trauma I experienced trying to use this thing with no attachments for the camo challenge I would I really wouldn't wish it upon my biggest rival you know like with just like think of any other guy especially I get DMR right you take a shot except out of the gate it's more accurate practically hitscan and on top of that the time between firing is way better please give me play to get ah fudge I was hoping they'd at least give me play the game so somebody could see my Damascus crossbow and then be like you poor thing I'm just looking to I'm trying to farm pity points here you know that wasn't even the worst part though long shots and washed up their mountain was terrible - okay whom I can it was actually a lot of fun when you are on a tear in a life it hits different man it hits different well I'll give this thing though that's why I wouldn't suggest it to anybody especially if you're not looking to hate your life but at the same time it can be pretty fun you guys know me I always opt for the weirder staining your loadouts weapons all that kind of stuff and well this fits the bill to say the least oof there we go see you got to be right on target and when you get those kills oh it feels good I hope look at all them pinned up there Oh baby and that's the thing about trying to get double kills and triple kills because of how long it takes to cycle a bolt you literally have to kill a person and then by the time you load the next one shoot it get a kill otherwise you know too much time is faster oh there we go mmm-hmm there's this cool crispy little quickscopes honestly I get as much satisfaction out of quick scoping with this as I do a sniper rifle that a hot take I don't know but I actually I think it's almost harder to quickscope with this thing oh okay hello sir yo and there's a third I also just like challenges I swore to myself I would never gold another weapon after getting Damascus clearly that well I lied to myself it was just something about the crossbow you know I was like man most people wouldn't do this I shouldn't do this that's why I'm gonna do it that's what early like my my train of thought oh get noscoped breath point-blank breath I'm gonna let you enjoy your little office right I'm not gonna disturb you I'm pretty sure they know I'm here there's more of em well they just keep coming and they just keep coming and they just keep coming and they just keep coming they just keep coming and they just keep coming they just keep coming and they just keep coming spawn right at me spun round to me that's all they do they spawn right on top of me I always die it's really unfortunate I hate you and your ugly face I'm sorry that's rude I don't know what I'm sure you have a beautiful face you seem like a beautiful person with a beautiful soul and I'm so dead I tried to go with a build that focuses even better on a DSP and stuff but if God I'm having a seizure with the fudge if the attachment decreases both velocity it ain't worth it it's almost it mr. fruit are you alright as you can see here I have the run Eddie or whatever that pistol is is a secondary because sometimes it's necessary if you want to well stay alive you gotta shoot a bolt the swap shoot a bolts pop there's got to be a couple people up here right well that looked like a good quickscope here's another bizarre thing I have found with the crossbow though I will straight up like that have my my sights right on the guy Oh hold up I'm going in right now I'm good come on try me try me drop out Oh hold up okay my friends here to help me I appreciate that buddy clearly I couldn't I couldn't finish the job Oh oh god I forgot her natty got her in a skirt and then I got a skirt he's not gonna see this he's gonna think I'm pushing but I'm not I'm loading up the next bolt I'm popping all my killstreaks he's dead hahaha and so is he you see what I'm talking about though sometimes it is oh so crispy scar or on check this yeah I'm dropping down forge didn't work what the Dickens it was nice though finally unlocking it even though you know I spent my whole fourth of July unlocking it well not only unlocking it but then getting gold for it anyway not important it was nice being able to not use explosive tip because before this all I had was the blueprint and the explosive which is like okay I guess but like sometimes well actually most of the time you would hit them with the bolt and it wouldn't 1-shot until it explodes so for a long time you're just kind of boned for lack of a better way to put it like you'll you'll kill someone and they're dead to rights except it gives them like a full second to kill you and make no mistake they usually did I'm trying to go for a wool we'll drive by you know even better idea a little bit of this action I'm sure they're hiding it oh all right we want I guess they just never want to push the flag I mean sure you're not stewed oh my god you're nuts the crossbow is a test of my willpower would I say it was a worse grind than the riot shield no dare I say anything will ever truly compare to the absolute horror that was the riot shield gold quest I'm confident to say any any future call duties as well like what were they thinking man that's just bizarre alright grabs welcome to write proper Cheshire Park yeah it's a good thing we're in a red urban area you know you're totally not gonna stick out especially this ghillie suit love it there yeah we're the heavily forested area so uh yeah no good call on that one buddy good call yeah I think it's harder than sniping quickscoping because what I've noticed too is like I said you could be like like that Oh what like that I'm I'm on the dude and sometimes the bolt just doesn't go where you tell it to it is bizarre it is tilting it's beyond me older we'd be like right here and I'll shoot it and it'll just miss and I'm like how they're like they're not moving but life finds a way and I'm going to and yeah I'm gonna die here anyway where'd you go I live oh yeah I see that one no that feels nice that's got to be embarrassing - he's like what he watches the the kill feed he's like oh my god I can't even be mad enemy UAV oh my god let's see this mmm can i I don't even know if I can like hit it yeah doesn't it I fight the explosive tip maybe but yeah I don't think I get hitmarkers cuz I think I tried to hit a VTOL before and you'll hit it but I don't even get a hit murder the beetle is just like a hawk what are you doing wait what oh he's in here this little rascal oh no I was supposed to get an animation but he turned around last-second Trudy tragic oh fudge hey come back ah dang okay hold on he's gonna be coming up Oh what did I tell ya I have the sense it oh fudge I thought I could jump on that roof don't ask me why of course I keep oh that's the scary part man you got one shot yeah hit the bolt or yeah hit that deck how old let's go in mr. booth make sure to write that one down you know we'll use that in future material Oh get noscoped oh yeah I know I'm handicapping myself I know I've just cranked up a life difficulty to like extra hard but I do that to myself in like every game and whenever I'm able to do well with it that just gives me a certain pleasure luck okay okay I should never get a hit marker I'm sure what I was aiming how did it hit his knee which none of that makes it alright here we go oh I get a test my hypothesis now hold on yeah see we had it not even a hit murder it just laughed it off I actually really liked red chard perk though they've added some Maps what 90 percent of them have been like old maps and honestly you know nostalgia side they most of them haven't really fit into this game very well if I'm being honest with you all like ship what how do I even miss that point-blank that that honestly takes Talent like I'd whatever I'm just gonna sit in this little flower garden I blend in they'll never know who oh I hear a couple of red they go oh I hear there we go yes oh god frickin I was just trying to assassinate your friend ruff okay I don't know how much I got to compensate for this oh boy alright but yeah I can't even I can't even tell where it's where it's going man oh and I think their hearts good with me yep okay there's one more though uno mas uno mas uno my ha ha ha ha not today oh we're losing a hold up watch this mm-hmm you know what uh huh what how does it oh my no is c4 throwing like the new planking cuz I swear to God everybody's doing it and I know planking I'm showing my age god that was a trend what like 2009 to anyway point is it just seems like a fad right now because I've been playing games and we're literally I swear the only thing can you guys just stop they've been running around exclusively throwing like c4 and it's working it's frightening and actually ah dude you're even more nuts here's the thing I did have some popoff games with the crossbow while leveling it up it is also very hot or cold like a really cool spree and then I spend the rest of the game feeding like oh that was a sick triple kill and then I get spawned killed 20 times in a row with that sad don't fall after my footsteps have yourselves a fantastic day and I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
