hi ad hope you insist avert and welcome back to more star wars battlefront 2 I'm flying solo today it's big galaxy and I couldn't find my friends out there yeah don't know there it's another star system or something I'm not really sure so instead we're playing my tried-and-true we're playing blast which is essentially 8v8 deathmatch Star Wars style I want first order really bad I guess I'll have to settle on clones which isn't a bad thing after all we can be a clone commando but I really wanted to be a safe trooper um I got in this game mode but now it's oh wait a second Geonosis huh I like it yeah call me crazy I know a lot of my friends don't agree but I really like the clone era okay I know the prequels get their flack and whatnot but I think people are just hating the hate you know I'm saying I need to also remember you guys told me to put on rally up or toughen up whatever I just used it it's essentially like a stim Who am I okay ah okay I actually changed my mind this seems like a really good map for sniping and I unlocked what I like to think of as the OP in this game world it's like their bolt-action sniper rifle and yeah I'm a fan although that's map is just wide open I can't I keep five minute one they just had to choose the map that I haven't played before stupid droids I swear I'm gonna turn you into a he but John come here hmm like that yeah I missed on purpose boom but I didn't miss that I also have a cool card where if I get a headshot kill bro quit taking all my kills these these are all mine dibs on literally every droid in the match from now until forever so if you steal them you're a horrible human being well I guess you're a clone so that doesn't really apply all the other blast maps I swear are a much more hectic the first-order ones well it's gonna say they're my fit ah I just I just but I just oh my god is even bigger than I realize the heck but you know what I do have I think you guys told me to swap off this but whatever our sponsors an enemy or aren't here he's not going to expect this flank what the fudge who shooting me ah Jesus okay oh god this is bad yeah I need to take a sniper position yeah I can't come on now a little bit more oh god oh god oh oh shoot the arc trooper who needs the Republic command when you've got this guy totally forgot about him forgive me I'm pulsing uh-huh I see right here oh you're so dead what yes the longest time I didn't realize that the arc trooper can shoot both of his guns at the same time boy was that a game-changer I love the commandos and I have read the books but our trooper best trooper sorry at least in this game okay forgive me unfortunately I can no longer play in first-person everyone made fun of me some people like hey it's cool to see somebody in first-person - mr. fruit you were putting yourself at an insane disadvantage and you're right being able to peek around corners change shoulders all that kind of stuff it does lead but but my immersion you know alright I'm scanning the system what the fudge I just I just came all the way over here for nothing what happened to that dude oh he's alive I was I'd say alright check this out you don't know that I'm right here so I'm just gonna oh you damn boy I'm double cheek duh don't mess with me oh but I'm hero Droid over here I'm on point follow me it's blessed with his voice changer when you need them it's just got this shame oh my god and that George will never be the same either I just scarred him for life I'm gonna have to reprint him immediately but they lost the mold you know it's the last Roy to ever be printed g-good okay okay yeah who who thought this was a good ap8 map this is this is insane I I can't find anyone wait I found their spine well I do a lot of damage not so much at a distance hold on nice clutch reload me aha you hurt charge this up boom practically one shot you who's next oh I see him over there watch this charge shop Oh that actually connected yeah my face boy I need to learn how to use my electrical check job my electrical trap is well not very good at that let's see if I can find a pile of junk to try it on there we go shock trap I clicked it but I don't know if it did anything I'm out there spawn though I'm telling I'm not gonna die now once I've gotten the arc trooper it's it's over for that lucky for them they'll I can't find them nevermind I found one hey come back here good LAN they blend in so well on this map - it's not fair we stick out like a sore thumb that's fine we have the upper hand anyway ah or do we or do we oh I should have gotten to Kevin I just need to get enough points to be an art trooper again and then you're all done for what a fantastic Renea by myself oh my god wait what yeah I actually killed him oh well 97 Jesus what plan I know a lot of you guys do want to see me play heroes or thrones in fear not that will be happening but I want to try and play with my friends as well as ohm get him on the action he mentioned that so trying to find the time we can all coordinate and destroy together I am going to be the best SIF and/or Jedi the world has ever seen I totally thought I was the art trooper so I was trying to double tap and that's why I looked at guy was an idiot like this I'm running up on the enemy they're around here somewhere yeah I found him and mr. fruit trying to not suck you Sora stick - AHA and it worked hey there's a crowd over nobody knew they needed Final Fantasy 7 but cloud has that buster lightsaber wait I got 5th really ah we're the first order just wait until I get my hands on you my friend we are never gonna lose I do have to say though I like the clone era but I think the best trooper design is first order it's that sleek modern look you know although I always forget and I know it's stupid but this is technically way in the past anyway well yeah duh mr. Freed's a long time ago in a galaxy far far away yeah I just think of a galaxy far far away not the fact that all these events took place a long time ago you know what I mean can't hurt to the brain since they're like a head but they're not and also it's interesting too that like all the designs they have in Star Wars are technically because of the limitations they have when doing making for the most part back in the 80s they had to get crafty you know but I like the mixture and honestly I think that's part of the charm it gives there something grounded that people can associate with or a look at and be like oh I I get that not just space magic yeah what what are you doing down here in the crypts boy well if you insist I'll go ahead and bury you myself if you're you're so gung-ho on beam underground holy 193 baba we can only be sit Rupert Holden pack it up boys games already over check this out boom oh hello alright I'm apparently right next to like 8 million people all right

what I'm doing what the are they in here you yes yes they are what a solid grenade me I beseech the reason he's so good is you can just pulse and Mark people and then depending on how many people you kill in between like using the thing you can mark even more people it's incredible go ahead and die for me boy all right and then you let me go ahead and do this I forgot to reload but that's fine boom now you can see my little ability it has a 6 now so if I do this boom the 6 nearest people are March hello sir but don't mind if I just come up here and annihilate you and your friends ha ha ha ha I hate come back here what are you what are you oh wait are you that oh you are you're one of the special classes I just couldn't tell for the life of me but I think it was beating it down with his

rebellion class Willam ow good one yeah dad how about you huh rocket trooper not on my watch MIT maybe on my not on my watch leader I can mark 12 people like what are we marked the entire enemy team for a select amount of time but enough time he wouldn't need boom you're dead okay don't you need to activate that boom your dad I told you guys no one believed me a Sith trooper is the bestest Oh what a flank let me get the guy that's not looking at me first shoot his feet that's a solid grenade sir ah we're just gonna take a second to cool off they're cool our jets even though I don't have jets but I think I do in the movies but I can't give troopers everything I mean I'm already good enough you know I'm saying I they got that gunner class he's really good but I'm better toss Nate over there okay we're getting Nate it out here boys holy jesus fudge I'm just oriented like yeah all right tossing the grenade up there and I think I just made it myself fall my god I'm the one on the worst sit super in the galaxy the grenade what it does and it does some damage but also like delays health regeneration or healing effects and stuff so instead of hitting the enemy with it as I hack what if I just hit myself with it uh-huh 800 IQ and we got the kill with to health so well then I'm out of here they're all right up here oh you sweet summer children ow I look forward to destroying
