from the top rope i got you buddy i'm coming back he's got a needler of course heidi hello everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to halo infinite and in today's video i'm doing what no man has dared to do before or woman just person it's a controller say with me controller very good yeah anyway uh and then this what is this a dirty mouse yeah i like to call it a rat okay sorry um i'm gonna be swapping inputs every time i die that's right and not just in any mini mode i'm gonna do it in ranked i'm so sorry teammates but hey that's the point of you know open input you know that's what they meant by it they meant you got to play both i'm obligated to so that's what we're going to do that's my eyes also just so you all know looking for sponsors for this billboard a lot of free ad space right here so hit me up if you're interested god if i could delete anything from halo infinite it would be strongholds i don't know what it is it's like domination you know every i just don't like it in halo you know i don't know i don't know what to tell you okay starting off with the mouse and keyboard more at home with this these days let's see if it'll pay off from the top rope oh fudge that's mine give it to me who's shooting fudge and there we go more show about the rocket play not the uh not the input here but uh nice nades me my shot is crap i'm actually kind of surprised i ended up oh this isn't good this isn't good and just went back to the madison keyboard this is fun it's kind of like a little dance i hear him i hear him maybe i don't okay i'm here thanks i can use two inputs but not both my ears that's uh different motor function recruiting oh the dot damage from the distributive the electrocute i'm gonna be honest i don't really remember ah what this is called ooh the bulldog do i do it i think i do it what is what i got you buddy ooh that's a nice shot he had though nice little stray for roni i'm coming ba oh sheesh killing spree let's get it they're gonna try and nade me they're gonna think i'm gonna come around but i'm not cause i'm crazy come on oh suck what are they doing there okay and we're back to the controller the one thing though is i think my br shot is nicer when on the controller i mean yeah you wouldn't know because i'm back to mountain keyboard but the aim assist bullet magnetism you know what i'm saying like shoes but i'm just i'm so agile like so much better situational awareness and who is shooting from downtown funky like why are they even taking the shot all you're doing is tickling me it's rude i knew it ah come on y'all the one thing i do miss playing on console though is you know having my ready wait what what did he jump from the top rope with the steel chair what happened though i don't know i actually i hit that one of the dudes with my grenades now the real challenge is trying to use both inputs at one time maybe i'll try that that sounds unnecessarily hard so of course i'm gonna do it i wanna get off this rollercoaster ooh spanker in 20 seconds yes you know i'm into that stupid what are you mayweather huh i gotta reset a hold up what okay well there goes me rockets back up oh he didn't expect to see me climb up there frankly i i didn't uh expect to do that either stupid another killing spree with the keyboard mouse what am i doing but uh so far the only thing i've done is use keyboard mouse i'm mono what's the opposite of ambidextrous monodextrous yeah it kind of sounds right oh wait oh oh oh get off me zone stupid and you've got friends in all the right places unlike me alright control i'm embarrassing myself or am i victory take the spanx take the yeah nice oh oh you're fine you're fine you don't even need me reset a oh you're nuts you're dead oh oh we won oh look at that i did nothing with the the keyboard that's incredible uh 13 and 8 i mean 11 12 of those skills was keyboard and mouse i swear i'm all right with the uh we're gonna we're gonna start this one with the controller i'm going to prove that i can i don't need to prove anything though i already i recorded a video only using the controller and it popped off in fact i did better than i usually it was just poor timing is all capture the flag capture the flag i'd really rather not with my keyboard and mouse let's get it oh oh that is so unfortunate i wasn't even the one to grab them you know what you have fun buddy because i'm out he's up there me friends maybe not the best idea though like i could have done this in any playlist but for whatever reason i was like let's do it right yeah yeah i tried to backsmack the overshield and how did i i thought i killed the other dude did i not kill him okay but that's why it's first to five or unless j1 diddy last second can he do it oh my god my br shot's cracked yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo i'm helping what kind of a nade freaking oh that was it was a good try i'm trying okay all right this is it run it to me baby run it to me i'm looking for him oh i got him weak it's up to you i'm not changing inputs okay whoops oh that's weird i got a new controller again okay i'm gonna return the flag wait contested what the fudge what how did i get one shot all right fine back to keyboard mouse trying to prove a point that oh wait i stayed on it for two deaths didn't i whoops i forgot that i'm trying to i gotta use both but like clearly i can use the keyboard ah they do not lack the critical information uh okay you know i'll go sway i'll slay and get the flag okay i do be looking kind of nice with it though why did you not die i'm just okay i'm i gotta focus up here okay i'm feeling my own challenge spectacularly i'm going for the spanx no i'm not unless unless i don't outgun him he's one on them back to keyboard the fudge he's got a knee warrior of course okay the only unfortunate thing is i cannot flag run with control i'm only good at juggling on wow look at that just a hit squad as soon as i grab their flag wait what what the fudge am i doing hey why am i grabbing the fight we've already established that there's an overall shield there but also that this is and he's got it of course what a gamer oh ow dynamo he's won i think our entire team gets out and gunned at every corner myself included wait keyboard maps what am i doing oh i'm swapping midlife i'm going to pretend that that grenade kill came when i was using the keyboard mouse i threw it with wait wait wait wait wait what are you going to be perfect that's right nope run the other way that's a double check this out ready what it freaking i don't know i thought it would just come to me no matter what also how in the world are we ever gonna get their flag if uh our guys we don't even have anyone okay go jay muno there goes my hero he is so dead stupid go get him get bruh all right i'll do it i'll do it hey you want to grab that i'm feeling pretty good i'm feeling like a fragger right now stupid get absolutely pooped on killing spree with the with the keyboard notch again yikes i'm better with the keyboard mouse well it's controlled if we just have the stalemate forever spoilers they win so best case scenario [Music] the boys got dynamo grenades and that okay do i not do i anybody he's he's he's right in the yelp where the fudge did he have a gr where did he disappear to what i touched it i i did that i touched the thing he had over shield skirt come up i was i was trying i don't i don't know what i was doing never gonna end oh they're gonna get the spanker too aren't they awesome oh wait the kill that's huge i'm going for it i don't got it i waste that's my bet okay i'm going hold on buddy just a second just one more second is all i'm at what why i'm gonna help you out no i'm not cause here's the needler i'm dead nice nice nice nice nice nice nice now they do what in what world i i quit shooting because i'm like explode i'm pumping that dude full of metaphorical i don't know what the needles are made out of pink mystical crystals i don't know he's above me i hear him stomp him [Music] alright well he goes arden i go there then challenge me that's what i thought okay this could be going better now they know i'm over here my god they got cry this has been the entire match god i freaking hate it new combo here we go freaking freaking zoinks wait what mo i dropped my pistol what where's my pistol oh my god i don't have my piss it's just the mauler i got it i got it i got it oh my god i got it okay i just have to try and get their flag defeat all right we in the negative yeah most of those were still five and 18 plat one why are you here what they have onyx onyx onyx diamond six and then we get plat one what all right well you know amber then put that's not it i need to find a better word for it but that's it's just the ten it's a we're gonna workshop the name we'll come up with something better my people some focus groups that's not what's important what's important is yeah boy believe it or not can play both even though i think i got like four kills for the controller total that's incredible and then we didn't even win the capture the flag you know screw me so anyway thank you very much for watching happy results fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] [Music] you
