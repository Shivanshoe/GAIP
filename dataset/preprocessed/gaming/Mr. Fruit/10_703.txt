hi ad ho foon my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to the GG ovaries a podcast episode 29 video listeners see there's a little bit of a difference today audio listeners you can't really tell hopefully I've snuck in a box but we'll get into that very soon we also talked tons about TV shows because if you're spending some extra time at home you got some time to binge some stuff we have some recommendations aside from my youtube channel feel free to watch that for Rob's twitch or blues twitch or any of our associated friends content feel free to been joining Avast yeah exclamation raffle but we talked a whole bunch about that stuff and that's a lot of it we answer a patreon question because it turns it turns into a bit of a story time and all in all it's a couple of dudes being dudes or a couple of nerds we got to make it even more quick baby in than bigamous okay mr. fruit of naked and afraid mr. fruit demonetised go big Nick this is the episode good boy you mean welcome oh yeah hi welcome back to this episode of the podcast episode 29 Audio listeners will know no discernible difference for the most part Rob I kind of sucks yeah Rob that is crispy but he's here nonetheless we are throwing it back to legacy GG over easy for reasons I am going to skirt very carefully around because last time we mentioned it we got demonetized you know what I'm is that really the reason why we got yeah I will I will tell you 100% the reason because at the very beginning when we do our low intro I go oh and we didn't do our den Annette denna de and then I say the word and that's why no because I said - ooh text me and she's like why was the video demonetized I was like oh I don't really know and she goes was there not enough content or something I was like that's like ma that's that how can you imagine someone reviewing like this sucks t monetize I was like ma that's not and she's like why don't why don't you explain I was like I don't even know how it works mom like I don't even know why I got to monetize because it's okay so what do we say like we need a we need a code word and for those that like don't know what we're talking about you know that little thing going around that people are worried about that should be enough for them to be okay I know yeah the the certain alcoholic beverage people get it mixed up for that thing okay that thing let's call it Miller Lite so the Miller Lite okay blue better key word what it what is it we need we need a better one we don't want to go Miller Lite I feel like that's I mean straight-up go just like like penguins you know but we're not it's not no yeah fruits going around and nobody wants it yeah the fruits going around buddy everyone's trying make sure we don't get the fruit symptom giving you an example you're kind of right actually want to talk about trials yeah they're gonna be like wait what are we dying honestly I honestly don't think a we're going to call it Harambee how about that yeah let him never forget oh I saw speaking of Harambee both actually I saw in a thread someone's like I am a firm believer in chaos theory and I think everything that happened is right now is because we killed harambe yes somewhere is like no wait he's got like the red strings attached she's like I knew it I've been on this told damn but yeah so Harambee we mentioned it and so it's demonetised by a manual review which means someone was reviewing it somebody and he's like yeah because I was like uh there is no way they watched an hour and a half of this yeah because it comes within like the first minute so it's really easy they're just like oh cool okay bop cousin but I think we've I've said it by name before but it was just so far into it yeah and everybody was like stupid well no people have been getting demand highs for months it's just we oh really oh yeah yeah it's got caught no I mean you look like a potato let me see if I can make you pretty am i ugly dude this is what I was worried about he's like hey we're just I'm going to like not like do anything and nobody can come over anymore so we have to do like over webcam I was like great now I'm just gonna look like a frickin potato what my hey check your settings hey hey but quality cord yeah check like your maybe like your upload quality or something I don't know I don't know just as Logitech whatever man I mean come on we're ballers on a budget come on okay fine if people want to complain I said worst case scenario you can let just put a drawing over me you both you guys are both good artists hey I drew blue for the podcast okay at one point lot of time and effort let's just maybe you and harambe and move on okay it's for wrong guy's fault it honestly looks like you know that clip where the dudes like trying to talk really serious in his office and then his daughter comes through the doorway who you know that one what you've seen that clack it was a couple years ago he was like he was doing like a at home call on like Fox News or CNN or whatever and they were interviewing and then yeah and then his like wife comes in like like gradually runs out it just it kind of looks like that in your quality I'm getting the vibes from that it's not bad you just just don't move just okay I'll have to like pull as you move a lot okay oh we're getting up just a bit my legs are off the floor so now I am able to like just kind of chill out but I look like a gamer you do so anyway yeah we have to be careful about harambe and that is precisely why that is why we are currently in the manner that we are in this form back to legacy I mean not yay because I prefer going over to your house because that's when I can see it I also spend a lot of money on the tavern so I'm not getting so much you say yeah your parents basement and we have live footage of blue still yeah yeah we can't go without having blue but i but i was thinking to maybe in the future episodes we'll see if at least while we're doing this whole call thing anyway maybe go back to getting a couple guests for some episodes or something yeah that'd be kind of sweet maybe we uh maybe you at home could be a guest maybe not like maybe if you like like Will Smith like yeah for sure we could do a we could do a caller episode like welcome caller number 27 well here's the good news we wouldn't do it alone we'd have to screen them before yeah we would either screen them or just edit out be like hey okay you're one of those guys okay just let it that out they won't know that's true yeah we're not live-streaming it up yeah we're live right now we're not doing that I am looking to get cancelled so ggz will still continue that's how you know we're here for the long haul okay just because we're not doing it we're not quitting everybody's like GG ez is in here for a week that's a star attitude that is a star if I've ever seen one we earned a new star we're a letter now we're nine ten a lot wait we reload to it we've never even been a ten we jumped although we were 10 I can't just feel like Super Saiyan one to Super Saiyan 3 bro I mean they doing like a season like in one arc I was rest in peace at the gym the last day before I have self-quarantine myself just listening to some Dragonball remixes oh man just getting me so emotionally oh just like it's cuz it's like dubstep but then they take audio from like important fights or like people although they're like dyno dishes for like goku and gohan it's like piccolo he's like you were the first ever add yeah but no but it's like yes right so you're like let's get the pump and it worked I was almost like crying sometimes cuz i was thinkin about all times like like Gohan fighting Sal here almost dude yeah he's like my father or Vegeta during like the majin buu fight he's like a garage like I'm gonna leave you but just know it's like the first time Vegeta is gonna like sacrifice himself for the greater good finally and then he's like just anything does this bastard my character by the way though he's practically if there's a if there's a second man character it's Vegeta Goku in the medina should have been Gohan somewhere in there but that's not important speaking of animate Oh Rob had a good idea for this episode because of Harambee and people like myself and soon to probably be more people who are chilling at home quarantined self quarantined or enforced whatever it may or may not be or you're somewhere not in America and you're currently chilling around you need something to do well one go right on over to YouTube complex which lets my mr. Conte the gaming content you want to watch but if you don't want to do that or you've already done that we're gonna talk about some TV shows you can binge in the meantime if you haven't already should we got spoilers are we going to talk spoilers like this this could be a pretty spoiler like free one but it'd be kind of hard to try and convince this cuz we should convince somebody to watch a show they haven't watch okay that's what we do it should be we'll talk about shows but without any spoilers okay because we're going in assuming that whoever's listening that this hasn't heard it yet and so we have to convince them to watch it but without being like oh and this is how it ends or oh but then there's this twist it's exactly we just got to be like yo maybe there's like a something you won't see come in but we'll keep it as ambiguous as possible okay I kind of have like several recommendations and four different kind of hits you know what I mean you're like for your fields or if you want like action that kind of thing I'm gonna be kind of all over the place with mine Rob's Rob's ready blew I'm okay do you have some shows in mind so what's the criteria here we're just like some shows that we really enjoyed binging and you should binge or we're just yeah and is this just and is this like in the past year like a new current show or just a general one and it's about 25 years old I think yeah I think almost anything goes and if you can think of it or when you mention it try and look it up and be like if you do want to watch it if it's available on a streaming platform be like oh it's available on these or if not be like you gotta rent it or again let's just preface that my mr. fruit content is the best fruit on the this is the best video content you can get right of course of course especially during Harambee times I'm pulling up my shows now but otherwise we'll talk about shows I think I mean we've talked about it so much so I'm just going to go ahead Game of Thrones torn because I think there's nothing to be torn about that shows well no I see I think every season up until the last one is worth it but then can I recommend it no you just finally admit that the last season sucked I mean yeah yeah I mean like I I try to see it half glass full but it's not the ending that a lot of people want it like I'm okay with it it does kind of it does it kind of like puts the rest of the series in a little bit of a light or like a different light where it's like it's just not quite as good I wasn't super happy with it though and I'm not happy enough with it to recomm I don't know if I'm happy enough to recommend it to somebody recommend it I would I will you still what I would it I would just past past season seven cuz season seven is kind of sucks in some parts but a is just trash but like the first six seasons dude are masterpieces and they're so good like like you work out to like Dragon Ball Z and that kind of [ __ ] I would like work out to like Tyrion like saying some stuff in the courtroom it's almost exactly yeah very much and it's so and it's just like it's you go and do it and like you get to see the politics like that's what I watched Game of Thrones watch like and that's what I feel like season eight kind of was it was like flashy and cool than that kind of thing but like in season one through six it's like political like backstab me and like I like this guy but they're like oh [ __ ] that guy but like it's awesome so I that's what I love about it I almost feel I I think I've swayed towards the side of probably recommend simply one for the fact too because all these dope TV shows we got going out now with all these production qualities we're gonna look back and Game of Thrones is gonna be one of those series that started it so yeah I think about a game of Thrones one was like a huge cultural phenomenon but then it was one of the first shows to show that you can put in a ridiculous amount of money get an amazing product and it pays off like you know almost every episode like I remember eight million plus or it was getting towards that like Season seven or eight but like just showing people that like movies aren't the only way now and you can tell a lot of really cool stories and you don't have to like cut corners or anything and you can make it marketable even something like the fantasy genre which is which like I would say Game of Thrones for the most part is like low fantasy in a sense that like even the we talked about from the books they tried to do like exclude some of the more mystical fantastical stuff because they knew some people wouldn't be bored or be like soccer mom just not behind the red that's what they're thinking was so they kept some of the more like magical stuff in there but some of it they left out but still like a fantasy setting like who would have thought that was gonna be the thing that really took off well it's just like so it's just like so big on a scale like if I like want my [ __ ] like my favorite kind of series like something I would really want to be made I don't want it to be made into a movie I'd rather have like Amazon back if like eight episodes or something like that cuz you tell way more with a series well then I need to start The Witcher look that is something I ovalle have plenty right why wouldn't you recommend Game of Thrones you think season seven and eight is so bad that it ruins everything like by the time you finish it you're like [ __ ] this show we owe a lot to Game of Thrones right all the TV shows we have right now which are like have so much production quality would not exist without Game of Thrones being there to help you like all right like movies that's tight but like TV that's tight too now Gareth Rhodes was like so like the first four seasons are some of the best it will probably always be some of the best TV in the history the hotel appears so perfect and masterful show kind of smart to Peter off round five and six hey-oh see you earlier than me see I think five and six are still dope if I went six are still really die compared to other shows five and six are probably still like it's still I get a - I like seven it definitely wasn't written as well yeah I'm now eight never before have I seen such a show with such a cultural phenomenon just lose all of that prestige in a matter of a few episodes I would point the Lost but that was before like social media read oh man I think it would have been just as bad Game of Thrones Season eight makes lost looks like a masterpiece alright let's be honest watch lost I've watched all of us and it was a cop-out right it was a cop-out but at least like stupid and at least it was at least it was a cop-out like that's like like it's like a cop-out they okay with roads just straight up like hey let's there's one thing of like that's not how I thought it would in and literally nothing I watched just mattered because nothing it none of it happened see but at least lost was at least lost ended like that at least the lead up was really good with Game of Thrones an entire season was just no no your honor no no season four and then they ruined the best character in I'll say the Kami okay well they ruined him don't say it says it or we're not doing spoilers because I feel like this is one if you don't think I'm of Thrones and that's your fault okay Game of Thrones is definite a little more ambiguous but wait how did you ruin that yeah that's true it's very true which is why which is why he needs to be Joel in the Last of Us he needs another shot your people you like okay okay so might so my TLDR is how you it shows that if your ending is bad you can totally erase the legacy of what was essentially one of the greatest shows of all time 1% which after season 8 is Game of Thrones people don't really talk about it as like oh this is one of the great shows of all time not as often as they used to because Game of Thrones was like and everyone's less like oh this is e that was talked about all the time and within a week just does it yeah nobody everyone just a few episodes right like we're breaking bad like everyone's still talking bad like I love Breaking Bad I love the idea or even avatar Oh avatar incredible show I love this Oh movie no one is going to be like people probably still will be but they kind of killed their legacy in one season yeah so I mean every time you talk about Game of Thrones like us you have to be like Game of Thrones is great asterisk season yeah as long as we're talking about recommended I don't think it's that bad to absolutely destroy the show cuz I think there's one like I said one through four is just that good yeah and I just even five I say some of seven and then seven and eight even though they weren't the strongest if you just cut to like fight scenes and stuff those were great it's just the storytelling everything else was pretty bad yeah or just like you throw it out the window but like watching some of the the big battles and stuff he did with like the big budgets that's cool especially towards the later seasons but I mean earlier especially if someone really and like medieval fantasy that kind of stuff definitely think you should watch it and the stuff that I still think you can like especially somehow you've avoided like any spoilers and Game of Thrones yeah like well done I don't know how yeah then like some of the twists and turns yes some of the twists and turns are still worth it it's just it's just solid it's maybe I think it's not as like the best season one ending like any show ever oh I remember I remember watching that cuz I was like wait a minute like this doesn't have as I wait so what's the show about yeah and unfortunately that was win season one chemische I didn't have anything else to watch I was like I was already binging at that at that point so Game of Thrones figured we'd had to talk about that one but blue mentioned a very good one that I was going to mention avatar I've ever last airbender absolutely absolutely really like if you're in like you would recommend that over like if you're an anime kind of person you would recommend that over like like other like come on well technically people don't know what is anime oh but it is come on I mean come on but I would say animated series it's probably my favorite it's it's good I I was like a kid so like you know when like you come home from school like oh avatars on sir I'll watch this one so you never like really caught every episode that's how I was I was ignore me unlike you guys no one yeah I know you guys are diodes ivory washes so many times oh really has one of the best character arcs in a show I know about like that yeah I mean it's not much of a secret I mean got some great character arcs this the C series doesn't go on or too long it doesn't drag out what you almost shows is it only not even 60 look it up you have a computer right in front pretty sure it's sixty three seasons of 20 episodes oh that's not bad and I thought it was way longer for some reason no and I mean like it was so good though I was like I want more but I mean it ended really poetically yeah yeah it it ended well it all came together characters were great storytellers great animation like I cannot stress that enough if you have not seen it you should do I'm I'm gonna bring a fighting words between you two now because I think you two differ on this opinion what do I pick do I pick Avatar The Last Airbender or do I pick Korra which I think you can't watch one without watching the other yeah you also can't fully understand Korra yeah well yeah some of the characters and nuances I mean they introduce a lot of new characters but you'll miss a lot of stuff you just be like I don't get it or you want to understand the significance of this character showing up or this scene blah blah blah that's hard to say I'm still I still prefer Cora because I think some people will look at a lot of avatar the original series through very rose-tinted nostalgia glasses cuz man that show was slow sometimes hostile yet so brave not that controversial to anyone who like looks at objectively like that's a brain and with best shows ever probably best western cartoon of all time right but show was super slow sometimes I mean Korra has its faults too but I feel like the payoff in Korra and a lot of stuff is a lot more I will I will say in the original avatar right here free like I could hear like steam coming out of is that the same in chief is saying it Zuko no no character in either series comes close to to Zuko's character arc ya know yeah and a lot and as much as like Aang is chill like [ __ ] like Zuko Zuko game for life destroyed but I think I think Cora had lower lows though Oh first season of Cora I think is the best avatar there is like that fall for a season well to me oh that was oh and the world-building well they love and in show a few episodes to the Isle of Cora so much because the first season to so much world-building and the show never really stops world-building so it just does such a good job of expanding on what you're already cuz you're wondering all these questions like what happens to these people what happens to these kingdoms and Corey answers questions but then Wow - we don't need to talk about that season yeah that's fine trash it's so bad it wouldn't even worse avatar season yeah it went through a lot ups and downs tragic Cebu and the problem I blame Nickelodeon nickelodeon's kind of the fault here why is that it's they gave him so many limitations even in the final season they were like hey like you got a cut episode like what like what if you've never seen Korra look at watch an episode of like season 1 yeah and you'll see that animation the art the love that's put into that and then watch one from like season through season 4 it's like a no no no he's way over exaggerating maybe I'm like freaking job no you can I that I will admit that there are if so less lower sections no it's short was that trash that is trash he's very it's very overblown maybe somebody's looking at Korra with rose-tinted glasses blue that's not fair because you look at you you're comparing like different frames this is like the the issue with that dragon ball super head Dragon Ball super yes has supers animations pretty bad now Oh at some points and when it first started it was but no the first season yeah had great animation and obviously their budget got lower and lower but but they never compromised because that slow points its character points yeah the animations not quite as there but like at that point doesn't matter the characters the animation is never an issue in the show that takes you out of it like that's that's your that's a big reach huge reach season two I can see that because there is a big dip and send the animation because you can tell all their budget went into the first avatar section what was his what's his name the chapter demo they explained the origin story of how the avatar what's his name me Eddie huh it was such a six story no no one one ah ah you're almost definitely telling season 2 all their budget went into one story which is dough but like the rest of these and sucked but season three best Avatar season not even close the whole series season 3 season 3 the bittersweet that's AB adult theme [ __ ] that's a pretty weak that like you brought it that's pretty weak that's pretty weak well the the thing to that kind of ruined Corps was Nickelodeon like stopped airing it Korra towards the end was only available online and even wasn't yeah they're being dumb that's why I like they pulled budget and stuff like I saw the first season of course like this is amazing and then then tendo's like not Nintendo Nickelodeon's like oh oh you like that well let's just ruin it and so I don't know why houses so it was so confusing cuz the response to season 3 was like massive like and then season for high quality online season 3 was like oh this this season was made like this season like brought me back like this wasn't using to it was bad but season 3 was amazing like season he brought me back like season 1 did and then we're going to the season 4 with so much hype and Niccolo just like mmm no you're gonna be online only and also you have to cut an episode it's like [ __ ] what Nickelodeon is like notorious for cutting good time yeah invader zim was sick and then nickelodeon was like no like well speaking of stuff that sucks let's take a break real quick oh that does suck the we may not break watch handbrake watch the head break doesn't suck let me let me reiterate the ad doesn't suck just that you know you gotta take a break from the podcast anyway here's ya

sanitizer it's like gold right now oh yeah I was thinking about this the other day but my parents have so much sanitizer and then I have like oh I managed to get a couple like my jars of it resell it bro it's time to the boomstick I was saying no I'm saying cuz my dad has this little Santa's like he's like oh he's like before you go to the store like here he said just one on like its keychain I was like I was like I was like dad like you you can't be showing people that you're gonna get robbed you're gonna get a job sanitizer you're gonna get Safeway and like they had a pump at the thing I was like that's gonna guess we gotta like Oh as I respect the game but like that's very nice I was at my cursory store and they had to they put they put zip ties on the the anti antiseptic wipes put zip tie well because they have like a little you know they have like the little box where you take them but they please zip ties on so they people wouldn't open the wow just like the do you want the antibacterial or god it's ridiculous but we were just talking about how Nickelodeon was dumb canceling shows and stuff I think I won't go on this for too long but I think this is a good super easy series to binge too because there's only like eight episodes I know what you're gonna say what am I gonna say Firefly my man that's right they did this show so I've shows that got done everybody it's that Firefly yeah like I can't think of one done more dirty if you don't know what we're talking about come on I mean this was like potential people liked it but Fox so here's the problem there's some people I don't know the story so Firefly is like seven or eight episodes it was one of Nathan Fillion role kind of like break that rules so yeah okay that's Nathan Fillion it's like a space Western it's essentially what Mandalorian does now but just earlier and it wasn't Star Wars themed that's why I like Mandalorian now cuz it a lot of the time it gave me Firefly vibes which I like so that super dope loved it but the problem was it was on Fox originally but Fox aired all the episodes in the wrong order when it first came out so everyone watching it's like what like I don't remember the first order but I definitely don't think the pilot was first the last episode was like somewhere in the middle like I don't know how they botched it this bad yeah so it came out and understandably a lot of people are confused they're like off gratings aren't there and they just cancel it and that was it but there's like a cult following like it was so good and if you watch it in order really this is great I thought there was like a reboot that was coming no so they finally made a movie a couple of years ago to like kinda just put like a period on it to shut you guys up what well I mean the Firefly casts themselves like loved it too and wanted it to come back but there's nothing they could do about what is it about can you tell me what it's about sell me on because I've never seen it I mean it's pretty much that so it's Nathan Fillion is this I don't he's not quite like a space pirate trying to exactly remember his like a star-lord kind of like from guardians of the galaxy well so yeah he just kind of like goes and ragtag guy yeah he's he's not working with many people and he has his own like super like janky ship but eventually that comes on this planet meet some people slowly builds a crew kind of like Mandalorian and then it's all about them on the ship and what's happening and there's this girl they find there's a whole bunch of questions about her so it's a lot of questions about the people he meets with that are on the ship who they are why they're now tangled in this mess because of this girl and they don't understand and it's sick and like literally I mean it's like seven episodes like twenty minutes each yeah that's why I'm saying like yeah you could you could watch that and then watch something else for the rest of the day but I really liked it and yeah I think I think it could have been great but bringing Fox and people are stupid so here we are well okay I got a question are you guys like big sitcom guys like like do you guys like sitcoms not really really like not at all like you did you not watch Boy Meets World like growing up I did I mean same thing it was just flipping channels oh yeah like Boy Meets World yeah well I do I've been like rewatching it because the Disney Plus and it's so good dude you can be like laughing and then like 30 seconds later you're busted out crying I love it dude like what like it's so intense I don't know how they do it every episode I'm like I'm something Wow I'm going to apply that I've become a better person yeah I was like wow when I was little I was looking through the eyes of Corey and now I'm looking through the eyes of the dad and I don't even have kids it's SoDo you should watch it if you like say comes now or the office if you haven't I mean yeah at this point plus you want to do it soon because it's gonna be off Netflix here soon that's what I think that's the best thing on Netflix honestly I don't like I don't watch a lot of like Netflix exclusives honestly I don't think they're that good really they got some bangers I think like in terms of like other streaming platforms I think the other sharing platforms have bigger bangers what they got well I first off stranger things which is like the biggest I think exclusive stranger season 3 was pretty weak i stranger things season 3 was kind of weak I don't know how you guys feel about it I would not recommend it I mean I think I mean I walk them into see a black men recommend the series I don't think they'll ever beat season 1 Oh season 1 is great television I'd recommend that but then just kind of maybe stop I mean let me look at the list of Netflix exclusive orange is the new black that's but always creative and received really well never gave it a shot my step-brother Mitch loves it though stranger things obviously narcos our house is cool the first seasons sake but then they kind of I think putters off Bojack horseman I'm not on Adult Swim I don't think so no hmm well shame what happened to this one - way to go Kevin Spacey a house of cards that was I loved it and then of course he just had to go in I don't know how much people like some of these mine hunter I know some people really like Ozark we tried sitting I tried it we just didn't hate I'm gonna be honest I tried mine hunters um Claire really liked since eight but I've never seen that what's the one you've been talking about like plus ultra or something like that like like the one on Netflix you got you tried to watch it then you're like I'm gonna throw out Oh altered carbon altered carbon yet people are like that one series of unfortunate events I had the books are better I'm sorry well I mean yeah the Oh a I think of heard good things about 70 mall so I just want to say for the record I didn't read those books I had them read to me okay I read books here I remember liking them so much because of the hardcover and then the pages all they're really cool they're yeah like well good pages that me also did it to where like it was all the pages were different lengths so it felt really cool like you know one time I had that like like your diary oh yeah some we've been so really that but uh I love dear double I never gave it a shot never I like superhero movies I don't want to see superhero shows the Umbrella Academy which I love season two is coming out soon altered carbon black mirror obviously people are like that one black mirror has some cool episodes and also somewhat monka w episodes yeah they have like they're really hit or miss some really yeah and some are like what well they're also just like so like each episode is completely different from each other yeah they're just slowly many stories almost like what's that old nineteen like The Twilight Zone yeah that one yeah which that's come back recently right with like yeah I haven't you anything about it though which like makes me feel it makes me pretty shitty I feel like I've the only thing I've heard wasn't great okay I were also hey for all your thinkers out there I would recommend watching jeopardy I think there are some jeopardy episodes on Netflix like they have some dope once that's how you get your learning in that's what I do then I haven't played in a long time though haven't played in a long time I [ __ ] own at jeopardy I just no dumb stupid useless stuff American manhandle like Oh have you seen that one no but I've heard it's it's hilarious yeah I heard it's super good it's like a mockumentary thing it's fantastic yeah Jessica Jones was good that's like another superhero one right yeah well they had some good shows but then their marvel like contract expired they could only make like six seasons all together something of like Marvel stuff so they say no you know what I watched this weekend and just remind me of like just crazy reality TV show just how it's so bad I was watching like the last episode of The Bachelor and I was like I forgot I like bad trashy television but it also I was just like man barb that ain't cool girl like but then I was like oh my [ __ ] god like I'm quoting The Bachelor right now and then like the other guys like that lady looks like barb I'm like what am i doing right clear my mom were you just talking about them Oh apparently he was like a great Indian Orange I have no idea but yet people been talking about that non-stop it's just like trash like I love my trash television to like I used to love like the Flavor of Love I don't know if you guys ever watched bro Flavor of Love see but Flavor of Love was so good only because of one person and that was no it was a and he was like the dude like trying to find love okay and specifically it was that was real name like Tiffany or some [ __ ] if any something but she calls up New York but hold bro she made that show that wasn't Flavor Flav's show got like her own spin-off and I think he's still very successful in like that that she was liking she like a mean before memes existed you like with pumpkin Spit on New York I'd say spoiler oh and there's oh man and then she's never driving to school the next day with my mom I'm not driving cuz I must like be like eight or nine I don't know maybe 10 or 30 I don't know if Flavor of Love came out maybe I was like 12 I can't really remember what year but they were like talking about it on the radio they're like I can't believe new you're like spit on pumpkin I was like yeah can't believe that you should just sat there at each food yeah it just reminds me do the trash television how much plastic trash TV like road rules real world challenge like they'd always compete and like just stupid things I love that that was trash television a lot of good there's a lot of good trash television like reality shows but I don't really watch him anymore like old Fear Factor was sweet good old Joe Rogan back in his heyday yeah I love old Fear Factor they try to bring it back but and I don't know well I was completely lost there but I'm glad you guys III never really watched any like the MTV or vh1 any of that kind of stuff well you are allowed to young man I don't think I wasn't allowed to just oh really just didn't yeah I just use that never really caught on to it for entertainment why I remember there's tune in and some stuff like what is like pimp my ride I'm like what the other ones I never really ever caught Rob and was wasn't trash television that was called yeah that's great television that's like that I never saw that I saw like my sweet 16 or whatever and I was like oh that's trash but come on Oh like after you watch room Raiders and sweet 16 comes on and she's like my name is Lauren and I've want some Egyptian party I'm like Lauren let's see all right like sure I'm in going back to Netflix though this is one I would definitely recommend I don't think either of you've seen it peaky blinders going Dutch isn't it like Fanta it's like back in like around I think after World War one I believe kind of like gangsters it's gangsters in somewhere I think a part of England or something oh go on then and it's super good Tom Hardy comes in to later on and I left on Martin oh but peaky blinders would definitely recommend that my only issue with it is there's like mastering audio mastering problems with it we're like I need my TV on a hundred to hear it but then I go in a different Netflix show it's like whoo but then you go and piggy buncha thing and this episode of pick what I can turn it out it's like a show where it's like but when it's like in an action scene you have it turned all the way outside well that the problem is one it's already low but then the talking is like super like thick English accents of his like yeah you're like what like Tom Hardy I love him but when he came in that first episode was like bro is this English I had to turn caption I was like this can't be English I so but I still recommend it it is a fantastic show [Music] see like I think bigmouth I know what people Lauren over all those shows combined easily Mandalorian is sick Oh Castlevania oh that's what boo that's a video game and like have you seen it and the anime is so high wit early season 3 almost as perfect ratings across the border they do what do you mean what do they do it's Castlevania they just cannot Dracula why don't you watch the show I don't know what it's about that it's the Belmonts story of the Belmonts which is their family right yeah that is Richard and bringing you know that is that's who says ether ether that's what it is I thought that was cross the thing he goes ether does he I thought that was kromm's of this expert I have no idea is it blue who says ether ether that's like oh I get when he uh pees right yeah yeah no I think they say uh holy water or something okay but that's Richter and Simon okay and they're vampire hunters and so it's a story about you'll have to see it it's kind of cool and it has like some underline a it is well it's Western like Netflix is own anime I think Western development house show but people get very technical they'll rebut there but it's made in the West I don't know sorry three years is anime okay the best way I would put it is pop maybe here is called pop pop made in like Korea's called kpop you know I it's like ultimately they kind of served the same purpose but I think for them like anime is something produced by Japan by the way we stand BTS for all you BTS fans out there but anyway it's a super dark show it's like mature and it just takes a super dark twist and it has some crazy social like undertones and explore some really cool ideas and it's great so I would recommend that there's only third season just came out and they're only like 20 minutes apiece they're not like there's not a ton of it so you could definitely get through that I also recommend my hero academia crunchyroll and watch that well I mean if we want to go an anime that's a rabbit hole alright I think we had a discern you saying like one anime real quick if I was to pick one and for all you anime Watchers don't watch last avatar the Airbender watched by hero Mike it's not even an anime it's the same thing no I wouldn't I would I would throw that in a different category you see you're like some people would read you're one of those people that read it's just different it hits different you know if know if it was if the native language isn't Japanese then it's not like if I'm not listening to it in Japanese and reading subtitles it's not anime I have no idea but also you're recommending a show out of like the three anime shows you've seen well yeah but it's the best anime I don't know attack on titan is pretty sick actually that's a good question let me look up like highest-rated animes if you'd like like it's gotta be it's gonna be some old ones I imagine like YuYu Hakusho or some way samurai Champloo is rated anime Cowboy Bebop like one of those yeah so I mean Google's first results I don't know if this isn't order we have Cowboy Bebop Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood never watch it oh shut the [ __ ] up Rob Brotherhood right now okay I got this a bad time to say I haven't seen oh go get that tattoo want me to get those removed because you don't deserve them if you don't watch full malakas brother guy i feel like this is how long is it I feel like this is last night though and we were playing and you're like good goal like what are you doing here last night we're gonna play warzone and fruits like DMS Mian abuses of yoga because we play blow blow whatever we figured out we all joined voice and casually I joined and fruit says as casually as possible yeah I was gonna go play with oh man h2o delirious but we already made plans with you guys so let's get the war zone it was like I but the driest ways possible I'm like what the [ __ ] are you doing here go good friend well she hide like we've made plants is like the begin by the day we were planning so I was like I'm not just gonna like ditch it like cuz we were like waiting and stuff so just be like now that we're finally here like yo sorry like um just hit me up but there's like closing the Gabe I what are you blue I go play trials did appreciate that but that's when they reminded me I'm just like I watched that video today actually that was a Bangor video it was fun well then I have another son like new like first of 100 P meme blow it out and then I was like no way that was with me and blue in that video I was like who did he play with and it was omen ACOD leader she was like oh no no that was satellizer yo tomorrow we'll have HT total areas which hto hilarious probably means nothing to rob but oh he only has a small amount of thirteen point two million subscribers so okay that's it nothing yeah he whenever and he was he's the dude that everyone was always like oh dork sounds like this dude oh that's cool and I told blue ironically when I like playing with him last night straight up at points was like I forgot you're delirious or not dork like between the voice the microphone quality and then just the way like their mannerisms I was like like you're practically one in the same that's really funny except 3-way hornier yeah as if I say delirious might just not be into as much anti but we don't know yeah he's just not as publicly I'm on the podcast but again I also don't think he probably retweets like Godzilla titties yeah like maybe a year and a half now we might be coming about to well I I just stopped linking it because I think dork was the one if someone's like like don't link that I think dork is like stop linking it I was like oh sorry Twitter when he does videos with us yeah cuz like oh yeah just but he's like no because then like people follow me and then just ask me like what am i doing he's like you're the one that decided to follow me so he's just like just just don't put that I don't want these people fall it means like alright but yeah you'd like anybody they need like just a disclaimer like if they go to click dorks fall a button they just need to know what they're getting into yeah and you just kind of scroll across dork favor did because you don't want to see what he favorites let alone and this for some reason Twitter's Agra news like hey I know I know you're having dinner with your girlfriend's parents for the first time but uh here's this that you're welcome oh my gosh it's just a saggy old titty I can't tell you how many times no meme i can't mute him because yeah he's your boy like he's your but at the same time oh yeah like about him over here like hmm it's Friday huh you know I'm gonna go out my parents and let's go get some dinner with them and I'm just sitting there I'm like um to twitter twitter tater whoa it's not just it's like villager it's like titties bigger than like us if you were to fuse all three of us together you just got some weird stuff the rest on this list I've heard of this I don't how to say it code geese code geese that's guys bro I have no idea Code Geass nah I have no idea I've actually I've actually never known him pronounces that's why I'm gonna look it up right now yeah no no it's GE a SS I'm not really sure to say that Oh pregnancy pronounced pretty funny though that that's a thing people look it up like like what is this code code Gaius Gaius okay code Gaius Dragonball um I mean demon there yet come on Neon Genesis Evangelion I know that one's a big cult classic that's like where they flats at Gundam right kinda time non Gundam a Stein skate I've never heard of that one oh dude that's rojos favorite one who loves that uh he's one of my friends he likes wares but he's a bit he's like sammy anime level you know what I mean like you like we like anime like there's me who's like a very casual anime fan and then there's you guys who like kind of dabble into animes like nicely and then there's people who read the manga like claim your fare the rub I think you're in our group because you elevate once you get a tattoo okay fine I'm with you guys then because of these okay and welcome my wee brother likes Sami you know like then there's rojos right there with him and that's his favorite he swears but he's like if you watch anything you watch science gay right now and I said okay so but now I got a watchful Alchemist Brotherhood know that was sooner than I thought 2011 that's not as old yeah yeah it's pretty nude he said it's not that long he says about it's about like time travel that's all yes a group of friends create a time machine capable of sending messages across time and cause ripples through the past and present yes he says it is very cool and very epic I'll check it out we also have yep samurai champloo has the dopest intro to any anime ever I've watched like the first like six episodes it's pretty dope dude like the like it has like really dope like hip hop instrumentals in the background while like there's like conversations it's really cool I like it a lot it's very interesting I haven't finished it though there's only like 20 or something episodes it it's not very long but it's really dope next one I have been recently actually someone's told me to watch this Gurren Lagann I believe it's from like good or not good is that a so okay good your logon is the pinnacle of mixing hype at storyline with s tier animation that isn't a better than attack on Titan I'm like no I don't know okay well that's what a con Titan is storyline and animation like well okay animation why is attack on Titan this different level but that's because it's the year 20 2007 but back in the day 2007 Gurren Lagann animation was I mean it's even to this day the stylization is just beautiful he's Elijo 'ls up but it's not like I mean you see tak and Titan like that straight budget like it doesn't surprise me though because that's um I forget the studio name studio trigger or whatever they've done like we like Caleb Starling in the paper and stylized yeah so that's also best anime opening of all time no cap don't have to check it out one piece can't say I know it's at like episode yeah just yeah it's just watch like the first 200 and then it really ramps up yeah just go ahead and catch up where it like not laces to be bro we got 923 is the latest episode 900 I'll speed read some of these we got ghost in the shell' bleach hunter hunter attack on titan full metal alchemist psycho-pass Death Note FLCL I don't Netflix is way better so when you guys talk about television and you're actually like binge this show FLC was gonna be my pig FLC I've never even heard of that fully cooling foody Coody that's just like it's such a weird show but it's like very it's very much about like trying to grow up too fast and like I was i watch that show at the exact age group as the protagonist so that show hit different with me it's very weird by today's standards it came out swim it came out in 2003 but they just had a season in 2018 so they rebooted it like was it's right there but they're all separate storylines I haven't been watching it oh oh I haven't watched it cuz I don't want to ruin the legacy of the ocean it's I don't know bottle okay Bart that's your straight trash moving departure we got watch the new seasons because the roles are all separate storylines it's not like they're the same it's like in the Scent set in the same universe type thing but I just haven't watched it but yeah for rigid the first fully coolly was like my favorite Rose ever it's very uh I know each relate to it really hard it's very weird though it's a very weird show I'll actually go according to IMDB the ones with at least 10,000 votes highest rated I'll do top 25 number one Brotherhood number two definitely three Hunter hunter for Cowboy Bebop 5o pong to see this one one punch man well I assume that's maybe not with season 2 season 1 was a banger my opinion season 2 definitely brings the average down for me yes season what is fantastic season 1 was like peak wolf 6 attack on Titan 7 steins gate 8 one piece 9 Dragon Ball Z 10 your lie in April 11 Code Geass 12 monster 13 full metal alchemist 14 berserk 15 Rurouni Kenshin trust in potato roti Kenshi and that was also like a classic adult slow Joe is that can't you I don't know raw number 16 my hero academia 17 erased 18 because it's new well my attack on titan death note they're all up there they're really new wait wait no dad no Oh death 2006-2007 I thought it was way more reason well no I mean let's see well attack on Titan in one punch man 5 & 6 are super recent another point 18 artists ship in a nineteen mushishi 20 samurai champloo 21 ghost in the shell' 22 Dragon Ball 23 rurouni kenshin wandering samurai 24 neon genesis evangelion and 25 Dragon Ball super even though it's only been one season it's disrespectful Neon Genesis Evangelion being solo is mad surprising to me okay to be fair though Rob it might not have 10,000 votes on IMDB okay because it's so new I don't know I would definitely put Demon Slayer up there though look I have so far it's so good and I cannot wait for the movie well that comes out ironically I just found some anime I'm gonna add to my list so and well apparently Brotherhood first do I need to watch you need you don't need to watch the original no is it like a complete completely different so the first one was made but as as manga happens they they don't have the like the the manga doesn't come out quick enough for the animated release so the anime kind of the original one took some creative privileges which we're not nearly as good as full Milberg full malakas Brotherhood so but so if i watch Brotherhood episode 1 I'm not going to be like wait no you don't need to watch the original okay watch brother Brotherhood is they both tread the same path it's just Brotherhood is is like closer to the original then the original manga manga then the orginal show was make some alright well I said we wouldn't talk about anime but we talked about anime so let's listen to this at break and then come back to other normal TV stuff okay and welcome back to the normal TV stuff we got through our anime i we always seem to rather than somebody i think people are sleeping on it at the same time though it's definitely become more and more popular all for sure the fact that's when you know it's nor me once Rob gets on it like that's very once we Rob started watching and I was like I can't watch anime anymore leads to Normie Normie in force ok so I think we mentioned a few blue and Rob are there's some other ones that immediately come all there's one show I want to watch really bad and I've heard it's like when you say like shows like breaking bad and like this show they wake fight yeah wait one real quick we should say I don't even this should go without saying Breaking Bad watch Breaking Bad yes yes watch Breaking Bad I don't care what you're doing and don't listen anyway anyone elses head witch watch bring a bit it's on Netflix till right it better be it's so good watch Breaking Bad the wire had any of you guys ever watched the wire no but I've heard really good things about that - yeah it's one of like the highest rated TV shows I think yeah that's like what show that I really want to start watching is the wire I heard that shows really really good Oh blue have you watched no the wire is a great show it's just so you think it's really not telling you how hard like why people turn up to the wire and it's so like why is that you think no it's just so like oh man like this show was so oh my god today I watched the wire and I learned about the ghetto that was such a good show oh is that was about it's a great show don't get me wrong city but it's like a drug dealer in like the projects but like and her like man this is a [ __ ] department to like more for that show than like real-life minorities I'm beyond diligence I've seen the wire okay I stand the wire all right yeah welcome I need to watch that but that's like one of the shows that I've heard is like super super good but that now that blue says that no it's a great show I've just back of the day was like oh my god have you guys seen the wire such a good show that's about right it's like oh my god yes so drunk yeah it's just like real life I'd also really like to watch The Sopranos I never got into The Sopranos but that's like the first show my dad watched my and that's like in the time we're like they were burning shows on VHS is and my dad would just come home with a bunch of VHS as his friends burn from The Sopranos my dad didn't want to buy HBO so that was the first time I ever saw my dad binge was The Sopranos he would literally watch it all the time I looked up on IMDB top rated TV shows met you will not guess what's number one wait one year what year what you tryin so I looked up top-rated TV shows on IMDB and I do not think you guys will get number one or two oh I remember Modern Family have you seen the list was I remember I'm pretty sure it's planet Earth yeah planet Earth planet renters everyone Osmos no planet Earth choose one planet Earth second like the first one wait like playing it's like this right here is a are you bagging on my boy David at borough and his Cubs thanks hangman's have Cubs I don't know haven't seen him I just see the clip so it's like the snakes find its prey and the lizard runs that one like and I'm like whoa this is sick so I could understand why that's number one I just never yeah I just wanna I just thought of more like episodic series I never really thought of that is a name across my mind yeah cuz what I thought it was technically I guess the first TV show that isn't like a nature documentary because yeah I mean I think they're more like a documentary kind yeah they're definitely a different category it would not put them as like entertainment but but maybe not Band of Brothers which I can show is extremely about like it's an HBO show about yep a platoon in World War two and the crazy thing too is it came out 2001 the amount of stars in that yes is insane there's so many people and the thing too is because this was before like for a lot of them this was like their first thing like I'm like oh my god that's that's so ensue oh my god and he's oh my god and then like and people just showing up for small little parts - bender like so many people in it Donnie Wahlberg is in this yeah there's a ton [Music] - rumors in it Tom Hardy I go through mall and some huge people - yeah just coming for like a little thing and I'm like nowadays yes you had Jimmy Fallon had like a like a minute cameo yeah it's crazy I love that show we definitely recommend it's a miniseries I think it's like in episodes it's like it's like a Chernobyl series just like yeah I swear they like they like save like a concentration camp that's crazy yeah yeah but yeah fair warning it's heavy yeah like if you're not ready for something - like yeah you got to be prepared yeah then Breaking Bad absolutely understandably that shows great that show so good like I caught up with it on Netflix at freshman year at college that is literally all I did was watched Breaking Bad on Netflix and then I caught up to it like way the final series oh yeah it ended I was are sad because it ended yeah and then technically number three Chernobyl great did you finish it mm-hmm oh great yeah I love that show that well the good news is that's the guy gonna be directing The Last of Us really yeah that's gonna be really sick so if he just brings his a game like that yeah it's gonna be good technically well technically then there's blue playing it - but again we'll just assume exclude him at number four we as it's rides down this wave number four is the wire and I am surprised number five is Game of Thrones I would have thought people would have like bombed it after the last they probably did I but it has 1.6 million votes it's probably the highest voted ones I mean it's still so good like come on yeah I mean like like blue said it can't ain't like the last season contained it but still like pretty crazy then we have again a lot of these we have our planet cosmos a spacetime Odyssey cosmos which by the way both are dope I've seen both the one with the earth is flat guys the older one with its propaganda like out Carl Sagan and then the newer one with Neil deGrasse Tyson both fantastic wow I did not see this coming so technically number six Rick and Morty oh dude yeah man Rick and Morty is so [ __ ] good but you just can't get past what I can't but like six greatest TV show that's kind of crazy it's so good like but like you gotta have a big brain to understand oh wait never mind I totally agree with this list because number seven Avatar The Last Airbender is it yeah not surprising Wow it's above The Sopranos take that Sopranos surprise number eight as the Fran is number eight yeah my dad loves The Sopranos he would go to he would stand Sopranos number nine I haven't heard about it the world at war is 1973 I haven't heard of that one what is that a groundbreaking an 26 part documentary series narrated by the actor Laurence Ollivier about the deadliest conflict in history World War two I'm gonna watch that you know I'm really interested in issues like wool or history then we have Sherlock the BBC show oh is that coming back no I told you did I listen to his Smaug alternative oh I'll just a mountain my wings are a hurricane alright yeah I think you will call you will call yeah that's that's enough the Vietnam War 2017 it sounds like a document gasps the twilight zone the old 159 yeah um that's a dope right I like that right a lot more nature stuff really Batman the Animated Series 1992 Oh that shows awesome it was like one of those kids shows that like you just kind of catch while it's on but you liked every time it was on you know I feel what was underrated though Batman Beyond that was him and like that really sleek like the one that was like red like the red Batman yeah I was like really tight yeah I think that was so I think that came out after that I want to see it did I think so have you seen that one blue no really it's a good one watch I was again Batman Beyond no I think that's why I've seen it as a kid I thought you're talking about a Batman Forever is that a movie yeah I don't know I I just think of Batman Forever yeah Batman Beyond first Christian Bale 99 no Batman Forever was really bad well it wasn't is that the wall with artists worse than a year and then it was Bao Kilmer which blessed stands its eyes to meet you know that was though that was if you I'm talking about Marnell George Clooney when he was a Batman and Robin I think that's that one yeah um like I said next Firefly should mention yeah do a small series that got canceled is still that high people saw the potential so did but does it have a good ending for something that only has seven episodes well I mean that's the problem couldn't really get in that name they like kind of set something up and then I can simply be good with no ending you just have to watched it I've never heard of this Decalogue ten television drama films each one based on one of the Ten Commandments came on 89 true detective I know people are really big on those which one is true oh that's like the one with the HBO show I thought like season 2 was bad that's what I heard like the one with like Matthew McConaughey I heard is good but then the next one is sucks but then the next one's good about that the roller coaster yeah you're a lot ups and downs Wow in anime all the way up here we got Death Note so apparently Death Note is the highest-rated anime wait I thought I was above Death Note yeah it was both oh yeah that was a up there yeah yeah I passed did I pass it was right before Twilight Zone um Death Note whip there Fargo eyes at the movie with the JoePa wanna what now that um oh my god what is that I've never seen that like no I know what you're talking about but that's not it Fargo Fargo is a show I believe it's a show based off of this kind of cult classic movie called Fargo I tried to watch it I think it's from the Coen brothers it's interesting movie like it's either a love or hate and most people I've talked to you hate it my brother loves it but bebop last week tonight with John Oliver that's oh dude he's great but see like that's not I guess I mean yeah to TV show but like I'm thinking you should get series that's still like a series like it still has seasons like this it's late night shows no I think I think it's some that's some different no I'm thinking of a story based and I don't like it I like John Oliver yeah by the TV show don't discredit him it's bigger than that we got friend the NBA should be on here we got friends better than the friends I've never watched friends Monty Python well now that you mention it the office hey see I think the office should be higher than friends I think friends is trashed by shine fill all the sitcoms are like right next to each other well cuz yeah they're like okay we put one now we gotta put the others like oh right there's other ones yeah science I've never watched Seinfeld but like I watch him with airline food oh dude the Larry David show what is that called that shows hilarious but otherwise I'd show your time no Larry David he's a he like it was a writer for sight of the creator of Seinfeld what is that show called Larry keep going I'll have to find it well I'll pass it over to blue boys or any other show right now that you can think of that you're American yeah this is a lot of pressure I know that's why it's up to you great show no I would curb your enthusiasm that's that's what you should watch that shows hilarious I love Curb Your Enthusiasm it's just like Larry David he gets in these awkward situations in life and it's just hilarious how he reacts I love it I would recommend to I mean a lot of the ones I mentioned that it was a listen off unless if I said like oh that one's really good that's a recommendation that's recommended now other shows you think that are bad like that you wouldn't recommend that people do like well I wouldn't know because I probably didn't watch it oh well do something you trying to you're like this is wack I can't really think of anything I'm asking you guys a question I don't try to even think of the answer I chose I went in as a bad show I've started watching mostly because everyone has recommended it to me the show called shameless I think I've heard of the name I've started watching it I'm it's an interesting show it's pretty relatable but like I say bad isn't damn like they like they really like you know there's a dick there's some titties oh yeah more dick some titty there's some titty again so a lot of tittie well I feel like ever since HBO like it's no longer tasteful like I feel like people just do it now because they can well I mean it's I mean it's not really like they don't really use it as like shock value anymore like that's just a reality like yeah people have titties and people have dick what I've never been like like it with you oh no I was just so surprised to like the very first episode I was like man I don't even see that like in today's TV and this is like a 10 year old season was like a ten-year-old season yeah and I'm just like TM like this is like this is more than I see today like straight titty titty titty dick what was like the first research in that order like like cuz your parents wouldn't let you watch you yo like what like what was your favorite like your first mature show that you remember watching Robot Chicken I honest way I could even tell you like I remember like I used to watch Dragon Ball Z and I went to Walmart to buy Dragon Ball Z Brawley the movie yeah and we got home and my dad let me see that and on the back it says like blood and nudity which like the nudity there like there isn't really it's like animators like yeah like his shirt off right or like ripped clothes and so he took it back and everyone gonna see it like that was what I was dealing with when I was younger but then when I got too old enough that I was like I could just do whatever I wanted or like like for instance I couldn't see a pg-13 movie until I was 13 do you remember your first pg-13 movie yes it was a Superman pick I think my first rated-r was a drive with Ryan Gosling Oh classic movie yeah like a racecar driver like or something like that have you seen it no I had not yeah just watch it it's it's a it's a pretty artsy film I mean it was one of the first like ones with Ryan Gosling like right when he was starting to take off was it with your parents no just my older brother okay yeah the other shows I've mentioned I mean I've talked about a lot recently the expanse I'll say it again you're not watching that you're missing out I don't know why more people aren't talking about it it's don't spans well that's like that government show you were saying that's like an alien's it's ephra sci-fi show on Amazon and it slept on and literally everyone I even had like some friends who listen to the podcast I said it they're now watching it and they're like you're right it's great what's it called the expanse the expanse and shout out to Amazon for saving it appreciate you okay also the boys another Amazon Prime show I really like that one that's cool did you ever finish that blue why the boys oh the boys no I I haven't watched since I was in your extremely Cosi theater room that I'm never gonna watch anything you never again probably well that's why I just thought you'd because like you were watching this you're like I got a show but then I just you gotta watch it's good watch and I don't watch much television wait a minute this has to be a troll number 74 is content cop Oh like idubbbz content cop they are like someone someone said it's documentary comedy crime and it's a TV series and there's 11 thousand something votes so I'm assuming somebody came in and kind of trolled this but that's pretty funny I thought you're gonna say the dream team I was like I believe it yeah Russell yeah it would be like it would be like dream team specifically dust anyone there like the first couple episodes say and they may just kind of lost it you know we're still waiting on the Olympics Guardian games yeah expecting some revenue share yeah we talked about it not in an official capacity though but the mandalorian I'd recommend that very sick stupid like there are some parts I'm like come on like like they're in trouble thank God we got that show and it really helps really helps wash down the flavor of other Star Wars read it like it revived it like like brought me back to Star Wars it's so weird that we had force awakens and then years of nothing and then just the Mandalorian it's like it's crazy as far as I'm worried if I use just those two that's crazy Star Wars thugs um well and then just like Rian Johnson officially coming out to and saying like yeah I didn't really care about like sticking the cannon or war we're doing all this and the reetou it was like oh yeah we can tell there's what a surprise buddy sorry about your stars maybe came out and said like the Emperor was like a clone or something like that oh yeah I don't at this point just stop just stop like you you're shooting yourself in the foot you're not helping anything there's like what because I mean I think that's even worse if they're gonna come alone which like I mean it was already hard to believe he's survived so you're telling me like I don't know there's a clone yeah and then how is this clone so powerful that's what I don't get and then that clone made a clone 94 is Demon Slayer though run Wow it's up there that's what we're talking about [Music] any other I can't really I'm terrible at like off the top of the head Boy Meets World is such a good show and it's like I feel good show I've you know I've been watching too I don't know if you guys were into these as kids I watched like seven Disney Channel original movies this past weekend like it's like Johnny tsunami like motocross like get a clue brink did you guys ever watch those as a kid like on the Disney Channel yeah oh they were the best dude brink is easily the best one and then motocross is to then get a clue three I would recommend Disney Channel original movies Eddie's million-dollar cook-off is great too I don't know if I'd recommend this oh they're falling yeah well like may have you seen them as a kid and you have that nostalgia factor but otherwise yeah it's like rats that's just kind of like a throwaway sounds like I said trash television I like trash movies there's none I gotta be some more TV but questions like this it's so hard to think of everything Chernobyl is up there oh I talk about a whole bunch the new Watchmen that was fast everybody loved it super well-received would recommend that and I think I mean it up what we mentioned a lot of stuff anyway there's got to be something out there that we said if an interested you you could watch if not you just I'm gonna watch Brotherhood oh I haven't had a new anime no one might as well uh if blue is gonna yell at me as if I was gonna go play with delirious then it's probably it's probably worth watching sorry dad I didn't mean to let you down so I have some patreon questions pulled up here if you guys want to answer some of those very funny big no yes okay all right um here's a question from Ben Tate have you guys ever been overseas if so what is your favorite country and what did you do the most about it I also just want to say I love the podcast and all the content you guys deliver keep up being awesome people no I've only been overseas one time and I was like - and that's when we visited my family's farm in Colombia so I don't really remember so I guess like I guess going to Colombia but I don't remember anything you've been all over the place mr. fruit I I would not say that well what I'm trying to what I'm trying to currently do is actually find a review because we didn't do that we're still five out of five I may I may pull one well this is five I mean we're ten but this is only five out of five because we can't go higher okay but like the bar is like kind of like overflowing spongebob with like mrs. puff is like scraping off the star and it's like just hanging all right that's what I'm doing right now it's just kinda um let's see oh god no I can't say that will get demonetized it's about to rob a okay you know I'm just gonna read literally the most recent one did you ever easy that's the title or who from tea drink thanks tea drink three nerds talking about nerd things what more could you want hashtag gamer hell yeah thank you teach dragon and as far as traveling up until college I had never been overseas except when I was like would early one I guess my parents went to Paris obviously yeah I don't count that clearly actually bringing a one-year-old the Paris did you or no it wasn't Paris to London I think they went below I mean even then but yes but I hadn't traveled overseas until college and then Claire and I at the time we went with her family to Paris and Prague and then I met my dad because he was working overseas and we met up and we together my dad and I went to watch what's the word I mean I went to Venice but then Venice and no Barcelona Lawrence I think of Florence Italy oka I'm pretty sure we went to those two places and then after that I went to Cologne Germany for Gamescom miserable miserable trip if I had to choose a worse one it would be that I just oh my god why why was it so bad have I never I I don't know maybe if I told on the podcast but the whole the whole fiasco trying to get there did I ever tell you about all that I don't remember like maybe like when it was happening but obviously Gamescom was forever ago it was for I was getting fun out it was for Battlefield one they're flying me out to get some content make some videos blah blah blah they were paying for the trip and everything and I was like cool like that sounds like Gamescom over she isn't flying for free to go over there sure why not right yeah like it'd be a cool opportunity yup fruit yeah well when wasn't whatever battlefield one was out 2015-16 I don't know and initial flight out because we have to connect somewhere in Washington and then that flight from Washington yeah would had an international flight our flight was delayed for some reason it was weather or mechanical air I don't really know but so we get on that plane and we're stuck on the plane - it's not one of those like oh you will you just in the airport sorry guys it's like you get on the plane they're like oh sorry it was on the tarmac for like three hours yeah and it was one of those things to where they don't have the a/c going either so it's just like everyone is just hot it's just terrible his game games caught in the summer - um I wasn't I want to say August yeah so we fly out I land and you might have been right Dulles or whatever it's called we land there and at this point the flight I was supposed to go on just it's gone because like I landed six hours yeah because we landed so late and international flights stopped flying out there at a certain time so with anything like 6:00 p.m. nothing else out and games come is the next day that morning or something yes I'm like that and so then I go to the airport a desk whatever where the gate was yeah well one like it's at this point it was super late at night I haven't had any food traveling's been terrible and then I have nowhere to stay now and there's no flight until like 11:00 a.m. the next morning I'm trying to figure out like what I'm gonna do we're in trouble yeah and I go to the desk to talk to this guy and I don't even remember what was happening but something was happening we couldn't get on any flights the airport was essentially just closing down like most don't but this one does and people just like leaving I'm trying to talk to like one of these last guys there at the desk waiting in line and I'm trying to call because the problem too is none of this is in my name like I don't control any of this itinerary it's all through EA yeah so I'm trying to email these travel people like hey mismo I don't know what like this is this I need this information they're requesting this what do I do about I need to change the like and when it's international everything gets 20 times more complicated so I'm like on the phone with some different agency trying to email these people which the person is surprised the first I was supposed to talk to you was asleep so then I'm talking to someone new who's trying to take over for this person I get to the desk try to talk to him and for some reason never talked to this guy before he refuses to help me he says I can't help you sir yeah like I get up there and I'm like hey I'm trying to figure out he's like sorry I can't help you like what and I'm sitting like well I like I need and he's like he's not just as you like yeah I'm like sorry cuz I guess he was getting off in like ten minutes so he's didn't want to help me and so he just I'm like I need like I need to figure out like my ticket or like where am I staying any of this stuff and he's just like sorry I can't help you sir nope and so he eventually leaves and gets replaced by this woman and so then I go up again and I'm like hey like this guy wouldn't help me or something I I don't know what to do and she's like sorry I don't know well she's like I don't deal with any international stuff like you're gonna have to go to this other desk which is only one left she's like and you'll have to go talk to them gosh I start to go to this desk and I'm not kidding you as I approach the desk I hear the guy radioing the girl to not help me and I couldn't believe it yeah I couldn't believe it and this is after just a miserable day it's like midnight now I was waiting in line for hours nothing I have noticed eh yeah and I'm like what is this I have not done anything to this man I'm like I've never had someone just so you never had an interaction with him like before nothing no I still to this day don't know what it was so help that [ __ ] idiot I don't know what it was so I show up and the girls like saying something like sorry about him or something like let me try and get you straight so she finally helps me I get to a hotel like 2:00 in the morning near the airport go to sleep wake up international flight and then it's like you know like eight hours or whatever eight hour flight and the thing is because they just normal economy and so then the problem too is because of this delay and then the time change I land at 7 a.m. on the day Gamescom starts game Sun opens at 8:00 yeah so I couldn't sleep and now it's 7 a.m. in Germany as I land I don't have any travel figured out they couldn't figure any of that out in time not to mention everything's in German I have to take the train myself and I have to get to Gamescom which opens at 8:00 and my recording was at 9:00 and I'm like yeah I'm just like everything with me I'm like I'm ready to break down I'm trying to call my dad because he frequents Germany that's part of his business so he understands some German I was like dad what words am I looking for like I don't I don't know anything and so he's like tell me like look for this word and then follow that and then you blow out you'll get to the Train odd so then I finally find the train station but then I guess I meant like the wrong platform it was confusing I have to go find the right platform yeah no one's helping me so a train shows up and so I'm like what do I get on or whatever I call my dad he's just like get on sit down you'll be fine whatever because I had to buy a ticket as well yeah so I get on I sit down and then they like start to move and then the guy comes like yeah some guy comes down he starts to check tickets you know and so apparently I'm in the wrong car you like assign certain cars and seats but I don't I can't read anything yeah I can't read anything so he comes to check my ticket and he like he likes cans it's like and I'm like oh my god and so he's like speaking in German he's just like speaking in German I'm like um no sprechen Deutsch and he goes any like tries to like talk slower I'm like no no sprechen Deutsch that's the only thing I know yeah just like I don't speak German or Dutch like it's very rough and he just goes in stupid American and then just like yeah and then he just walks off so I'm like all right all right I guess I'm here and then I can't sleep on the train cuz now I can't figure out where my eggs it is so said like some coke bla bla bla thing and I don't understand it so every time we stop I have to ask something like is this so and so no no no no and actually is this so and so known so we finally get to that I get out I have all my bags with me I have to walk how long have you been up I'm probably with 30 hours something like that I don't even know and then I have to walk from the station to the convention center then once I get to the convention I have to figure out how to get inside because the just the campus Gamescom is on it's judge it's insane it's like a couple airport hangars yeah it's massive and so like I'm at with the wrong check-in nobody's speaking English I don't know what to do I know how to get inside what time is that are you about the are you missing it was like 8:50 like it was about to start and and mind you I'm still rolling my bag I have my backpack like it except the problem was it wasn't a rolling bag so I was carrying my bag I finally get in I somehow I finally find battlefield it's like in the back of this random place drop my stuff there am I made it and like no one cares and he's like oh cool you're at like station blah blah blah I miss breakfast the whole debrief everything I've known yet so I have to just immediately go to my station drop all my stuff there and then it's seven hours of straight capture no breaks no food no anything and I gotta tell ya bad if you want to ain't that font it's not yet jet lagged no food to try new content to like like or was it just game it was just gameplay capture okay so no like comment here ya know and I was I was out of it man but I was trying and mind you - I'm at Gamescom and it's all content creators so the game lobby already is just sweats everyone yeah so that was terrible but the one good thing that came out of it was seananners was there and I got to talk to him oh very cool yeah and because I reintroduce myself no but I did reintroduce myself as I hey you probably remember like I met you back of pack South like my channel then whatever he's like well you seem to be doing well if you're here and it was who like talked a little bit and that was really the only good thing yeah and then II worth it and then EA is just like oh yeah cool here should capture you guys are good to go thanks for coming out and I might you got to be kidding me so then the problem too is uh I've nowhere to stay [Music] well so but the problem was I couldn't check into my hotel until a certain time cuz I'd to rebook me so I actually found the Bungie booth there because they were showing off whatever expansion there whatever fall expansion was coming up then I don't remember might have been rising buying or something and so DS was there and I was just like oh thank god someone I know and he's like yo well he was like who's your handler like where is everybody I was like I have no idea yet nothing and so he's like are well you can like chill here for as long as you want we got like food refreshments I thought you are would early my Savior you're my angel and so I stay there until closing but then I'm like I don't even know how to get to my hotel so then I have to try and get my own taxi which was a nightmare just thinking about it gives me anxiety I get a taxi no not in well the problem was uber was but it was at the point where it wasn't in like European countries okay so I have to flag down a taxi go in there and then just he's speaking German and I'm just like I just have the hotel name and I'm just like something hotel and he keeps saying I'm just like something hotel and he's just like and yeah I can't believe that guy actually said that to me but eventually we just get to the hotel I drop everything in my room I just go to sleep at like at that point is like 8 p.m. I wake up in the morning my flights at like 6 a.m. I go to the airport I fly back in other 8 hours whatever worst worst time because originally I was supposed to arrive like a day early he's gonna have time all day to like explore the con explore the city if I wanted to there was like dinners breakfast I miss everything I get the worst is that sounds terrible yes so there's my forever you like haven't I probably told us about it but I completely forgot about that that's terrible you know it's one of the worst days of my life and then on top of that I tried to call Claire when I was like at the airport everything everything was going horribly she's like I can't talk I'm like bit like I need someone to talk to she's like my best friend her best friend had just broken up with a boyfriend I need to be there yes so she's like I'm here for this person I'm like now so I was like all alone there's a miserable miserable all of
