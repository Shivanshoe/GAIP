don't know if you guys do i know that i trust you oh okay so here's around the time where you want to start making sure you're full power ammo so don't really use it anymore oh i'm full cap i am full as well full of confidence that we are going to rock it on time i wouldn't have it any other way i'm getting predicted we'll have to switch it up yeah we want some oc great finish buddy i'm alive i prefer it that way believe it or not that is how i prefer my women alive what you both what guys come on i swear i swear whenever i'm in a call with blue i just lose iq i just i resort to peepee poo poo man i just can't i just can't help you know how many times i've done like at these nuts jokes in the past month maybe like once in the past 30 minutes i'm like i'm pushing for a record yeah the way i see it is my jokes are dumb but my ass go dumber you need to stop all right kill this guy but why what has he done perhaps he's just as scared so that's why he's shooting at us he's seen us literally eliminate the past like 300 of his friends he's like i don't know track record here man i'm not feeling great like so yeah i'm going to start shooting at you first hey dude my mental is not feeling good right now you killed my homies like yeah so like and you just killed me all right what's the point i'd be pissed here so the strat first of all kill all this crap here first do not kill the blight okay well is is there time for a pee break can you wait like two minutes okay and i dribble a little bit it's your fault hey forget about it okay so here's the strap we're you're we're gonna be dpsing from over here blue you're gonna see like right next to me right here you're gonna drop your well right here okay and uh fruit you're just gonna kind of stay nearby as well there's gonna be boopers behind us we have a very limited amount of time to shoot rockets with the boss the boss is gonna spawn as soon as i kill that thing in the middle he's gonna drop down his shield will be kind of blocking him as soon as the shield is not blocking him start firing jihorn rockets fire everything that you have as soon as you're out of everything switch to something else and just keep burning copy that shoot shoot and shoot i'm also going to drop my ward down here um grab it for an extra 10 bonus damage oh you're not doing that now okay uh i will on the way back i just want to get this like really weak you want some help i got it i mean now now i'm going to drop it because it's pretty weak okay make sure you get buffs thanks tattle uh the screen's going to go white dude in 2022 bungie's getting away for a little while so just be ready ow what the fudge is hurting yeah i said that's all good well and fire fire fire fire fire away far away i'll shoot my load he's taking it go quicker oh my god i think i missed him but he'll die ah i got boobs get [ __ ] easy oh my god two exotic engrams it's so easy that's the first hung jury i've gotten in like eight runs i got an empty vessel cope switcher subclasses and uh we run it back oh i got a hot head with clown cartridge and tracking module what's good what's good on hot head uh the things that you just said wait really yeah yay [Applause] okay so if those turn into exotic engrams when i go to get them they'll still probably be like they're we're vibing right yeah i don't know what i'm trying to say frankly you know i feel like the new witch queen exotics are probably uh probably gonna just keep dropping from lost sectors so things from here you can probably just you probably just uh you know you probably just crack those open switch your sub classes okay so i got a clown cartridge tracking module impact casing hot head is that good yes it's the best all right run it back let's get her doing that you know what every time i think of when i hear bait that's when my middle school bully got me with the uh i masturbate joke i hate it i'm not sure i'm familiar with the eye masturbate joke it's it's pretty low brow and especially in in today's environment you'd see it coming from my way but it was a little something like okay so i'm gonna say something and then you say like what you what bait you'd catch it with so like if i say fish you say fish bait mr fruit why do you have a gal horn what he just had to go find yeah like two gallon horns yeah well you guys don't have the you didn't have the i do have a hot head now we'll do it next time okay well then you're the problem yeah the the main thing that is important is two rockets in the chamber at the same time uh um sorry you were saying mr fruit yeah she was like you so you just like say what you catch with so i say if i were to say fish you'd say fish bait so he went through like snake snake bay and blah blah he goes through like three things and he goes eye master i'm like i masturbate and then the whole bus like erupted i'm gonna be honest at that age i didn't even know what that word meant but i was like okay clearly i done messed up guys clearly i've been gotten yeah and then he would just physically bully me why would that be something like you think of it now it's like who the [ __ ] would make fun of the fact that who doesn't that that people jerk off and blues it's not that you masturbate it's what you masturbate too all right i'm not here to judge you're king shaming now dude yeah what i learned is not here to judge well the guy commenting i mean as long as it's not illegal you know it's like hey it's not if if it's not hurting someone yeah then go nuts yeah if you're without your i wasn't going like that s m or whatever guardians make their own obviously obviously were talking about consensual porn i wasn't talking about like anything else like jeez guys sheesh jesus christ i was are you king shaming yeah it's always not illegal hey bro whoa i mean it was pretty much any other song as long as well it's it's a clear distinction to be made you know it's not hurting somebody it's not even every time every time you make a joke you're like someone's gonna yeah there's a caveat so what you're saying is like pedophiles it's like brown like come on man oh my vagina oh okay that night's breathing fire please kill the night he's so weak he's dead oh nice i did it for blue's vagina there ain't no god here boy guys i don't feel so i wouldn't say pop you're super but you literally can't see you were working with here okay poke your head no you see you don't want to draw his attention because then he'll start shooting you yeah but i won't kill him you need to stop oh my oh well you need solar damage oh he's shielded now you're that's so stupid you cringe dude fire fire firefighter on a cringe he's still shielded yeah yeah i'll i'll let you know still fire not shielded he's not shielded this is my mom man you're my hero you mean that bro yes i do wait have you ever there that is one of my favorite tick tocks have you seen it where like he makes his friend a sandwich he's like bro yeah oh yeah yeah like you made this for me man it's just like potato chips on bread yeah man i did and you're the best he's like i love you all right same exact thing except uh when you start to run out of ammo just pop your supers blue you could probably actually don't pop your star away because i'll get in the way of the rocket i help all right free you're gonna do the rest of it so i can be in position copy it hurts i'll make my shield spend it's weakness leaving the body you know they say that but i'd prefer to be weak and yep go go oh my god [Music] i don't know what's happening but noises i don't hey hey tell danielle i heard she was making fun of me in her stream yesterday and i don't appreciate that okay oh uh danielle mr fruit says you were making fun of him in your stream the other day yesterday did your fruit had a dream about me not being a i'm sorry that's not what what was i saying i don't know what was she saying no no not a dream in her stream no in your stream oh i thought you were in a dream no in your stream she said yesterday what she what'd she say uh people say it was after she heard about my grandmaster fall my horrible solo flawless oh you're solo flawless he was trying to do solo flawless dude chat was the one was like it's not going well it's all right i was just gonna tell her she wasn't wrong i was like dude i've never tried to solo flawless or anything i'm gonna do this dungeon maybe if it was hello shattered which i've done i'd make fun but i can't i can't talk if you want coaching because i was coaching danielle if you want coaching i can well i should i probably should have looked up a guy and you're like you watch the cards right like no yeah so what what happened uh first wipe uh forgot which switch was which uh awkward uh next couple wipes pretty much boiled down to uh either falling or uh pepe gain every possible way in the ogre fight gotcha over and over no no no no just need some more experience that's all you need about three out of five was me just failing to look at my um spoils timer uh that one's awkward um yeah i know that goes and getting greedy because while i was trying to just do two doors immediately instead of like one door bank the other door and yeah that kept killing me oops okay i see yeah yeah that's a bit more of an advanced strategy when you did work well then and then i did it success was a great dps phase and um i don't remember what killed me it was like something i bubbled but i think it was some fall into the right being an absolute boner gotcha it was rough let me tell you well and i think the reason it's just so frustrating is because i know for a fact i'm gonna wipe to that sparrow part like 20 times i should probably practice it frankly yeah i would definitely practice it i don't have the uh the red sparrow so oh my god oh yeah and freaking the thrall boners man it's coming out everywhere man the thrall during the fight i mean yeah they're just sponsored like they've never been a problem every other time of day but now i'm solo and just like 12 randomly show up next to me inside yeah yeah you gotta be uh you'll be on the lookout for them they killed me because then i was too focused on killing them instead of watching my timer dead yeah what you got to do is you got to go to the crystal and then just have all the thrall come to you i got a rapid hit box breathing hung jury that's going straight to my pvp cat my my my pit you know subsistence wall spring i did get no backup plans even though i already had a decent known backup playing role okay so blue so that oh no you need one more okay nevermind yeah i need to stasis now and then and then i get conqueror yeah and then we can actually go do the thing that we set out to do at the very beginning which we're only going to get to do like one or two probably we're right on schedule dude we'll have you know datto um i got my first dead eye title today um we're working you know i'll get conqueror uh i just need one zur's chosen played seven hours looking for one they still need one but then i'm vid master azer's chosen a what yeah the zur's like lightning round thing oh okay yep spent seven hours looking for one haven't found it so we'll get there look guys i don't talk about it i've filled the 300 slots with cod rolls i assure you okay i'm like a crack addict all right you try and you try and take me to rehab but unless i want to get clean nothing i can do no in this case i'm just a hoarder i'm being told that you're evolving oh nobody's a little chaotic at the moment no no no no no they're lying it wasn't 470 out of 500 again mr fruit number one get literally narcton number two how is that even possible that you have filled your vault with 350 items okay for the record they knocked incorrectly it's like 440 okay and got a lot of goggles restream that oh i i don't want to tell you did you get you got 300 of them mr proof you got 300 god rules my luck has been insane dude it's been i'm on an insane pace right now it's awkward i need names who is that talk about bungie but oh i can't believe don't give us space where's all the vault space bungie a clear 350 items out of mr fruit's ball and in less than a month 440. that's why you're not getting any more vault space chat to be fair i haven't asked for more of all space i know i'm the problem okay i i understand that ooh free melee i'll use it on this guy they're pretty heavy i would never make fun of you for anything blue quite frankly i'm insulted you would insinuate something like that i referred to the very first time we met uh botter didn't happen look it was that was you just misinterpreted what do you mean i thought it was the opposite thing see that's how i knew i liked you you know it's true i didn't know that until later but also for the longest time i just thought you hated me i still remember joey the radius like joe i want you to know i don't joke with people unless i like them do have to say that was of all your your roasts and zings that might be that was a tough just yeah just the delivery and everything a bit going on that was because everyone was ragging on him like joey look man it's not true because i mean everything i say i always worry about like uh kind of like content groups that rely on people making fun of one person in particular a little too much because then the audience can feel like oh i can make fun of this person a lot too and it's like oh you don't know him yeah welcome to us yeah welcome to our dream team olympics oh yeah well that's why i think i said it recently in the pokemon series i've been doing them too it's like yeah it was kind of funny but uh are you i'm getting bullied are you i know how i know fruit is like distressed means like are you i don't have to finish it because they know when everyone else does it you can't do that that's not how it works like i i related to like yeah like my brother like when i was growing up like i can make fun of my brother i can punch my brother i can joke about you do that no that's that's not how that works why did you go that far well he oh my [ __ ] literally as soon as he got out of his overload just like freaking it's like you know mando with his little like b wash things that's what happened okay all right come up jerry jerry come on he's got a family jerry ah jesus uh let me put him out of his misery please you've come here it's okay boom oh you got it i pissed oh mr fruit dude number 14. it looks like mister in a sticky situation so i'm trying to not rag on joey so much so that people don't just feel like they have a free card yeah it's fun because other people just take it but eventually people think that they can like we do it because we're joey's friend we like joey knows well let's not like not [Laughter] that's better thank you i just don't want to you know set some expectations here see that's how i get him too like joey i'm i'm done with that dude like it's not funny anymore because i never liked you in the first place oh another this is a terrible hot head ooh i got subsistence adrenaline junkie hungary okay blue you should be a modern conqueror now right i'm a conqueror so that means you should have all the nodes unlocked now right i'm so powerful i'm gonna bring my conqueror's heel on yeah now i have all the nodes oh yeah okay fruit so what do you need to unlock conqueror i mean just the three other strikes that's it for gilded conqueror or regular conqueror regular conqueror okay because you need three different ones in order to get the achievement done right yeah so that's what i'm saying we've done like shadows we did proving grounds and if that thing was hauled later then there wasn't three of them okay so whatever the the other three i don't know okay so we can just do like three of the easiest ones so we can start with devil's lair and we'll take it from there copy [Music] [Music] you
