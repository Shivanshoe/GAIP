hi eddie hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to call of duty modern warfare and i gotta be honest with you all i've been sleeping on the fennec in fact i nearly got a nuke on shipment i was like on a 20-something kill streak and i was like wait a second this might actually happen so i hit in the shipment container clicked record real quick why wasn't i recording i don't know don't ask me i was playing shipment i never thought i'd get a nuke and well so yeah that um that hurts but i mean that's just how nutty the gun is and i'll tell you why it gets nutty first off we're using the zlr 16-inch apex barrel let me drain those 5 this is what sets it apart the 40 round drum max problem with the initial finnick you get one kill and you gotta reload but with a 40 round drum mag the one the only s-t-i-p-p-l-e-d grip tape baby and that gucci gucci slide a hand so we're hopping into an 8 v8 mosh pit on cheshire park and shoot house can't guarantee we're going to get a nuke because after that game boy did the sbm kick up like wait a second he's doing too good guilty as charged the reason why i like this weapon as i do with every other weapon is because i can ape with it really when i'm going down a list of things like a weapon has to check it's literally just like can i ape with it great and this one was designed from the ape up but evidently i need to be a little more careful running around corners as i say that i'm just blindly running in but what else could you expect wow my aim is nutty today there we go okay there's a kill let me just reload this is terrifying i'm in the point ah skirt oh i did not see you up there i saw a little thing poking up and i was like that's too giant to be somebody's head you got a fat head my friend and i mean that in the worst way possible wait who else is on the point how nani oh he's at the court you little s oh my god wait a second give it give yes the kali sticks the breadsticks ah there's about a whacking with my baguettes here we go skirt dude what is with this c4 meta i'm over it anywhere and everywhere could a c4 be thrown then you bet it already has it's game over for me nice assist okay sick man this game's asking way too much for me they want me to like play the objective no no no no no not me baby they're all gonna be flooding in here any second now or yes yes they are here it comes here comes i'm ready for it i'm ready for it this is what i was born to do i can't see a darn thing if i'm being honest with you all he's just on fire ah come on rarely do i camp you couldn't even make it worth it for me come on i felt dirty just doing it do what you want what you want with my butter do what you want what you want with my barter wait a second oh shoot yeah i mean yeah the range leaves a little bit to be desired but i mean that's the point of aping it's not supposed to have range it's supposed to be up in your face let me guess oh you thermal using sound i respect it though i mean realistically he's probably just trying to get the bruin or whatever the fudge is called boom ass cyst doesn't carry the same weight yeah when it's uh okay i'm over it what the [ __ ] i don't even know i it feels like he was already using the bruin or whatever it's called we like to ape ape ape it's what we do who it's like app it's like my code to protect and serve no to rush and ape that is the name of we didn't kill that guy yeah right guys they're all coming behind you throwing knife that missed oh hello what are you doing in the corner you'll rascal oh we're getting flanked we're getting flanked i repeat we're getting oh jesus they're all dead oh i got you buddy no no no no i knew it as soon as i s you can probably watch my cow give me that oh my heart look at this dude he breathes like a donkey apparently i don't know where's my donkey oh my god there he is again there's what are they doing there's so many of them here i go skirt look at all of them what am i dealing with right now let me reload let me reload oh my god they're coming they're coming get the kill ow oh god oh my gosh that was a stupid c4 wasn't it all right there watch this i'm gonna go up this fence and immediately get blamed here i go jesus oh where's your big head poke your big head out too many heads too many i'm running i'm running i appear to have poked the hornet's nest which i've been doing in ghost of sushima it's actually pretty cool you can use like a bow and arrow to knock down a hornet's nest and it'll like go aggro on the enemy do a let's play on the second channel actually if you want to watch it first episode's going live today it's uh more mr fruit there's a link down in the description box below ohio nice self plug me see the worst part is i didn't even get the nuke so i just bumped up the lsbm dramatically or drastic dramatically well it was pretty dramatic but also drastically and we still didn't get the nuke okay they're all over here 100 guaranteed now this oh this is what we live for oh my god no i was hoping he went the other way the quad four piece let's go i got that feed baby stay within the optimal range and suddenly everything just starts clicking ah god bouncing betty's pain suffering i bet he's a little bk i bet he chased me i bet oh my god apparently i'll just whoa uh what do you know c4 do i have eod on oh my god and then there's freaking therma and freaking smoke oh my god i can't i gotta hide is the smoke gone yet okay the smoke's gone i'm safe more or less come on poke your little ghillie suit face up move not your ghillie suit face oh my oh my god i'm gonna switch okay he's dead thank god unfortunately he didn't die by my hand though that would have been that would have been nice oh my god oh my god we're holding down the alamo oh i'm sorry what what what huh i'm shooting him and just apparently pop-up head shots or whatever you're staying right on target no stagger must be nice dude what's that like i couldn't imagine oh my god wait wait a second wait a second there's the enemy i'm on the wrong sense this is a much better sense actually i think this is the wrong sense too yeah okay that's too high i play on like molasses sensitivity okay it's just what i need for my geriatric response times actually it's kind of the other way right if i was that slow i would need a higher sense to be able to react quicker all right big plays big place big plays nope see if you call out every time you get a throwing knife and then the one time you get the kill with the throwing knife it looks exponentially cooler trust me i'm a doctor oh my god what the are they just spawning here what the heck oh you didn't see me doing that huh i'm all spider monkey actually spider monkeys aren't a real thing are they and if they are what noise do they make and if they aren't whitmore's what noise do they fictionally make oh jesus christ there's no way get your breadsticks out of here no um baguette whatever don't give up reload faster oh my god oh my god okay specialist bonus active here we go here we go i'm running out of ammo but not full oh yes yes oh my god i'm out of ammo again yeah give me your ammo okay
