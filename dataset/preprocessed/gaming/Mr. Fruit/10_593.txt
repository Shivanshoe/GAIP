hi ad hope your money miss mr. fruit and welcome to Gwent that's right if you know Witcher it's that card game from Witcher 3 or rather Witcher 3 is the game inside of Gwent because let's be real that's that's all I did I played this when it first came out like early access or like beta over three years ago I want to say or about three years ago and it was completely different but the other day I saw a tournament was going on I clicked on it and I was like what the heck this doesn't look anything like I remember so I fired it up in lung behold now I'm a dig data and I know what you're thinking oh my becomes another mystery fruit video with some obscure game with a sub-genre that doesn't relate at all to his widespread audience and so because of that it's gonna underperform but it's good to do it anyway because he enjoys it and sometimes he just wants to make videos on things he enjoys and so that's what he's gonna do and so hopefully we're gonna sit here and watch it anyway hey I got new glasses one of two new pairs I got these actually have the blue light filter in them we're going to immediately hop into a game and as it is with almost all the games new games I do I'm going to walk you through it as we play as if the card game isn't hard enough especially they don't give you a lot of time to think and me being new to the game - and my deck being pretty combo oriented stuff it's like ah if so let's see how it goes I've also seen some clips of people watching my videos and I noticed if you're watching this say tickle my pickle really that's the one that's the only man you could come up with put that in the comment section because I know some people like okay just went five minutes into the video so I'm like wait why don't I make all these intros if no one watches them I don't know how many people watch them anyway we need to do some redraws what am i up against nilfgaard or whatever the fudge they are so I need to make sure first round I want to go in pretty hard here I don't want that I'm a deck and I don't want that my deck but rather in my hand and I don't want that my hand either okay that's a pretty good start alright I'm not too upset about it I go first so let me play a card and then I'll walk you through what that Hank is happening although I'm not sure they could lock I mean here pretty easily so I'll do something pretty neutral here draw a card discard a card and which card do we want to discard we just want to thin our deck here I'm gonna get rid of you and end our turn okay so while they're taking the journal me do this real quick there are two rows and Gwent there used to be three and in which you're three you would notice there were three they were like soldier range trebuchet or whatever the fudge now there's just may Lane ranged and it doesn't go based on points in each row it's total points long story short the way you win the game is at the end of the round you have the most power between all your units in both rows so you'll see you here right now he's technically winning five to four right and now if I were to pass he would just win it's best of three and so I'm gonna do my best as we go to kind of walk you through this I don't know what this does formation if played on the melee row and he didn't okay order damage unit buy 1 charge 1 resupply whenever you play warfare card ok so he's just gonna keep chipping away at us that is a little annoying so I am just going to play another one of these oh look at this combo so we drew this card but I have to discard a card but if I discard this card it goes to my graveyard but if it goes if it's discarded during a turn it summons from my graveyard to the main later oh I know crazy I'm gonna be trying to get through a lot of stuff here real quick so it's a lot about back and forth you each take one turn playing a card if you don't play a card you can pass but then you're not able to play anything else in that round so like I could pass here cuz I'm up but then he could foreseeably only have to play like one card to be up and then pass you start your turn one around one with 10 cards and then if it goes to a rat blood will go to round 2 round 2 you draw 3 cards and then around 3 if it goes to round 3 you draw another 3 cards because it's best of 3 and you'll see all my cards are animated this is actually it might sound really stupid but this is the reason I wanted to play because I was watching the stream and all the cards were handing me I was like this is so sick likely this they all have their own animations and music and stuff when you click on them and it looks cool on the board so yeah it's pretty stupid but that's watery why I wanted to play so give one charge to an hour at unit boost an allied unit okay so he boost it okay oh yeah all right so how many cards are May one two three four five six seven eight perfect I'm gonna continue to offend my deck so I'm gonna play this again in the melee row sometimes it matters sometimes it doesn't ah that's sex cuz I want that to be in my in my deck fudge yeah I'm gonna have to get rid of really sex okay so I'm gonna discard that describe that okay but the point is I'm very calm oriented and so literally every card I played so far is just to send my deck so that round one I can play my combo turn to ideal everyone round one turn to I just pass a whatever round three then I get my combo again and go again that's kind of the idea here what is this bush and I'd unit by two he really likes boost in that unit Dhoni so I'm debating on when I want to go in on my combo cuz he could lock it but I think I'm just gonna go ahead and commit right now so this is the gist aside from the dope animation from a freaking Draco turtle so this do my this unit he has five you can't see it but es5 power in five armor armor takes damage for it before it's health would take damage right or its power at the end of a turn if it has armor it gains one armor whenever it loses armor it gains power for every armor it loses I know this might not make sense but the whole engine here is I have the small blood priest which at the any return damages the unit to its right by one and then spa bread peace boost itself by two anyways wait did you really just help me out there order ranged move battering ram to the melee row then Dame is the highest enemy unit by three oh okay he just helped me out where dude appreciate that so let me show you this alright I'm gonna play this fall but first I'm gonna in my round it's gonna reduce this by one armored boost it by one because it lost one then it's gonna gain another arm because it ended with armor and then he's gonna go by two ready to go bop boom and then you do this early enough and you just let this thing build and build oh so he watch it he's gonna move my small but I'll wait okay was move Oh move an allied unit okay well that makes sense because he could have very well moved my own unit so that's why I was confused but he came so we got that engine going and chugging it's a beautiful thing we'd love to see it so now we've got this going we want to ideally win the round but have more cards and cards equals resources to find a way that I can keep this going I'm probably just gonna summon the small blood totem so it's an artifact but it says when it spawns it summons to spa Blood fanatics listen to this dude that animations and the sound design anyway so I do that and they they're card reads berserk to which means if they fall below two to health something happens and this just so happens what did he just do what was that I wasn't paid enough okay so he played a spell or warfare split for damage randomly between all I mean it's increasing there's one for each season okay so anyway watch he's gonna damage these two units two units both to the side which might sound dumb but they hit the threshold to then transform and we get a huge power boost you can see we're 34 to 25 you freakin destroyed bro so that's looking real nice for us now I can damage ourselves again give us more of a boost and I get a bleed somebody for three okay so that's a siege engine that is also a siege engine trying to figure out which one I want to bleed which bleed just means each turn it has a stack it'll just lose one help so this is the gist of the deck damage ourselves but in turn damaging ourselves is given us buffs and activating certain cards which normally would be kind of productive right so he goes ahead and passes which means he doesn't think that he's gonna win this round now he does this now because he is four cards and I've three cards which that means next round I'll be at a disadvantage which one card difference might not seem big but it is so I'm gonna go ahead and pass and normally be like alright well I'm a one-trick pony that was it but the deck is designed to then repeat this combo in the third round because I'm probably not gonna draw everything I need in the second round and I'll show you what I'm talking about here I'm gonna make a an interesting play that you might not agree with but you'll see why I'm doing it here in a second I do not want that my hand don't really want that in my hand either it's not the worst thing I've ever seen but I'm gonna get rid of it anyway okay we're actually pretty close to our combo we're not quite there but here is an interesting move okay look I just pass I'm giving him the round but the reason we're doing this is because it puts us back at a card like neutral our resources are the same he'll have the same amount of cards as me then we head into the last round I draw three more and that should give me my combo to run again see what I'm saying here I know big brand I figured this out so that's some of the mind games it's ancient like sometimes you want to throw round one and win round two three sometimes your deck is a1 and a3 all this kind of stuff play a warfare card from your deck oh I guess he's thinning his deck out too huh although maybe he could have just whatever no maybe he's combo oriented too but as you can see I only have eight cards left here 17 I fed my deck relatively well so now we're gonna drive three more last round pray to God I can win that is not what we need that is certainly not what we need and that is fudge we're one card away actually wait now I think I'm good regardless I want to shuffle you back in and I get a shuffle one more person you we missed the one Carter would like to see which is Frey is blessing or calmer on Crete a bit of a mouthful I know but the good the good thing too is giving away round two means round three we go second going second to always better because you can react to your you'll always be reacting to your enemy rather than them having to play the first card not knowing what's gonna happen so he's doing the exact same thing he did before I I'm debating on when I want to activate the engine because again slight promise he could end my engine early but I don't know how likely that is so instead I'm going to summon his series uncrate I have no idea how to say that I want to do that some of the drum and queensguard cool great we love to see that by the way I chose this faction there's different factions because Vikings I saw it was a Viking faction I immediately clicked it I haven't tried anyone else yet I'm a simple guy I'm a simple guy not to mention each faction has different powers that can dictate how your deck is gonna work so over here I have this blaze of glory that has one charge and you'll see what that does later in this game because I'm gonna use it in this third round but I only get to use it once the entire game so I got to make sure when I do it very purposeful so this is damage you know by one order damage an enemy unit by two what is the order oh okay so that's what he'll be able to do if I don't kill that soon now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go ahead and use my ability because I don't like this thing chilling out here in the back so I banish something from my deck I get to deal its power to an enemy but then this guy specifically reads if he is moved to the Graveyard this turn I summon him and that's exactly what I did now I'm gonna use a raging bear let me show ya hit this for to in turn I forgot to use the ability because I'm a detriment okay hopefully doesn't kill that if he does actually I think he's gonna kill it okay that's a really big miss play by me oh but that's good oh that's real good okay because now he won't have that to use I'm trying to make sure he uses all the removal before I play my my main draw I'm saying I don't really like that but I don't think there's gonna be any way okay so what I meant to do is when this goes below three health I can use it and summon a copy of it like that I know I'm just doing a fantastic job at explaining all this honestly it's what can I say I'm a natural well like I said there's a lot to do and like the times already ticket you know I I don't have a lot of time to tell you what's going on here so I'm gonna play this guy he plays down three skulls each turn I can deal one damage to an allied unit if I destroy these they deal two damage to an enemy unit you see that's like the synergy there or next turn I can damage queensguard for one and then summon another queensguard and then just continue to summon Queen's guards see there's a lot of combo pieces he what did he just okay see ya pieces what'd he do okay damage unit by one charge one oh Jesus okay but but we're living we're big challenge this I'm gonna damage her summon another and then I get to do that every turn unless he's able to stop that so good luck with that bud now here comes the biggest part of the deck with gold cards you can only include one in each deck so I'm gonna use that to revive Draco turtle from our discard play him back in the battlefield and then our engine goes again because I have another small blood priest I saved then we have that engine go and so right now he's got a lot he's got to deal with and I'm feeling pretty good about it okay but he's got a lot of these things and I don't like these things okay so he destroyed that queensguard okay it's totally fine cuz check this damage that one and summon another I'm getting a lot of value out of this right now holy hackers okay now while he's distracted by that he's like oh my God he's doing this again that's right now we got the Draco Turtle priests engine going stacks so much fun man and that's why so you'll see all my cards are animated right yeah well so that costs money you're like normally cards are just neutral which is what I realized I was like what the heck well like I told you the reason I wanted to play was I love the animated so I'm not ashamed to say that yes I am ah fudge there goes the priest but that's okay cuz we're actually still big chillin I I uh II don't see how we lose this at this rate we still have a lot to play now check this out too so I'll play this damage him for to apply three bleed so in three turns that ballast is dead tell you what it's a nice combo deck but it's reactive even if the priest engine goes down like there's other stuff to do this game makes me feel big brain which if any game can do that it makes me feel better they wouldn't boost your allies he might boost the one I made bleed yeah okay so won't die now but we're reducing that boost he has totally fine by me because yeah an ability treatment so it might only be able to do that once but I can't tell I don't really know how that works doesn't matter funnily enough I could destroy it but I don't think that's the play right now instead I'm gonna continue the queensguard look at this value we got going on right now I am going to play this veteran which damages himself but if I get him down to two health he heals himself back up to eight so if I wanted to damage him it would be good and right now there's no point on hanging on to resources because this is the last round if you don't use it it's not gonna work so instead Oh we that he gave up yeah so instead you want to use some cards that you're better more reactive cards you want to save like these cards so I was saving those to see what the enemy would do and just like that you can give someone gg and if you do you get some rewards he gg me IG cheat him you can see I'm insane and I can only hope that some of that made sense to you probably didn't that's the tough thing about a lot of these games that I enjoy to it it's not it like an FPS is easy to explain you know it's like all right i'ma shoot the dude and you're like ah I get it card games it's a little bit different especially because you can't read each card so I'm gonna do my best I know some of you might be confused but you can you should always be able to tell when I make videos like this though my genuine excitement you know like I'm invested this is fun I like this a lot now this starting hand could not really be worse I'm actually going to replace you and replace you yikes I might have to just send this deck III yeah this is gonna be interesting we're doing alive I guess nice we have none of the pieces we want here and I can't really just give up game one because if I go in all in game 2 then I can't go all in game three like you see I'm saying it's not guaranteed that I'll lose but it just makes it more difficult so at this point our best bet is to thin our deck a little bit make him use some resources and then go from there uh okay maybe he'll use some of his big-boy stuff too here I'm only gonna be using web stuff you know what I mean so I'm gonna actually start with Harold and actually I might be able to sustain this first game using that queensguard engine we were just using but I kinda didn't want to use that because if I play her in the melee she actually spawns shield mains instead and when a shield maiden is damaged it summons all shield maidens from my deck and that's why I just shuffled both of them back in don't just pull those two from the deck and so we won't be drawn those I don't know I guess we'll see I just don't know how far I can get without having Draco turtle because he's a big he's a big staple he's not like the only staple but he's um he's nice to have and we don't even at like if I at least had the totem I could I'd feel better about it moment so he just spawning dwarves up the butt which is fine but now I have to decide do I wanna just go the distance with the Queen's guards it's a little bit dicey err or I can just come cuz I got to discard here that would get too out of my deck hmm I think I'm gonna try the Queen's Guard I don't know that was honestly a lot of fun so I damaged it one as long as it survives until next turn we're good I guess I have to hope it does otherwise yikes we didn't get that going and I didn't offend my back so yeah I guess and I guess in that case maybe it was maybe not my best play what's he doing he's damaging an enemy and okay it looks like he can't kill me okay he's boosting what at his dudes which is actually perfectly fine so I'm gonna spawn a copy and then I will damage that one next turn because right now it's inconsequential because it has to I think it has to wait right cards authority yeah cannot be used for one turn okay yeah so I'll wait a second instead I'll destroy one of these guys do some damage I've one two three four I think I have enough I'm gonna play her draw to discard to send the deck that's what we're doing oh that's good that's good okay but there's a lot of stuff here I can't okay I will get rid off podge of you and you I don't know if that was the way but the problem too is if if time runs out it doesn't play a random card for you it just burns a random card so you'll lose a turn and you might lose a card you want it so in that regards it's very dashing okay so he's trying to kill this which is fair I too would want to kill that so now I'm trying to think okay so that's probably gonna die let's be real I can draw another card and discard another card seems pretty good okay so we we drew a shield min that's fine it's get rid of that again then in the deck what it's about we're down to 12 so the odds between around 2 and 3 getting what we need is better and actually I'm feeling decent about this one as long as this guy can maybe get one more queensguard off I feel like we've gotten no nevermind it's dead wait wait what what is his ability to spawn an elven Deadeye in an allied row was that deal I don't know but the fact that he didn't just I mean yeah maybe he's like well I get more power removal off of this but in the long terms this listen listen guys I'm not gonna complain okay worked out my favorite show I shouldn't have to shouldn't have to defend why we like that I'm a spawn this fella here II yeah yeah seems pretty good right yeah so now damage him three more times and he'll heal up to eight so now I can play cards that would normally damage my teammates and right now maybe that's not the best although really it's good anyway but that way regardless I can heal him up to eight if so it'll be a big buff you know held like oh well please tell me he just forfeited just quit disconnected like the coward he is okay he didn't quit what the fudge as anti-climactic really thought he would have just given up you hate to see it oh my god never realized top right and bottom right it actually shows you how many cards in your hand Burt Peter okay well he didn't disconnect but now I just don't know what's happening a game like bort oh no it's not Boost now I'd unit wait oh my god wait what if there are no other units on that row oh well that's a pretty big swing what is his original power baggage I guess I could have stopped him from continuously buffing up earlier if I just realized that botch okay fear not my friends because the Queen's God continue now here comes the best play so I'm gonna discard this from my deck normally when you play this it loses six health but because of its raw stats and I'm circa minimap we get 12 free damage so I'm just gonna bop hit you for 12 now we are way ahead and then I'm going to damage you and make him bleed so the likelihood that he can stay boosted is even lower so right now he's at his regular health so as long as he doesn't go up to 5 he's not gonna be up in his power every end of the turn I mean while look at the value we've gotten out of these Queen's guards and he passes which is great because I didn't have to use any of these which are pretty big yeah we managed to win that round without what I thought were staples I did have to use my ability there which is a bit unfortunate but I think we can make it up I think we're still okay but I think the fact that he can't continue to grow that he was just like nyan well it's good okay so seven out of ten here don't actually I don't need you and what bronze cards would I want from in here nothing really okay so don't want you either because normally you you want that card to resurrect a priest the small blood priest when you because normally you have that engine running with the Draco turtle so then the turn round 3 whatever when you need to activate it you just hit them all get get those back however we're feeling pretty good I've got everything I need which means I'm feeling more confident yeah I'm more confident heading into the last round with my full combo and on top of that we'll have a one card advantage actually wait no he doesn't have to even use a card though because he has his ability Oh let's see if he sees that I would assume he does you guys can't see it but he gets three charges to essentially just spawn a three power alpha token Oh but he doesn't so oh but that's pretty good so he just gets to spawn some or buff something for next round anyway okay so not a lot lost on his part but we still are up one card and as long as we can find the Draco turtle oh gosh Gaby you gotta be kidding me right okay so we do not want you I will take that what about everything else oh wait a minute I probably I probably don't even need you yeah I don't need you anymore although I could get the Herald hounds not again that is not bad what else could I draw yeah I think that's fine I won't use my last Mulligan here we go it's it's always a little dicey we won round one great but can we do it again in round 3 I essentially always forfeit round 2 seems like it's always the best play at least with this deck I played a bloodthirsty that was still Skelly or whatever they had the Viking people before and it wasn't just like Auto pass certain turns I'll give a seat he really likes this guy and it's where he gets all of his stuff from but actually okay I'll show you what dope a little maneuver we're gonna do later even worry about it and here's the best part I get a play Draco turtle early normally I wouldn't but even if he kills it I have sick sicker sicker Dreyfuss right and I'll grab him back normally I don't want to play him in fear that we're gonna lose him but we're good to go which means I can try and get my engine going as soon as possible and that's obviously important he's not even boosting that interesting because the more turns I'm able to do it like the better I don't want to put Draco turtle and the priest down as my last two cards because the amount of value you get out of them buffing each other is next to nothing it's like I said I'll just go and play my priests engine it's up to him and best part I have another priest too so the likelihood of them sticking on the board is pretty good oh no big brain over here making me feel so smart meanwhile you all are home almost like like mr. fruit I'm glad you're having fun but I don't get it it's free-to-play try it out yourself if you want or you know just watch me ramble but just know I'm having fun ironically the most time I've been playing when was this damaged enemy unit by the amount Sheldon is boosted oh okay that's only four he wasn't able to take care of it a little does he know that doesn't matter to us okay so we're gonna draw a discard that's so good okay so now I get a discard this guy he summons back to the grave and now I got free us blessing back so in the event that he does kill boats fall blood priests guess what we bring it back this is looking good he doesn't realize it but as far as I'm going this is about as good as they can get rowdy dwarf in this row what the fudge is that me bonded spawn to rowdy dwarves in this run what doesn't even mean okay whoa oh he's using all of his tokens oh he's going all-in makes sentences last minute so tree this ability if you control copy this card okay he didn't so okay ratty dwarf is just this two mana got two animations and stuff are just so sick though like listen to this sick right okay anyway oldest tractor here I I'm going to play this here this will be a big power boost next turn see he just blew his whole load too and little does he know that power bonus ain't gonna do much for him unless he's got something where it all combines or he sacrifices for Exodia or something yeah I don't know or maybe depending on how many elfs he haves in play which would be only three it seems he's all like dwarfs except for oh I don't really get how that works damage na minha before damage for enemy units by one okay that's fine okay he choose chooses to just hit everybody which actually is wasted because now those guys are gonna evolve and and all that damage is negated so actually did two damage not very big brain of you my friend but that's okay I'll forgive you now what we want to do I think I'm just gonna get another priests buffing up here and they're all just gonna be buffing each other so now that heard said that up up up up up up up uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and look at that we've got a card advantage with three power advantage and I got a lot more awaiting actually maybe not oh he has Geralt no so Geralt can all obviously be a very good removal card and he's like yes I wait a second it's right back that's right baby I was gonna say if he didn't actually have a way to kill these then I'm kind of sitting on two dead cards but that's not the case anymore and now I wonder what to do what the duel so he can damage and a life or two so we can hit our dragon for even more which honestly feels pretty good so we're gonna do that and then buff everybody back up we'll get that we're getting what through one two four yeah four damage every turn just racking up from those guys who's to jacent units by to boost all dirtiness oh I see what he's doing now that's why he puts them all right there so that's a big buff but sport where's buddy I got two more cards than you here not to mention who do I just do it to him now kind of feels mean no I don't know if I just do it now you know what I'm saying okay I don't actually know how this works so let me see how this interacts I don't know if spawning him is gonna hurt him it does fudge I could have put it right there I didn't realize them but we're still ahead by seven so he has to not only play seven power here to just tie it but it's plain enough because spoilers this is the cool combo I play this guy oh yeah oh wait that's like wood early the exact amount he needs oh wait no it's not ok watch this I'm gonna do it now anyway spot him in the melee I get a banish she unit so we discard this with our ability put in the discard do till 12 damage then we banish it with this guy then get to do that 12 damage again and as you guessed it we want I'm just gonna go ahead and be mm to hit him with that 75246 yeah boy did it not even close he blew his low but my load was bigger why couldn't I figure out a way to phrase that a little better there we go feels good we want both of the games I didn't suck for you guys even though I'm sure you guys are just like yeah what did he do are we we're all we're cool that was good yeah and that ladies and gentlemen is Quint odds are it's super nice I'm probably you can do one off because it's just not gonna fit on the channel but your boys having fun so I least continue playing in my free time because I lost my train of thought earlier but recently the most games I've been playing is this legends of marooned Terra which is the League of Legends card game slate aspire which is a card game roguelike monster train which is a card card game roguelike harch down throws like some other car yeah I don't know I'm just playing a bunch of card games right now it's nice I don't know anyway I don't think I offer much for watching those that did watch this make it through most of it I appreciate you with that said happy wheels a fantastical talk to you in the next one very well [Music] [Music]
