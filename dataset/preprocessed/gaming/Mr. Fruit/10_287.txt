heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the last spell and welcome back to the channel the let's play continues part four and we're going to continue to play it because i really want to whether or not this moves to the more mr fruit channel is to be seen if it does i'll edit it into this video or the next part whenever i decide to but hopefully we can just keep chugging along on the main channel and hopefully youtube doesn't get too angry at me you know how finicky they can be and apologies for it looking so red i don't know when i wear it like a blue shirt the white balance auto white mouse thing freaks out like see if and then if i unp like that kind of see and then it slowly gets redder okay i don't know redder is that a word so we continue i have to remember where we left off i don't think i did anything for the preparation phase today so that's where we begin you might be curious too i'm wearing some different glasses you know i'm usually wearing these like the blue light filters well during my wedding i might have gotten a little ham on the dance floor and they might have fallen scratched the glasses and completely bent the frames so figuring that out so in the meantime i'm gonna wear these which is unfortunate because they're super tight and they just give me a headache they squeeze my giant brain my my head just okay sorry anyway welcome back one and all you've all taught me very much in the comment section more or less i did see someone say that i'm in for a surprise if i survived this night or the next night's date night six i don't remember i know i'm making up as i go but let's start leveling up and i really need to save my other weapons um for different loadouts but anyway um kolb is our wizard as we remember you know i'm refreshing myself so forgive me so armor could be good extra man i'm not gonna say no to i'm gonna gamba screw it first time why not that was terrible idea okay i guess i'm we'll take better health okay that's not the worst case damn well i have to go with whatever we get here daily mana regen isolated we don't have any of that accuracy i don't even think that does that apply to i don't know if that applies to magic i know it does like archery but i guess we'll just go daily mana regen it's nothing crazy but it's something oh shoot and then we get into the tier three perks this is when it gets interesting isn't there like oh yeah the first manner consuming skill used in turn cost minus that's nuts that or a patient holy jesus and then oh my magic damage is increased by 50 what the more so do i want to do less mana mana cost don't want more magic damage or store action points probably not going to use that one as much hmm they're just both super good i feel like the first mana consuming skill is kind of the play magic damage increased by 50 here it's current mana oh current manager that would only be plus seven that's probably not worth it i'm gonna go with thrifty for now bop that's sick all right monica what do we got what are we looking at here girl um range damage is not bad it's only a five percent buff could go with five extra mana i'm kind of digging in fact that's what we're gonna do sue me ten percent greater accuracy girl you finna make me act up we didn't even go for damage i'm crazy while at full health extra light well i'm not even full help potential move point penalty from where the body armor is reduced by one upon dying this hero turned from the grave well that is tempting that's very tempting we could go extra critical power and just less damage that would put us at 56 so every other attack theoretically we're critting for i don't know how much additional but at the cost of just 10 percent but that might not be bad i don't really need magic damage first man and consuming skill costs minus one mana that is tempting storing action points i don't think so um i'm not like crazy about any of these for the archer i guess maybe move point penalty but i'm i don't move much in fact i literally took steady aim because i never move so maybe i just go play dead [Music] but it doesn't give us an inherent advantage now you know what screw we're gonna go with the critical it's really the only one that i can really think of that we'll get something out of all right durand eight percent extra physical damage uh heck yes my friend i love you and your sword dilly dilly oh my god 16 extra damage to bonus momentum and like two of his moves are momentum aren't they momentum okay just one i could have sworn oh i really thought we had more okay um so then maybe that's not that good i could try and gamble for something else but this is just 16 essentially 16 extra damage on my skill one that's not bad screw it we chose it it's too late potential move point penalty from wearing body armor that is very tempting because we could get back to seven that would be nice uh we're not gonna be full health that much play dead is first mana consuming skill during this turn cost minus one that it is not that important honestly we don't have to deal too much but any trap around the hero i don't even think i have traps can store a few unused action points and move points that is interesting because it seems like sometimes we definitely but i'm gonna go with extra movement speeds sure or whatever less movement penalties we get a new magic item this is exciting it's all butts it's all butts all right kolb oh wait we could get a power ring which we don't have for like anybody five percent damage and extra multi hits um we could just get a tome to add as a second thing doesn't this have a multi-hit this does and we could go for six multi-hits or another wand to have honestly i'm going with the trinket because that's something we can slot in don't even have to think too much about it because it doesn't have anything in there freaking boom get those extra multi hits buddy because you deserve it worth it now let me work it need to build defenses we need to assign workers when you do a lot of things holy hackers what do we have here armored boots i just bought a trinket but it doesn't have to go on call this is extra accuracy extra opportunistic and extra poison damage well slight problem um i could give it to our archer for two percent accuracy and then the rest is useless because i don't think anyone uses that stat never lucky this is crit power accuracy and resistance that might not be bad well well well and this is just extra magic damage you know what does this do plus 50 damage for one turn interesting okay well i'm gonna buy this and then we're gonna throw this on you my friend yes extra critical hit power i don't know why i don't think it shows me critical hit oh here we go critical power 215 we take that damage is 90 but that's okay i quite like that i don't know why it doesn't show i mean what the crit chance is six percent oh critical power oh fudge that doesn't affect crit chance that oh okay wait i made a mistake then because now i have a six percent chance of creating but i just do 10 less okay that's can i take this back is there a way to huh popega okay um i don't think i need this you can have it we have a scroll triple swipe scroll for nine targets wait what the fudge how much is it 42 though jesus but i guess it'd be a good like last resort kind of thing right could give some potions you can only get one oh boy didn't realize that maybe i should have been stocking up a little bit more uh this extra damage honestly probably gonna be clutch i'm buying it and then the rest i'll do to build some structures yes yes we could get ranged items we could get melee items we could get defensive items man oh well i think we should start regenerating health gold mine we don't even have these we could just be passively getting gold that'd probably be pretty good so let's we have let's get materials first and then i can build on this let's build us uh some healing and they're gonna be coming from this way too um is that the best place to put it i reckon it's not great because okay whatever worry about that some other time let's get ourselves some gold mines all right now i'm all out of gold i'm all out of gold uh two useless regenerates 75 health that's pretty good what is this upgrades heal and unlocks uh offering a belly regenerates 40 health and it's free and that's 25 gold paw i don't know if we're going to do all that but let's heal you and let's heal you and we can't do anything else we don't really need to regenerate mana i could use my workers to like boost this i guess right how many workers drive left sure what do we get oh dodge and critical whatever screw i'm just gonna take this oh what does this do seven percent dodge now whatever somebody somebody wants this right what uh what do you have uh no you can't equip that okay oh wait fudge i don't think anyone can equip this ah papaya wait this is probably better than this yeah this is just for black this gives you dodge and critical as well why not and i can't give it to our archer because the bow is two hands right yeah okay so who wants these i might give you extra damage and i'm probably going to give you the health in case we get to dire straits hopefully that's not the case but we got to be a little realistic we got two more workers what do we want to do with it there's not really um anything we want to repair probably not let's let's build some defense just see what we're working with here first um i'll have this probably be melee side so we'll do a gate here the other side won't need a gate right no do some reinforced every now and then because i can't afford [Music] that much okay that might have even been a little too bougie for you boy okay all right well then it looks like i need to destroy something i only have two workers do i even have anything i can destroy for two uh chief i don't know oh yeah i do later all right give me some materials all right let's at least close off these walls that's all closed this has been shield yes um really have to hope they don't go that way all right so you're gonna chill out her wait we're good right yeah okay we'll go to uh deployment phase so uh you have six movement yep oh but you can teleport you're gonna be the flex guy that's right we're gonna keep you right here for best line of sight i don't think they can reach you i pray and yeah you're gonna sit here and flex flex on it buddy all right pray for me um i can't even armor myself yeah we're fine we're freaking fine man remember to mark people too all right here we go uh i'm terrified that's so many of them they're already hitting or practically already oh jesus what he's oh lord they are they're coming from freaking everywhere okay and somebody pointed this out if if there's a sword and a if there's a sword it means i'm gonna do damage if there's a sword and a skull it means i'm gonna kill them if there's a sword and a skull with a question mark it means i can kill them i just have to high roll because as i can see here precise shot we do 76 to 99 and it has 90 health so a monka monka indeed i don't want to do this um let's pray we high roll pog that's a good start good start way to go monica brady uh this is looking way too juicy is it a little early maybe but when in rome friends we're not in rome we are certainly not in rome but it's beside the points let's see can you hit this guy not quite you do 82 well you have a good chance of one shot let's see what working with over here first try and plan out our zippity bippity boppity boos about um oh we're guaranteed to kill see bop not not even a chance to kill dodge we will kill if we do this however which is good because i really want to kill these guys um um [Music] all right i could do this all night long all night all night all night long how much armor do i have okay this guy i don't think can break my armor so we're kind of we're kind of vibing currently so maybe i just helped clear up some of this but first screw you i got to get these runners before they get out of hand i don't i don't have a line of sight do i fudge all right well then that's kind of up to you my wizard friend but you can't really fudge no one's gonna be able to see that guy okay kind of cucking myself with my own building but what do you do i have one more point left uh let's get rid of this boner as long as we hit easy oh i didn't use my diva or my mark that would have been a good idea okay well i can't teleport anywhere oh free so well not faux free but one less maneuver okay whatever that is a valid maneuver requires line of sight course does okay well if that's the case let's just high roll or not i prefer to not apparently can i not move what it what is this oh there's a barricade here well that's not good i don't remember anyone what can i not destroy this thing okay i'm gonna actually just get pooped on by my own barricade that's sick okay i don't know i guess i'll freaking figure out what that means for us later oh and somebody pointed out that yeah see you don't have to technically kill sometimes the strategy can be just a weekend and then go for other people because as you can see here i think if they're below 40 health they get minus two panic minus two move points and minus 40 damage so that dude's kind of useless right now you know uh and i'm actually out of moves so i'm just gonna give you an extra action point you can wound this fiend stupid she only has minus one move points but he could potentially i don't know how to like keep whatever he could oh here we go yeah she wounded or badly wounded oh and i guess the threshold would be if their health reaches that makes sense you guys are you guys are picking up what i'm putting down right all of her action points have been spent i'm going to move her because i fear for the worst and by that i mean i'm pretty sure one here didn't move what oh well he technically moved yes um this whole yeah that that is gonna get out of hand uh in fact all this is gonna get out of hand because of my lack of line of sight did i get hit did you actually do damage to me am i not full health you did two damage you son of a you will rue the day my friend all right well let's just slice slice kill this guy omega slice oh i love the swordsman we are out of action points though um okay i'm gonna go here so that think there's only one person that can hit me oof but then he's gonna have to he won't be able to make it back in he'll have to chop his way through whatever ah am i gonna survive this night i don't know it'll hurt no matter what i'll tell you what okay how much health do these guys have 120 they actually have more well that's not good um let's hope i kill two of these guys here i roll ah for health you gotta be freaking okay you technically are badly injured though i'll have to finish you off but give me a second all right let me know mega you go over here what out of range what oh oh he's too close and i can't freaking see anyone oh my oh hey okay some mistakes have indeed been made okay i gotta come over here uh let me finish that guy off for ya now i gotta start multi-hitting okay we don't have to kill we can simply maim or whatever okay maybe not i can't freaking okay so let's just see what else we're gonna do here omega that dude [Music] shoot that dude pop um now what why can't i requires like i say if i go here okay that's better that's all the moves you got that's all moves you got and that's all moves you got uh i think we just kind of vibe right here they can't hit us this oh this can't cause it movement speed is like nothing little perfect all right let's do this holy oh my walls my defenses ah jesus they're getting in every way oh stab me right oh my god okay well there goes all the walls we've already lost the wall over here oh yeah yeah yeah it's getting out of hand so fast i really want to be able to clear this night but will i be able to that's a good question jesus literally is like not a free spot this is just one in the dickens gonna have to start slowly making our way through i feel like there's no there's like equal people over here he's doing his best to hold the fort down watch so much you can do we just don't have any aoe without we well i mean we do i guess i could do this right um and then that means i could do this uh and then maybe these people because they'll take a little bit no but at least i don't know i have one more action point okay i'll screw you and then you know i'll jump the wall what out of range here we go that might help a little bit probably not much all right now we just need a miracle oh i almost feel like we should switch because her aoe is gonna be way better here well i guess i could right like over here can i what's our best that's five okay i accidentally broke a wall you're welcome eyes line of sight you can suck my pp all right kill this thing please pog oh just barely that's threatening our town and i won't have it and then just hit everything else that we can all right we have severely made well actually we didn't severely injure anyone but that's not the point you can hit me possibly but i ain't worried about it let's wait to see if i want to give her an extra point um okay that's pretty good value just either kill or okay we mainly killed nice job um we'll just oh mega you and then yeah let's give her an extra point because she can omega somebody else let's just get the runner okay and then she'll probably need to back up because it's gonna start to get a little dicey and he'll stay here whatever he's gonna take a hit but i believe and that's pretty much it okay yeah all the different oh i thought i thought it was going to show me like people are coming in from there i'm like excuse me nothing all right it's like solely up to durand over here all right we have so many people threatening our city there is quite literally no way duran can do that on himself might be time to start getting people to help the poor man hmm okay kind of think what are my best odds to just kind of like hit over here dip and then i think that's showing me that i'm going to hit my own fence so it's kind of lying to me about how much value we're going to get there now we only have one literally one person currently threatening the city here i just don't know if she can move far enough to help not really no well in that case i guess you're stuck over here requires my sight are you son of a hmm how far can we teleport again not far enough baj okay i'm just gonna do as much as i can here before leaving to go help durand dodged sick okay that's what i wanted we could go for another multi-hit uh i might have to how many people freaking dodge should i miss two i don't know okay you got one more point left uh you can't even hm okay here's what we'll do get you as far as we can finish you and then we're going to teleport you here okay you'll help next turn your man is almost depleted that's bad okay uh god if i could just get mine aside does this count yes it does oh much better all right i got one omega for somebody with their name on it this guy no of course not but this yes now i have to back it up gas pedal i must wiggle like i'm trying to make my butt fall off gas petal gas petal all right now it's back to you buddy it's go time we're gonna chug this gl and then we're just gonna get this slicing and dicing okay okay all right i mean that was like seven kills you're doing great but that was all you could do i'm proud of you they're definitely gonna kill this building i don't think there's anything to do about that how far are they gonna get i don't know i'm gonna go like right here oh boy all right pray for me oh my god he already is he actually already gonna hit our wizard thing i don't know what is the center in on that but holy i feel like literally everyone here can like reach can we dodge pog see that oh jesus literally our entire city is in shambles what the fudge oh yeah this is beyond bad really all right we definitely have to um jesus what okay i have to get further is there the problem is then he's too close for me to fudge i can't even hit him from here oh oh okay i nev i need to get these guys because they're they're actually hitting this like we'll probably lose this building it sucks okay so this guy can also make it there but aside from that i think the rest just kind of has to take one for the team sorry friend sorry friend i could dash there but that's not gonna help anybody  okay so it's up to you somehow to stop these fellas no pressure kill that runner screw him okay you have enough mana for one more of these you cannot and i repeat you cannot miss i cannot understate how important it is you do not miss the one thing he had to hit it's minus 40 damage though we're not gonna lose our wizard yet oh wait wait i have one more action point okay i swear me mom like i swear on me mom gonna say usually right in front i swear to god okay as much damage as we can okay they're all severely wounded that's good um he's gonna hit this which i'd like to keep alive but again at this point i think we don't make it past the next night i just need to make it through this night so we're gonna we have we just know we're going to take some l's so i just have to figure out what am i okay losing um like how far see i could come over here and help i think i need to um yeah there's like no way okay yes correct i don't see a better way for us here so tagging you in buddy screw you all right that's that we're gonna be losing a lot here but and i have more action points but just can't there we go maybe at least this way i won't die all right 28 more duders sweet moses load above pray for me very hard and long the lord knows i need it and i hate the color correction next i'm taking this blue shirt off all right not right now but you know i mean okay this is good for us because uh screw you if i go through you now all i need to do is wipe out this guy okay nice clean up you're adding action points but we'll deal with that you have no more mana sucks um just gotta start trying to kill things all right i got one more in me then i'm gonna give you another action point so that you can kill him all right now you guys can handle that now i have to come back and um pray i can figure out what the fudge i'm gonna do about all this car's line of sight yeah yeah yeah this is the last spell we could cast we have no more mana rest in pepe hey how's this guy oh he's gonna hit the walls wait how is he threatening what is he threat i don't know um we gotta shoot something i don't have vision i don't i can't okay then fine screw you all right one year didn't move whatever forget about him our defense is our buildings we just gotta say goodbye okay we don't need them we just gotta protect the wizards i think we'll survive the night your water right in front of me so that's yeah it's like if i miss we need to talk you're too far there we go clean you up don't have lunch like clean you up clean you up all right and then you watch and then come way over here okay you got you got the last two so then i'll just come over here give you an extra action point because uh i am useless and i can't even teleport myself so send one more that way move this way oh i can give you another request wait whoops okay i didn't realize i could do this twice that's kind of crazy oh but i ah fudge i would have used all my things okay well all i could do is move all right oh we did it it was not pretty in fact literally it could not have been worse panic-wise but who cares because we survived the night let's get it there's three left i only see two oh i'm blind nailed it okay dead dead day five complete or night whatever good lord what oh s because of how much hp we lost but little do we know how the city went okay it's not gonna be good everyone's alive not much damage it's good right oh d yeah that's surprised but that's a lot of tainted essence yes i like tainted essence a b and that's solely because of that s we got it was tough but we made it by god did we make it and now i am all but practically dead let's be honest okay let's see what we got going on here do i want to pick up i was going for the magicians is there anything new anything new holy unlocks mage2 that's another 5 000. jesus get more hammers where's the uh more swords because i like that stag set sure we can fly him like that a warrior set more starting armors maybe that would have been good huh could have possibly been good but what happened i'm just gonna go for cloth armor so we're just gonna like as much as we can we like to prowess very fun i don't know what i did but i'm sure it's legendary shut your face you dirty actually you're very clean i'm sorry build a hundred defenses uh new lakeberg havens when i have some initial wooden walls oh shoot don't mind if i do deal 500 physical damage in a single hit i did that jeez oh i just unlocked the brute set oh that's sick survive night five the end building allowing you to recruit oh i'm sorry what we get to build an n and recruit more here oh oh you saucy minx it's the first thing i'm doing next run holy what is this survive tonight at or under level two of city panic um can't even do that this one have a hero reach 400 in health lost um if that's be one hero then that's gonna be tough have a hero reach level seven additional positive background traits during the generation of heroes we're so close to that but i don't think we get it walk a lot more tiles okay i can do that have a hero reach level 12 in move points that's a lot of movement chief um okay oh is this heavy production buildings craft 10 items what uh we're pretty close there wait i might actually be able to just do that right now well actually i don't think so let's see we got a lot we got gold gold materials materials materials okay yeah i'll just put all my workers here and make them craft things uh we get ooh adepts one two yes the power ring yes or the tone give me the tone yes all right workers get to work check my wares i think i will the armor maker trash what the fudge and whatever i don't care um wait no improves upgrades help uses per production phase oh that's good that's what i mean upgrade yes all right now just take um uh i love that that's great boom we got the prowess that's why i paid attention because otherwise i was just gonna end tomorrow night but now i get this boom we now get axe pistol and druidic staff oh shoot let me see mixed weapons five oh mixed weapon set three spend 400 gold at the shop i haven't really bought much stuff i okay i guess i'll just what is this build 200 oh gather a thousand i believe this there's so much i'm overwhelmed let's buy some new gear oh yes i love that um don't mind if yes good perfect wait what is this free oh no i didn't see that i was like is this free for me well i accept you any more workers we have three i could break this down for gold yes and then i'll buy more gear how much do i have 34 best bang for my buck i guess 15 15. or how much did i say i have 34 15 17. there we go build some defenses i can do that um here we go oh we got walls up in here i'm just spending whatever i got boom um yeah i think that's pretty much it honestly uh everybody can level up though so let me do that again i guess it's not that important but you're a mage so get some extra magic damage freaking more multi-hits you'll have to see that your perk magic damage increased by current mana love it perfect this problem this might like doing this might mean something i don't know um reliability love that i think do we first manage consuming probably do that sure we could unlock four if we just leveled you once more i'm sad we won't be able to ooh eight block yes please uh critical power is up there um experience gain no we're gamba gamba okay not that important and then we could go with play dead but it doesn't matter anyway we'll go with patient sure there we go all right screw it in the face where are they coming from oh lord yeah whatever you guys got it over here um no no no no no there you go you got over here begin i'm terrified and back to hell oh jesus they're already alone oh loud all right so i'm just going to end but move as much as i can and kill as much as i can build different man okay great stuff buddy multi-hit up yo butt as far as line of sight oh i can double down on somebody uh let's not rely on gamba i do forget that i can stack multi-hits that's why i like the crossbow isn't nearly as bad as i thought it was i'm just dumb oh out of range i don't think so die die die you had action can we oh my god look at that too bad he's getting all the action okay unironically that um i didn't go that bad i say that now if only we could move you a little bit more for actually i can't do anything else i quite literally can't do anything well there they all are now the party started and look at the progress of knight this isn't even half this is like a third of the monsters i'm gonna see yeah right what is this a claw wait how did he move so fast i feel like i've seen him before uh i'm just being dramatic okay kill you you kill you well at least maim you meme you made me oh look at all those multi-years go on sun dodged of course classic oh now that's value oh shoot see i guess i should just move around though for the sake of it right and uh hurt you and then look back and then there and then there oh the attack hit you hit you bow move back move back oh i'm crazy crazy on my feet okay um i can't stop most of it wait why do i have three movement speed traits and buffs wait what what happened buffs minus three did someone hit me and slow me why am i minus three why aren't i moving it just says buffs minus three something hit me i guess or i don't know well unfortunately not much i can do oh oh wait i could execute it i forgot about that sag um that's unfortunate okay i think the wizards might just die here we're holding the fort but see like imagine i had another hero to go with our melee we might like honestly not be in a terrible position right now let's not get ahead of ourselves on this fruit dodge stupid ow says my walls okay we're still in this holy now that's some value oh yeah screw you guys brian you want some of this you want some of this huh hey move outta here huh can't you see i'm busy trying to do the goobidigapa hit him over here hit him there hit him right where it hurts screw all you're dodged are you kidding me i'm gonna double hit you cause i hate you yeah we're kind of holding the four dent and imagine i actually had did you dodge again what the fudge you will 27 dodge holy jesus what happened jesus you can do something see now i have six movement yeah i don't really know what happened but okay saved more or less let's go all right and then you get a save real action point you'll rant go okay we're almost halfway to seeing how many people we're gonna fight good lord oh no not oh wait i didn't even use that to heal i didn't really need to and i'd already used all my workers they're destroying the city is bastards dodged i'm right in front of you i'm not even one shot in these dudes now never mind i take it all back i take it all back take it all back take it all back i'm sucking on my titties i'm sorry um that guy needs to die requires line of sight okay maybe not you have a nice day i'm nuts dude all right how do i get line of sight well whatever you you you you you hakushu dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge the fudge just died all right nice thank you for listening more or less and can i see you now are you out of range wait wait wait i just gave him an extra can i undo that what though why would you think that's what i want to do why is that even an option all right well you got to clean up your mess yes oh my 396 damage i haven't even used your extra damage potion but let's be honest that's not gonna help um oh wait is this the end wait wizards hang on for dear life fight forever oh my god there's so many ah nah oh 12 hours we're live bro i'm trying okay wow jesus it's it's a nightmare over there again we're kind of vibing over here but because we got two where are all your rascals coming from i swear to god get out of my life i hate i hate you i hate alls you get crippled or dodge like a couple of boners that's fine ooh some crits in there though i see you require lines of sight of course oh yeah there's no what the fudge what okay there's no point in they're just gonna regenerate the armor so i kind of have to finish them if i'm not gonna come away there we go move ahead and then yeah we're just gonna do as much damage as we possibly can here um is there any way i don't lose this i don't think so i'm gonna execute you but then i think it's over fairly well we fought valuably hey we made it to 56 remaining enemies technically we see what we're dealing with now in our next run yeah i'm feeling good i'm feeling good these wizards not so much or these they're they're called wizards right everyone whatever whips the magic circle is destroyed see come on just level up he didn't die just give me give me that prowess no okay yeah you see it uh i don't think i got any dark essence because we didn't survive frank didn't get anything i don't think i unlocked a prowess i just work towards some everybody says shut your mouth wait what oh [Music] what troubles the child disperse the mist which shrouds thy mind i ask what thou sees what i am what i was and what i will be i looked into the depths of thy heart and shaped my physical form from fragments of thy thoughts and feelings you're beautiful don't lose thyself in such conundrums i am the mother and the daughter i'm the light and the delight concentrate on achieving mighty deeds and that shall be rewarded handsomely and re-rhyme didn't unlock anything by god god count onwards to lake berg number three poor lakeberg man just getting absolutely pooped on it so uh i met i could just i could just start with plus one here are you kidding 20 magic but nay i don't need that i'm already making plenty of strides myself we start with some wooden fences they're not reinforced and honestly they're not going to do much for us but it's a good place to start there now are there now yeah three wizards don't know what that i want to say that just adds health maybe truthfully i'm not sure uh but let's figure out what we're working with here we have abigail using a oh druidic staff this is new i don't know what this does effects opportunistic so bonus damage to targets affected by stun poison or debuff okay that's just your basic one uh we can debuff -3 movement points wait nine targets oh shoot that's pretty good just a big aoe just stall them out okay bee sting poison and it propagates okay or acid spray minus a hundred armor oh my and minus forty percent dodge it's very much a support class i like it what do you have plus three mana plus two daily management plus ten experience oh shoot plus derivability minus three magic damage minus five percent dodge that's unfortunate but i still think you've currently i think you should still be wielding this druidic staff we have kiro who has that abigail right whatever oh shoot he's got a gap my man's got a wooden pistol one-handed too it has extra crit power his basic attack deals bonus damage per tile traveled oh interesting okay so the farther away the better damage this attack ignores the target's block oh okay we have a grappling shot i don't know what those little icons mean next to the range down there has like an axe or something i don't know uh moves to here to the tile of a killed target that makes sense to be a good way to maneuver as well or wait does that take doesn't take mana this does two action two mana grape shot nine targets now we're talking and it ignores dodge oh shoot oh you double cheeked up what the fudge do you have like all oh my god you just get one plus actually he's got six action points you're crazy what is this minus one bag slot that's fine minus three mana rough but you know an extra movement point minus three magic damage and dodge okay that's fine you're not using that anyway right i think this is this range damage okay so far that works too and then we have jalenka is that right is that a j i think so to link is that t i know we're gonna go with the j jalenka who has um oh a rusty axe it has reduced accuracy but it's one-handed effects inaccurate wait what this attacks lack of precision increases targets dodge what huh well that sucks i'm assuming because it looks like it targets three in a line so maybe the farther it is the less likely it is to hint but you can do it five times in a turn it's decent damage intimidating scream the skill doesn't require a direct line of sight we like that six targets it gives minus damage mine's 33 damage minus 10 accuracy okay and axe boomerang it um yeah it just hits five people for decent amount of damage pretty self-explanatory okay it'll be interesting to see how this one works uh extra physical damage and resistance perfect minus armor and dodge that's unfortunate but minus one trinket's hot now plus 10 dodge okay well you're confusing me because we still got pretty decent dodge honestly yeah i think we keep the gear on everyone we got so just one deployment yeah okay let's get uh chalenka up there abigail with her druidic staff and kirill with his wooden pistol i think there's plenty of room for us um we're just gonna army up just in case it's so fun uh let me see what this looks like oh very cool very fun yeah i think we're good whoa kind of cool wait let me let me test this okay why did i just shoot my own why did i just shoot my own building okay i forgot it with the damage so apparently i have to kill in order for me to move to the target um hopefully that building has so much damage what the fudge am i do okay hey it wouldn't be me and last spell if i wasn't a little paper to start okay but i think it's time we absolutely dunk on these plebs let's see oh you kind of you gotta kind of get close here with this thing don't you oh that's cool though oh that's fun that's very fun ridic staff so many options does this do this doesn't do any damage it's just a big debuff okay really good later on when we're gonna see a lot of armor um oh but it's it's it's not i thought it would be forward three fudge so she just kind of like swings okay that makes sense intimidating screen no damage axe boomerang fudge man this is going to be interesting we might have to chillax wait for them to get a bit closer the entangle is nice but we don't need to do that right now it kind of we have 18 man though i guess i don't need to be yeah why don't we just go ahead and see what they've done very fun oh well well well all right and then if i move here boosh of course that didn't kill you i didn't want it to anyway but you're severely crippled am i i'm like just now i'm not doing enough damage ever that's fine we'll just get you all weak stupids i do have a lot of action points though so it's not oh that was all i could do i guess that kind of makes us awkward i could hook shot but yeah so i'm definitely gonna need to give him another gun huh another weapon because like i could do this but then i'm just putting myself in arms away which i don't want to do i don't want to use mana right now i'm not close enough to punch back on punch so i i mean i could run up there but that just kind of seems dumb this gives minus damage and accuracy i think we're just chilling right here so they can't hit us uh i need to kill you screay yeah and then he didn't get heard lost so do that and a bada bing about a boom poison's killing okay now we got a couple of homies what is good maybe the grape shots the playing out oh oh i'm look at oh talk about value ready still okay we need we need to do a little bit more raw damage it like does a lot but just enough that it's not enough but i guess it's good at wounding it doesn't have to kill everything i guess right leave it to somebody else or something um those people can move quite a bit might just propagate you guys yeah why not oh yeah you guys are boned we could just do big ol minus movement but i frankly don't even care about that um let's kill you and then come up here whack you dodged this is a good start i already hate the axe are you kidding me all that for that what okay well what if i just do this well right now i'm at action point so now i'm just in the middle and whatever you got plenty of action points i guess i can help you let me just pop finish you off out of range freaking  yeah i really need to stop him freaking pop you're dead we're getting out of range uh you did all right i think the poison is just going to kill them i want to say so i'll just hit the runner screw the runner like that and then i think they're all weakened enough oh my god wait i didn't realize oh my wait what what the fudge i thought there were so many oh jesus okay i want to go home now that's some good value again and then this might be a time for like maybe a big minus movement speed maybe on this side oh i'm out of range hold him there we go all right just kind of contain them like that uh then i'm gonna propagate here all right don't you dare mess pog i always knew you had it in you um does this kill no do we kill it yes nicely done uh we can you know i can't hit you hold it and then these guys movement has been rather impaired all right so he's handling that side great stuff buddy you know these are like especially this pistol this axe it's a little bit more difficult especially with the staff it's less straightforward the pistol it's a lot of crippling i'm not killing anything and if i can't one shot things on the first wave i'm never going to be doing that so i need to get used to that kind of play style um i guess i can just use that um what does this roar do again minus damage and accuracy don't miss pog uh wacky there run back and then hurt these fellas oh wait no i meant to do something about this runner dang it okay i don't think he can hit anything he might be able to hit one of our walls but all right don't you do it you son of a son of a i won't forget this how how much am i going to regen at the start of the day the other main region too okay then i'm just going to stop using my my grape shot how much wine does this movement okay so they're delayed movement for one more turn it's pretty good we region four so if i don't use anything else we'll be topped off so i might want to hold off then um in which case go here whack you kidding make me sick hold on oh okay hit him i'm here son of a gun man all right i guess i just gotta start doing whatever i can here which is not enough the answer okay um i'll um i'll debuff these guys because you're probably gonna take a couple hits here unless i can save you i don't think so yeah i don't think so i'll try i guess i don't have that many offensive options here all right screw it looks like i'm bee sting [Music] you're welcome all right now i'm moving back here i can do nothing for you soon what if i just walk up punch um i don't need the grapple shot okay kill that dude hit that dude grapple shot punch um shoot run away that way pog big brain over here oh wait what the fudge when did that happen okay i guess i'm blind sitting there like i'm so smart yeah sure thing whatever you say mr fruit five health machine it feels bad all right do you do you have this because frankly it doesn't feel like you do i don't want to use more mana with you by the choice i'd just get rid of you but bring your stupid axe i know some people probably dude i like swear by it and i'm so happy for you i guess that wasn't bad okay we got a wound oh we're out of range there we go i can't finish him off now over her just start boosh i'll punch punch shoot um punch because i can only do four of the shots before you know you know what i'm saying everything she uses those mana for gamba i'm gonna do three here one there uh-huh farm that movement same here bop two action points yeah i could do it you know i don't want to spend the mana okay just just shoot and then i'm just i'm gonna get my druidic staff user to punch dilly dilly first night freaking crushed level up level up level up ass frank naturally we get all of our bonuses ignore them you know oh my god oh i could i didn't go all the way oh fudge me well because i'm preparing 683 essence we'll take it an s i would hope so it's it's the first night mr fruit nothing to really celebrate there uh but i believe i can finish one of my unlocks here that's fun is he gonna reveal his form no i wouldn't know i wasn't listening anyway okay [Music] is there anything new oh there is what unlocks the ballista automatically firing bolts at the incoming horde the mounted ballistic defense with added elevation granting it vision what what the fudge okay i'm invest oh look at this but then we can get off hand so then we could literally like dual pistols or something what we'd have dual swords what more more danger mixed what unlike two-handed sword rifle and magic orb heroes are generated plus here's the journey with another action what wait so what do i go towards more action points or this freaking oh i'm going for the ballista are you kidding me what i think i i guess i like some prowess let's see oh what a lady wait oh i thought it said i did i guess i didn't okay nevermind you mind silly what am i talking about we did level up you are physical damage so that's actually 10 is pog and reliability isn't bad we need accuracy oh there we go although like it's it's very possible yet let's see if i just get you a new weapon i guess not no okay we could get you propagation bounces that could be good for druid and mano way to sing um just damage multi hits in real life that's pretty good or block moving points momentum and resistance could be good for jalenka but this is just sick for the druid i feel like it's too good to not grab that means we still don't have else to go so it's just that i could invest more in accuracy but if i go with well i mean maybe it's just it's not a bad thing reliability is pretty sick too i'm gonna go with reliability yellow perks fatality experience i feel like i just go experience why not i feel like it's a little greedy but you know physical damage uh no you were arranged i believe we could give you another movement point i don't think you need it that much give me some more dodge or armor um uh um gamba oh all right i guess just more man experience game that's pretty good accuracy i don't think you're inaccurate at all although as we get further in the enemies do get more dodge so accuracy is important so that or just experience game let's just go accuracy because i'm gonna give you see you don't get steady aim like a bow user because you're moving quite a bit so we're just gonna give you experience game too what you want abigail um no oof okay well i guess you're getting crit because that's really gonna come in handy uh wow okay you do do poison i'm just gonna go with it six percent accuracy or five percent damage uh we'll go you know what we're going damage yolo perks oh i'll tell you what perk we getting if we keep druid staff though poison's pretty pog but i have no idea if we're keeping these weapons currently um okay i could have just literally looked at this novices power staff what does this do completely different things apparently this does more damage uh what a lot more damage though what the heck targets one plus eight boy what is he doing effects minus 10 accuracy girl what oh i think around the person i hit that's what okay stunning entrance we have a good chance to stun 70 stan chance to stun everything around it oh interesting it costs a movement point to cast as well as everything else um you don't need vision though moves the hero to the tile of a kill target what the okay that's balls that's all mega balls you kidding me and then we have scorching wave which i guess makes sense because it's a close quarters one six targets opportunistic or fire thrower range melee nine targets this thing's kind of raw um we could get better body armor with dodge stun chance daily health regen this is very interesting oh we could go with a rusty spear instead this axe see i need an offhand melee weapon because i can't give them this otherwise this is health but less movement points i kind of want to go with this power staff although at the same time this druid staff is big brain and is super super helpful the power staff is just like oh mega like i'm just trying to damage everything you know i'll grab this i'm going to keep the staff though because i i don't know why i keep forgetting i can have different weapon sets it's not end-all be-all so i might just yeah i get another thing too to add to this the axe with uh jalenka i've never seen a spear target's three limit see it seems so much oh well that costs two mana um multi hits skewer armor piercing oh triple swipe okay we'll just grab one of these and i'll throw that on you as well let's go to character sheet give you a different build oh that's two hands that's probably why it does more damage propagation yeah this all goes to [Music] abigail abigail you rascal there you go oh a prowess has been unlocked oh yes of course i know that i know why that happened i spent money unlocked dagger crossbow i'd already had that maybe it's a two-handed crossbow and the magic scepter yes very good very good now moving on let's see it takes oh a hundred eighty it's by an end grants the ability to recruit additional heroes okay screw everything though i think that's what i'm saving for how many workers drive four so then uh give me all the gold i can't only 28 gold i'm getting scammage down here that's all the workers i have but build some defenses do i need to i'm gonna do that keep it minimum we already have some walls one thing so i don't even have to build a gate you know screw it um everybody over here because we'll go to the deploy phase in a second like i mean at what point is like i could get a gold mine and it could possibly get me gold but at what point is it worth it like i just want to beeline and in and then do everything i don't know if that's the play but i really want more heroes and the more heroes we can get before the days go on i feel like that's just the play right but then they're probably gonna cost gold and then i'll need so yeah it's like do i build a gold mine because i think it's what like 10 or 20 gold every two days or something i mean is it that worth it it would take like four days to recoup the cost maybe i shouldn't have bought all that gear i should have looked at the end first whatever all right we're gonna head into the next day in the next episode continue this run and see where we can get uh this end's freaking sick being able to get more heroes is i think going to be a game changer so i'm excited for that i hope you all all continuing to enjoy this let's play with that sound thank you all much for watching happy sales fantastic day i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
