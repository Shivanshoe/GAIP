hi everyone my name's mr. Furth and welcome back to call of duty modern warfare and in today's video the port doc is all alone I am evidently invisibly I am the invisible mate God players only want one thing and it's disgusting well let me tell you it's not this playlist this is 10 v10 shipment might be like that sounds No I'm losing my mind dude I am trying to unlock the new light machinegun but you have to kill three enemies while near smoke in 15 different matches it's just like some arbitrary way to get you to play more games it's slowly killing me and then on top of that we're working towards up sitting on the mp5 but I gotta shake guys I am struggling i 100% prefer the Damascus grind to the obsidian grind it at least gives me clear goals and I can make a slow but steady progress but just getting like 80 kills and around and then seeing the number go from fallout of 150 to 7 out of 150 bro so you guessed it I'm gonna throw some smoke and try and get three kills real quick then after that we go for the obsidian people are throwing smokes this is great first blood obviously totally deserve that yep I'm got knifed Oh just just get ready for it man you thought spawn didn't make sense before oh you sweet summit Chad you know nothing of horrible terrible there's a knife somewhere wait why am i reloading I'd like a hundred bullets I don't think more bullets is really what I need okay that's three that one wasn't near smoke though but I have a feeling we should be there everywhere oh okay that should be four out of 50 we got a personal radar I mean pop what what why is it not six not really important butter bean butter boom we're onto the mp5 and I got to tell you the one nice thing though about granny for the Damascus is finally I can just use whatever I want with whatever attachments I want I mean obviously like I still got it like to use the mp5 for instance every game because that's if city and I'm going for it but I don't have to prescribe to some bizarre loadout or way to play I can play the game however I want it's just that I have to play a lot of the game for one single obsidian by the way and I've still saved myself so I have no idea what obsidian looks like in-game is it worth the grind I have a no idea but I certainly hope it's worth at least doing one of them I I'm gonna be honest I'm gonna try to get one obsidian but don't hold out on hope for me to get a second one holy damage what well is that I don't know but we won cool blazing that was actually like beyond fast I didn't even get one tick for my obsidian 4 out of 15 haha we're that much closer to the bruinen MK 9 and start this off right with some smoke wait what wait what just somebody walk in the middle huge okay that's one near smoke and that's two near smoke I think the smoke screen I don't think that one's gonna count I'm obvious but we get a personal radar I can show you the world screw that guy up in the booty ah he's dead yeah just know this you killed me okay for some reason there are trophy systems galore I don't know if that counted near smoke okay that 100 cent did that should be good good kill me thank you obsidian here I come I mean like in like a hundred more games or whatever you know but like I'm almost there you know what why should I be covering it let's just roll some Yoshi's music hold on let me realize I'm reloading got a kill got a kill this is going well but I have to be careful the game was practically ready to spawn somebody on me as soon as I take two steps out I will get spawned behind oh my god chopper gunner all right well we're staying in here out of necessity if nothing else I spawn I spawned stay focused stay alive got him oh you have a specialist bonus oh my god [Music] watch me get a new gun to me ten shipment it's gonna happen oh yes yes fun see that's fun I don't know I took so many bullets but you saw firsthand just how ridiculous it is I just shot my friends look is this the bravest play style no what is it the safest play style yes out here in this ten be ten shipment it's this or death believe that if they're gonna spawn them all like that how am I to stand a chance there's someone else behind the story no I blame my friend he gave up my arrow never mind that all the people had killed that knew that I was there that's really irrelevant you know let's just blame my friends its way from way more fun that way nice thermite and and by that I mean it killed no one yeah headless little hey no swivel all right meet up quicker swivel Oh get process information yeah back into the box back into the pool nice missile idiot I can't see through the smoke oh my god man who asked for this what card player asked for this the one thing caught players do Watchers removal a skill days matchmaking oh thanks for finding new work actually apparently that's not true because all the casuals are playing the game and clearly it's working for Infinity Ward they're making more money and more people are playing so yeah skill based matchmaking ain't going anywhere whatever about a 15 it's hard work but honest work and 14 out of 150 great we're almost there just like two thousand more kills ah yes tank top morrow whatever you're also so original you kiss your mother with her own credit card that you used to buy those skins yeah think about what you've done there's a guy up there you eat alright I didn't get any kills near smoke so I'm just gonna yep die I take to wait for it to pop wait for the pop there's one and that's just one oh my god don't even I spawned and smoked oh just keep tossing it mad and keep shooting mid that's all there is to it Jesus dude oh what a spa oh wow we got one of those Brad that was like that was the spawn you know I'm saying but hundred round mag like how did he not die by the way what is going on I don't know and quite frankly I don't like it okay okay John stick to mop smoke written okay I just need I just need two more oh my this global plebs trophy system gun whose idea was this whose idea was this I'm shoot and I'm shooting someone's got to be in the smoke then they spawn right behind me Oh Mike what what their game's over did I join I had to join in progress I don't think I did I don't even get enough to progress on that LMG well at least my doze is no longer alone it was a little boy I really should just do this in hard core shouldn't I should I just don't like a handgun - you need a little less kills and like a s in hardcore maybe be easy I don't know would it be faster unsure just let me shoot some people in their smoke dude please just three literally three is all that I need one more there I'm two more math is hard okay just keep chucking the smokes there appeared to be other oh that's - I think I can't really tell how close he was and okay okay okay I think that's enough but I'm not entirely sure so I might do one more for posterity sake let's try it out ow ow ow ow ow pick up all the tags just unleash okay that should be good onto the mp5 how many kills we have four okay so at 19 we'll get a tick off with a very least I can get one tick in this game yeah the annoying part too isn't like total kills you finally get 14 kills in a match with the mp5 that's wasted no progress has been made you know at least when it's like kill a thousand enemies or like whatever the cam will be seems like 750 whatever 800 I don't remember what they were for Damascus there's something like that but at least at those you're always making price you don't have to hit a certain threshold every match yeah that's the more frustrating part - oh nice 29 kills in the match way to frag here is one tick towards your progress so realistically you know you need like what I did the math or like 2400 kills whatever with the gun but actually that's if everyone goes towards progress which spoilers more often than that's not gonna happen we're we're just letting them have it Bob everybody's stem and I'm dad God to God look at his madness not even the Spartans would partake an F it'd be like this all my 14 kills yeah oh yeah another match no obsidian progress they just put all these game modes in a ten beat em playlists that are done in like two minutes I mean I guess it's quicker on the LMG progress I kind of need the option stop turnin all right you guys know the drill pops some smoke and hope that I can find somebody in this man that how is there no one on that side of the map what do a quarter of the map and no one was there what they did was run ops to their spawn it's all they had to do they couldn't even do that for me useless the lot of them a lot of them okay one down let's try and get another fudge we almost had to okay okay okay I'm dead nope oh my god I'm going insured oh I feel like they spat in my face like oh you did all that work for Damascus well here's an even more monotonous grad like I don't know what I would rather do is sit around waiting for a long shot mounted crouching kills or just eight million kills well I mean this is just stupid kills would not want your smoke why should that even boom just just keep checking it keep checking it god yeah I don't even know if that was near smoke though it's so hard to say okay that one should count ah and of course it doesn't tell you if you've made progress so you have to guess so like I think I'm there and well that would have done it but screw meme and friend takes it okay okay okay that should definitely do it so I'm just gonna swap over one more kill probably wouldn't hurt but whatever I'm just gonna I'm just holding it down alright there we go alright mp5 time we're at seven kills we'll need math 22 to at least get one tick but games go quit well actually a little bit more time here I might actually be able to get a tick towards obsidian this is exciting well with a with a flank like this it certainly helps oh my god I'm out of ammo nice to mask it Steve although a play club played all but I spawn right behind you so right back at ya buddy ol pal do-do-do-do-do Figaro put his thing and then not even see this I got it your wagon that Sentra why didn't it target mean I don't think I had no cold blooded is a fourth Street for me so I most definitely did not to average it just felt my response dude holy Hecker's oh my god HQ well I didn't get wait did I even get a killer I don't even I don't even know I seem to just a love getting assists tell me that much I am the assist daddy whenever you get assist you must call me daddy whenever I get a kill I have to call them daddy because they evidently let me oh my god it had so many kills right there if only I had a bigger mag we deciding what kind of popping off we're we're kind of I'm out a mile hold on I was popping off give me some ammo give me some ammo let me let me scavenge I'm hungry I'm hungry feed me feed me we're all that are you all taking mice cabbage packages like what's going on here oh my god way to saying wait a sec no no why would they do this we were fraggin to man you hate this  is that our helicopter yeah of course it isn't have fun riding in the shipment game everybody's favorite game this is this is Tim b10 shipment in a nutshell killstreak score hide in container prey it's about all we really can do to not much else could be done 29 kills all right that should be one tick but see like all that from one tape yeah I gotta be honest with you all the Damascus grind was tough don't get me wrong but I had some hope and I liked the fact that I had to always mix it up though but this is just used a gun for an ungodly long amount of time so you know what I might just have say hey we got Damascus cream to take that W screw obsidian with us I don't think about much watching every cell is a fantastic day and remember cod players only want one thing it's not this playlist or the challenge for this gamma grant actually top players want a lot of things a lot of things but somehow you manage to get one of them wrong
