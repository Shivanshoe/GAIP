in today's dream team the dream team hey we we oh what no that was not your cue that wasn't my cue sorry oh oh my okay take two uh blue i'm coming back jesus yeah sorry you would have thought we're back hey road to trials we did it and by we i mean we waited on rob the the prodigal son wait where is he i wonder oh that's my cue i'm like kylo ren when he was cool coming out the ship yeah it didn't work just cut out but that's cool but i got 1280 i so i had to grind five and a half hours this morning to get to 1280. i didn't i did pvp i did gambit i did strikes i did nightfalls i even did the thing we did yesterday again wow thank you but now it's road to vault that's how we have to do this i'm so oh god i don't belong in your presence so strong i don't know what this one is you do the honky pokey and you do it all about uh anyway yeah so uh we're actually finally doing trials thank god thank god it only took us an extra 12 hours [Music] series if first go we go flawless hey see look at us i'm vibing in the ship that is currently damaged and barely working and it's going to peter out by the time we get to the second game wow that's oddly uh let's put it this way okay like 30 of players this weekend got flawless okay that's a third of people you would think no no no no your stats your stats have have canonically been very wrong so don't tell us 30 percent of all players it's everywhere but then slight problem i didn't want to look but i can't help it rob's 1281. yeah let's look at this okay so what do we got here can put everything i did into today so be nice here was my plan i was going to go straight why aren't you just infuse it like what am i looking at what the subs i thought everyone was saying substance multi-kill clip was good uh that's what we call baited i mean for pve but yeah what about this one we'll buy this one that's much better that's much better no okay maybe they were saying it was this one okay just like just put on like ace of spades man you i know you have that yeah dude no that's a different no no ace of spades hold on let's open up destiny item manager no just go in your collection and just if you don't just just make it again election where don't i have to be at the tower to do that no no oh my god hey hey put you're killing wind collection no no no don't make that dude put on rob put back on servant leader put on the put back on the killing win one yeah listen rob is not going to be winning any close range engagements so you know that's a great point you'll just be sitting in the back being like oh i did i feel like i hit him cause great job honey that's the plan love it thank you blue thank you for helping my perspective on that let's see that's my is that the sniper using rob i think yeah um okay i'm gonna hit headshots with it though so oh yeah yeah uh-huh lead from gold okay you're wrong hold it together that rocket launcher is fine what hey we need you to get some mods in your armor big guy jesus what are these numbers everyone in your chats go and lead from gold lull and it's spelled the exact same way it's lead from gold i get that but how am i supposed oh my god before we go in rob we need you to get wow that's a really good helmet oh my god oh those are pretty not bad boots either i'm impressed thank you that's a really good helmet um listen um we need you to put some some mods let's be honest we're wasting our time mods no no no no okay so when you write a card okay you could you could like break major spec targeting adjuster uh that yeah a targeting adjuster would be nice okay i put that on my scout yeah put yeah for a scout targeting adjuster that's not bad um maybe like yeah let's check this out check this out hold on okay on your on your gauntlets do like a reloader you know get like check out the reload speed on this yeah yeah like dexterity for the chess piece for the chess piece you could do like some unflinching mods that would be nice okay boss spec counter balance stock is that no armor armor armor armor armor on your body holy suck do you like unflinching oh uncheck on my chest piece i thought you guys were talking about my gun he watch him have like no mods how many what mods do you have big guy hand cannon reserves leaner fusion rifle reserves unfortunately grenade launcher aim unfinishing hand game unflinching pulse rifle aim unflinching scout rifle there you go yeah you could do you could you could do unflinching sniper or scout i don't even think i don't have a sniper one okay that's fine we'll just do scout uh your leg pieces okay we can do i don't think you'll have holster mods i do have holster mods but i don't have enough energy no that's a pump that energy up pumping them throw a couple pump it louder i'm at five now wow you could do like maybe sniper holster or scout or uh do you have a scout holster no do you have a sniper holster i have side very rifle scavenger that's not going to do anything do you have um uh what other mods do you have well like like you're the ones closest to the top like do you have like uh in in in we're gonna skip all that uh we're gonna put a recovery mod in your first slot i did it you're a cloak let's throw another recovery mod in there boom what's your recovery at right now oh you're 71. that's pretty good that's pretty good that's pretty good yeah this is looking amazing but none of these mods help with my aim so i hope you guys know that my aim is going to be fine you i thought you had a targeting mod on your helmet for your scout uh that would be correct yeah that does help him okay now the real important thing is blue [ __ ] what are we working with here ace of spades here you go i got a spades i got my proximity truth teller and then i have my controvers hold to cheese people and just spam out of handheld supernovas if they get too close to me i love it i am at least a little more prepared than rob uh i feel like i'm feeling a little crazy i want to have a little

like i'm feeling blessed by the light dude like any any fellow guardians wait a second dude you and rob literally did the same exact damage somebody says this is widely different vibes from the last time playing trials it helps when there's a population playing trials and it's not just recuvs cheaters and sweats now don't yeah you see we got this vibe going wait till like game five then talk to us and then we're gonna remember why we don't play trials except we're gonna pop up uh one's burning behind pillar but i got destroyed by hochman he's behind pillar regening still you there you go rob there you go okay two at the door careful oh oh my god you're crazy they're both to your right blue [Music] okay so they're playing it different they know they can't match up to us in range yeah 100 yeah okay in range because they don't have as much range and they saw rob scouting like just push uh the i'm the only one who got a kill last round mr fruit so no i'm saying that's why they're pushing

possibility you know that is a possible run not likely but and like i don't get how you guys get your super so fast i'm more i'm only like halfway because you just don't have anything you don't have any intellect oh that's a grenade launcher ow he's made by the heavy over here he's got a shield up there you can probably get one of our rez's oh they're rushing one minute left my friend a ballsy
