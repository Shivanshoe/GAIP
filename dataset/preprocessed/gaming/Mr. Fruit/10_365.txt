all right boys you defeat whatever is inside here you can take all the loot that awaits you back i'm going in [Music] how did i die hey what the hell i thought was like 76. i i think i ended on day like four like i said we played a little bit just uh just a minute or two no this really goes on doesn't it um let me see yeah we kind of just been going for a while oh looks like we're gonna loop back to the boys perfect that's good news because then that shows me that there is a channel to the ocean so is there a specific reason we're hoping that we have like a river going to like our base sort of thing from the ocean so that way we can make like a dock and have the big boat right there because it's not easy to make it and take it everywhere and then that way the so the whole reason like ores can't be teleported is so you have to like actually work for them which means like you'll have to essentially sail them back home oh so you actually have to got it yeah cause like your boats will have storage so you sail out thanks daddy well on top of that we need to sail out because we haven't even found the next biome we have to do is swamp and we haven't found that yet so we need to like sail out find it and as long as it's connected to our main base that means like we can always get back no yeah bringing materials to make teleporters so we can so it's really the convenience factor if we can find a way to the ocean yeah um oh wait a minute specifically we could uh right by our house we could put the dock right yeah all right yeah cool should we be scared of like creatures of the deep is that is that something i should be worried about hell yes is it bad that i'm happy that creatures of the deep exist well we'll see where we get there you're happy about it now but when we're in the middle of the ocean our boat dies and we drown with all of our gear don't worry i'll change my mind very quickly yo how did you build these like kilns and stuff with a hammer um you need cores which is what you find from dungeons uh that's why you go into dungeons all right give me a second my uh very precious resource my stamina is very low currently prepare for war so how do you smell how do you add a tin and copper together i'm ready um you have to forge all right we have to hope he doesn't have a stick uh oh he doesn't punk okay i'll draw aggro shoot him real quick you get sneak damage all right and then i'll just uh rope and dope him i'll just go for some shots stories nice ah okay uh is there any point in holding for longer uh yeah more damage okay and more accurate nice i like that you like it uh i'm almost out of stamina me too so you know all right i'm out i'm just sort of standing here come here be stupid all right starting up again hey big stupid you telling him stupid i made my first armpit let's go we pooped on this guy give him the bag the world flows back it's it's it's not graceful but it'll do no no no no no it's more insulting that way we're just really drawing it out that way he really knows what just happened to him all right is this dungeon oh are we are we doing the snow dungeon are we doing normal dungeon we're doing this dungeon first then we go to the snow one yeah so we can actually see what one looks like where you don't die all right all right mushroom i i picked up the mushrooms does anyone have a torch they can use i do not i do not okay again hammer i got the best shields yeah all right now you go you go with fruit hammer over here no come with me push i followed the wrong one all right where are we going all right just follow fruit you'll have a shield now and just slam nothing so far we gotta pick up coins the door just breathed at me menacingly oh here you go i'll be on coin duty and then once we're all done i'll split the coins four ways all right that was that one so you're like the banker in monopoly where you're sneaking some under the table i take a small interest fee all right so we can't pick ax through any of like the walls if they're dead ends or anything like that not these ones now go go go go go oh oh there you go that's really good against uh skeletons because of the blunt damage oh we went upstairs we'll let rob fight the ghost nah all right you got it rob go on buddy no i'm running away you wanted the league go on you seem like i'm nervous for some reason i'm the i'm the breach and then you guys are the banging clear oh very nice i can hit through you which is fantastic let me get the bones a little amber all right rob you got it you got it rob you got it go on i got what go breach right there oh god you're right go get him get him rob get it kill it wrong get him right no it's on me get him you got it you get him leave me alone [Laughter] why are you running wrong get it because i can't do anything about it scared a ghost rob yeah wow oh my god well it's stuck all right well i'll use my bow and arrow then oh i'm down here oh wait i don't even think i can i can't even hit it which is nice nice look at that i glitched it big big you know you know when it has to be near then we fought a ghost there's nothing rob handled it calmly this is a terrible first the entire time yeah what is it i swear what'd you say what do you what does it mean if we find the ghost usually after the ghost there's usually a room with super goodies over here oh no it's dead was it just like circumstantial i guess this is just a bad dungeon fruit and i had a dungeon where we had like 11 cores or something like that what was that most 11 or 15. i think 15. we had like a crazy dungeon we're not finding any cores in this one that's right the the last one way we'll have like eight million trust yeah no when we search everything uh rob what's going on buddy get him all right let's deal with skeletor nice all right diddy diddy wow that was done actually ass yo there has to be at least one this is like the fastest quest i've been on my whole life first dungeon we never found a single corn all right retrace everything maybe we missed something yeah i must i'm just just in case there's a door we missed or something i'm sticking with you guys it's too dark yeah i'm not seeing already anything over here chief yeah this dungeon's ass come out of here all right the next dungeon's about to be crazy packed oh yeah i swear guys it's it's right oh wait wait where's rob we lost rob i'm coming hey guys that was that was totally worth all the hype had a great time [ __ ] um it's getting very cold this dungeon looks different it has like a mushroom head oh no really tell me more this is the first dungeon that we wasn't attached to uh like a like a giant landmass yeah this is like a snow dungeon too so it might be a little bit more sketch oh no i i found a dungeon like this okay reach back clear grab that story guys this one will be cool here we go on my mark mark we'll go left left already going upstairs monkey back back right right oh my god double up oh dead end oh back back [Laughter] i'd say overall uh dungeons have been i swear it really amazing experience gotta wait all right we went left we go this way go this way i'm just double checking never mind it's dead end yeah i hear bones all right here we go boys it's about to pop off all right get ready spawner time where's the spawner right oh there it is oh here are some cores you guys got it we got coors yeah rob why don't you get yourself some cores oh we got a core our first core what's a core that's what you used to make smelters and kilns intelligence look at the shields i wish we could pick those shields up shield or something from it imagine guarding a dead end that's sketchy imagine it couldn't be me okay uh randall just stand in front of this one all right like it's a very important job we're interested in the okay oh i'd like to imagine it's just good to start oh jesus yo watch me parry i gotta help with this one holy [ __ ] nice too good i wasn't even trying oh hey nice i'm helping make sure you use a blunt weapon don't use your spear doesn't do much damage to him wow all right i'm going down now we're going down nothing down nothing up either we're going left we're going straight that's why i wanted to go the whole time anyway he's also guarding the denim wow dude this these two dungeons suck we found the worst dungeons possible thank you so much for taking me on this adventure we told you you'd go get copper we said it'd be more interesting all right i didn't realize you guys were actually trying to give me the content you were yeah we were we were telling you guys like bro trust me yeah i guess copper really is the play i'm gonna go and mine that all right for the record north where what i got another dungeon i got one more uh oh i have more than one but there's one to the north that's the one that's close i think i'm gonna go mine copper like look dude like like i believe you and all but [Music] i'm never gonna get used to the sound the deer make we have to go back for our storage thing i mean yeah we're gonna go back no matter what on the bright side i feel way better about killing them when they're making noises like that i feel like i'm doing them a favor they're just always in heat i was going to say in pain but yours is probably more accurate oh this is copper right here too there's like kill me kill me kill me i'm in so much pain [Music] [Music] your boat deserves better fix this i'm gonna need to do [Music] all right well here's what i'm hoping to do i'm hoping to find a swamp land there build a quick little hut lay down the
