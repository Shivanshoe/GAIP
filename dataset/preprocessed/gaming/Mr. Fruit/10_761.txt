Furth and welcome back to Super Smash Brothers ultimate and a new fighter approaches but wait a second this isn't right this gotta there we go much better and I must warn you the last time I played Super Smash Brothers was when Terry came out and before that was when hero came out show a little rusty that's what I'm saying is if you lose to me that's embarrassing another fine blown character just what I've always wanted here's the thing about violet she looking like a pretty great low tier character or maybe mid tier nobody's a super big honor yet but that's just cuz you know she's misunderstood do it almost happened would have been sick okay and he's just gonna punish me yeah yeah okay she is really great at breaking shields if people are dumb enough to hold shield when you hit them with stuff but most people don't know oh that's hipper on the F smash you get a tipper on that thing yeah she go hurt I just gotta get him off off the ledge no bro I thought I was the King huh I thought I was the king if it goes up long enough I do have super armor but um that might be enough to just kill me everything he does has better frame data than me I swear to God hmm I'll hold some shield SmartPlug douche Oh grab like this yep or just dipper oh my god I'm about to do this no I'm not no don't let me you feed don't go I'm dead I mean look what do you want to say I'm like in the
