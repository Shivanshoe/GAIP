hi-dee-ho my name is mr. fruit and happy new years to all of you out there not even it's not like a holiday everyone it's it's 2020 although how does that Chinese they have their own new year or something are they had a different calendar okay I don't really know how many of that works that's not how I thought I would open up this video hey hi how are ya happy new decade huh yeah it feels like guys just in school learning about the Roaring Twenties now it's our 20s what's good what are we get whatever our twenties gonna be known for it god only knows I'm terrified wanted to make this video as a little recap of the previous year and looking forward lots happened especially in this past decade I mean I look back a decade ago I was in high school no idea what I was doing my life I was all alone and Here I am I'm engaged to the love of my life found her we're gonna marry this year we have two little fur babies two corgis they're adorable I went to college dropped out and pursued my dreams which I never thought would happen YouTube YouTube's turned into what it is now obviously it's crazy to think we're the past ten years have taken me and where the next ten might I don't really know but I'm excited either way and you can bet the next ten years means a whole bunch of content you're not I'm not going anywhere I'll be doing this for as long as I can because I love it but it also brings me to 2019 which will get after you get into right after I talk about my new year's resolutions which I don't do New Year's resolutions I'm not here to harp on that I do have one resolution get a haircut my hair is getting way too long and it needs to go yeah well and I guess just keep up my fitness and everything this past year was the first year where almost every day like all don't need the entire year never skipped anything didn't fall off the wagon at all boom I stuck to it this year we're gonna keep going it's gonna be great between 19's ID from the fitness was pretty rough it was my hardest year on YouTube for sure for several reasons and you guys might be confused as to why that is this was the year I felt burnout the most I've always had double uploads you know for the past four years or whatever and this year was the first time that that schedule was ruined for a while it was later in the summer there's like a couple months in there where I was struggling to even get a single upload a day and it wasn't because I wasn't trying to literally all I could muster was a single video a day I was having some health issues exhaustion issues simply because of that alone I was struggling to do anything that on top of my depression so I did have a deeper pit I suppose of my depression since I've started youtube was one of the worst I've had and just took its toll on top of the exhaustion and so yeah I was literally doing my best just to get a single video out of day I couldn't even try to do the double uploads I've done before but if you've seen recently gotten better at it what's been helping a lot too is going to bed and waking up at about the same time each time that seems to be really helping me regimen through my sleep schedule I go to bed around like 10:30 wake up around 6:30 get plenty of sleep that helps my workouts what I would used to do is at the very least what I'd do in the day is I needed to get to the gym and do something and I was having a hard time and I'd do some workouts but they weren't great at least compared to like what I'd been doing but recently I'm having the best workouts I've had in forever I feel energized and I think a little bit of it was actually the vacation I took the week with my fiance's family out in Mexico didn't do anything just lounged around for a week and I think my body just needed it it's like ah thank God came back I'm good to go ririn and revving up the L engine and so workouts now are going even better I'm getting the double uploads up and so everything seems to be on the up-and-up for the most part it was just a rough year because on top of that obviously moving to single off loads as well it was the worst year for the channel as a whole growth wise number wise all that kind of stuff and I tried to not look too much and get into it too much of that because that's just stressful and it's not gonna help anybody and Bob numbers can be very overwhelming but it definitely lies like at the back of my head we think we had an upswing here recently november paul duty has actually been doing really well which i'm glad and i've been enjoying that but ironically it was like the to be two tournament i posted i had no idea but it's like at a million views now one of my fastest growing videos i have no idea why but that kind of took off and I was like this is the first like semi viral video the channels hadn't a while probably since apex legends cuz apex legends was a good February but everything else it's been pretty slow game wise as well before fall so all in all I was just battling a whole bunch and then work cuz I do value work a whole bunch I know you're not supposed to like put your value as what you do or whatever but I love what I do and its majority of what I do during the day and stuff so obviously it's it's near and dear to me there's only so much you can do I am but a man a man who needs a haircut geez well weeks 2019 though did have its fair share of amazing moments we had the first ever fruit summit which I'm hoping to continue moving forward as to have that a look we'll probably try and you know iterate and and figure out how to make it better for this year and then the years moving forward I moved into my new house is very very awesome and very humbled again this is all the product of YouTube in the past few years and where I've gotten to we added a new puppy to the family which was Appa he is a handful but I love him then the less you might be able to hear some of their yelping they're playing outside right now some cool games did come out schecky ro famously almost killed the channel can't forget that can't we know it was a good year it was kind of marred by that whole downfall in the summer and the depression stuff thankfully I'm starting to come back to more normal levels if you guys don't know I struggle with reddit areal depression and more or less I'm sad all the time that's not entirely true it's just it's always with me and so some day better than others and it is what it is so looking forward though this next decade is gonna be fantastic like I said this year I'll be marrying Claire that's very exciting I'll be a married man it's weird to say weird to think but that's happening the the merch eliminated fruits on to collection that came out a couple weeks ago or I got a month ago I guess at this time we'll be releasing soon for a small window so that people who weren't able to get it then can get it now or didn't know about it or couldn't afford it watch out for that we also have also have an a cool other merch item I don't know when it's gonna be ready but we're working on that that's exciting been streaming more recently I haven't because I need to get back into my groove and the holidays were insane but we did that more we did that more in 2019 as well stream more than I ever had and then looking forward really it's just I don't know what to expect because if I've learned anything in the past couple of years it's don't bother trying to figure out what's gonna happen because load only knows laughs gonna take you where laughs gonna take you and as long as I get to share it with you I know it'll be the best seriously though I do appreciate all of you who have always watched my content whether it be well all right it hasn't been ten years since I've been doing YouTube I think I started in 2011 almost been a decade branch and it was a hobby for a while but that's a long time like black ops let me think that was like 10 years ago almost now that's insane to me it does not feel like that long ago time really does fly especially in this job I do not going out every day just doing the same thing and that if it wasn't for my workout that probably in football I wouldn't really know what day of the week it is that's really the only time I understand otherwise it's just it's just another day I work every day too so it's not like there's really the only reason I know is because Sunday I try and do off day and watch football so that's I just know how many days has it been since I took in a half day and watch football oh okay so it's probably Thursday is that sad that might be sad we also started the GG easy podcast in 2019 well we didn't start it but we vamped it rereleased it I don't know we rekindled the spark and so we've been doing that now that's been a whole bunch of fun with Rob and blue met some cool people did some cool stuff and then again if I look at the decade as a whole I couldn't even I can't even say I mean literally just from the moment that YouTube took off until now just like five years and that timespan of things crazy stuff has happened I never think would happen that I got opportunity two places to go people to see things to do yes that actually just says I've got people to see places things be people to see I can't not busy ok I don't know what I'm talking about okay I didn't want a hard bond for too long and now I am and God my allergies are acting up whoa I'm a mess listen I can't thank you all enough for the part of my life you've been in the past decade and I can only imagine where this next decade it's gonna take us hopefully you'll join me along for the ride but I just kind of wanted to briefly talk about how 2019 was the hardest year for me for YouTube it was the first time that I struggled to get stuff out this January I might do what I did last year and single upload this this month it was it was a nice break last January and again I do have stuff I want to work on the game I want to make is still in the process I mean it's a very involved complicated process thanks for listening to me ramble about this kind of stuff you've watched this whole way through your real one my eyes are killing me and i can't stop yawning and now i must go to the gym I just finished my morning smoothie delicious yeah I love yes thank you very much talk to you guys in the next one as always farewell [Music]
