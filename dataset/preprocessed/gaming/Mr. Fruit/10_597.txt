hi eighty hojoon my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to smite I know so soon well I've been buying a few more games since the last video and funny thing so it kind of seems sucks when I was playing but evidently I was playing BOTS you can probably see where this is going I hit level five queued up a game and all I can say is Wow things got real real fast so now you're gonna see my foray into a sweaty game so feel free to give me constructive feedback in the comments section or make fun of me but just know I'm telling you I don't know what I'm doing today we'll be playing around with Susanoo because well it kind of hurt to figure it out but they're not adding the avatar characters as brand new gods to play their skins for existing characters and so this fellow here Susanoo he is gonna be Zuko so I figure I should probably you know prepare myself with the characters that are gonna get the skins so I guess I'm a Zuko man he's afk well alright this is a good start that is the second game in a row that we've forfeited as soon as possible so going great hasaki that wait wrong MOBA oh it's the pub Patrol that's adorable okay so hopefully no FK this time I know what I'm doing though I want to get warriors blessing cuz I'm a solo and I also want to get the chalice of healing get the basic boot that's all my goal to get the first ability oh oh oh I didn't I didn't buy my relic though herp derp derp hold up hold up hold up okay so I want to grab the tell teleport clip perfect perfect alright now I don't know if they need help but if it's like weak I should help the jungler to give them a leash so I will be here too whoa wait what the fudge are you doing here you you've made like creepy you'd be suitors oh maybe you don't need me then kind of seems like you're self-sustaining alright you got it bud now who am i up against who is that it's a Bellona ah of course Bellona I don't know if I included like anything from Alaskan because we had an afk but my abilities okay look my first ability it's like three different Auto attacks or got watch watch watch my second ability I pull my third I throw a tornado it does deal damage over time and I can teleport to them all that good stuff okay I'm just gonna do some little poking action to the enemy hero because every time I deal damage within a certain amount of time on a cool-down I get a stack on my warriors blessing and at 15 it evolves and I want to try and do that soon I don't know why I didn't get a stack the first time but okay this person wants to get a little saucy with me so that's fine you guys did point out that evidently there is such a thing as last-hitting it's just not nearly as important you can see I got 25 go up there I don't know if you get more experience but I know you get a little more gold look at me count I don't think I got that last hit okay what's hey hey hey what the fudge yeah get off me Oh Oh or maybe not Oh maybe I'll just go on you okay oh okay a lot of damage a lot of damage that team team he's so weak though god they got the totem if I just had a little bit of freaking help I tried my best so they got they get like a little bit of gold and extra magic region when they're near their towers or something and also it doesn't help that I grabbed the wrong ability when I saw her spur of-the-moment panicked a little bit and unfortunately it did not work out in our favor so you hate to see that skirt that should be a last hit am I still getting targeted I shouldn't be there's a kill all right you'll lash - thing hurts so much okay we all just level that grants grants mm-hmm oh but I'm I'm gonna pull you into my tower come here come here I missed fudge okay fine I'll just try and stop them oh I'm out of mana oh my god why are they focusing me instead of it wait what is this girl doing she's jebaited me yeah wait why would they why are they still tagging me instead of I'm a stupid turret okay fudge I don't want to get rid of this so I'll be right back okay I want to get warrior tabby and I'm short so we'll do that and then I think next I get gladiator shield can I but no I can't okay so let me TP here so don't miss out well about my ability I'm learning guys I'm learning okay most of it yes comes straight from the whatchamacallit let me pull you real quick okay but there there is the enemy jungler but I think I think we 100 check out his kill yeah okay we got this kill to come on now okay wait for some reason my tornado missed oh I guess it hit one of the minions ah what a block on the minions part I already hate you alright imma hit you with that you're taking a little dot damage it ain't much but it's honest work I did fight against the solo laner who liked to take the magic buff so I guess I could have done that oh oh you're fighting oh but you're so far out there you're on your own hey I think I'm trying to get the totem of - I did it and our guy died okay I think he went way too deep oh but I just noticed 13 stack on our items already watch this ah that's pretty good hey that's pretty good alright do some damage over time you're struggling love this just start to bully the lane I got my alt before you but I also have a lot of money that I would like to use sooner rather than later yeah that little lip of yours I tell you what I hate it why are they still targeting me the heck get off me breath oh I missed that last hit and I missed that last hit and it turns out I'm just the worst I need to be careful of mana cost though if I want to all-in or use my alt I I don't have a lot of leeway there you like this whole strafe thing we got going on here yeah what up what up dude I'm just gonna old because I'm about to back so I'm just can do as much chip damage as I can turns out I am very strong okay let me level up here oh you're almost dead can I can I kill you I didn't even realize no if I just had mana I'm the worst wait wait I kill wait what just I did my minions kill that's pretty funny all right buy those boots I know you're supposed to go pretty offensive but there's a build where you go with a tanky item first and then full damage I kind of like that idea because I feel like I need a little safety now go in full glass cannon for me like with me you know like that's just so I'm gonna take this buff I don't know if that's like rude or if like that upsets him I mean it again I saw other solo laners do it so I think it's kosher I don't really know how he's coming for the buff oh okay oh wait well he was just helping me I guess okay yo let's gank this person let's gank this person go go go go go I love it I love what I'm seeing here but you're not going you're not going now you are pull back okay this is going great okay back back back back back back back back back back we don't have I don't have the mana or all my stuff was on cooldown I'm so sorry but I couldn't do anything oh my god what the what duck what the [ __ ] just happened she's like oh my god she's six kills already yeah well I just feel bullied I'm just gonna go ahead and teleport I couldn't buy anything unlocker as you hate to see it but it is what it is okay I'm just gonna let them attack my turret instead of me taking tons of damage okay see like why are they targeting me you know I'm saying I get a day job does Bellona she went assassins blessing okay I don't know what that does but he seems to be stacking that up just fine half yeah take a little bit of damage over time you like that mm saucy me thanks we're not doing much for me but that's okay and I kind of feel she now has level advantage I feel like whatever advantage we had Elaine I have now lost but I think that goes with that same at least I got a level just that gang kind of boned us what like why are they hitting me hit my chair with the fudge sorry I'm gonna get this last hit I'm nuts I have this person just healing so fast you have like a completed item or you've ninja tabi mm-hmm it's a great item it's great item one of my favorite really just timeless classic you know all right go up for some CS so I can dot you oh you got sniped and now I'm gonna jump on you cuz you didn't see that wait wait what the fudge okay that kind of seems like an OL so I'll alt you back you okay and now behind you you can't escape me that's right back off of me if I hadn't died at that turret I just had one more ability I'd be up on this person they wouldn't have even had a kill and if stupid jungler does it lady would just stop bullying me oh my gosh this is being on fantastic okay I realized - oh fudge me off fudge me I'm a daddy I'm a daddy pop everything I've got oh how do you just do so much household of greedy wasn't it yes this junglers just freaking everywhere dude okay I can buy the gladiator shield great now I go for hydras lament oh yeah okay so that's a little bit of a power spike here please don't feed my link cert sure you're you're gonna you're going to die because that pirate what it what is it pal a pale I guess you play soccer or something I don't really know what she's kind of insane all I know is she clicks things and I die real fast and this person is trying to get way too saucy with it look at this look at this oh I'm just a couple seconds are you not again a multi I'm out of here okay hey wasted my old butt didn't die so worth I'm destroying my lane but just getting babysat by Pele over here I'm gonna push this real quick oh it doesn't look good for our heroes oh boy okay hold on giant last hit okay that was pretty successful action okay whack some things by the way are there some settings I should turn on or anything like do my my doing stuff wrong I honest I would have no idea if I was what is this Pyromancer well that looks terrifying okay I was looking to see if maybe I could help ganker zips up but there's really nothing and I pushed my lane up so bitter idea much that's my fault oh but I can get that matter buff and we love the man up off yeah from a storm thing on him Bob you're dead give me that okay all right we're in business you best watch out below NER whatever your baloney wavering name is I don't know no about ten huh well so am I except guess what now I'm level 11 all right we got a level advantage here freaking massive I hit her with my storm because I'm actually just insane but now I'm taking minion aggro because of it so was it really worth who really knows okay I think she just used her old Lum ow I certainly seems like a no Lana it kind of seems really cool and she completely wasted it so it absolutely debated now my teammate is coming in here now I'm gonna pull and then I'm going to go past you and then worry about damage I don't really know why you just gave up on the kill if you were really that confident in me thank you but I would argue it might be a little misplaced I got hit by the tower that's unfortunate okay but I feel a little bit better I think Pele is in the right jungle and the good news is my junglers they just backed fudge I'm out of here I don't actually know where Pele is I might have been able to kill that turret but at what cost can i buy I can buy hydro ok and I have my teleport rune so this is pretty good ok this after using the ability my basic attacks deal extra damage or something so that's that's pretty rad if you ask me okay should I help right lane I feel like I don't know I'm just gonna I'm just gonna keep tunneling on on mine so it is what it is we're gonna go heartseeker next ok very good I kind of seems like everyone's fighting over there now oh but ok but my my guys here so I'm not a complete daddy and then I'm just gonna pull and I'm gonna hold leave this damage oh fudge bro hey Wow almost had that kill but then as soon as Pele shows just doesn't same damage in like no time at all record time in fact it's got to be a record somewhere for something anyway let's go and get this buff and then I will destroy this person until her jungler shows up again and then it's just a repeat actually bigger brain I'm gonna destroy my or her minions so now you're stuck in turret range and you're dead yep nice big brain instead of just going for the kill you know hey work smarter not harder you know sometimes I say the reverse but you know I'm a bit of a pleb so it's best to do that having the ability levels up on the F ability the keys or whatever little confusing has in league you just click ctrl and then the ability weight shoot okay I gotta go I gotta go I go go fudge rod rod oh Jesus I got the turret it appears the right lane who has been absolutely just nomming on my team who's feeding them just so incredibly well they have a full stomach to say the least they've now decided to come to my lane just fair because I think I'm really the only thing that's been going super well for our team so it makes sense but I'm gonna go back see ya let's buy the charged Morningstar and then I'm gonna buy actually okay so I'm gonna get this that gives me a blink I'm gonna go over there and then I need 1900 if I ever want to do anything again my oh my god what the fudge has been going on here in railing yikes clearly I should have been here helping ow oh my god hi I'm a dollar oh wait that's a pretty strange place to put your room that's fine I'll help you Phoenix I won't let them hurt you you hear me you you you all right now we're starting to dish out some real gamer our energy damage what the fudge am i saying right now but I dunno oh my that's a lot of them I'm coming in wait why did you oh I'm oh I'm oh my you're insane you're insane you're actually nuts oh my this is this is actually Oh who was that was that Cerberus bro you're nuts that was massive all under the tower - oh my god I'm not gonna lie I got a little chub going on here holy hackers that was sick alright I don't know what exactly we're doing here but I'm just gonna get some XP is my team going for some buff over here the fire giant Oh what is that we I've never gotten that before but I'll help ya I don't know but sure oh my god well what the [ __ ] the fire giant just like one shot me ah well we're all gonna we killed the fire giant but literally everyone died for it and if it's like League it would have given us a buff but we're all dead so no one has the buff all right I got I got to go to my lane I'm coming Lane I'm oh but someone else is here oh my Jesus Christ what I'm trying okay oh my god oh oh my god oh my god wait I might hold on one more one more oh I almost got him both I wish is there might be is there like a damage report because I can never see what exactly I died too okay it's going down mid lane apparently oh he just hated him in the nifflheim and helheim and whatever i'm common team it's just it's taken me a little while so give me a second yeah Pele is running away alright there's like eight people in Cthulhu surely we can kill that dude but it also appears that the squad their squad do be rolling up though okay I'm gonna go on this guy oh my look at my damage now like that I didn't get the kill what the fudge rigged what are we getting hit by what is go hi dude I swear to God my health just disappears okay we're bot we're fighting some other demon spawn thing okay this one's going with weight all with Jesus okay I'm all T guys can we stop going for those he's game a triple kill I don't know who keeps making that cut but we're clearly not coordinated or strong enough and then freakin Pele please okay well it's it's gonna kill wise we're kind of close but that's clearly not cutting it these have so much more gold than us in general - I know this guy's underleveled so I probably shouldn't be even sharing XP with him oh well now everyone's here I don't really know what to do anymore I'll go help out my lane I guess they destroyed the Pyromancer Oh rats I guess I guess let me put a ward right there so I always forget to do that I don't know if that was a good spot but I'm feeling pretty good about it okay they're all mid lane and it seems like they're getting kind of close so I should get this over with sooner rather than later just kill this wave of minions and D up because I'm sure they're wanting that Nam on me I bet I'm looking pretty tasty yet orderly oh never mind they're just pushing our base team team watch I'm going back I'm coming as soon as I can they're on our Phoenix what plebs yeah yeah I see that okay I'm gonna come in here I'm gonna old okay this is the best I can do so if we kill we kill if not okay I pulled Pele in I'm gonna get a shutdown here why are you in you yes the little Phoenix that could I was gonna say what like what what transpired there I still don't really know what okay we stopped him we shut down Pele I don't think I shut down Pele but we as a team did what is this oh I got some gold are you sure let me just get some more golden XP on here for my troubles thank you very much blah blah pretty good how much do I need to buy this 1,700 I might get a little greedy stay around longer than I need to you know what I'm saying I I don't know oh wait are we already fighting again I'll change my you guys never give me a break team all right I'm coming I'm coming let's go Thaler dude oh Jesus that's terrifying what the fudge do you do against ow God leave me alone uh I'm just gonna walk away from that sometimes that's the best thing you can do okay they just warded that Oh speed camp well don't mind if I do watch me watch me get up yep there is there he is huh huh team nope that's fine yeah let's just let him have that okay and we're dying I'm teleporting out of there uh still not enough money I might be getting old agree okay but we're pushing right lane we got a turret oh that I'm close fish Wow what they're so far away in my hell that just disappeared all right I'm just I'm just running back to base nothing to be ashamed of by that little power spike I guess okay we just got it we cannot lose the Phoenix I repeat care not where's the bear Takes okay I'm moulting okay that looks pretty good almost got that kill hole you okay we're killing it we're killing it right now why won't you die you did die okay and I'm pushing I dotted you die cut dolo yeah someone stole my kill like I didn't get any of those everyone just assisted but whatever dude that's a pretty big one if you ask me oh my god yeah I'll get the timer's I do have a lot of money but I would rather just attack fire giant oh wait what attacked fire giant okay wait now we're talking middle lane okay we got to make up our mind they have long cooldowns but if we sit here so indecisive it's not gonna matter all right yeah let's at least get these to town oh but it's Pele of course that's the only one the left what fudge fudge and I currently am doing a dot on her so I'm taking turret aggro oh gee we're just getting zoned Pele is terrifying we gotta go dude rod rod you're on your own dude I'm out of here I'm buying this I think I'm full items now right Frank practically
