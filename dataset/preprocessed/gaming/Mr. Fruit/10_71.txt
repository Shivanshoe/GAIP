heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and in today's video which queen's right around the corner which means i gotta make use of all the tower rewards i've yet to redeem i got uh crucible and grams some vanguard engrams gunsmith materials iron banner tokens which technically i think could save but the multi-mock is leaving i want to get that a lot of stuff to do right now and i gotta come clean about something here in a second you're all gonna judge me and that's fine because i'm prepared and i'll explain why we did the thing so before i can uh start assessing the rewards i'm about to receive which would be something like 54 crystalline grams i'm gonna be honest with a couple vanguards i don't have any gambit omega low we got twelve thousand guns and materials uh i got like 600 iron banner tokens but again before we can do that i gotta do something first and what is that well i gotta make some room because if you haven't seen it already right there you should do it go watch datto clean out my vault but here but here's the thing ah we got down to like 200 something slots i think right yeah i'm um i'm back up to 49 nine and there's a reason i haven't brought datto back because i know what he's gonna say and i just can't take it right now okay i know i know i know okay so instead of calling datto back and having him be an upset father i'm gonna take the knowledge he's gained he's given me i'm going to clean my own ball in fact i pretty much already prepped the vault and so i have made my decisions i'm going to commit to them and you might get angry at some of them and that would probably be the right thing to do if it seems like it's even halfway decent i go i don't i'm gonna put in the vault we'll figure it out later and then what happens is i usually never figure it out but today i'm figuring it out and i've pretty much already figured it out and what i figured out is i'm just going to clear out like one thing we're going to call it so what i've already gone gone ahead and doing is i went ahead and locked everything which i'm not going to dismantle yep i did mean to lock those i think ooh the rose you know i'm going to lock that ah i'll keep the revolver ah okay maybe i unlock as many as i thought you're just gonna rapid fire here midnight coup i'm you know memories antiope memories uh escape thought give me don't care better devils did i just like never mash to work it or something we're gonna keep it though you know memories uh huckle okay so all the exotics that i only have one of i'm keeping just so i don't have to pull them out for which queen go figure what's great regis broadsword memories orton's law i did the video i did what i said i would do so you know what i'm unlocking it delete pounds of the eagle the fudge is this i don't know but i locked it okay uh nope uh mountain top i can pull at any time plus i don't even remember what that is i already have another monte carlo i mean to dismantle this one spot it's not locked getting rid of this one we don't want that this is okay i'm gonna keep one i have a try i have trouble not keeping at least one copy of a gun i just doesn't feel right high albedo more like low libido get out of here turning me off and here's the thing some of these probably hey i wouldn't delete that and you're probably right but also if i never commit to just dismantling something i'm never going to okay no lots of chroma rushes and these aren't even all the ones i've dismantled been looking for the subsistence rampage god roll this we got freaking hard launch when you're compensator blinding slideshow board but we're good to go baby so i i feel pretty good about deleting those i kept some of these i think this one has spikes yeah spiker niche you know maybe who knows a lot of survivors epitaph why i don't know way too many i got some decent rolls below these we just gotta freaking get mad keeping the luna's howl i can always pull it back but you know i worked hard for that so the ringing nail why did i keep this i never used it nine hunger i just i gotta yeah that's better do i really want to keep this like what it's a pve weapon at sunset get rid of it think of what data would say he'd say trash that i bet you're right i'm sorry just keep holding it down mr fruit be strong it hurts i know i feel like i'm gonna regret all these things and be like oh my god what if i but just do it needs to be done keeping this because auto loading shotty this is a slug right yeah i want to keep an auto holster decent shot here just in case we should label guns though like i wish i could label like sojourner's tail pve or social north scale pvp so then at a quick length i'm not even looking at what i'm deleting anymore it's just if it's locked i delete if it's not i don't otherwise i'm not deleting things and another like actual like vault cleaning app but you know what i'm doing it myself that's the only way you learn by doing right look don't go saying rip in chat because you guys are just gonna make this all worse for me okay did what i did no regrets my hot head ad ups are pretty garbage but they're ideps so whatever okay and here's the other problem um i i'm not so ready to dismantle armor you wanna dismantle my 30 resilience though machine this is so old though oh my god because i feel like especially witch queen depending on what but most armor yeah so i don't know what to do with that big fat bot whatever there check out my memories you happy heavy web fair the what they're doing understand dismantle yeah but for like some certain pv builds i know i've i've delete hey i've deleted a 160 pieces of loot on my own okay and i feel like that's not gonna get enough that is more things i've deleted in destiny in one day than probably the rest of my destiny career okay so look dude one day i'm gonna want an absolutely cracked mobility strength build i'm gonna be like thank god i saved those okay that's my story and i'm sticking to it all right i'm pretty sure everything else here is locked anyway i'll get ready to go figure i feel okay that's almost 200 spots okay i'll get rid of that one right all right how about okay all right that's all i can handle for now that's a lot okay my armor is pretty full uh same thing i just armor is just so tough for me because okay why that's 13 30 but now okay that's embarrassing i don't know how i got those got in there okay all right so now the fun begins should i hold on to this okay speaking of preparing for which queen keep this ready are you ready you're ready [Music] some of you probably do that's not impressive at all i've never bounty prepped before okay so give me some props and there's got literally that's like all the space like come on and then i'm working on my other two characters but i even did it too so that at max i only have like six or seven of each activity too so i won't hit the powerful whatever okay everybody's like do the xp yeah yeah i mean i'm going to aren't there um certain ones that are going away though which ones are they deleting are they deleting any of these right now oh this mod will expire oh yeah oh there you go yeah that makes sense here we go ready for me the fact that you can't just what oh my really really we were so close to greatness sorry i got five umbrella grams one of them is going to be the subsistence rampage chroma rush okay what about over here wow garbage i already have the god roll for the ignition okay have you been so rudely interrupted we continue oh all right we're out of space uh trash maybe i don't know what i'm looking for there but i don't think it's that it that's it new oh no all right on that one now on that one now on that line make us proud hi there we got the fetch already have a good i killed short gun subsistence rampage look at you ghost skate flock okay go on son whoo the rest get out of here what the fudge do we have here no yeah here what's the masterwork subsistence quick draw um when i guess appended mango that's not bad [Music] i told you there it is it's right there it's that easy dude it's that i thought that was a range that easy dude it's all energy keep it loaded [Music] i don't know about that one it seems okay and if i think it's okay it probably means it's trash but you know it's me me but it checks out all the stability all the stability all right that's a meme roll i'm keeping it oh yeah it has a rangefinder should be a pretty good pivot weapon guardian all right this is it the last of the guns man oh all right thanks for the free math stupid oh my god get pooped up all right crucible time ah one of our brightest returns you know should i do this on an alt i'm gonna get armor but what the likelihood i get any decent armor it's probably not worth it whatever who's these engram drops probably suck man it's armors garbage holy friends yes [Music] oh god i just realized i'm getting gunsmith materials guys my index finger's getting worn out man yay okay i need me a good multi-mock baby give me something oh dude i'm gonna stop right there i just got the god roll oh my god oh my god iron reach reload speed i mean that's not bad i'm gonna hold on tonight because i literally don't have another one so but that's fine because the god roll right here what the [ __ ] i'm not looking for you it's no give me the freak stop dude hey yeah it looks like i'm keeping that because it's literally the only one i'm gonna have come on bro no that one multi mike's looking a lot better now isn't it oh god dallas armor i don't know what to think of i guess we kind of got boned here but slideways irish sure feeding frenzy iron grip iron gas not a clue you know what to do with that big fat butt wiggle with it y'all know i'm doing this ah oh god i'm i'm hoarding again uh no don't make me do it uh is there anything else leaving that i have not gotten i have no gambit that means i would have had to play game it so no yeah i'm saving trials for day one on the off chance they give new ones probably not but hey why not right do not rush by come see nothing and i'm so close to the freaking golf ball man all right i think we did it i'm not really going to be getting many more engrams so i have used everything needed to be done overall what did we get i i have too much of my vault so that's a good great question ah we ah we got one multi muk that was it it exists uh this is that that we got this death hatter that was gonna beat me i like my quick look quit looking click we're fine okay i did it whoa we gotta lower loot my ball is so many free spaces uh nothing else that we're ready for witch queen whoa [Music] [Music] you
