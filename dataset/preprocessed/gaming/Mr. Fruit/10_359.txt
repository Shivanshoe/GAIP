by going to tutorials i desperately need to play the tutorial okay um start with navigation oh jeez wait oh i can't actually oh i thought it would be a tutorial i get a play oh okay that's not very helpful okay fly over energy riffs to refilling your stamina bar what did the energy riff look like i'm not gonna lie i wasn't paying attention oh i see now no i don't align your sight any marker and press left click crazy when the marker is green to shoot homing fireballs oh they're done for i have auto aim okay it's a fire pick the flag up and pass through as many gates as you can the team with the highest number gates sure carnage mode this is like tdm now we're talking all right i think i'm ready to go oh select your class which dragon ride i am oi they have different looking dragons because that will also mean a lot oh they do oh it's a tie between phantom and marauder phantom's slicker marauder doobie thicker actually wind guards are not bad okay phantom or marauder honestly i think i'm gonna go marauder first and i guess i could potentially choose different abilities i'm going to assume i can in the full game or something let me see what these settings are motion blur what the fudge whoa oh this is fun okay i oh my god i need to change the sensitivity holy heckers how am i going to be making any kind of maneuvers like this you kidding me my entire desk good ward okay
