little yard i'm running out of time we're gonna tie here play the card i don't know what we did there where are my demons bro is this the theme we're still alive a lot of things are activating and i don't know what they do hi eddie hello everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome to roon versus sea brawls a game i've never heard of but i found it on steam came out recently had some decent reviews and a couple things that caught me first off pirates boom i'm there secondly art style like it boom i'm there so we're just hopping into it first game we're probably gonna win let's be let's be honest here uh i will say pretty sure this has to be a mobile game but what do we're out of freaking pirate oh what okay i don't what is this buy this rune permanently wait what does not participate in i don't know what this destroyed 25 any minions to get a new recruit minions you summon and comment have plus two plus two when you sell a minion morgan offers you a random man in the same old it remains a plus-sior plus your power-ups when you destroy 20 minions what i'm just picking this thing i don't know i gotta kill 25 things i guess i don't know i gotta choose one of you guys gain attack range the next reload costs zero what reload okay i'm buying this dude i'm running out of time play the card sees a card but then you play him and he's essentially just just like your regular minion you know uh yes i really don't know what i'm doing wind is on your side but it's like battlegrounds hearthstone battlegrounds like you have a store thing and i lose okay great off to a hot start to be fair um there's just so much on the screen what is this pay a duty oh i can just give him plus attack whenever you upgrade morgan's crew uh i don't know what that reduces the cost of upgrading morgan's crew by one that seems pretty good reborn that seems pretty good let's go reborn i want to win some early games so i'm going to do that and then i'm going to pay a duty to give you plus attack buddy i'm not going to lie this time is really short especially for somebody who doesn't know what they're doing hey nice rebar we're gonna tie here classic what is your power soldiers that survive okay cool story whoa scarecrow reborn wait that's exactly what you do but you're a steaming i don't know what to do frankly yeah call me crazy we're gonna sell we're buying two of these dudes in hopes that i find another one soon and yeah this is happening way too fast i like it though i'm just a sucker for auto battlers dude i can't help it oh that is pretty good i think we lose no we no we don't oh my let's go screw you damon 82702 yeah when you lose a combat i can never read it in time reduces the cost of upgrade morgan's crew i mean that sounds pretty good n plus one attack and ranged for the next rain this mean can attack other minions without getting damaged okay well watch this i'm gonna upgrade the store and i'm going to refresh for a tier 2. alter too sick yourselves maybe give a stat to another friendly demon oh that's pretty good uh i'm going to buy you i'm going to place you and then i might freeze because we could get another one but is freezing worth it yo whoa we're going demon build and it looks like i'm kind of a demon kind of person so this works what is that thing i don't know but it's dead okay we don't have to find out what did it just smite me uh uh okay well i don't know what we did there either but you're dead here's what i know we're winning i'm buying a brain eater i'm playing a brain eater this minion ignores time that's pretty cool but i need demons none of you are demons why do you have a book on you what is this gives your other beast plus two lie okay there is one thing i can do though pay a duty okay see i'm gonna give him a tack and then i'm going to pay one gold pay one gold you can actually pay to give minions taunt pretty neat all right i don't know but i know if i kill 14 more minions i get a new recruit so that's oh my what is this thing oh my oh he's golden oh my god he's upgrade all right well i think this is a fat oh no it's oh my god we're not i can't believe you won that you got a golden minion and couldn't
