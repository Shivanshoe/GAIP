peacock dot sh chic okay they don't allow spaces okay okay and the closest fish that started with fr that i could make work that wasn't fresh water is apparently freiburg's peacock cichlid ah or mr fryberg if we're talking scientifically the uh nakhara jacob freiburgi of course [Music] why do you have to keep the sr you know this is going on your youtube channel right you don't have to worry about branding that much what do you mean it's a hilarious pun a trout time joey like try harder dude i'm joey is so good you guys are lowbrow okay i'm sorry that i have to entertain such low iq non-funny humans or in this case i'm sorry that you have a space in your name and you can't do that in game that sounds like a branding problem yeah look at me reuben carb chasm that's hilarious yeah see my chat they're they're my ghost writers they're great sometimes please refer to me my full name just like my mother said if if i wanted to be called chris she would have named me chris my name is christian okay and in this case my name is mr fruitsburg peacock cichlid okay i won't and i also have no idea what we're doing so we're trying to do it we're oh we're all together wait a second hold on we have to unfold i thought we were doing this okay so i'm the blue one i'm the red one guys how'd you just flop out ready this makes sense to you guys what though maybe a trout time joey is just better at uh i think maybe rolling oh get over them don't leave out you guys oh i'm out of here too see ya out of the box we cannot we can't abandon our fish but fish brethren i'm going backwards i'm cramping my my fence cramped hold on here get cpr can you just wait we gotta go massage i don't know how to go backwards i'm going i'm too good at going forwards okay ready okay that see that's the flipper button that's the button so you can go um excuse me sir sir i'm sorry sir this is inappropriate swear i i i'm trying my best i'm okay i'm a fish you see me trying to live my best life you look
