hi ad hope you won my name's mr. fruit and welcome to waste of day ed if I didn't had a southern draw to it can i really be played in this game this is an open beta they are currently running it is some sort of a stylistic twin-stick shooter I want to say roguelike it says new run of west of dead so I'm gonna say roguelike either way my first foray into this game shall be with you all so let's pop our proverbial west of dead cherry here I was again either death was getting lazy plans for me voice acting hog let's go we're here you can look and aim at the same time what what the fudge well there goes 25 health I was literally just trying to click 'next on the tutorial and instead I dodged into the abyss I suppose look at this though find a weapon okay alright he'll die where's a weapon ignite but uh why do you know in turn briefly stuns enemies and also blinds me the light it burns oh oh level one musket a slow old-fashioned rifle hello friend okay ready check this out skirt hold on I'm gonna ignite this boom he's blinded doosh doosh hahaha get absolutely nya lighted I could have used that 25 hi AB stand absently accidentally lost at the beginning of this run but that's okay Dodge vault and slide between cover by pressing a this will help avoid danger but one here after reloading okay Loki that totally sounds like the guy that plays el boy and went crazy I have once in two hundred iron I don't really know what any of that means but we have it and I'm sure I'll I'll find out one way or another oh my god oh hello partner chapter one how much I help you it looks like dying and weren't gonna take just yet the creeps you want to play some cards cards anybody last thing expected to see the rundown saloon I guess there's always folks looking for a way to ease their path to hell welcome to Bergdorf Ram where you headed it I guess I don't make it being a difference now not a soul been able to pass Easter way since that preacher arrived place is filling up with all kinds of undesirables ain't safe out there no more may as well stay and drink a finger to to someone puts things right oh there ain't no telling when that'll be well my friend I'll fix it fear not I am the one to deliver us from evil through the saloon we go skadoosh okay sick oh we get weapons ok felt like pistol love it level one musket love it oh ok so we got two weapons I go good dude dude dude Oh Lee that's dark something tells me there ain't to use the words of the bartender and undesirable in this darkness and I think God just found him juice juice juice oh yeah we just go up close and personal well then I I know just got to deal with the problem can't use this right now that's cuz I'm full health and that's just cuz I'm a gamer demonic ritual summoning circle thing never mind it appears to be some sort of a checkpoint exactly what I thought and Doge Doge oh oh headshot Tater Tot I take cover now burner and then we're gonna juice goose this is incredible first off the art style alone ooh we're all about it then of course just the combat oh the Old West guns with you I tell you what I tell you put I'm all about it and let me take some cover here draw the light and turn out the line duster ha ha ha I'm loving this approach we have here doosh Oh take cover partner I think he's right there we missed him oh my covers bad to break oh I seem right there douche ha ha you know I'm busted my cover buster get out of here you good-for-nothing undesirable your mother didn't want you and I don't either wait what was that I kind of know I was scared oh well I do know what this is that played enough videogames to know what this is data that that eye level to weight level to decisive blade causes critical damage on stunned enemies whoa now we have another we did oh you like that well it takes a long time to refill though but does like a cool animation all right so I guess that's yeah I don't know if that's like a respawn boy in a save point Check Point still I guess I should have figured out more that this is more like rogue like it it certainly has procedural and it has randomized loot and stop sign I mean I want to say yeah yeah a Mons telling me new my body my body blind you all I see you right there you lose 90 damage to a stunned enemy yeah I think I'll take that Bob Zeus Zeus and then you over there with the fence not for long though dude god I'm just are just fragging right now I did I was born to play this game goosh get me out of here to the left or to the right left I made a decision and evidently it was a good one Goro what does that mean uh-oh oh shoot we get upgrades that this has to be like roguelike okay upgrade to toughness level 1 to 2 we get extra health and melee them upgrade the perception we get extra firearm damage or resourcefulness increased ability damage an item recharge speed hmm these aren't pretty good that's a lot of extra health manly damage Hanban item recharge speeds pretty good but I feel like it's it's got a let's go with health even though firearm damage sounds fun we'll do this I'll try to be responsible you got the 183 health now is that a razor shot causes bleed status effect don't mind if I do okay so this does 36 HP three rounds reloads quicker but this causes bleed so it doesn't do as much upfront damage do I just replace the flintlock pistol it seems to be like the flintlock except better in every way maybe the flintlock can shoot a little faster but reload same MO same except that double damage bleeds mmm yeah we'll replace this there's Rob brother look at how cool it looks to cut Doge little gun trail thanks to okay it seems like that's where the game wants us to go so let's double back and make sure we're not missing anything of importance over here well hello stay away come sail away come sail away oh wow screw you douche ah mistakes I've made a few so much for the cover idea apparently all right you the bleedin effect is not one to be trifled with see what's over here what is this I don't know but I destroyed it see I thought that was an enemy so I was kind of spooked does it just have loot or something yeah I think it has iron in it ah locked away goodies you won't keep those for me they're mine I lay claim oh shoot what'd I tell you this is why we come over here and I get a level up again okay so we can get less yeah I assume so it's it's it's scales so next upgrade we don't get as much cool stuff which means we should just go ahead and go here you know what let's get some more firearm damage a pow oh so it just went ahead and leveled up all my guns anyway it says level two from agains oh well that makes sense because yes so that's the level of those skills necessarily because that's why there's a two next to my health that's not my overall level just the level of my perception or whatever that one was called let me through hey this definitely doesn't seem like it's leading me to a boss fight or something or a baddie yep that's okay well at the very least somebody I don't want to get acquainted with foes douche take cover Oh oh my god no scoped not quite but yeah brother you're in the wrong town I missed that's incredible all right that'll do the trick just run up and shoot him point-blank with a revolver that'll do enough damage I reckon partner see the real reason I wanted to play the games just so I can go around and talk with my cell and draw nothing wrong because I just don't understand what that is what we get to grow again oh my gosh well might as well just get level two and everything first right seems like that's the play rather than just hyper focusing into one spec maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong I don't know kaduche well certainly uh it certainly hurts them I'll tell you that much oh look at that holy the bleed damage this was totally the play good idea mr. fruit oh it's egg what's going on over here you're blinded Oh and you're bleeding out little give me old goodies so we don't know what the iron does yet I don't know if that is something we spend in the run I assume it is or if it's a permanent resource like some of the real kites have but I am inclined to believe that a or dynamite that it's run dependent what I'm assuming whatever we have that carries over we spend that like the saloon or something that would certainly make sense and it appears we found a dead end well not quite also these levels are huge whoa a level one traitor enemy shot in the back suffered critical hits sure let's try this it doesn't do much damage but it has quick reload a lot of rounds just shoot him in the back forehead I can't even oh I think I figured out where to spend it a trader even out of here someone was looking to save you the troubles of a heavy purse that is very kind of them it is starting to weigh me down well - smoke grenade for way too much iron durable bomb which produces smoke obscuring you from enemies level - job old barreled shotgun well well well or a decisive blade I already have that hmm smoke grenade evidently seems smart but me go face so we're gonna get double-barreled shotgun and I guess I'll replace this alright thank you sir I appreciate your business well I guess the other way around you should appreciate my business good thinkin there mister fruit a wise an idea to go that way now let's go back this way and destroy whatever evil ohs with my throwing axe which hits hard giving the wielder little breathing space oh let's see let's let's see what it looks like oh alright yeah so it's whatever I'm looking I don't have to be my character doesn't have to be facing that way take this already douche wait what oh no Huntley why isn't it firing all right partner goosh so dynamite won't work here brother I think he's too far away Oh sniped oh my god would it what a throw sir let there be light douche I don't know where they are but I do know where he is douche lying them okay we're good I think the other guy bled out did the bleeding is so strong oh wait spooky I'm assuming that's just cover and that comes back oh and it looks like we made it to the end I could see a way up I didn't know where it went but any place away from the ears seems pretty good it ain't that bad come on now don't be dramatic yeah so we're just we're still doing it we're still running in all right where are we wait a second whoa I could feel the witch long before I saw her I couldn't wait you could feel a storm coming from a long ways off great fiend stranger folly awhile unburden yourself of sin take the memories I offer in their stead memories of who you were and are soon to become look what is this spen send to unlock oh so maybe sin is the permanent thing I don't know unlock small Health flask a portable flask contain a single step of Health I would need 10 cent what's a good thing I have 12 whoa and now look at all the stuff we get a medium health flask a sniper I want their Molotov cocktail fifth time lucky every fifth shot guarantees a critical hit that's sick shields bolt gun well heck I don't have much sin and I'm afraid it might not carry over actually so I should just spend it while I have it what do we want next it would seem like a medium health flask would be the play right what is that really what I want to do and it's gonna take 50s contagion let's get them all top cocktail it's probably good idea decent throwable to find and I assume it's not like oh you just get that from now on it's like it'll show up and runs now I assume oh and what do you know oh fudge don't tell me I just used all my she is oh no I didn't okay so he's gonna replace my help thanks dude what am i two kind stranger you are Thank You bartender and I guess that's that on to the next the wind was cold like knives it brought the scent of copper the smell of the hunt blood torn flesh and bones zocalo that's how the hunch okay well that sounds terrifying and judging by from the aesthetic change yeah this is not maybe isn't good news I don't know but we get to grow again it grow as a human will it well what are we exactly a demon okay I'm gonna get more fire fire I'm damaged because I'm a degenerate and moogle fish will save I guess okay looks like no this is just another level or something cuz there's plenty of branching paths again I see all these Rascals in here surprise open up SUSE FBI you're dead that's the only person in this room I think so unsure though and give me your iron thanks did Bo's get out me way I'm a man on a mission oh oh oh whoa we already found the store holy level three smoker nights 629 iron I assume the higher the level like the shorter the coolant level three double-barrel shotgun Oh the heck mean all right so maybe I know this I doubt even if I complete the whole level we're gonna find that much iron I don't only one way to find out now I wonder if I use these oh I thought maybe I could teleport in between him I can't it was just a way of like knowing like hey you came this way I don't know oh that dudes not looking good skirt I missed lose Oh got the devil bails so strong okay I still think there's people in here I don't trust it so blinded blinded okay now we're get well they had us in the first half I'm not gonna lie couldn't tell if there's any loot suspended in the air or whatever either way we hold w or in this case that we hold the left stick forward oh jesus oh my god so strong oh we got ourselves a hellhound hellhound down I'm just I'm just a Fragger dude it's what I do is there a way to see the map yes there is really that all right well that'll be good to retrace our steps so we'll just fit flush out this way and then eventually oh sweet Moses Lord above we got him screwed blinded and knife from Fuj 122 damage that'll do it Bob don't we're just fragging out here absolutely fraggin you know this game is sick dude I mean you guys know me I'm a sucker for roguelikes make it halfway decent roguelike and I'm there like I'm are I'm already all about it I am simple to please in that way ah loot a level 2 traitor enemy shot in the back set for critical hits this might be true but I still like a razor shot more Plus that means we just have to close quarter combat things and now well I ain't don't do that alright we can increase firearm damage again should we do that that seems a bit ridiculous I could do item recharge speed Oh does that do like my flask I don't know if my flask recharges but yeah I'm a degenerate we're just gonna get more damage again me go fish me shoot my guns go pew pew Oh level 2 razor Charlotte's get it 12 extra damage heck yeah no now we're double cheeked up brother yeah these these increases are gonna be worth it what the fudge is over here I can't see nothin ah I'm blind oh jesus oh no blind them blind them Jesus blind them oh here we go yeah I had to reload clips but we're good blinded by the line we got some more iron thanks for the loot and my dudes thanks for keeping that don't wait to say I was that just it's a woot icon I do believe yeah yeah yeah I was gonna say what is there's an enemy how do I miss him I don't need the health I'm a gamer come on no kind of disrespect me like that I don't need you I can't see blind it and good - oh my god I missed oh my god ah ah why did my shotgun do like negative damage ah oh it's going poorly yeah I threw my hatchet that'll help okay there we go there we go I just don't understand how did it die I like what is that you're doing up here well oh I see you're um that was so strange I don't know I just I like shotgun and point-blank like twice but did well like we don't like no damage okay we're going to go up here and quickly fend off this evil evil do well come here yes douche 208 damaged yet it's like maybe I'm too close I don't know I'm doing something wrong literally nothing up here alright well there was a guy to kill we sent a message I assume in getting the killed grant desire in any way so it's not completely wasted okay alright okay let's just cut let's just calm this down sir I'm gonna have to I might have to start using governor up the heck boom you're dead no dynamite for you okay we have 402 iron 426 still not enough to buy from the shop but something tells me uh yeah we might be able to afford something we might also not need it though or no here's to prickle on the back of my neck but I could tell things were about to get nasty all right well that's my cue to go check the rest of the map certainly seems like a boss fight or something precarious is about to happen and I don't know if I can double back so I might as well do that now do we haven't explored what is this abs reloading time holy that's good so do we want to do stunned or doing I think we just let's get rid of the axe absolute in time that's very nice okay what is this double-billed Pistor a reliable high-damage pistol its range is probably lacking so the question is is it better than a double-barreled shotgun well it does have more rounds and I might I might buy the level three double-barreled so let's try the double world pistol why not doosh doosh Oh has way better range and more ammo with better reload so yeah maybe maybe this worth it let's try that douche why you're running from Amelia so Jewish couldn't see it cuz the level one axe in the way not cool oh Jesus ah i'ma hurt Bob I could use some light oh is right there the whole time screaming huh I could hold the heel but there is still a healing item we haven't used somewhere oh speaking of which well here's another one yes you why waste my potion Oh level 2 axe same cooldown but it does more damage this does do critical damage on stun enemies but I get tons of free damage I'm stunned enemies anyway so I think we do the axe this way don't have to be a B stick away let's go ahead and grow as a person again more health and melee damage or ability damage an item research let's do that resourcefulness I thought about doing more DPS huh come on now mr. fruit come on now be smart about it don't be a big dum-dum me dumb dumb we're headed back though I think there was still yeah we didn't explore that way by the shop and then yeah I guess I'll just have to hope I can come back after whatever we're about the face because otherwise I won't be able to buy anything yet let's top ourselves off though oh they're not quite okay I thought it would heal more than that that's I guess that's balance though we're sure something whatever din that's where we got our infamous level two razor shot may we never forget now volt my friend oh wait a second I just missed this iron what am i doing that was 30 iron you silly goose begs the question did I miss more probably but unless it's directly in my path screw it we're holding forward no let's see what we missed over here it doesn't seem like this is branches off too far goosh goosh okay I can't tell wow I can't see the other stuff oh nice perfect on hunch they're ready what's you you're blinded going through an axe in his face Doge alright well done it is starting to get a little hairy I think yeah I need to start using a little more defensive positioning there's no one around here so we wait hauling something that's corner huh I don't know all right and you start using cover and I need to like immediately illuminate if I can cuz like that like couldn't even see the dip will get destroyed Oh together that I'd other that a Dada Dada Dada Dada Oh level three quick hand oh wait Oh guys I'm an idiot this isn't a passive effect I was like dang that's Oh Pete you have to you have to physically use it how long does it last okay I can still see it around my character oh dang so laughs oh wow okay now it's gone dang and then but then look like with all my upgrades the ability is almost back dang okay duly noted I have to use that it's probably good I figured that out before I fought whatever we're about to fight but I think that's good and I like our weapons I guess I'll see if I can buy after this demonic fight otherwise I guess screw it we'll take it into the next realm it's not a terrible idea alright friends this is it do or die this can't go poorly hello oh okay yeah yeah goosh and then go ahead have my reload time dude I throw hatchet okay definitely thought that was going to be like a boss room or something hmm might just mean that going forward things are ramping up in difficulty all day he'll oh no that's just my item I thought they had to do something with that broken campfire but alas Oh My Jesus oh that's what I thought it's the Windigo holy cow god I need healing to you it's good I can't see she is hold on let me blind him up oh okay does he care about though I can't tell No thank you sir let me throw a hatchet you let me have my real time oh god it hurts oh what a perfect dodge though blind him okay the one to go does not seem to care about the light blonde eared Baha what you can do with me behind cover let's go we slamed the Windigo it's a good thing I kept my healing thing though we would have time I definitely need to work on my combat skills that could have been much clearer exit no idea word let maybe you closer to the preacher maybe not only way I'd find out was by going through [Music] the man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger follow [Music]
