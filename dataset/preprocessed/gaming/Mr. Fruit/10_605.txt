hi 80 hojoon moanings mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny too then in today's video it's a glorious day because it's mr. fruit reviews an auto rifle day you know me I'm an auto rifle fiend false promises first off I have to say I'm quite a fan of the aesthetic of this season's weapons believe this you got some like white sticky goo don't make it weird cool green trimming stuff emerald something what was that carbon fiber incredible stuff comes with some random perks and you boys gonna be using corkscrew rightfully it's mean flared magwell certainly use a million's is really killing wind on a blows grant increase mobility weapon range in handling it for a short duration that Jeff sounds like fun and you know what you love it's in moment cuz it does money now to a pleb like I that seems like a decent role I don't know what a god role is I don't know what I'm looking for but this seems pretty good so we're gonna play one game with this one and then one game with this Auto rifle extended barrel high caliber and dynamics way reduction swashbuckler yard so as to which one will win my heart perhaps both perhaps none but it's an auto rifle so it's already won to the crucible now little sneak peek here keep it on the DL alright later this week you're gonna see the dream team against the prophecy dungeon that's right I'm pretty excited about it I haven't done it myself so it shall be an adventure because really aside from reviewing weapons in the crucible that's about so far the only cat Jay and I have in the new season also I'm using the acting war rig because I mean why not right and the ornament Loki kind of fits in this outfit real nice tbh if you love auto rifles and you know it clap your hands just realize like can't hear you so I'm just gonna assume you all clap your hands hey hi how are you what is that I got a respect it all now I must question how you see through that paper bag don't worry though the Titans have their fair share of ugly armor don't worry about it some people like make your fruit what you cocky ya coolish armor ever you know it - che you know one man's paper bag is a another man's treasure it's a high impact frame so it's slow firing what am i doing but high damage I just tried to reload instinctively but the acting war rig doing what the action Warwick does whoa hold up wait a minute put a little love in it okay all right you know even without the crazy range doubt on the other role this thing is already not having trouble hitting a distance quite frankly melting but yeah yep hello hello pokey yes now go kill do my bidding you've heard me you son you wanna shotgun me bow shotgun you're right back doesn't mean I'm gonna feel good about it but I'm gonna do it nonetheless I am I am so deep an enemy tier I'm surrounded Baba all right fine we're going the auto-rifle route okay you're afk sick he was pulling out his ghost at the lab okay wow you got him too huh you guys are doing great you're doing great we're doing great this is a team effort isn't it normally this range not great but now definitely loses to a scout rifle feel myself a little bit too much there oh yeah what are you shooting what are you shooting I've got you buddy wow it worked so hard for that kill hold on a honnestly a little tired a little exhausted I think I'm gonna take a nap sorry guys I just I just got a kill what are you guys okay that was that was strange I can't tell cuz it seemed like he was shooting me more but then didn't then I died real quick and it felt like I should have hit I don't know to be seen to be seen indeed fantastic kill there mister fruit all right I'm doing it just just forgive me Wow yeah as you can see here was not kiddin about the lag of this match whoa catch see I'm a little busy breath fighting you're laggy fiend laggy fiend of a friend is this who you associate yourself with you make me sick yeah he's using the false promise said but I could have sworn I should on that now where's that feller he's rolling with overflow rampage I don't know is that better I'm not I'm not quite sure whatever though I don't need a God role I am the God to the role you know what I'm saying I make the roles well I'm thinking a cinnamon rolls Stewart saris I am loving the representation of the auto rifles because as you you know as they all say no taxation without representation we need the auto rifles around except really not enjoying going up against the cirrhosis and and and the other false promises because when they kill me I just look bad and you know quite frankly we were popping off just kind of lost it in the second half you know I'm saying how are you not a worm husk look in son of a disgusting you piece of filth I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't know where that came from that was just highly uncalled for I apologize guys will you just let me janitor a couple kills boost my ego just a little bit I'm not at Golden Gun watch out for him I have no idea where he is there he is dude screw you and screw you yeah we waited long enough we got the Golden Gun we're gonna get oh my god that feel when you pop a roaming super but then you poop your pants at the sight of another super a rare feeling but a unfortunate feeling nonetheless that my friends is a fist of havoc and I'm doing my best to light him up yeah run away run away skirt oh yeah go ahead your half help and it's probably running out what you gonna do what if you go and do it's got over run out by now right where did he go wait one wait what I'm getting sniped how am I not hitting anyone weird okay I killed someone so far I guess I haven't been paying attention enough I haven't really noticed the The Killing wind or killing blow final I pretty sure it's killing blow and I think that's mainly just because I'm bad because it's definitely dead oh there we go okay I guess I'm moving too grooving a little bit faster I really thought I was out of range of that but it doesn't even matter look at me go wow wow oh that's my golden gun think the Lord Jesus above yo go get him you died how did she how dude that's shoof I mean that's rough bro hi hikers you're gonna be talked about in the history books but not in a good way you know which which side of history will you be on the right or the wrong the good or the bad the killer or the kilee well unfortunately you were the kill II that and I make up a lot of words so it's one in the mr. fruit language a very rare tongue dialect kind of been lost throughout the ages really sad too it's a beautiful language there's a word for everything because if it doesn't exist you can just create it you know it's beautiful magical fantazmo cool see there's another word combines a whole bunch a lot of feelings there can't even accurately describe what exactly that means because it means so much can I kill something Jesus man they keep like bobbin and Weavin bob and weave what are you Muhammad Ali just keep tagging each other out Oh Shawn what up pokey how about you take that pokey thing you got there and stab them with it okay okay yeah this fellow knows his range and he's just using this hallway to his advantage and I challenge him with my Auto rifle which has some range but not that much range so what's going on in there and the sight kind of makes me feel a little uncomfortable but in a good way is slightly arousing and that's what's worrying oh look at this dude's spinning up oh shoot with the heir-apparent I think I don't don't ask me oh my god that's I just screw screw right over and gave a nice little little haircut you live only by the grace of the Greybeards but you will not always have their grace and I will probably die here not this because I'm terrified oh dude still alive I guess all right well lucky me that means yep they're gonna be spawning right here or what I need or what oh my wasn't it you know I was kind of even at first I thought it was terrible but it worked out you just fake it till you make it baby my motto pop yeah you hear that run run run as fast as you can can't catch me I'm the top fudge oh Jesus get away get away oh we got a kill easy skirt what happened to the hammer what happened you didn't hit a wall I threw it what leave this dude heir-apparent go Bob it's scumbag time skrt skrt bop thank you who's next never off weird he one second on the team Wow look at that damage you'll love to see that stuff and you love to see the return of rum Baba defconn let's skip hop and scoot doodle our way to a rumble victory royale why don't we we like fortnight but we're gonna swap out over to the dynamic swaying swashbuckler edition this time with 100 percent more range and to burn the know little bit meaner honestly not a fan just gonna go ahead and create that Bob is still I guess what are you doing that's a grenade oh my god swashbuckler times 5 Oh it's cuz I got a melee kill wait keep going while it's active oh we lost it yo swashbuckler times 5 though d-stroid that man let me get another melee kill here real quick if they would be so kind hold on give me a second give me a second ah swashbuckler times 5 oh my oh my I don't even I was gonna say I don't care that I'm half help the back toe a swashbuckler times 5 we are for shouting that's yeah how do you say crispy in Spanish I know or any other language really just gotta make it a little more interesting alright let's kill ourselves with the word cliff that's the only thing I know how to do with this thing and hey we got one oh wait we only get one shot don't even ask me why I have it equipped I can't really tell you the last time I added that clip okay there's a kill there's a this is going exceptionally well you know if I'm being honest with you all okay there okay we got that kill come here now don't be shy hey hey uh I'm trying to figure out what's going on here what in the shenanigan eree oh that's a nice nade except evidently had killed nobody oh fudge and he just grenades somebody come in give me a swashbuckler times five yes now run at me yes dude it's it's insane maybe swashbuckler just insane unlike any bata rifle or something but like holy actors yes I don't have a lot of experience with it but I got to tell you I am a fan come on now oh you've got you've got to be kidding me well son of a rascal skirt Bob yes the times five Bob but we're sitting in the nade who we're cooking we aren't Doha they're cooking up mr. fruit right now we lost a swashbuckler okay and I honestly I don't even I was looking at my buff instead of shooting people as you can tell that was I could have just made like that dude see him tell is a pretty poor showing oh my god the recoil I only hit me or zone and I'm trying to make an excuse for that performance but uh yeah I curse it was really just simplest cheat the dude all right come on come on out where you at I don't know I give up skirt chase me I dare you he's like wait I have made a grave mistake pop up about that guy too is like oh yeah wait bra did it's not that deep dude come on now were you all at where you all okay just two more stands between us and infamous infamy and ah Jesus we are kinda swaying at this game if if you want me I respect the combo it's essentially what I was doing when I had the not forgotten except it actually seems a little more viable because all you have to do is roughly hit them in in the general vicinity how in the world that he just did you just see the range on that man's mainly ba never let me square up with that doing the ring his reaches incredible you oh all I had to do was hit well I might remember the last kill pass oh my god I just spawned right behind the dude oh oh heavens oh boy oh boy all right ran out hold on and survey says yeah we got the final kill practically steak dinner in the Sens ik mmm-hmm a ruble test is back you know I gotta say I like your style kit that is an auto rifle I can get behind but again I get behind every Auto rifle so choose to listen to me and my bias or not that's entirely up to you but it's up to me to wish you but it's up to me to tell you I hope you have a fantastic day thank you much for watching I'll talk to you guys in the next one very well
