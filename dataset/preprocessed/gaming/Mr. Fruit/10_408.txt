january 25th 2021 [Music] aka d-day why does this keep happening to me am i the problem i can never get close to anyone love anything because when i do sure enough it always ends up hurting me more at this point i'm just numb i deserve better than this at least that's what i tell myself farewell sweet prince hi there everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to our youtube channel but a solemn video today uh another game i've loved another game i had been excited for before release played it after release actually liked it unlike most games these days i feel like i get hyped for so many games and then so few of them deliver this one did for me at least but now it's dying it's dead and i'm not talking about like oh exiled you're never going to see them again like they're still out there but like they might as well not be i'm talking we're going to take into the pasture and you're never going to see them again because we're killing them kind of dead you know what i mean and yes i uh i did sit under a shower in my clothes for like a three second bit in a video don't judge me what game are we talking about well you know it you'll love it battleborn and i know you mr fur you're still on that okay hear me out battleborn was practically dead right ceased you know support on it and whatever but january 25th 2021 it's dead they're killing it they're literally pulling the plug you will not be able to play the game not even single player it's just poof gone into the ether feels bad the fourth dimension or the fifth dimension who really knows and i'm i'm gonna be honest i'm upsetting spaghetti about it just because nope the game didn't get the recognition it deserved another hero shooter that honestly oh just was the greatest for me at least it was it wasn't quite overwatch it wasn't quite a moba it was this beautiful fusion this hybrid and everybody was like huh well battleborn i'm gonna go play overwatch uh well look at what you did you are to blame you killed this game definitely wasn't gear boxes publishing and advertising and marketing there was no issues there hunt totally not at all all right let's take a look at something here let's take a look at battleborn current players 30 wow that has to be a high 37 was the peak here look at this okay average players it launched 4 200 that's pretty good and then well you know peter man and never well never really saw a comeback let's be honest but now it's just it's just dead also this is only pc consoles probably more this is the free trial and whatever now this reminds me of another fantastic game before it's time 100 percent this game should have absolutely popped off super monday night combat now monday night combat was great played on the xbox 360 and the xbox live arcade way back in the day but then they made a sequel and it pretty much was a third person moba but it was fantastic i loved it so much just never got the love that it deserved and well that also died it's also kind of like a hero shooter character thing and i really think i'm the problem or maybe i should just change my tastes see now everyone points to this this was definitely not their best moment march 7 2016 battle born at play overwatch and they add a period before to make sure everyone sees it and they had a gift come at me bro they came at ya pre pretty pretty pretty bad and now here we are five just a little under five years later and it's gone i just i don't know man so we're sitting in that with an ura literally one last game like i made a video about this a little while ago haha dead game that was when they like were like yeah it's pretty much over but now they're like it was on life support and they're pulling the plug you may think i'm stupid you may think i'm crazy but it was a great game now the question is uh okay i can't i assume the bots is gonna be a little easier to get a session but it still says estimated weight long well in other words tonight is my once a week cheat meal i'm getting indian my butthole probably doesn't appreciate it but my appetite currently is very excited but before we get into this game because it's going to be a while so we want to make sure we stay hydrated that's right it's the patented but not patented because i couldn't patent it water break oh yeah now see the embarrassing part is going to be if i can't even find a game as the last hoorah 2 000 years later all right it's been like two hours maybe that's a little hyperbolic it's been like two minutes oh we found a game it's definitely not because i made it so it's nine bots and me definitely not you know what we're going with galt it is what it is let's give him a nice cool skin buddy before we take you outside and make you look at the flowers well they got some cool skins whoa look at that skin the heck well too bad it's useless because what won your bots and two you can't use it at all so believe this they had these dope skill trees that you could v you know this this reminds me a whole bunch of stuff heroes of the storm yeah where you kind of have that um i don't i don't know what i'm doing but look down there at the bottom you have your different abilities passives it's also dope and it's all gonna be gone [Music] the cool thing is you can say bottom left i'm level one you level up end game you like you have bots they move you kind of like it is very mobile-like but also at the same time not quite but it's just perfect balance and it's a hero shooter and it's it's so good but of course i think you know what maybe that's why i have trust issues these days i don't bother to commit myself to anything because i know it'll just oh hello well i'm going to be honest i don't really remember what i do so we'll uh we'll just destroy you real quick i think you're a tank and i have a shotgun so i think i win this battle i'm not yo yeah i definitely get out of here kelvin you got the and the watches right the bm yo get destroyed got you a little rascal uh you always know how to get on people's nerves and i love it oh here's a marquee a robot sniper he was definitely my favorite to oh do not click that button wait come back here come back here come back here what oh my god i for the buttons dude it's hard whatever wait a second get out of here yeah you like that back get up set a trap here stupid hook you uh-huh what are you gonna do now he's gonna start running back uh-huh stupid ai i can read you like a book bop bop bop bop oh you're not getting away oh and no he is not there's another kid oh my god that dude was so weak easy peasy level up i get another augment uh yeah so i'm gonna choose that what can i say it's a great choice if you ask me oh amari you're so dead yep that's it i'm gonna taunt you because why not i gotta tilt the ai that's the secret to everything really is always always tilt look at this big old guy hey there atticus where you're running off to you're getting a little weak buddy oh come on oh an assist i haven't even bothered to show you but they have bots we have bots we're going to try and run them into the little furnace points at the top show you how much more more robots you get into their thing the more points you get quicker you level up you can buy things like they bought an accelerator here i could probably go back although granted my ai are probably doing it all so they yeah it looks like they bought an accelerator but i could have changed this i get another augment where'd all the good people go oh i can activate this sure why not and then how about i destroy you guys huh destroy your bots you have no defenses oh or whatever your name is you've done messed up cause i'm here yeah where are you gonna run off to nowhere it's the answer yo i got you i'ma pull him watch this pop get the kill of course i definitely stole that from you what do you want best of all i just unlocked my ultimate ability now we're doing it i don't know what else this does that's all i know and i think that's all i really need to know they keep buying the supply station and you know what i'll just keep destroying it stupid come here calvin oh i'm sure he does not want to do this yeah it's me your old friend come on we've been having so much fun this game okay you found some friends i'll admit that however there's still not enough for me uh oh what ready i'm gonna trap you come here try and hit me oh my god okay maybe not you're still level one dude embarrassing oh i'm dual wielding i'm dual wielding you're still level one stupid fish i don't think i have a mag limit while i'm in this too that's some good damage come here calvin ah and it ran out okay well let me just trap you here then come here come here buddy who took it rayna you owe me an explanation this guy just bro what are you i'mma pull him where is you going all right come here mr sniper and we missed okay well play i will remember this i'll remember what you've done here oh i could double wheel against him i'm doing it oh wait i'm about to die oh my god oh my health what happened wait oh wow i'm bad all right you know what i'm going to escort these bots let's show them how it's done let's show them how to play the obj i know it's a new concept for me too now unfortunate oh wait oh i can't wait hey hey get off of me i'm trying to kill you get off of me i'm trying to kill your thumper turd bro don't be weird about it come on try as you might this oh now it's gonna be super easy for my boss to get in here and kelvin is just so enthusiastic let's say that and you know what i have to respect it but i also want to kill you so desperately so that's exactly what i'm going to do oh and i'm gonna talk right in front of all your guys and die i'm dying okay maybe that was a mistake okay oof don't die don't it was 100 worth the taunt though sort of my dominance over the ai yeah people think they're gonna take over skynet and all that kind of stuff no clearly we're way far ahead look at these ai dude clearly they if this is what we got to worry about artificial intelligence we're fine we are nearing victory let me see i don't uh i think i might be able to buy a big bot but i'm not sure let me see oh no i need 800 rip well i might get 800 right here hold on oh there we go oh we got plenty let me show you how it's done so in order to aid our minions i can buy a super one we're going to build this sucker look at that mr fruits m actually bot that's right let him know let him know who did this to him it's me mr fruit see our teammates built a little turret here you could fight over this neutral position but we want it hey get down here oh ho ho that is so sad right out of my trap too wow i'm just that good all right they have some elite bots or something but i have a double shotgun so let's go move forward bots i shall defend thee now watch we're gonna get omega points for this guy ready we're at 358. he pops in that's 23. if i did my math right which i think i did my last battleborn kill come on one last one there we go wait the finale i kind of forgot what that what that is okay okay two of you might might be too much oh my i'm stuck in a quarter bro somebody i actually died uh oh wait i think i remember this whoever has more points we spawn like a bigger robot and then we're trying to attack it to their base or something while it's alive i don't entirely remember i'm gonna be honest maybe we just have to get him as a big boy into this thing he's a slow boy though but that's all right you have me by your side easy game easy life place a trap there even though we don't need it come here calvin okay he stunned me while playing our team scored and there we go victory my last game is a dub very fitting got a lot of those back when the game released and then after that just caught fat l's when i tell people battleborn and i liked it and they're like well mao get wrecked nerd and i indeed did battleborn thank you for your service i hope you have a good retirement let's see you're getting retired okay yeah that's what's going on here so congratulations hope that pension's going to come in big for you i know puppy i know [Music] foreign
