hey everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome to a very exciting video because the very first halo infinite technical test or flight whatever they're calling it is out now which means for the first time ever the public gets to try the multiplayer and myself i've never played this in fact we've seen very little gameplay of the multiplayer so i'm super excited to dive into this with you all as you all know halo is it my lifeblood we go way back so let's check it out [Music] that's right oh i am hyped for this my friends and i hope you are too let's get into it so interestingly enough odst boss slayer go up against a team of odst difficulty bots on live fire and recharge now i played one game just to see how it was earlier and i think there's only one map in rotation and i think it was the easiest bots so i'm kind of afraid i'm about to get dunked on by some bots it's happening oh look at this oh this is sick little intro i bet you can like get poses to unlock later or something eagle team oh and it goes right and oh what is this place oh it's all beautiful although did it like reset my fov what the fudge oh my god it did no wonder all that oh my god it's like i'm playing different game okay this is sick i've got what is this thing oh oh i've got the grapple yo how's this gonna work my mouse sensitivity is absolute garbage super low but i'll figure that oh my i'm just gonna freak out about everything got the new commando auto rifle or whatever this is it's a full auto rifle that's all i know power weapon over here gravity hammer who's shooting ah no stop it bye oh okay okay this is my moment this is my mo man give it to me okay how do i get back oh my god the verticality they didn't stand a chance now they're definitely not going to stand a chance when i grapple in with a grab hammer oh my god i'm about to show them what's up ready that's what i'm saying this must be one of the the new ai things they're talking about oh my god oh my okay get pooped on i don't know what that was the like companion ai that voices that you can change oh here i go ready okay let's grab this again i haven't used the pistol yet but it's probably pretty raw zoomed in at this range they're not gonna unscope me okay wait wait as i say that i get unscoped holy cow halo without auto aim clearly the controller has been my clutch okay double kill oh i missed the announcer get a nice little nade oh is that a triple kill not quite but it's close sidekick is raw double kill again okay okay i'm listening i'm here for this can i jump up from here i can the clamber oh i feel like a little kid i'm telling you what i'm so sorry but i'm freaking out i'm grabbing this grab that how do i okay perfect what is this the grapple again oh this is perfect okay so this is the pulse rifle cannon what is that noise ah fudge is not wait oh i hear you little rascal okay all the projectiles killing spree i'm sorry but oh my god this is bringing me i was the reason i play fps is to this day is because of halo halo 3 is literally the reason i have a youtube channel so like it's the only reason i've my gaming career is where it is that it might seem like i'm just being a goober but this is actually so sick okay all my friends died over here all my friends are dead push me to the edge oh that was sick it just didn't work out well i i wonder if how different it would be if i like actually directly grapple them i would imagine a good bit um let me grab this don't mind if i do let's try this a little bit more oh whoa it takes a while does it track at all i can't tell the distance but my killing spree oh overshield power in seven seconds don't mind if i do is there anything else coming up here oh it's beautiful and the rain i'm all about this all right you know i'm hogging this thank you let me just grab oh here we go one kill two okay one was an assist unlucky but you dropped wall no i don't want that i'm gonna take this thing uh that's where my team spawned it so i'm going to assume not there here we go there we go uh an assist sag all right watch she's gonna push me stupid overshield uh guy this is buttery smooth which makes me so happy because i was so worried that they weren't going to do the pc version justice there's going to be an afterthought but this feels nice loving it okay here i go okay he's not dead yet but there we go well gunslinger oh i wish he just said every metal man i'm i'm here for it i'm coming to your rescue friend except i don't know how to get down to you i forgot oh yeah i can slide too oh you're done what wait apparently my first grab hammer did no damage maybe i should be directly hitting him like apparently it does sorry you freaked me out apparently there's no splash jams the sound of this thing so meaty i'm coming for this where you at come here where'd you go what the fudge oh there we go well if i got him in my sights he's dead ready oh i'm coming up here you best be ready i don't think you oh fudge oh shoot okay i gotta bait him in here bait him in come on in come on in the water's warm oh go for the triple no he grappled me oh i've enjoyed myself so much oh this is so fun and the crazy thing too is like it doesn't feel like i'm playing bots you know if i didn't know i was like like yeah i'm doing pretty well but and you know they don't make like all the decisions a normal person would make but still they're definitely competent which is nice uh-oh oh i had to reload this what am i doing oh stick tacular oh let's go look it's me i'm not the orange one i'm not i'm that one [Laughter] i don't even realize there's a mini map i forgot i want to put it top left i don't know if that's a an option but it's it's weird being bottom line i just don't even pay attention to it i'm just so used to not using it like it reminds me of when i played modern warfare and it didn't have a mini map i was like bro i can't play like this the cold war had a mini map and i just never paid attention to it because i just got used to not looking at it and i'm not used to looking at a halo mini map eagle okay and here we go this is the map i played in the warm-up oh i'm getting the skewer check this out ready i'm probably gonna mess with it but it's a one shot it's like an immediate hit scan is but well actually that's not even true you actually have to account for travel time against the easy spots i was having a hard time hitting it let me let me just put it that way okay well he's dead before you can grab that watch see that didn't hit hold like see that didn't hit you would have thought it would have right oh like see i can't even tell how far off i am oh my that's embarrassing oh wait what that was in the back step about the double little skewer hit though the backsmack i love that they called it that oh the sidekick kind of killing it okay i'm weak you go up buddy i weakened him i weakened him there you go god i'm just so bad with the skewer like you wouldn't believe it until i showed you you went you can't be that bad but then you're like oh my god oh here she comes watch out boy she'll chew you up is this what i think it is ah well he took it he dropped it oh it's a shield that's not i thought he was getting the grapple thing i've been debated don't mind if i do oh kate wanted to steal that unlockers oh wait i think there's a battle rifle here no it's a commando what does it change every game or maybe every respawn or something i don't know how that works oh my god this thing is hard to what the fudge i think i'm better with the pistol maybe i shouldn't just pull out of it maybe i should take my time camo uh don't mind if i do although i believe he is going to grab that uh never mind uh let me grab this and baba they don't know you can't see me ready i'm gonna give them the backspace oh fudge fudge oh my god i'm the worst i'm not proud of what i've done here today i need to look for other weapons oh wait i think there's one right here yes there is the commando okay i gotta get better at this thing man i just feel absolutely useless i ain't no i don't just feel useless with it i am useless with it what the fudge yikers ow also ooh spike grenades though what's the button for me gee the stick okay they're using my frags first whoops spike grenade go what why did this switch off no that what that was the spike grenade okay i guess i'm just it arced a lot more than i thought it would i guess okay okay now we're kind of now we're kind of picking it up here oh the little music let me know it's halfway is this a little sniper tower okay we got this thing can i come up this i can does anything spawn up here i don't know what does that thing oh that's more shields i believe i just want to use new things i'm a simple man new is nice and shiny killing spree double kill give me the triple where's the triple where's he over where's the kill tag it's like i never left you know all right i'm using this thing okay you got oh here we go wow didn't hit any of that thank you for the assist friends ooh with that active camo let me waste that again don't mind if i do never mind he's gonna grab it i'm gonna be a good teammate let him do that okay definitely looks like it it uh it adjusts itself a little bit i am in pain i think i can come behind these rascals oh yeah sure you can take that has the skewers spawned again and i just missed him i mean it's a good thing i didn't pick it up let's be honest but i wouldn't have minded new weapons new weapons where are new weapons i want to use new fodge what the maybe something spawns down here anything special oh oh something's bad wait when this has come up i don't know what this is when is this when does this arrive that's what i what wait how did he just wait what sir wait can you show me what uh can you run that one back maybe one more time get the oh my god switch the pistol okay we still got a double wasn't the prettiest hit oh that would have been my triple you boners man all right i gotta find that weapon next time let me see if i can grab it no okay so maybe what did he do i just didn't see a prompt or anything [Music] tacular [Music] so you
