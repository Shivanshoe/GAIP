hi ad ho-jon my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to call duty modern warfare and Lord be with us all it's here the master kuhmo that's right just moments after obtaining Damascus Infinity Ward said nice dude well we're just getting started enter obsidian and you could see here that you can't see a darn thing it's all blacked out well what's the criteria well it's right there yes silly goose kill 15 enemies in a match 150 times now this does differ per weapons for instance assault rifles as kill 15 in there's and match 200 times now let me run some quick couches carry the one that is 2250 kills with just that weapon by the way that's not including every other obsidian camo so the unfortunate part is this more challenges that don't require skill just bashing your head against a wall but to put it in perspective I only needed 720 kills to gold the mp5 now you have to get three times the amount of kills they took to get gold just took it obsidian so yeah that's gonna be interesting thankfully though this week we do have shoot the ship and even better is that you don't have to get 15 kills in 150 separate matches if you double up let's say I get 30 kills in one match that counts is two towards the progression so yeah we're going ham just hope we keep getting shipment and what do we kill everything that moves okay so apparently I looked at my watch and apparently it was dead I thought we just look at a ghost time a gun she whatever they call it you know it's dead so yeah it didn't have been nice to know okay these are assists though they're not gonna what they're not gonna fly how did they already respawn in our saya with even even attempted to take an objective but the world of being double Kela I don't know where everybody just cracked out here what's going on her oh okay okay okay I forgot what shipments like actually I didn't really it's just every time it happens that you haven't played it for a while it's always a bit of a shock like Jesus I don't know the best attachments I'm using the sawed-off or whatever super-crazy suppressor that like removes skulls and all that kind of stuff but no that's the play all but we're ranked 69 bro if I don't get obsidian now like you know am I even a gamer hey gamers you're my friend ah it don't got me killed don't got me killed for the last time I swear to good we're playing grind honestly I don't really know what any of this does III never really bothered to figure out what exactly it does tag collect it like I don't know do I do more damage per tag I have yeah do I move faster or ability like with here's what I do know shoot the enemy and they die just like any other game out and that's the only thing that counts for obsidian anyway so that's exactly what I'm going to do I'm in so much trouble somebody help me yep I need somebody help now just an air about air keep on dancing to the rockin Saturday night you see I thought I'd hit something you know maybe in orthis out look at all this free XP though okay sure XP XP XP we've already gotten 17 kills too which means we've got all one of the tix done is that a kill at there's another one that's why I'm saying we just got to get as many multiples of 50 it's at the very least we need to finish this match with 30 or 45 60 75 90 105 that's right I can count it's a simple geometry or in this case simple addition I don't have the range though but I was like I don't need range it shipment but actually I mean with this integral suppressor thing branch is actually so buts it might not be back I mean up close don't get me wrong fantastic wouldn't trade it for the world but aside from that well to be seen my friends thankfully I have that which is proving to be beneficial as it aw but the fuzzy set as it always is it doesn't love some stiffled grip shape goodness Bob right off spawn Bob there's someone in the shipment no no no try and get me off spawn girl swerve swerve my friend dang I forgot how what's up I got mail aid with the butt of his gun we'll get this dude The Audacity is a golden ground I respect it I'd like to get up sitting for the new guns but you have to get gold first and obviously I don't have gold for any of the new weapons so probably never happen Oh my tags what wait a second okay is there something to this I guess you drop more if you have more oh my God look at this look at all these drugs Oh fifteen see what does this do I'm grinding so hard right now but aha oh my Tech's move I need them I need oh my God look at all these stacks so many jacks hahaha so I have 17 really figure out the fudge that means bro someone used to tell this ac-130 thing to like calm down now give me all the tags again there we go this stupid Harrier it doesn't miss dude and it's it's wall banging me through everything I've better aim get destroyed give me them tags I want to hit 20 the infamous the elusive 220 oh my god we did it we're skirt we're at 24 I'm insane I still just don't know what it means is it just free XP when I pick it up cuz that's really about oh wait a second I'm out of ammo okay we're at 40 kills so we got multiple two in time for the win let's go oh wait a second I'm an idiot oh you take them and then you like I think you deposit them in the zones no wonder I was like why aren't these flags getting capped I understand it took me until the game was literally over to figure it out but I did throughout 150 I feel like I should maybe take up the subsonic into girls suppress or whatever the budgets go ah ah but you will not stop me today but your friend well I thought there's only one of them not two of them unfortunate sure watch I get a kill well there's one and then my thermite is gonna get me a double kill ha just imagine yeah I would have been Zack what are these guys doing in the office bro this guy is gonna be it's gonna be camping right over yeah what did I tell ya what did I tell you you had first jump on me Brad and you couldn't even capitalize you make me sick might not have liked scavenger something like what the why do I never have any animal I have to I've scavengers what do I not have scavenger the fudge is going on right now oh I've got 11 shots I'll make him count check it skirt no I didn't don't have scavenger what the fudge moreover I should activate specialist because if I don't use a kill streak then I can't muddy the scoreboard because if I look and I'm like oh I'm at 20 or like 31 kills but three of those were I kill streaks or something then little did I realize that wouldn't count towards it so instead we'll just do specialists make it real easy real simple no way to misconstrue the information at hand no muddied statistics I have a pretty sick flank right now I'm just trying to to keep that have my head on a swivel it was on a swivel but unfortunately my aim was not he boned ant and why is that swear to god sometimes the most random song it's Alvin I can't even tell you the last time I heard that song but now it's just like it's just you can't get out of my head I own a rock n Roll all night and party every dude I'm just running in there Bob that's not true oh you will ferrell said about the fact that he missed that many shots to begin with this incredibly oh I got the flank and they don't know they didn't know I will say ah there are rumors evidently of the next Call of Duty being something Vietnam related or something not technically black ops or not like related I don't know unsure but needless to say I'm very interested because as you all know my favorite one is black ops 1 and where was that set Vietnam but some people are saying like we don't even need a new call to do this year because mana warfare is is really good you know we just invest more into this and I agree to some extent maybe we can keep warzone keep that around but I'm always down for another Cod especially since I've done as much as I really can with this game but when this game is good it's good like when I'm playing on like shipment or shoe house mainly more shoe has fairly shoot house is kind of pinnacle it's enough we're good action lots of action it has the call duty feel but with the modern warfare package and yeah one worker is nice but again I think it just suffers from maps so many so many maps were just like at least while I grind for obsidian I get a show off my Damascus so I can't show it off what's the point I can't flex it oh boy all I know is I'm only one I've got so we're at four out of 150 let's let's get it guys Oh new skirt you son of a got him now we're on a swivel and I'm dead silent bada boom boom boom boom boom boom they can hear me come Aaron I am a little silent assessing on/off fudge it helps when you can finish your kills mr. fruit does he know that I'm gonna rush him maybe he did maybe he didn't cluster strikes my anus dude really that wasn't an invitation to my anus didn't appreciate down here we go ready and the Lord said yeah yeast oh my god your dad lot of bring the body boomer we got a shoot for more critical mass actually just headin do they consider had critical mass effect that don't i shouldn'ta peaked when i was reloading but I thought he'd pushed me around the box then they'd be a crouching around waiting for me like a little plib like the little flip that he is nice thermite oh my god we actually gotta kill him that was unexpected but a welcome surprise nonetheless nope that's a dead body I'm gonna have to reload god button shot that dead body he would have been dead he could have been dead Oh buddy buggy back I thought you should know my name Oh God just stop singing mister fruit I'm dead I'm not yes I'm dead but I'm not how's that work okay we're at 31 kills which means at the very least we got two out of this game Shipman is definitely the best way to do this but it shoot the ship so I'm just you know it's it's a toss-up of what we're gonna get and knowing my luck the map I don't want to be as always waited believe this flank though this do wait what where did he how did ooh okay well whatever he's dead oh there this way let me reload I bought it bring about a boom I didn't think they'd already be up there I didn't think they'd already have a foothold in the office headed it down better that down better data don't dead the dead I don't better than not that's Parks and Rec not office kill them really say uh up in the office still there's another one down really but now he's dead yeah I'm not letting you get away with it this time you thought you could live so large and leave so we stuck him where sure that's what I meant to do watch me what do we have 38 okay I have a little bit I have over a minute to get seven more kills this should be doable six more oh wait now one of them was a thermite wasn't it o-cedar baited that shouldn't even use throwables I saw now I think six more oh geez or maybe five more oh no seven more because I got another thermite kill oh my god I'm starting to not feel so good about this guy's no seven more kills come on not much time but we can do this me that they're gonna win they're just gonna win get on the point wait a second get off the boy mmm you sons of gods ah hey it's me doing what I do look at me go oh that hurts when I've just found a new way for another camo challenge to tell me hooray I think No well friends one way or another I will maybe eventually possibly very slowly get the Obsidian camo I don't think go over much for watching happy plus a fantastic day I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] [Music]
