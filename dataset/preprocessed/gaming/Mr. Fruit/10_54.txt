somebody's getting pooped on could be us could be them i have to hope it's them we have swords they have machine guns oh my god they have what we've never even heard of such a thing because why would we have them [Music] never mind sir it appears we don't need them hi there everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video a wild challenge appears i know it's been a little while courtesy of patrick cox i haven't said this in so long but mr fruit i've got a challenge for you the medieval challenge you played trials or elimination wait i didn't read that part uh but you can only use buzz glaze and swords but is there okay but no guns okay well um we'll figure that part out look i look like a knight okay i would have changed the fit for this challenge it was a mistake probably frankly it's it's it's night like right come on come on guys don't tell me i wasted all these materials for for nothing but as per the challenge we got a bow we got a glaive and we got a sword the what the what the fudge i can't i can't inspect my hello oh god they're ruining everything hold on does that that fix it no i can't i can't inspect but the fudge or we'll use your imagination if you've seen this sword it's probably the most canon medieval thing we got here looks like a giant great sword excalibur looking thing it's perfect glaive has to go in the energy weapon we have no kinetic glaives and let's be honest the exotics are trash so i'm using my enigma in the whispering slab not many kinetic bow options and i like my whispering slab well we got archer's tempo opening shot targeting adjuster and other things that you can't see because i can't inspect so [Music] yeah okay this man really said go into survival how about this okay iron banners here and that kind of fits the motif the theme we're going for here salden is a knight it's all it it's it's medieval themed armor or samurai stuff you know so we're going an iron banner guys look just close your eyes and pretend it's trials or or elimination okay that is a six stack okay no thanks yeah saw eleven out of twelve pop-up out of nowhere my sus star was oh there's a freelance iron banner okay did not realize that okay we're doing that i guess that's not very candy because you know back in the day i'm a knight i'm probably fighting for some sort of house not like a mercenary or freelance i fight for house fruit or something you know my queen or something so but look what do you want from me twilight gap i swear i have this this supernatural power it's kind of a useless one but i like i don't know i'm about to play and i like i just have this vision of what map i'm gonna play and like nine times out of ten it's the map i was thinking of so yeah i was thinking a twilight cap why i

i threw my hammer at nothing what just killed me i had health and then i didn't sorry the funnel web doesn't do that much damage people say recluse 2.0 but not like that oh my i can't i just can't hit anything man and at that time at least like that time i understand i was the issue nice critic lunch or stupid yo distraction him wait i just killed jesus wait oh god who do i fight for i'm so confused for the king for the king for the king king for the king for the king for the king king who's the king who's the king i don't know but for him for the king for the king screw you almighty you know what maybe i should have listened maybe i should have gone into survival or elimination trials isn't here so that's what is not an option but okay and that's a bubble you have a nice day sir yeah i'll say i'm just gonna immediately go to the next game you know what i'm going rumble i am a mercenary now screw it after that poor performance uh the king has relieved me of my oath so i'm telling you dude i don't it's my dpi it's it's the right clicking is throwing me off like unironically i'm not kidding that game felt so strange you know when you dream you're like fighting and you try to punch somebody but you just can't you know like you put all you have behind it but it's it always feels like you're just like punching in slow motion and there's nothing behind it that's what that game felt like everything had this weird delay and i don't know yes excuses okay that's what i'm making just address the elephant in the room even though it's not an elephant it's very obvious what i'm trying to do here i'm grasping at straws except i don't know what straws are because this is medieval time are you talking about like hey straw in which case thank you but i'm not a horse you know oh and i guess what would it be a phrase then i condemn you wench i don't really know how that has anything to do with anything but i've got the beast in my sights who knew bringing medieval things against future wait has that always been there that crucible crest that's news to me ah nice glaive don't mind if i do oh little double okay suddenly suddenly i'm in it i'm not hitting a thing right now how did my hammer match glaive might you know might just want to stick to that although the glaive was a little more eastern yeah enclave was used more so in the east why did i spawn into this what's going on i don't know but i won the duel my honor was threatened and put into question so i said nay fight me and so oh my god are you kidding me i can't see penis where's this person what nice i'm thinking more kind of like mongols you know use this but that's fine if i gotta be a i'll be a mongol you know what the mongols did oh i don't know had like the greatest empire of all time at one point so yeah i think we could do a lot worse than mongol frankly i'm so weak though please please no please please stay away every now and then get pooped oh my god i'm alive too shoes so we call out played can i say dessert you're not dead i thought that was a headshot this chainmail is incredible and i must have dual arrows i thought i hit him within the chinks of his armor but it appears nay okay now someone tell me what the what so we stand no chance like why is that commander we have swords they have machine guns oh my god they have what we've never even heard of such a thing because why would we have never mind sir it appears we don't need them [Laughter] stop it stop it stop it just curious does your penis shrivel up from straining that heart every single game you play just curious stop it stop it stop i have my sword hey i i hate you i hate you i don't know you and i hate you it's a strong word to use on somebody i don't really know but i did i didn't i don't regret it that's how i feel okay nights have feelings too okay well just because it's just because it's you know medieval times doesn't mean i can't express my emotions or fight for gender equality he's invisible here isn't he he is of course he is of course you are why are you the way you are chaperone invisible melee dominican oh my god let me just hit you with my sword i'll hit you with my hammer how about that he's invisible of course he is can't wait to fight for my life here okay yeah come on what you want do what you want what you want my body do what you want what you want my you got to be kidding me who's behind and how did that arrow not hit i'm getting tilted because i have crutched myself i've been put into a portal of time manipulation this is not where i belong go back to where we lined up and fields and charged each other and wrote on horseback what the is this stuff man jesus trent what kind of name is trent that's all i'm saying no disrespect to everyone else named trent this trent specifically will play it i guess or whatever it's weird because at no points during this video did i feel like i had body autonomy it's it's it's like that dream thing out metaphor i was making man it's weird maybe maybe i wasn't cut out for the middle ages the dark ages maybe nah who am i kidding we crushed that challenge blue and it on w cause that's all we do here house fruit baby
