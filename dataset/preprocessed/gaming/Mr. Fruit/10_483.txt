heidi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to call of duty black ops cold war the closed beta is it closed does it open i don't know it's on pc finally so now i get to have a real go at it we're gonna play some combined arms mosh pitch a bosch bit of team bass launcher gamers guys okay cool also this is literally my first game on this why am i playing like max wubble people uh well i can choose between freaking what ah the craig that sounds cool to me yeah why wow hang on everybody uh nicaragua of course i like this whole intro though oh it's thomas do this whoa yeah see this feels right this is the call of duty i know wait wait wait let me on let me on hey okay all right you have it hey you be safe out there oh you just ditched them i'll reclaim it and get on back up here now was really hoping i could run somebody over it did not work that way now the one thing i've been hearing a lot about and a little worrisome is the fact that the sbm in this is lathered on now not like butter you know where you where you know you're in the south and you just lather it on to either make you acquire diabetes if you don't already have it or make yourself more really obese no in this case it's the hatred light because it's it's lathered on so much that i can't see what i'm shooting or what i'm doing and i'm dead okay no that's not actually the the point is is that spm is cranked up some people are saying it's even worse than modern warfare and not worse in that like worse in the in this in the sense that it's it's there's a lot of spm okay well we're just uh well we're quite frankly boned oh my okay i'm a little rusty it's been a little while what is this thing but um is this a trophy system i kind of think it's a trophy system probably not the best place to put it oh let me get up here climb faster yeah no no rush dude no rush just in the middle of a battlefield and you just decide to saunter your way up a louder i feel like i can't do a darn thing at range which maybe that's how this gun is supposed to be oh i see you i see you hiding there oh okay okay that was a little lucky but mainly skillful nothing quite hits the same as just you know some dialogue and they really says you are my friend hey somebody's got a spy plane up in the air look i don't know if that's oh that's not oh it like automatically marks it for my team the heck i'ma take this down boys and girls don't you worry about it maybe actually i don't know hold on any second now in these okay hey i scared it off guys mission accomplished yeah this is a big old map and i don't know what i'm doing i don't actually know how many how many people are in this isn't it like 16 just or teams of 12 or i don't really know but i am on this giant gun uh no who's shooting me i can't

three well i am those levels what do you mean quite frankly i've been bamboozled i like this little oozy though oh i'm so fast i actually have no idea if my movement speeds faster maybe it's a placebo effect but i gotta think oh i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming you hawk at me but you don't wait for me oh my god you are so dead okay check this out oh that's a symtax i think and what oh i got a stem
