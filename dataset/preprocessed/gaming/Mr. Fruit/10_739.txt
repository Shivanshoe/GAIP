hi 80 homes ruin money mr. Furth and welcome back call duty modern warfare and in today's video we'll be looking at the second new weapon added in season two we took a look at the Stryker 45 or the UMP for us mm cultured people but now it's time to look at the growl five five six and yes you have to say growl every time you came to some oh it's the ground the girl no I do have the shadow site blueprint for it which comes with the compensator zlr drifter AO 8 by Mel watt laser GI mini reflex and the no stock stock all around actually love the bill definitely seems like the way I would build it it seems like it's turning this into more of a submachine gun even though it's in sort rifle so screw you certainly have a tickle to my fancy now there's been a playlist update so we're gonna play floatation oxidation get more with rust in v e5 moshpit we will be invading each other's personal space so we're just we're just gonna have to get over it Shepherd II Bobby to Bobo be die be bow hello Kratts what are you so excited about today what are you looking at is that platinum on that SMG I certainly can't tell from here because planet it's so it's hard to tell what exactly were you even it's not porn wait I got killed by Marchman rifle that close my anus I got to figure out what exactly we're working with here is it is it an SMG is an AR as is somewhere in between is it having an identity crisis I'm gonna go with having an identity crisis what it does have some mr. fruit if you shoot you shoot to kill when you point something like this but somebody you best be willing to kill them because if you don't oh what a headshot tatertot Oh barely saw him up again out and we got still he did okay I am so glad we're playing as a team I appreciate you all but I'm done getting assessed being a team player sucks you know what else sex really not am Oh Oh he knows I'm up here which means I gotta get down mainly because I need ammo ah I need ammo where's it I got some ammo okay that's one mag that's what I died I died for that was it worth it absolutely not I forgot to change my killstreaks why do I have veto it could have had actual kill streaks but instead I'm rockin this absolute clown fiesta but it killstreaks I don't know what do I think I'm like the next that like the second coming I'm just like the greatest ever but there ever was the official goat no one's ever had the official goated status until today and Finan award has noticed me and goaded me officially officially unofficially I said they did it so it counts oh that's fine nice buddy nice I mean I hey that's rough you hate to see it I actually saw a picture on the subreddit because we got some homies out there who had a map for us with all the spots to get long shots were they ours so I need to pay attention to that I need to pull that up soon because we're not getting shoot the house shoot the house shoot the ship shoot shoot house oh my god I'm just I'm all out of it right now okay apologies I've been been playing some other FPS has recently been grinding a lot or in between the cycle apex other FPS is actually okay that might be it but that's not that's not important I've been taking a little break these past couple days which has been nice because I have grinded a lot of Khalid Duty aha oh oh it's a burn it's a deep deep burn my dad don't oh whoa oh my god watch the stairs mister froat that's trying to BM me to bread that ain't cool it also ain't cool that I haven't bothered to chain can I change kill streaks on the manna game yeah way to go there you good-for-nothing mister fruit now I have to admit I am not entirely sure what that didn't kill now it feels like it really I'm using an SMG out here and heck I just don't understand screw me where this gun came from like the striker very clearly oh my god yeah it's you and P yeah of course duh like what do you take me for I know Joe Schmoe ain't no simp that's what the kids are saying these days does that make me cool I know that doesn't really apply here at all but just go with it that's a nice kill that's a nice second kill but I am feeling this man I'm telling you even though not everyone watches the apex videos which you should because I love playing it and you guys have been to stop lying and then I can't play it because my gaming videos on it don't have a lot of time to invest in the stuff and so if I can make contra on it no probably not gonna play it it's the conundrum I have with my job but when I do play apex I do notice well I'm grinding that especially with the skill based matchmaking now I do get better pretty quick honestly like my aim search to search do a Crispin up well my friends honestly like Rob listen he's not he doesn't watch my videos so he's not gonna hear this and if you guys linked to this or right on me not cool dude you know what happens to tattle tales in in jail well they're not called tattle tales they're called rats and they get stabbed with prison ships do you want that to happen cuz that's what's gonna happen if you tell on me so anyway I hadn't even said I was gonna say point is like Robbie he's caught up in slack and probably he's kind of been losing it let's see I can't tell if he's losing it or I'm just you know I'm hot around the sticks right now even though again we play on mouse and keyboard but it says it's a figure of speech hotter on the in man cave somebody got a Hugh a V it might be personal well I'm gonna make it personal and put it that way nicely done yo this thing is nice though like it it feels like an SMG that has range and that's great that's great when I was first using the strikers like Jesus you know it doesn't matter how far they are it takes like one or two more bowls to kill everybody but they're saying no no no no it does exactly what you want it might be these attachments I mean this blueprint does have just the perfect amalgamation of attachments it was the right use of amalgamation right amount I'm pretty sure I'm just gonna say I'm right that way I don't have to bother to look if I was wrong and then I can just blindly distrust and refute everything that you say even though it might be based on truth and that makes sure that I never have to admit that I'm wrong yeah pro tips for y'all out there if you never want to be wrong like me who is never wrong just yeah just all my lead mmm mmm this is bad this is bad this is really really bad this is bad this is bad but I'm going to frag it don't matter it don't matter i'ma put you in a body bag watch this check this out I have wow that was impeccable timing with that cruise missile I need to start listening to new songs for the radio well no not the radio dude I'm so sick of it the other day go into the gym I had tried to listen to the radio for like the first time and it was just post Malone circles it's time after time after time it was like well small circles some other song post blobs are that some kind of own don't get me wrong I had nothing against anyone just I don't really like that kind of music and that song certainly grows old after you hear it like two times and three seconds even but the songs not even that long you know it's like they don't even wait to play the entire song there's like a repeat booted back up whole hour of power post Malone circles by just the whole coentrão even listened to the radio and really on time and that's exactly why but I need to do it because well I like to sing and in my commentary I usually bring up some random song or some tune pops in my head but it's always the same stuff you know at this point you probably heard me sing just about every tune and renditions ever run in my head I've been doing this for a while and hopefully you've been watching for a while if not you're new hey hi how are you welcome feel free to subscribe hit that Bell like the video fudge blindly tell me that I'm right on stuff and never tell me that I'm wrong because I am NOT and that is not true you're gonna get the wrong impression to me that's not how I listen if anyone's ever gonna call me out believe me I'll be the first to do so I'm honest I'm upfront it's how I am it's what I do imma kill you with my grenade because I can't I can't see you which means I can't shoot ya don't yet have full that can bend around corners I've never seen something about that on like the History Channel or the Discovery Channel a while ago like jazz made 2009 like militaria working on magnetic railgun system that shoots like guided missiles around corners or some thought that's like let that's crazy never heard about it but then again who really knows because here's the thing about the government if they declassify something or show some technology that's because it's long past what they have and what they use so it's of no bother to them or any worry that they show that kind of technology because behind closed doors they got James Bond stuff you know like when was it in the Cold War we everybody joked about and didn't realize but like we literally had like a heart attack gun like you could point it at someone and essentially like have them like give them a cardiac arrest or something and as always Ken on mister fruits commentary to divulge into shenanigans divulge no that's not the right word deteriorate baby I mean not quite the what I'm working for but I think it works oh my god my neck is stiff though tell you what got a lot of go odd tense and tightness up there the upper back because that's what my physical therapist said had to go in from a back and he's like good low boy need de-stress or in the word you're something isn't that right buddy mm-hmm mmm I agree well said well sad a man a few words he speaks with his actions and his actions speak loud I am blindly firing into the ether the abyss the nether I don't Oh Hitler oh how did you get a purple name how did you do that guys I want a purple name that's so cool you spawn behind me really really because I you guys you're supposed to remind me to change my killstreaks so that I can actually get kills I'm blaming you all yep this one is not on me now no no no this your guys's fault yeah yeah shift in the plane that's right it's what we do here I'm never wrong I shift the blame mmm you guys are starting to get the picture aren't you yeah the sooner we work together and you understand how things work around here your life's gonna be a lot easier I know I make it sound like some prison system or something and you need to you need to find a game to stick around otherwise yeah what's with all these prison analogies I've got going there prison ships and oh yeah I stopped shooting because I thought he'd die it's a terrible practice muscle memory that I have from literally every call of duty before I thought I'd gotten older feather turns out new I'm still just as bad I'm surprised I'm even attempting it now yet with the growl because I've only used it for a certain amount of time and I'm really still Cathy 725 not a style like a while ago stop stop bad boy you're in timeout you're getting the prison ship mmm too late it might look like bar soap fashioned into a shiv and you might think oh cool worst it'll do is disinfect maybe clean my body a little bit no no it's a dirty dirty soap uh-huh it's gonna give you like prison diseases you don't you don't want those I know I don't prison diseases are the worst well someone just get me out of here save me okay like I just ran past me I don't think he noticed me Wow no I just got my feet all in the air space was full dodge that's a that went pretty well huh screw you limp wiener what you guys see that last kill cuz I know I did but my my eyes feel deceived we had a very short amount of time with this gun but I actually I was sick I loved the growl more impressed with it and I'm the striker and I love me the UMP so it takes mr. fruit seal of approval at least this blueprint I don't know what it's like without the attachments you'll have to let me know you commoner what is that you you don't spend too much money in video game transactions like I do because it's the only thing that sometimes gives me some small sliver happiness and it's that endorphin rush that I chase because I suffer from clinical depression and so I'm sort of sad all the time and that a little bit of it all right there me calm down hope you guys enjoyed this video with that said I want to thank all the much watching happy listen friend as they all talk to you in the next one very well [Music] [Music]
