well well there we go nice super high 8001 money miss mr. fruit and welcome back to more destiny 2 and another d1 exotic is back yes that d1 exotic oh my gosh back okay you're right I set myself up for that the fourth horseman or for those of you who've been watching the channel for a little while the fourth holy Sh see it's back in its default normal glory but I'ma be honest this ornament mm-hmm it's nice with it Sandara this weapons rate of fire is increased significantly and fires full auto it also has ever had break a soul tank broadside each successive shot has more damage and more spread and fitted stock we're gonna be doing approximately a lot of damage although if they're close enough for you to shock on them they'll probably die in one hit anyway cuz you you got to be close but fourth holy [ __ ] shall rain terror upon these plebs unfortunately I don't have the catalyst yet we'll get it one day if you do get it it adds one shot to the magazine and increases reload speed can't believe I'm saying this too but later today I think I'm gonna grind comp yeah yeah I know but it's some of the quickest way to get light and considering tomorrow is trials I need to be ready yeah how are you guys I specifically put on middle class striker because of slide shot but I never remember to frickin do it so I put on my entire swords to hopefully help me remember which is doubtful but ready oh wait hold on skirt pop oh wait oh wait what I forgot to put on mods to help with shotgunning but it can't be bevor mean to shoot twice but literally if you just like hold it for just a second to walk like that I clicked it like once but it happens oh wait you see that slide shot coming in no Bob and Jes wards Wow okay this is going well ready ready I'm about to deflect so much damage if the dude from behind will leave me alone but it appears that's not the case however I did put on some special ammo scavenger so we should be getting a little bit more ammo when we pick it up because one want to go just it ain't gonna cut it okay you picked up that special that's right you know I'm not I'm not trying to make a video simply out of shotgun where the especially label so now go ahead bully in this ornament it's 80s is so much better that's right we pay to win out here that's not entirely true but you know what I mean okay god I never mean to double tap mister of fruit you gotta stop that you rascal ah oh oh ah and then the one time I don't shoot twice holy bejesus well I did no one tell me being with antes for just so good I kind of knew it but I never did it I always thought I was above it but clearly that I was up I was about to slide you lucky son of a gun I was just drawn to Luna short but clearly that was not necessary ready and taste Ward's away ha ha and the slide shot reloads the thing oh we get fudge is more than I thought yeah this is kind of nice we can we can just keep doing this over and over I slide reflect damage shoots slide over the ammo pick that up it instantly reloads rinse and repeat ok unfortunately I did not slide over that ammo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo I probably shouldn't be running down this incredibly open way but okay oh my god wait I have 10 shots I had free ammo for days why'd you have to go and get yourself killed mister well I was like oh I have striker but I forgot I don't have like slam I have oh you're gonna die gauche what sorry supered for nothing so I'm gonna reflect this Golden Gun oh I did it but I still die ah I was hoping it would reflect back to him okay so it's just super hour isn't I was hoping the damage would reflect back but it didn't work that way well of radiance I'm not scared I just slide right into those DMS I mean if I could get face-to-face with a super I could probably melt their face I might need more than two shots or I might need to hit like every bit of my two shots but it's uh it's it's uh it's pretty good Archie's well now I'm just I'm firing too fast I I lost my a mile I I just I panicked oh yeah daddy as soon as we didn't get the kill on the one guy I just felt flustered I'm gonna go ahead and instantly reload look at that little extra damage too with the shotgun which they should damage isn't really necessary oh wait I didn't I didn't kill you I mean yes we are putting ourselves out there so we're dying quite a bit but we're a team and that's the life of a neighbor it's just unfortunate that we happen to keep finding so many people in groups like the heck is this all about you know I'm saying I got power ammo it's strictly just to prevent the enemy from getting it oh you're lucky let me just slide into that and play that funky music rawhide me reload real quick they have a super going somewhere I'm not sure but I'm going to reflect these projectiles so hard wait that didn't kill well that did eat okay Oh slide into that come on Oh oh my gosh okay this is insane this is insane screw you guys go Doge oh I was trying to run fast enough to then slide and is it bad that I'm having fun aping I think it is the Antaeus Ward's in the slide shot though making this so much more fun oh my god but then people like that don't die but that's fine I'm gonna slide into the slide shot didn't Rock but that's fine alright so I'm gonna go okay we got one kill and his friends over here and got got ya the spread and the range you know it happens mr. fruit no you've gone to the dark side you've become everything you said you wouldn't you exotic I had to make a video on it okay it's it ain't that deep bro okay it's I don't have a choice you see got just freakin shooting punch punch a tube whoa whoa whoa there we go nice that's two shutdowns in a row we lost but in my heart I did not you like that look at us I was gonna do a rumble game but then it just immediately loaded me into control again so at whatever paying it's the same players I don't know if same teams but at the very least we'll drive the run back we need to ape but there's a there's a careful ape balance you see yeah give me that okay so I might have missed the slide and a shot and I had to melee for it but that's okay oh my god oh my okay it's it's hard too it's it's tough I think in that case the the sliding extra screwed man could have easily just walked around the corner and killed the dude but I didn't I just started my slide I thought it would come out tragic that would have been absolutely embarrassing okay there we go there's one dude I got my slide shot going there's another one okay and we only two shots left but we'll make it work there there good okay they got heavy I just started my side darn it I have to predict it a little bit sooner but I would have killed him not used to these Antaeus wards but I must admit they're fine I need to rebind my slide button now it'd be a lot easier if it wasn't on control it's like who uses that got dome and okay - for what give me that and then I'm gonna get ya oh I couldn't my gun didn't ready in time otherwise probably my favorite part about the gun whether or not it's you like it or not you can't deny the sound effects it sounds great I mean bungees always been on top of sound and some of their guns just you know I'm saying wait I didn't kill him I does ain't a hordes have a cool-down probably right yeah okay but we heard the lead here and you know what I'm a fan okay I am yeah see it's tough I at the same time I don't need the slide in to get kills but I also have to slide in to get kills because I get the kill pick up the ammo instantly reload and it lets me ape that much better maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I had the catalyst but considering I don't what are you doing back there with a little sniper here ask hey hey season rank up 29 yeah it's like double what I was last season I'll give me that amp no no you're not supposed to that's my mo breath yeah they were a tight was way too far listen it doesn't have a range okay it just doesn't imagine if I used bring like a good Mindbenders ambition roll with this ah I feel dirty just thinking about it I can't wait to do it I'm just kidding I don't even have a good mind I don't think I have mine a bit different [ __ ] ambition all right we need to find our way around some more corners Golden Gun try me try me okay I reflected it but I think I'm still good what is with these misadventures bro how is he killing me it's twice in a row he just I just died uh-uh my son's radar is all what is this real life or is it just fantasy God in a landslide no escape from reality open your eyes look up to the sky and I need no sympathy because it's easy come easy go I don't know where I'm getting shot there's too many people on my radar doesn't really matter to me to me I'm actually sprout with you I know we're gonna die I'm just I'm just going deep you know arms I am brother I'm going deep we've not enough ammo and nothing but hopes and dreams and they keep Gooding constantly crushed but of course I'm gonna keep doing it I mean we are aping ahaha my entire swords governing huge there you can't defeat me come here arch staff let me Adam oh oh if I was closer didn't miss shots it's simple just shoot him forehead can that be said for like everything ever though oh I could have hit the kill if I just you know hit my shots well like yeah that's you kill someone then that's usually why you don't kill someone is it if you miss so thank you for that astute research what there all just constantly hiding back here I want to get in but I have to ape too hard to get one kill and then I scale it out from the whole team I mean it's why we're completely destroying them and score because it refused to leave see sight speaking of which I'm smoking CT all right I'm gonna I'm actually gonna Bob pull out the outer rifle just so I can get a kill to feel good about myself and game over we won this one I had the final laugh I'll admit I had a lot more fun with that and it might be because the whole Antaeus wards slide shot thing that that probably helped but I've been told it's actually not bad in PvE it can melt look a bit so if it can actually see use that would be cool so I give it a passing rating I know is if we're ever gonna get d3 so it makes sense even though not ever wants to see it I'm fine with all this d1 stuff coming back I just don't like that I feel like it's at the expense of getting new things but it would be cool you know eventually we have everything from d1 to d2 and just becomes a big shared world anyway it's not important it's just my dream with us I don't think about watching every cells friend has day I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
