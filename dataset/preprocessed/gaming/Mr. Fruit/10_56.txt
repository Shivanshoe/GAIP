the floodgates are open and i'm fighting eight people how does this work huh where'd he go there's one ah go get him go on now get what's wrong with you who hurt you come on ah hi do you hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video we're covering a weapon many people are searching for both high and low currently in the new expansion none other than the akantata 57 hand cannon this hand cannon was introduced in witch queen obviously i mean you see the symbol and stuff i don't got to tell you that in fact if you're insulted i had to tell you that that's fair i like the look of the gun service guns always look cool this looks cool that's all i have to say about that uh we're going to be going with arrowhead brake for some increased uh handling speed and recall increased magazine size are greatly increased in decreases for that speed real speed's already trash so i think we're just going to go append it back i had a storm i know for pvp at least this is one of the ones you want to get it becomes more accurate and boost handling as your health is lower now ideally here we'd have something else but moving target isn't terrible increased movement speed and target acquisition when moving while aiming down sights i mean if i could get like a rangefinder here or something that would have been a little cooler but what are you gonna do and then of course because it's a soros hand cannon it has the cirrus origin trait relating grant's weapon bonus handling and reduces incoming flinch for a short time i have handling on this i'm not going to mass work this because i i don't know how i feel about it this is probably my best pvp role i've gotten but i want to check it out and then i wanted to know is this a glitch i don't know on all my other legendaries like i i can't but for whatever reason on the cantata i was able to put adept icarus on it even though it's not adept or something i i don't know maybe this is a thing but i couldn't recreate it on anything i don't know i just i was like yeah what mods could i put it on oh huh why can't i put on adapticarus so i you know i put on tigress so we're gonna bring the cantata into some pvp and see what all the fuss is about i think for most people you know another 140 hand cannon and everybody loves their 140 hand cannons it's definitely the pvp meta on top of you know the sero synergy and then certain rolls so i can understand why this would be like hey you know try and get one of these if you can or just hope you get lucky or be on the lookout for this so you're like excellent question maker fruit king i'm curious why should be the gargoyle we should be here keep for uh so glad you asked me i am uh i do have a phd in uh destiny weapon rules and i would tell you i have no idea thank you very much for coming to my ted talk uh you guys have been a great audience i'll see you next time i don't know i think for pve people want like surplus time payload or something and then for pvp yeah i i don't know either storm and rangefinder or something whatever you want all right i'm not going to tell you how to live your life all right but uh linear actuators for whatever reason okay you got absolutely pooped on that didn't last very long okay okay i'm out of here i'm dying i'm using shoulder bash for the movement ability and that's pretty squat okay rude guys i can't see past your fat heads what from downtown funky stuff he really direct hit me with that wither horn huh that's sassy what i swear it's a junk cook my teammate baited me man you baited me you killed me get freaking in there dude you just died and you don't even avenge my death what's wrong with you who hurt you apparently a lot of people frankly for you to be such scum give me that overshield baby oh baby you what you say he's just a friend i don't know why i keep spawning here i hate it so much yeah i'm alive ah the melee bash didn't come back in time it would have been a cool movement tech there but instead i swung into the air it's just swinging a mischief move out of my way you like that ooh out of icarus [Laughter] spawns seem a little weird i would respond here every sometimes one's a little wonkier than usual no i'm always fighting for my life off spawn one way like either their spawn or my spawn ah oh what you've got to be kidding me oh my god i couldn't see it i didn't and then it just burned me so i was trying to reload this stupid garden and without a reload perk it's it's painfully slow oh i almost embarrassed you but then i didn't because your stupid little whisper the old gods void buddy freaking penis bubble thing hate it get naded why why you like this why why dude i can't get out of this room get me out of here it's like it's solitary confinement or something i want to go home i don't care where i'm just trying to get out of here god help me help me and my friends but none of them are in this game i hate everybody here oh god freaking dude he's jesus look at this what the [ __ ] thank you thank you get me out of here please i want to go home it does feel nice though when you oh when you start hitting shots too bad i never got to experience that because what the fudge was this game all right let let me try something here real quick here's another cantata robert hate moving target it's not the worst i guess range oh i like that but okay see i can't put adept icarus on it it doesn't like why was i able to put it on the other one it it makes no sense i don't know but i guess i'll take it if this is the only legendary hand can i get i get to put adaptic or script on that's not adept well couldn't give me a little bit of a better role but that's okay in fact you know i might as well just masterwork this is the my one legendary adept icarus it's the chosen one that's what the game's saying you know it's you know i don't i don't make the choices here what what is that hold on what what what is this goodness gracious it's atrocious and i love everything about it linen my hand of the rasputin i'm coming a fear not gotta kill nice fish you have friends okay don't know how i missed no you have advantage little rasky of advantage in my heart that's what matters out of my face and he was this big i was sitting on my rooftop chew my bubble and along came herman the worm and i said herman fudge i forgot the rest of it is i got hungry so i ate uh something i know my mom used to always sing that to me as a kid nice nice straight shot buddy you're gonna get carpal tunnel by the age of 12. cause i'm free okay yeah you know i'm starting to i'm starting to understand this thing is not it just it just feels right you know it handles well and that's so many of them maybe if i played around engagements better instead of just going in the 1v3s willy-nilly then it might have been something you little fusion rascal half a second more than you probably would have got me but you didn't there's one oh god and of course he ju you gotta be kidding me can i can i delete this thing oh wait i forgot i'm trying to throw my sentinel shield and i forgot i don't have it like what am i doing what is what is this and why is he getting like damage resistance i'm so confused stuck in a corner for a minute i'm whacking the air i don't have a shield i'm all confusing he comes from behind taking weird dick coming in and now and suddenly the wall is breaking the floodgates are open i'm fighting eight people how's this work huh where'd he go go get him go on now get come on that one's for you bless you like deserved a little more but oh there we go there's that ambiguous i don't know why i'm burning i can see your little stupid head oh my god somebody where where are my bullets going hello okay apparently giving this guy a haircut maybe maybe the stag or whatever the fudge this stupid helmet was was making me think because his antlers probably aren't hitbox but still like not a single one of those hit is so bizarre okay and then freaking actually i'm bolt freaking friend are you okay are you okay are you okay for rin friend are you okay are you okay that's a strong word to use i don't know if i like you that much i just met you but i often say that if it makes you feel a better i'm going to say a little better but it didn't run a little bad yes you've been hit by you've been struck by smooth criminal get in there did my mailing not registering him or or my shotgun like how is he full help if you close your eyes and listen to that grunt you now know what it's like to hear me go poop you're welcome come here i'm going to hit your antlers this time that's right yeah this feels crispy this feels great it feels like a nice handking so i can understand might be like hey get yourselves one of these and it's a little dicey running around on low health but if you can yeah it feels re what is going on over there silence and squall no thanks run friend the other way you're so dead okay little little gung-ho on that fusion rifle shot if you honestly were counting on that how did that rocket not kill him yeah i did well the crazy thing too is his his fusion rifle probably does kill from there quite often it's it's ridiculous that's like playing trials there was fusion rifles everywhere i mean myself and could you can't beat them join them just like well just don't play in fusion rifle range aka just leave the game because they're everywhere it's like oh too close dead diffusion rifle oh medium medium range dead diffusion rifle oh long range somehow still diffusion rifle nice team shot nice team shot appreciate you my man i super fell out at the worst time also i should probably just pop mine because i'm not doing anything i'm going i'm going now all right mr fruit.exe has stopped i can not i can't not believe that just happened to suppress her name why did it do so much damage and out of nowhere somebody let me kill this man i got him i got him it's all good we just need one kill just one kill nice steep shot see that's what i'm talking about you hit up with the sniper right hit him with the the body all right let's go take ourselves into the rumble playlist huh yeah see look look yeah fruit how do you ever add up icarus on my cantata yeah see i don't know either man i don't know well it's just a matter of time before i get reported for cheating but it was there so i could what do you want from me you know tell me you don't fear vanguard operations all right it's reset time baby let's go thanks for the golf ball wait was this oh an ornament oh that's cool i didn't realize there's a thing well i quite like that now don't i i don't want it keep giving me ascendant shorts frankly you're more valuable to me than exotics at this point in my life but do not delay we're hopping into rumble because i mean for all intense purposes yeah we didn't we didn't really have a first game so gun is just scuffed and i like it this way yeah i just wish we had some better perks here because if this is the only legendary hand cannon like this you know it could have been a little bit better but widows court oof oof ah okay that's yeah this is tragic i'm gonna take a map i definitely don't want to play for uh 15 bucks cheap oh okay i'll say it again what are we doing what oh my god wait what someone tell me how he just one shot bodied me with a sniper hello because i was like okay there's no way he got a headshot i still don't even know how he got a body shot frankly but yeah and then he did and he just one shot nice one i don't i don't understand what happened i truly don't let's go right around the thing funk okay that should have been both of my kills and this is to go even further beyond let's go okay was the next two headshots and it worked out perfectly i don't really know what we were both doing i don't know if he was just trying to bait me i think he was just trying to get low enough to be like haha and then he'd drop a well shocking around the corner whatever but that's not how it worked for either of us god i hate this map like specifically two for rumble and they kill each other great it's like what are we doing over here oh okay i don't know how i didn't what's your resilience is there a way to put your resiliency can't get three taps with 140 apparently because it seems like he managed oh come on i'm not gonna finish him someone else is i'm sure five minutes no come here how how man's really using recluse oh maggie won out of this lobby like that no see i three tapped it i wonder if one of the headshots was just a little bit out of range when i fought him earlier unsure if you don't give me a heads up you've got to nice nova bomb dummy nah oh i'm so dead cause i'm free oh the nova bomb again this time it went off though stole my overshield oh that's a sniper my overshield's just about gone he's stuck i don't know how that you don't have to be like this anymore no one needs to suffer at the hand of those all right that's just not that's not necessary all right have my super game's almost over it doesn't really matter why am i one shot exactly it's really not going to kill anyone huh yeah all right well hey podium finish guys we couldn't get a horse map but the game had to nerf us somehow you know i probably should have gotten second looking at that but you know whatever but get yourself a kadatta if you can with a pve or pvp roll whichever one you would prefer because it's a solid feeling hand cannon and throw on adapt icarus grip if yours 2 is glitched i wish i could tell you how i did it i don't know it obviously doesn't make that big of a difference but it's nice but you know what does make the difference you watching this video i'm honored thank you for your
