your money look into current and click the link down in the description box below right now ladies and gentlemen boys and girls other ways to identify people it is i'm mr fruit and it's weird to be back but we are and we're looking fresh we are dressed too impressed my friends i mean look at this we got like ox uh gauntlets ox is that an ox demon bull horn thing whatever forgive my lack of word smithery today i think i made that word up too i don't think word smithery is the word word smith is okay we're we are very quickly getting off track so let's get things back in order we have tickus divination tickus divination i'm not really sure we're gonna call it divination as you can see here it is a bow with rope and pointy things three of them though which is very fitting it's thematic because sacred flame hip fire this weapon fires multiple tracking projectiles targets marked by these projectiles explode upon death or when struck by another sacred flames explosion that doesn't explain what i meant i meant to read the other one first whatever causality arrows arrows fired while aiming down sights caused sacred flames to instantly detonate precision hits with the perfectly drawn arrows increase the power of the detonation okay never mind wait i did read them in the right order okay receipt hit fire there's other fighters multiple tracking projectiles it doesn't say but it shoots three three it literally auto aims it's easy it also attacked a string for peepee poopoo and straight fletching for nothing and uh working on the catalyst uh no ornaments although if we go over to season 13 and here is the level 100 season pass ornament for it pretty underwhelming i i don't know i guess i i mean what could they really do with it i suppose i guess that's one way to look at it but anyway you know me i'm a bow fiend so i'm all about this and of course we have to take this into the crucible i don't know why i punish myself like this but let's do it and we're hopping right into rank nuff of course not you kidding me do i look stupid don't answer that i'm afraid of the answer you're gonna give me now i could be a degenerate like everybody hates and become behemoth use stasis but i'm better than that also all the armor the only armor i've ever bothered to master work is now kaput it's uh it's been sunset kill me here is here's the new season armor you're getting the battle pass people have been hating on it and the ornaments and you know what i'm gonna be honest i'm actually kind of all about it if i'm being honest i don't know if that says a lot about me but low-key i think it's kind of sick i have to show you all this because matchmaking takes forever don't ask why look at this thing everybody's making fun of my helmet but dude i'm looking like that giant forehead uh jedi guy like what's not to like i am aware he has a name i just don't know what it is i'm gonna google giant forehead jedi well that's him ah keotti mundi she like come on now it could be way worse the anomaly okay yeah it just got worse it it just got worse sweet moses you oh god here is a problem you need a bigger map because here's the deal okay you need time to hit fire like this bop track oh whoops my bad buddy to track them uh oh let me get in on this capture hey oh give me those free points but then i then need time to draw and hit them with precision to activate the explosions because as you're gonna see here it auto aims easy peasy like literally two it'll it'll highlight them like you'll know exactly what's going on ready look see red box easy peasy um actually what the fudge i said easy peasy and then it did no damage wait what i think i'm lagging did i just get what is um what is all my fish okay here we go here we go i'm nuts yep see i got enough time to hip fire stick three arrows into him he does look kind of funny but that's about all the damage we did purely cosmetic and let's be honest there's nothing modern science and medicine can't fix he's he's gonna be just fine a little bit of surgery take a little bit off the top okay i definitely shot you whatever but she like i don't need to aim look boom tracked easy peasy i know there's a guy around this corner because it's trying to track him which it did and then if i can eventually yes get excited over nothing so i think each arrow does three damage if i'm not mistaken or something like that so yeah a full hip fire shot hitting all of them nine damage kind of nuts i know cracked dare i say broken uh hey teammate if you could not get oh oh that's good that's real good so what happened was the explosion did some aoe damage as you would expect an explosion to do fido oh come home fido oh he's a good boy anyway so yeah nine damage blah blah it's nothing special so what what needs to happen is you need to hit the precision shots which we which i just i can't do i can't do it so it's never going to be good in my hands i want to cry okay it does 9 damage per arrow so to be fair we could be doing 27 a shot what what am i doing my my grenades are off my shots are off but guess what you know what isn't my track what the guy's name is kaya told tusk cleanse or whatever i can't say the new antagonist's name but you know what i'm talking about oh there's that damage though if i had already marked them it would have actually oh my god meant something where'd you come from how did that go past see like on a normal map far distance like we beating right now boys i tell you what because like literally just hit everybody with one arrow and then fully charge them to proc you're eating you eating real good hold on let me okay there we and i'm done now here's the embarrassing thing i'm second place on my team mika here comes the boom okay wow hey what if i just threw hammers and never hit anything i'm clapping to hide and mask my pain you can't hear me crying over my claps this is an easy way to tell like i don't need to look on my screen to figure out if there's an enemy i can just let my auto oh my you know what one one day i'm going to show you what it's i i need range dude you know i panic up close when i'm trying to hit precision shots okay here here i go okay hear it hold on okay okay this is my moment no that was actually i could actually might have been maybe been able to do that one okay here i go yeah you guys see that once i hit the precision shot it goes and they all explode for like 137 so long story short that's a lot of damage bob that's a nice nade and i'm not pushing that because shout hayes all up in my grizzly hit him with one of those and then just miserably fail to do much of anything okay i almost actually killed him on a super oh i have noticed because i i played one game before this and i was fighting space warlock merlin uh freeze dragon aka stupid warlock stasis and if you can proc it while they're in that and they don't immediately find you wait what i procked it and he didn't die kind of sucks they can actually do a lot of damage to supers so that's something to keep in mind but that's only if they're blind and don't immediately see you and home in on you and you die get out of my outplayed out skilled quite frankly i'm embarrassed for you i definitely okay we're gonna anomaly dude of course here we okay wait for it okay there we go god what the okay oh curve those bend them like beckham what i exploded them but he lived i disagree i have to disagree good politely though and we ended up winning so who cares baby let's get it that's the way i like it uh stats how'd i do uh freaking uh actually positive okay about one and a half we'll take that now really all i'm trying to do too is uh oh i've defeated enough guardians well i just need to get more orbs of power and then i can actually get the catalyst and then i can work towards the catalyst i don't know what the catalyst does but it's probably helpful you know i probably could have done gambit i feel nauseous just saying gambit but hear me out a little bit of pvp not much but then i can actually show it off in pve where it is quite frankly actually really fun to use no meme oh but it's rusted lands i do like rusted lands you know what here's what we'll do we'll finish this off with pvp and then once i get the catalyst we'll bring that oh hello sir bend it like beckham oh i've seen that damage dude can you can i'm not surprised i hit that shot my aim is cracked do i hear a sweet business that is music to my ears i don't know who you are i don't know where you are but i will fight where did this dude run off to oh oh here we go wait i gotta kill what i mean yes yes i do oop celia that i can just i can spy people from miles away i was never good at i spy or where's waldo and this is just this is like wall hacks this is like cheating and where's waldo it's like picking up a pre-owned where that is a sweet business not really and he is just letting it rip it's like going to the library and checking out where it's waldo and someone circled him on all the pages some people would be like oh dude like this sucks i ca a normal person be like duh what fudge i can't find waldo but a high iq person such as myself realizes wait a second i know where waldo was at all i hit that i hit those oh my god i'm bending it so hard bro i'm i'm bending it like back up bro i my shot is just afk bro there we go got him and then ottawa and then charge oh there we go okay wow that's two people in a row i actually producted on that that actually is a record oh here we okay so you just gotta rock on okay okay we are winning now like pretty handily like that's oh does this guy do anything except look in the sky with a sniper rifle for the words mr fruit he's like up target acquired pop doesn't miss dude really doesn't miss him oh oh oh oh i did it i did it that like never happens i procked both the arrows on them exploded one that exploded the other and then they all exploded killing both of them oh my god i've actually done it i actually wait why didn't i proc it i thought i would have well that little duble muerte immediately made this whole thing worth it i've done the impossible okay but now i gotta slay this sweet business final boss okay great yeah nailed it how about this you said whoop just trying to bend it like beckham here we go where's this guy hiding there you are wow wow that melted me i almost had a fighting chance or at least that's what the game made me want to think oh but you know what hey it's my turn to use a rocket launcher i get one shot with this thing excuse me you know what screw you i don't even know where that went i didn't even get wow i am useless i am just the worst okay i assisted now watch watch me get sniped out of the sky ready oh spacious skies here are my flaming hammers i hate you so take this demos you are so very dead let's go and i have crest alpha loopy which shields me a little bit and then pop your boy's kinda popping off 1v8 right there i still got a kill i was like you know what i'm gonna die but i'm going out in style you know what's bro i'm telling you this dude doesn't miss it's it's got honestly kind of getting sucks i think he's just really good but he is yet to not head shot me midair oh my god but oh l-m-a-o they got mercy couldn't be us yo get out my way i'm trying to okay perfect victor yo let's go i'm a real war something said to visit lord jackson tower am i what look i'm not gonna argue i'm just gonna do what the game tells me to do you're all probably waiting in baited anticipation is that the word what is that phrase waited with baited breath okay i guess that's the i could have sworn there was baited anticipation or something apparently baited b-a-t-e-d something like anxious or something so you're you're all eagerly awaiting to hear what i have to say essentially because obviously what i have to say about this game is queer i am clearly the source and the number one voice to listen to when it comes to all things stash am i right so listen up here uh right after i talk to shax what do you want from me oh reputation awards oh is this rank 16 oh okay well i got a cruise boy graham i got some upgrade modules yeah thanks okay uh cruise point graham what was this i know but i'm grabbing give them to me taku's divination may not know how to say it how to pronounce it but i do know how to use it despite what this video might have made you think okay hipfire ads hipfire 80s it's a sure shot granted you know again pvp wise like it's good you could just use a faster draw time bow and arrow if you want to shoot them twice and you could kill them quicker but it's not as stylish so you always have to keep that in mind style over everything else style greater than your mom tiku's divination greater than your mom and you use it [Music] so you
