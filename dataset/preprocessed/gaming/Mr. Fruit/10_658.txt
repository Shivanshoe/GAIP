high 81 monning's mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny to the guardian games have begun and with said event a brand new exotic has become available the heir apparent now why is it that we get a red Legion inspired Colossus looking exotic during Guardian games don't ask me its intrinsic trade a heavy slug thrower use alternate fire to spin up this weapon can be fired only when fully spun up and then it straight armor of the Colossus while at full health spending up this weapon protects you with an arc shield how's it gonna be in crucible I don't know that's what we're here to test will I go crazy attempting to actually get gameplay of this power weapon absolutely now a big thank you to Ryan claimer of anime thighs because we're not as wait a minute mr. Furth that's not your account as far as I'm aware yeah listen Guardian games we're exactly what I expected them to be which is to say they're not great it's just bounty simulator they said hey we're gonna we're gonna take away faction rallies because much like trials you know we just don't think it's there we're retool it and what they meant to say is we're just gonna reskin it Asgardian games and make it even more of a bounty ground this is fitting that we play on a red Legion theme map or cabal rather since I am cosplaying as a colossus now obviously the most important business to take care of is to look at it and would you leave that allow there's a little titan insignia I wonder if depending on which class you acquired it on it comes with that I don't know I like that oh look at all the reticle ready I got a warlock well what the fudge you mean it has that even work I'm a Titan right now I could do this all day do better I don't have any mo oh if I did right now oh you'd be

well for some reason the enemy just doesn't yeah no that's I mean what am i what am i what am I gonna do what am I gonna do you know for some reason the enemy is just allergic to the heavy ammo you know get that away from me and yeah you know fine cool give it to me if you don't want it I most certainly do one man's trash is another man's treasure even though that trash happens to be treasure so I don't really know why it's trash in the first place and I got a respect whatever it is this Titans attempting to do because it appears he's just trying to show the charge me over and over and over we got the ammo again let me spin up here let me get my overshield first this is amazing like seriously this is incredible oh shoot ok I kind of couldn't see from that range we got team shot what do you do it only makes sense though we were fraggin you know somebody had to put to a stop to us eventually the enemy team finally decided to wise up and realized one can take me down a whole army must do it okay I'm gonna be honest I haven't played Garden game so I don't understand why I'm getting laurels for every class that isn't the one I'm using perhaps somebody will have to enlighten me on on

slightest clue and I can't pretend like I do or that I can give you information that even remotely coincides or something in PvE involved that is up to people smarter than I and people actually play PvE to figure out that is that is not me for any of the above and we are burning my dudes hold on oh no now look don't my god oh well how about I just miss every shot here's what I know it goes in PvP and it hurts people and if you're in PvE it'll still go and shoot people and I just don't know how effective that'll be I mean obviously shooting people is what you want to do in PvE but DPS wise or whatever like is it worth it I don't know but I do know that i'ma work it let me work it 40 seconds till the ammo and give me that heavy ammo but I guess it's now power ammo me that power ammo I need to make some content right now the captain is this exotic juju just what did you shotgun me straight through my wall and now he gets the heavy no I refuse straight up there like what the fudge I threw
