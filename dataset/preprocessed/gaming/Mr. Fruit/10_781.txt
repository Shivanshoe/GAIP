with them battle trade do whatever right there right then invite them into a party play with them I'm stop just so excited you look so crisp so clean and I decided hey why not attempt the first dojo which is your first serious trainer with a buddy of mine in cached go in co-op show you guys some of that the battle system and everything honestly I'm in love so I really hope you guys do enjoy this but with that said please enjoy this video oh wait okay wait oh yeah you fighting somebody I'm fighting with you so what is this nestle looking thing B that's sick I haven't seen that I didn't even think about this so I need to reorder my party because I only get to bring the first three in my party and you only bring the first three in your party right right yeah cuz I was looking through my thing I was like wait I don't have a little Ally I need to change that out though cuz FOMO is I need to level am I just caught them yeah I love all the battle animations too though they're all very expressive yeah that's - I think it's because I'm part I'm electric and flying I think so it's neutral yeah I'm gonna hit whip lung actually I'm gonna chain lightning it only hurt you a little bit okay yeah that's fine that should kill Nessler though oh that's not fair wait what we just got comm electric synthesis what I was gonna say yeah so what Chang lightning hurt us healed itself with its hit and then I just oh my god dang Keys going down Dodge nuts these are 800 IQ bro so I'm saying they like crank the AI to smarter than me that's pretty easy hey come on no you don't me mad that times for them moly nothing okay bro can you leave my ganky alone dude I might die if we plumb targets me yeah Nestle did is overexerted though so you just focus Nestle I'll get with them yeah I'm trying to get those big yeah your buck but yeah whip lump is I think water air or water flying whatever they call it that's what I've tried to look up some of their typing and I need like the type chart cuz sometimes I'm like ah I lose straight up just because I don't know advantages all right let me swap up the squad here oh yeah cool so bottom right yeah it shows me my first three initials your first three then we're good to go oh okay Wow there were a lot of trainer battles in here too well that's what I've liked about the game I mean it's like it's punishing but like I think playing recent Pokemon games is just made me lazy because the thing is up until the dojo really I haven't done any wild battles I was just like I don't need to grind wild battles but ya know I need to yeah we can both - ruch oh wait oh if we both do this Arushi all is a synergy move and with a toxic Ally we poison the enemy for 4 turns alright so I I think you're a poison how I maybe I don't know you're Tyson I don't know I'm like maybe you're like flying grass maybe you're not darn it I've never gotten synergy move to use you have a poison attack but you're not typed as poison and I've tried that combo with that Kaku before and I didn't work I want to I want to get one of those one day you focus sokku oh and I'll I'll finish can you you can go back right oh yeah I can good ok I'll finish Nestle as long as I'm fast enough oh not this again is it gonna heal itself that is and I did ah Jesus man and what is this err specialist God do I know they're like they smell blood in the water Comanche singing man I feel like double snazzy would be good yeah he's really solid so maybe you finish but wait this grass today resists my fighting I don't know I'm not sure I'm super effective against both which is good yeah try and take out nests la I guess I'll hit sake because if we don't it's just gonna keep healing itself that is such a good strategy okay that was worried you weren't gonna the one sliver left yeah bro - she pulls right over there you you are free to hit him a little 19 now yeah I'll hit I'll finish off hopefully finish off soft come here oh I'm not currently do you have any grass moves you should be weak to that yeah I have one yeah wait wait wait wait cuz I want to say calvess is water talks I'm gonna heal honestly I think I need to yeah that's the other thing too is I'm having to actually use items almost every battle whereas I'm just so used to again like PO Glen's been holding my hand for so long now alright that I haven't even yeah well good god I thank God I healed Jesus I think I out speed gopher to Y and I'm gonna finish Calibos I might take a bunch of exertion damage here but I'm gonna poison them worse oh I should be able to do it I smell Z's supposed to be pretty fast so I think I'm fine easy oh Jesus I'm dead haha no now I won't even get the XP either Jesus bin yeah I got scale how is he I'm waiting for a new valve he's pretty solid I think there's plenty of them - that's for sure Mullally get some rest - i gets the brass per Nami bruh the tough part too is like since we're in coop if my guide downs in a fight and then we kill someone I'm not even getting XP like no one of Mines gain XP I might need to put Kaku away for now I gotta just go with my highest levels I think for this let's go down fresh blood does low Ally resist Electric Dino I I think it's neutral I'll just DC BM Saipan yeah yeah get a Mady later tank you know it'll take a little fella that's fine appreciate it it seems like there's a difference between special attack and attack stats but it seems like defense is just all around like it's not lowering defense or special defense at least from what I've seen here's a fun fact this attack we both have it it's super effective on both of us as well that's stuck in a cage match man that's so cool yeah that's the thing now like even early on before I even fought the first dojo almost every Turner has like evolved Tim Tim I'm like what the heck ran you wanna focus brownian wasn't effective another thing that blocks wind oh yeah I'll heal you just you just finish it what what is this dude they're just focusing I know they smell blood in the water yeah yeah Elias guy it is cool though that you've beaten the dojo but you can still do it with me yeah so I'm curious how exactly co-op works like if there's a cut off with like who you can play with or like your level cap yeah or if it's just I'd not go for it hit him with some wind blade man all right that's half damage good to knock ie I know my type matchups I don't know what you're talking about if this is two times I'm gonna be upset a defensive maneuver and helps with against poison no I think poison I read it it's like specifically it does like 10% of your health every time or something it's for its good after all yeah you've defeated all the advanced students of the dojo it's been some time since we had the tamer like you oh it's time to fight the dojo must uh oh wait okay they lied to me oh now they're the first lieutenant's yeah Wow it's gonna start getting a little hello yeah there's the friggin barn she broke jenkees four times so easy [Music] Hey get him outta here get a body well that's why it's so I hate I've been hitting Baddeley noses because almost all the Tim Tim you can get early on have types that are just disadvantaged event right yeah now finish off this Patrick haha Rock hey how's it feel getting focused okay well kind of it's honestly kind of nice in meditation you maybe love me and they're evolved do you get more experience I I want to say so but it seems like far and away the biggest difference is just level right and then obviously you get more XP for trainers than the wild oh that's conch that's what my scale will evolve to that's what I want go for the whip plump though if I I might 1-shot it but they're waiting oh well there we go nice Twilight love Electra dude or land there's like the four times you can get mmm level 20 let's go Genki I can probably survive ahead all right pretty tanky oh just realized yeah I'm gonna take damage your you're fine you're out I we got enough you can rest up easy are we like professionals pretty much oh let me a heal up real quick yeah if you use that ten essence it heals everyone and you can only use it out of battle let's go ahead and use that blue so it healed yours but didn't kill me so I have to use mine as well it's like oh well you can use your own resources which is actually nice to them do you want do you want to try to use some snazzy or smash you to start to do some synergy stuff cuz I've got an ability that buffs both of us using combination with a melee ally it also just has vigor for three turns so I think turn one will both go out with a show-off buff up and we either die heroes or become heroes do it don't don't even know what vigor does yeah I know I don't know why but it's gotta be good right fruit it's great to see you again I can't thank you enough for getting me out of the cage I'm here to challenge you let's get straight to it ah going everywhere and as if dealing with us wasn't enough proof your challenge you've also made it through the demo you've earned your right to fight me will be pleasure to fight you I've been in such a roid opponent long time here right please go easy at me she does she's what's a level five yeah she's like okay man [Music] hey looking good they're all we're even the same level alright let's go for the show up but I've got more health yeah you have one more help with the head ah he used it yeah Calabasas poison-type because I just got poisoned for four turns more attack cuz you're gonna get a tie from from your show-off attack and your other one yeah Oh God look he's buffs attack Plus and then okay so now I I get bigger or no oh I get attacked as well and yeah it was going up oh yeah you can see the status condition next to like my poison and yours the three whatever that is stamina costs decreased by 50% whoa that's what a vigor does that's pretty cool I'm going for it loelai yeah sure because what we've we've both got at least plus 2 or plus 3 attack right now yeah oh well hey why don't you get some more later that's pretty good that's that's all right I guess yeah talk about synergy don't forget lo just heal up show off again yep you might want to oh oh the poison no but the synergy it was worth it the spar easy oh that's not that's not good for you yeah let's go for mercy first oh jeez I hope you're faster I hope we're faster otherwise might be bad I can't I don't know we I think wind attacks are weak like yeah I think they're half a peck them I think all right yeah what's your other one low Ally oh do you know what maybe maybe a lot yeah Peck's a priority move Tessa prison isn't as powerful though so at least you got that going for it put your slow I've got you don't worry man oh boy alright I would yeah I would say either heal or swap and I'll try and finish spars II should finish it so I don't hit on me but I'll survive you're gonna be fine oh yeah and then Calibos is also probably targeting you which is great force Massie oh all right you can you can Peck them though it should be nothing because even with your slower speed the priority on it should be enough I am gonna heal though I feel like ferrets also pretty fast so yeah I hope you kill it no way Oh dad what Oh uh-huh you're fine you're fine unless yeah Wow okay so you're down to one we got to make sure you stay alive worst case - you can always use revives right pick up eka is just flying I think yeah you can use your electric guy Newcomb yeah well and Calibos I'm probably gonna swap out - genki I don't know if I lose my attack buffs but it's fun I'm swapping out yeah he's so cute yeah one over the next form is if there is another form there is I'll take that easy I'll get some rest that's right okay I'm gonna chain lightning shouldn't hurt you much but they're both weak okay let's pray oh yeah beautiful yeah I didn't do much damage to me yes II imagine if like I was over here using Chang lightning and you were over there with that guy that absorbs electricity right the possibilities what is this thing oh shoot that that thing is I saw somebody have the shiny version of that it's like gold it's crazy do you happen to know what type it is I do not know so only one way to find out then actually should I just take it you toxic it I'll take out pick a peg okay we can just take out whatever is next to it and believe it alone okay pick a peck is sturdier than I thought it must be a water type you're well kinky you served us well that didn't do as much damage as I would hope but it's nice consistent I'll take out pick a peck you can okay finish the job I'm worried that her ice is gonna be super effective well no because there's not an ice type ice types or ice moves they're still water okay at least yeah from what I was reading I don't know if this oh it's resistant okay I got to use this them whoa oh oh my that all just killed me No oh my god so apparently that tsunami 2 with the water or with some sort of bonus it freezes people - what oh my god yeah well it is almost dead and it's either gonna overexert or have to stop anyway so right yeah we're faster than it so should be good enough I think freakin nuked my scaled Oh God alright so twice probably gonna use that like double attack I'm gonna need to use an item I'm gonna use a tonic to heal my stamina and my health yeah it's good oh finish off oh sure right there yeah geez I didn't know it gave that much Oh what I think it was funny was so what yeah see umbrella so it is a water move well that helps oh now you have the bonus tag I wonder what a cheese God ice or frozen must just like have your speed or something yeah cuz I should definitely way faster yeah I'm gonna just heal here I don't want to die too young [Music] there's still another temp time coming so oh no no this is the last one so we're almost there and the good news out is it has to overexert so now we just give it away is there 1v1 I think it is yeah it is you're you're the lat oh my god this is insane man oh well you're fine you're fine rest up I'm not gonna get let the poison do the work well that was a great battle that's a great as I'm over here just holding all my dead tipped em like they're tough but like that's honestly I enjoy that way more like every battle I have to actually think about what I'm doing [Music] [Music]
