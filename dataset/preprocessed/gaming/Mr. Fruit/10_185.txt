thank you for that explanation uh i'm claiming this as a dream team corner the dream team corner this is the dream team corner yeah this part of the tower why is there four i guess it honestly it's pretty appropriate considering no one ever goes here yeah that's what that's what i was thinking this is where we can meet up and nobody will try and join our lobbies yeah i mean that hasn't been a problem in like four years so yeah i wouldn't know it's time to christen this oh yeah get on in here rob grab those hips don't be sure go into the future oh what all right whatever don't be shy what's
