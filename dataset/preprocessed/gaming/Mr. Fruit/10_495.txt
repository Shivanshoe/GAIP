heidi everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to among us well actually it's this awesome mod we found inside of trouble and terrorist town so they recreated the scaled map which is the spaceship map and among us and they even managed to recreate some of the tasks so we decided to try and play regularly among us inside of this mod in trouble and terrace town obviously it's a little scuffed but we had a whole bunch of fun and if you're unfamiliar with treble and terrace town then might i point you to our trouble and terrace town playlist we've played a lot in the past it's one of our favorite games and odds are if you like among us you'll probably enjoy those all right that's right it's oh jesus really we're running out of oxygen lights are out this is a great start oh god where's oxygen oxygen is this way i'm gonna turn it on detectives with me i feel a little safe all right good job team good job team it's a good start i need to get to the actual objectives but someone just what what's happening does somebody get oh they're shooting freaking asteroids god it threw me off and someone just got in de-yeted sounds like feels bad all right well until someone calls the body there's not much i can do so i'm just gonna bop and pop yeah somebody shot the launcher after he said meeting [Music] okay so you're gonna i'm literally we'll see this is metagame i came to the kitchen i see bless running and i see a waluigi flying straight at him at me i'm not blessed who there's someone running right here i thought was another pink person i heard the waluigi launcher i heard it yeah there's there's two of them out here over there i'll tell you where the body is all right it was over there i mean we can see them they're both right there um i don't think it was fruit because i saw him doing the wires at navigation and i don't feel like he could have killed someone over there and if he did he would have had to hoof it yeah there's no way i was i was in electrical i flipped on the lights and i did my task in there okay i did i didn't see you go that way on the right side while i was doing the cables next to um what's a reactor i was by myself the entire time now i want to say when i was shooting asteroids i saw the indeed from above i also there's four people here that love destiny blue bless mr fruit and daddo love that those four are i will never well all right blue is completely unaccounted for so that's kind of sauce well could he be dead he's right here please right here i'm voting [Music] all all right like disrespect all right all right all right blue wessel was ejected man it really did be like that oh what are you is that even fair is that legal what the fudge nobody truck was like right in front of me he really just let me die like that all right so it's definitely ab i don't think it's datto body body body body body body uh uh uh report cafeteria everybody did you find a body is it the same well whoa which body did you find i think it's well it was fruit it was fruit and i witnessed don't even look at me i think it was versus i think he came down from the turret were you shooting asteroids no i didn't shoot any asteroids tattoo you were up there then right i was i went up saw blue get heated off and then i came down here i didn't do anything who was up there for an extended period of time i left immediately okay baloney i wish i looked at the color better but yo i saw the dead body it's up at the turret i went up to go do uh uh shoot the asteroids i went to go get a gun this is the gun i got wait where did we shoot astronauts like is there not like a room like in the north like you know in the first game yeah that's kind of sauce asteroids asteroids it's like up there where we threw the body oh yeah yeah that i didn't even know that so is that where you killed him bless self-reporting it was not me it was not me it was not me i know it look it was not me oh it's so hard to trust those cheeks it was not me i think i could vouch for daddo because i saw him like uh wherever i was okay uh i'm voting to skip but i'm i'm obsessed with these two i swear it okay versus a necklace okay i'm about to skip too i'm almost done with my test all right all right i'm gonna do uh asteroids all right bless had the right instinct but then apparently he didn't know we'll see surprises no one's tailing ab this is not a good look for datto tap's like no no because the thing is of abstract [ __ ] doesn't it there's it there's still a lot of tasks we don't do the wires do the wires down you're almost done yeah yeah oh but wait a second he's making sure there's no witnesses sharks like bro yo emergency meeting shark do it you know you know what to do he's doing it maybe he's not he's trying to catch ab in the act there's no kill cool oh well this is how it dims without any kill cooldown and posture op literally just bless he can't even fight back so i'm gonna say this one's done he's not even killing the asteroids all right ab just yeah here it comes he's really going to do blessed like this i knew i should have voted for purses it was damn it no cool yeah seriously like i literally hear versus kill someone in the other room and then immediately comes to me and i'm like man we never put that really sucks to be able to not shoot him did you did you hear the one punch man music or something yeah i did i was like oh well someone's dead that was going to look forward to impossible to shoot dude i am the phantom which means i'm still innocent however if an imposter kills me i get to haunt them which means it's gonna be super obvious who all they have to do is go to the vote screen and be like hey dude why are you like glowing well it's just my natural it's actually the face cream i use you wanna know you wanna know about it i can i have a referral code done five tasks left while we're killing it i really don't think there's any tasks in here it's hard to tell where the don't what the boy get away from me dork indeed someone already did shield sounds neat well what oh are someone trying to shotgun asteroids oh jesus we're all done for it sounds like it's right thanks to me though the 3d audio is uh little weird the z-axis is that which one it is i don't actually know it's also been real quiet i'ma see where everyone is i got someone cafeteria although that could be asteroids someone electrical someone cafeteria no oh that didn't sound good oh boy shark keep looking for bodies although he's a detective he would have definitely seen something at least there's one imposter oh body butter cafeteria i've got a dead thick boy right here oh no it's versus oh now shark i have a question for you okay the game says you're detective but why did you run past this body i did not see the body um what my ui didn't say there was a body near so i didn't see it i got it was right in reactor you just ran right by it oh i was doing the gasoline did you see anyone did you run by anyone uh wait sure the body but no i didn't see it no i didn't see it yeah but i thought and i saw dano around there he he did see me fill it up yeah i thought was that was that actually working is that actually a thing i don't think so i was gonna be like damn that's smart if it is what on both your end and so like i went to storage and grabbed like the gas like put it in the the little thing engine thing i don't know all right do we have anything yeah nothing i think it might be a self why would i self-report in this game when i could so easily just go on a murder spree i don't know because shark said he saw you and daddo i saw shark as i was passing electrical and i went by right in reactor i see the body and shark shark did you hear any shooting or anything where i was no yeah this was a silent kill oh what the fudge all right somebody needs to scan me i need to see if somebody will scan me they might just kill me i need to get somebody's attention i might just die okay lights are back on though let me get somebody's attention ah fudge oh my god oh my god body body all right well the detective's dead and that's crazy i know exactly who it is it's rob andor what yep i was at fan cams and then i was going to bottom reactor door closes sharks approach me as the door closes i hear him die across the door door opens who is it but rob and dork and then i'm looking for the body before they can kill me and i report it and that was it i did see rob and doric standing together and i thought a body died upstairs so i initially thought it wasn't them but that does corroborate your story because they were standing together when i saw them hey you just shot me what rob just teleported i'll never let you take me alive this he's going off script he's go oh my god he broke the code he's in these vents right here no he's not well one of them i hit him for 95. where is he is that what's going on it's torque and rob dork's hiding in the vents they got caught and rob dipped all right just do your task because dork's just gonna hide dude i don't know where the other tasks are i'm gonna try to live on this asteroid here let's all go help him with the asteroid it's just one single asteroid [ __ ] is it is it left or right uh there's one left one right here wait did we actually finish our task no detective and scuffed among us and among us i meant to teleport to where i set the first location i had but then christian saw me and then it didn't teleport me and then it teleported me right back under the bus no it wasn't it just kind of happened that way i thought you knew i'm the detective even though i just want to be the buster but of course just like normal among us that never happens uh this cannon yeah this really is a true one to one recreation that's crazy i don't know how he did it but he still managed to bone me even in oh that's red i couldn't tell which one was grounded which one is this blue yeah and this one is pink that means that one's just whatever color is left let's get it oh i got a still ugg i think this door remains closed for x amount of time i don't know and i also don't know what all the tasks are like what the um somebody uh i'm calling a meeting i'm calling meetings okay i'm running i i heard that i heard it yeah oh well i guess this is where the body is i'm here in the cafeteria the district in the cafeteria all right so i came in here i heard just like the stock i came over here here's this body and then there was a blue jelly bean over here that put a smoke nade on it and that was dork wait so wait are we voting dork then he's not here wait versus is that too what did he do i'm telling you it's dork wait dork's behind the yeah wait a second wait a minute i'll take a number three don't you do it dork don't go don't do it all right we voted okay all right all right good detective don't do it he opens it up like not like this you were like a brother to me where the fudge are these other tasks dude i really there's like wires oh where i really don't know dude no shields i don't think there's one in comms at all nothing i can interact with all the pieces look the same anyway nothing obviously there's still asteroids i mean there's something up here they didn't expect me to hardcore parkour like this a little did they know i'm a gamer wait well it's funny because little did the killer know i was above him the whole time literally in the room watched him shoot down bless and i was literally talking about oh tech no one's going to know i'm here and as i say that datto guns bless down dana do you have anything we're just going to make stuff up now we're just going to make up mr standing on some things well no here's what i'm going to say is that i was doing asteroids with shark yeah body was called exactly so that only you and we all saw fruit do med base scans so we know he's innocent i'm gonna let you go on your own terms daddo will you please walk up those stairs and jump off the ledge please don't do it don't oh he's got a bomb wait no he's teeping he just trying to like crawl away like really stupid i thought that was a blonde body somebody threw a goddamn incendiary [Music] you
