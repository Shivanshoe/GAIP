raise a bunch of money for charity every medal we dunk during this time our team that is we get more money raised for charity so what that turns out to be is just what is the most optimal way to farm metals it's not well that's not fun but we finally decided screw it this isn't fun we weren't even playing as a whole group so we did some master wellspring and that was a little more fun so i'll show
