heidi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to more dead by daylight if you saw our last video which was like five years in the making i hadn't played it in a while you know that i played with some people who knew what they were doing unlike myself and so they thought let's get mr fruit to be the killer so we can embarrass him joke's on them i'm a natural-born friend enjoy the video who are you gonna be well there's two people i have four choices what perks should i take as a hunter uh i would grab barbecue and chili okay what that'll do is when you hook someone it'll show where everyone else is on the map that's nice um do we want to give him nurses calling you can't like just tracking perks in general just give him the a really op build for hunters two people are working on a generator at the same time i mean now that we know that okay uh probably deer stalker will help you out a little bit okay that that means if somebody is laying on the ground you'll be able to see them that way you don't accidentally lose somebody on the ground and then as far as the last one goes i mean personally i think noed is always funny it means if we get all the generators done you'll be able to just click us one time and we'll die what are the what are the add-ons for the hatchery i should take um probably one i don't remember don't give him the don't give nothing iridescent wouldn't be fun but the one that makes it so that he throws them faster and has more hatchets uh if you like hover over you can sort of check so what i would do is infantry belt it'll give you two extra hatchets uh and then try flour babushka that'll make it so that uh like the wind-up time is less so that you'll be able to throw them a little more quickly okay great that should help you out a little bit what uh what killer did you choose apparently the huntress oh oh she's spooky is that the one that hums it is oh that's like oh that is spooky instead of like immediately hearing the heartbeat like you did with uh the other killers you'll hear her humming first like off in the distance so it's uh it's pretty it's pretty unnerving it's atmospheric [Music] i don't think that's the kind of sound she makes but sure take a look at that buddy rabbit apparently she sounds like [Music] so all i do is just like hatch it right i don't need to worry about pretty much oh you can also use mouse one just to hit people with the axe i don't know why uh why are you supposed to be scared of boobs though you hear that oh here oh god my god oh what the left click after right click oh what the fudge yeah so you wind up with right click and then you click yeah what a hitbox i got you got you bb you cannot escape me yeah ah what the [ __ ] i blinded oh ow nice you can use the flashlight to blind where'd you run off to over there [Music] i'm sure there's no way he'll figure out where we went hey don't be mad at that generator hey i'm mad at you i'm not here don't worry about it don't worry it's fine now you may think i'm up here but i'm definitely not i promise [Music] my plan here is pretty much just to make you dizzy i'm just going to keep ready to round in circles because i'm a boater can quick heals it's fine oh god oh i got you versus oh thank you it sounds like we're actually all okay now yeah oh yeah i'm the hunter of course hi uh actually hundreds up there what yeah i'm trying to say oh oh my god okay hear me hear me again hear me again give me again oh i get inside and heal me get inside me i love it get inside get inside and i'll heal you inside get inside get inside yeah yeah keep going inside there definitely is no killer going up the stairs oh i'll take one of those though yeah you can get more hatchets when you go to the locker fruit yeah very fun i needed some hey bonus where are you uh for the generators walked by i really shouldn't be so honest he just looked at me like disappointed break it down screw you i'm a hatchback i'm a hatchet oh god told you the truth i was right behind you y'all check this out oh wait check this out oh throwing knife check that out oh god check out these jukes i like that your troops just included you teabagging in front of him come here boy dark i'll save you you know i warm this up just for you here you go i'm going to save you shark please [ __ ] i'm next to the shark i'm going to get him yeah you should grab him i'm grabbing him right now you don't have any more hatchets i'm calling your bluff okay shark i got something for you i'm joking yeah [Music] you will not escape me run run run run run run wait wait hello to the basement never run into the basement i'm going to try something unique here i don't know if it's going to work i support it i support it you see what i'm going for yeah big jenny quit moaning so much man huge he just wants to do it he watched you do it he watched you do it [Music] huge flash i don't know what's happening but it sounds really fun there were fireworks i hate everything oh my goodness nice pop flash shark so so the reason he didn't die there is because i got a perk called borrowed time i don't want to hear it if i save him off the hook it gives him what it does it says when you're a boner you're a boner okay that's what that does i believe that is the official perk description yeah pretty sure it is i hate you don't do it miss fruit please it wouldn't be me no remorse no shame he did actually he's puppy guarding me do it uh shark how close is your generator i thought i was supposed to have a purge i'm good i'm like over halfway on mine

give you some you want something ah no where are you guys here he wants some oh no here's oh did he not he didn't see you he didn't see you why are you running away [Music] i may have made a mistake by giving him good perks yeah i don't know what you're talking about but thank you sure what do we do find the skull that's on fire somewhere there is a skull on fire yeah it's like a little little totem where'd you go who doesn't know what that means stupid not to me simple [Music] but if he touches you one time you die i'm dead boys i'm dead this is my third one you're going to be fine rob
