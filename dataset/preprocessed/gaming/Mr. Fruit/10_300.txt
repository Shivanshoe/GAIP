hey do you hold everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome to this bloody video we're playing chivalry 2. i'm sorry i pull out this terrible action every time i play a medieval game chevrolet 2 cross bladed blader wow okay i pull out the action and i can't even english there was a cross-play beta recently i got a little bit of gaming in this game is so much fun can't wait for the full release it's it was meant for me quite frankly like i didn't make it nor invest in it but if i were to make my own game it would be sure so dilly dilly i don't know if that's copyrighted they can't right surely this oh okay anyway enjoy the video my fellow peasants i need the chaos of battle 64 player mixed mods 40 player free-for-all no we're going into large-scale warfare you know there's there's that shame i might just be making this up i'm probably just making this up pulling out of my butt the more people there are the less impact an individual has on the battlefield you know ten thousand soldiers against ten thousand soldiers and your single skill isn't going to matter that much so that's what i'm thinking 64 isn't quite as much as you know large-scale medieval battles but it's enough that hopefully my team will carry me let's do this man a good start wait wait i don't even know if i got that kill oh i got that one though yo come here oh sorry friends sorry i'm just swinging and
