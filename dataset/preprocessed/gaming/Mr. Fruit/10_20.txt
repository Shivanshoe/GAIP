talking about you peed get your ssd on your bladder well i mean we get second and then we uh see who's the best kisser oh yeah i'm down yeah i appreciate you opening up but i'm good yeah let's uh let's unpack that let's let's end there also blue you realize you you should you're competing with rob right now he has more points but instead you came over you over here i'm the last that's the point you want to stop rob you're giving rob the most why am i here by myself i can't do this by myself yes i can i have a gallon one there's any diamond you're fine dang i wanted that to be a weapon i need to res that oh my god thanks mr fruit you're welcome see you albert well if you had some anti-barrier anti-barriers stupid let them know dude i'm not a big fan of champions either but you know it's just a terrible mechanic he's terrible but it's just a little overused over time champions are definitely over overused yeah i'd like a a new way like like i think we talked about it legendary witch queen campaign wasn't it didn't have any champions and that was still fun and challenging uh i'm fighting for the life out here you know i needed the handicap did you guys not grab the other one we already dunked him dude are you sure about that oh blue what'd you do okay well blue had it no all blue stuff yeah oh my god you're still actually the worst you're like you're cringe you're so cringe i can't keep up dude what this i'm this is a different side uh i'm getting last on this one and you know what that's okay maybe i get the rng point oh jesus so you go kill everything bring the unstoppable to kill me that's yeah that was kind of the intention i'm assuming no rob please ride me don't give blue satisfaction rob he's gonna win dude you think res points is going to just say if i win by 175 remember that i don't even know who this blue westlow is man he's changed ever since he started playing ff14 man listen dude there's one challenge i can win so i'm gonna do my best to actually win it because lord knows i'm not gonna win all their other ones okay well call that out when he's closer when you lose by 350 you just remember that my brother and shrieker christ yes and of course he steals the you're literally you're literally winning that and gaining the thing at our expense it's like you don't care about us so no so yeah you have to die along your board you don't care i'm just not going to yeah i'll do i want to do what needs to be done for my people god that's true the warlocks do need love because they are at last right now so at least he's in last and not like second if daddo didn't have something against warlocks and blue specifically i think he would have picked two to win this is cornwall chuck norris this is cornball man hey there's a barrier guy over there can you guys like do your thing who knew who knew this is what competitive pbu looked like i'm sweating my nuts no wonder it's not an esport this is like i'm like focusing way more on this than i was on the uh pvp i hate it stop this is this is bullying yeah it is i never said i was above it all right from the top stupid eddie gallowan ammo where did it go look at this he has i can see the smile behind that face that mask dude this it's disgusting and i swear to god the entire every wesler just wants all the ai are shooting me they're just ignoring blue it doesn't make any sense how much did you pay them enough clearly oh god here we go see you got the kill there mr fruit i did something oh this is our moment we can kill things oh what frisbee not this dude please please please please thanks see rob's a homie rob what's wrong with that i tea bag at the same time so give me tea bags you won't rise them when you want to and when we don't want you to resonate whose team are you on what he's just thinking about being at home i'm just trying to break this strike how would you know what that's like and to kill crota and omnigul you're gonna win but it what he knows the lore too like you're over here taking big fatty elves and rob just the big dog you're like crota's right nut the least favorite nut hey can you make some orbs so i can get super oh my god thanks big guy jumping off this [ __ ] the scarlet appreciate you how do you sleep at night the sad thing is probably probably soundly easily not a great sleeper i will randomly fall asleep in places though so i you know that doesn't sound healthy sounds dangerous it's not it's not but alas here i am sassy vodkas don't worry my grenade's not gonna kill anything nothing's running into it i don't know if i'm getting killed stop like there's a knight and there's three of us and he's like shoot miss fruit oh god oh god no it's fine i'm fine i'm fine i'm not mad about it oh god i forget you guys can just press g and kill him what uh thumb mouse button four for me thumb mouse button four what's wrong with you that's some that's some that's some sociopath that's that's some [ __ ] real kill come on man that ain't that weird is it that weird uh kind of a little bit it's comfortable for me i don't actually know what i have g bound to but it's something maybe actually it's not i don't know that's just so far over there joey thanks for the raid i'm gonna miss you buddy have fun in tennessee you'll be the only 10 i see there oh god no no damn why don't i get any points for objective stuff i love how we were spent we're like trot like you guys were trying harder in this than like in crucible yeah and it's i'm not even getting well i was taking it casually first game suddenly it's i don't hear a thing everyone's killing things i'm like oh oh fine i mean i'm i i i i was talking i was just muted i survive off of you guys banter and i just come in on it but it's hard to like uh it's hard to make jokes while i see coding all around me it's hard to focus coding what are you talking about because he's because he's like i get it now yeah i'm in flow state right now i'm not this is all i want after that now after that game it's kind of just like well now we just i think i'm the only one you have stasis oh you get okay well when you lose by uh 520 you could you could arrest me for 30 seconds you lose you could have reached me for 30 seconds i don't hear about it this 525 is going to matter i don't want to hear i don't want to hear it and i don't want to hear you neither did you score so what yeah i saw that coming from a mile away mainly i just want to get second so we don't have to figure out a tiebreaker i want to get a palum jones to drop because then i win stop thinking about girls i claim them dibs dips all of them dibs on these rooms there are three of us and they both shoot me this is cringe oh oh here i here you go i got you guys i mean thanks i guess i don't know if i feel good about it watch out boys oh here she comes she's a servant of crowder there are a lot of things in here i'm gonna like he's doing the thing he's learning anymore orbs am i the only one shooting at the boss you see these bullets flying over here i just don't oh i got some special enough dude oh nice and biz oh okay really it's funny because you complimented me all right i'm coming raising up my homies and they're putting me down or rather keeping me down now that one i might just keep you in there and let you think about what you just did i think i couldn't even go in you know what i want you to take a lap think about it take a lot big guy you think what you just about what you just did what the [ __ ] why don't you take a lap and think about what you've done we got gold nice oh so i got you guys somebody did bring unstoppable it's me if you're not good but what will you do about the second one poop my pants just a regular ogre oh my god i'm gonna die i'm gonna die no you're not i'm gonna die no you're not i'm gonna die this is literally free real estate where you right now it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't feel free don't die it doesn't feel like you actually you actually understand feel free you can respawn get me out of here screw you oh no i did not see you no i didn't mean to punch you i'm sorry i'm sorry i didn't mean it i didn't mean it i didn't mean it please please please i got it oh let's go i got an enhancement prism please give me a weapon palindrome how i don't know it's all fun i don't even know like hashtag your mom am i right boys don't even think i got a gun yes hey you're pretty up there mr fruit yes and think about it if i'd played at the beginning actually why do i even try i mean but did i try it this time well from your words yet you were talking about how you've never tried so hard in your life good sorry i'm really happy that you guys figured that out now hand me my ball gag okay well here you go big guy i got you the hello kitty one you like so much with the cool penguin on it dude that's right i always thought he was the coolest hello kitty character i'm out of here oh i got three i got three titles yeah jeez i got three i got one oh awkward classy encounter okay that's that's always there uh always yeah okay yeah we got four pull okay four four hip fire grip uh and hey don't forget about uh light mag you know uh these guns are quite heavy so light mag goes a long way all right uh let's check out blues on that note hey daddo so we got a couple good ones we got steady hand surrounded okay we got city hands one for all you likes and then we got grave robber one for all okay uh and for me let's find out the first one we've got thread detector surrounded okay perpetual motion or grave robber turnabout of yours of your three uh maybe uh perpetual motion vorpal for pvp the threat detector surrounded is like some neat synergy but like i've never really been crazy about that yeah um very niche thank you rob so perpetual who had perpetual motion vorpal that would be me okay so that is it was not that is mr fruit that was me okay fruit so that's a pretty good pvp roll it's pretty up there in terms of uh roll quality i'll give you that blue had grave robber one for all now i do like that one probably the most for for pve purposes because it has one for all and grave robbers like not the worst um especially on this gun i'm not even in contention i'm assuming uh what was your other gun rob one more time uh focus fury dynamic sway okay rob that that is a a decent roll but focus fury on it on a submachine gun in the mod socket there's a 20 bill mod socket you get to um for a pvp title i got ricochet rounds extended barrel or full bore so yeah rob i gotta say you're probably out of the running even with my friend mr jefferson in the mall yeah even with mr jefferson what about mr lincoln he wants to come in and have some fun no i'm incorruptable uh yeah it's not bad rob what's the fun in an uncorruptable it's not gonna be a back to back um ooh man if if we're going overall i feel like i need to go with the gun that's gonna give me the most amount of value across all activities and in that case it's the perpetual motion vorpal yes because once for all yes in in pvp and yet it is significantly better in pve than his role it is better in pvp uh e than his role yes but if i'm being forced to do overall if i'm being forced to do overall i would say perpetual motion for pole wins again by a little bit i would prefer your role blue because i would use it for pve more and i just wouldn't use it in pvp at all but i'm being forced just say you hate me i don't hate you just tell me you hate me right now to my face say it blue as a consolation prize yeah yeah send you some cookies oh he only accepts pokemon cards but look you guys are forcing me to do overall you're not doing a pvp and a pve roll that's true well then i would give another half point to blue if that's on the docket but it never was but but he's a little whiny so we we give him half so you get another half point blue so great i have one point current total i missed fruit in the titans with five blue and the warlocks with four and robin the hunters with two dream team summer games 2022 finale i'm just glad it's finally gotten to my section the part where i thrive easily the most easy like you guys are gonna have to be chasing me around while i bank these notes yeah we asked you like rob you're gonna choose one and he's like why are you even asking dude gambit is like you guys already know because there's so many things to choose from in destiny after you do crucible and strikes you know there's a plethora of things to choose from and i went with what i think i specialize in which is what gambit you and your friend drifter you guys are tight i think you guys specialize that in that one just as probably way harder than i do honestly yeah that's actually pretty true i don't i don't stand a chance i suspect a little too hard into that one yeah it's like you guys spec way harder than that one that's right a little i spec a little it's the finale it's gambit two games scoreboard position as per usual we got a random and yes he will affect the scoreboard so if he gets third that means we could have a one two four you know what i'm saying so yahoo i just thought of a terrible scenario you get first blue gets second i get last we're all five points yeah but then it comes down to rng but then oh my god if that happens i swear actually i kind of want to do that i kind of want to throw now so finger flashing on the field what tool we use in the day i don't think i don't think you know that no i don't oh i do like here i'll use it in a sentence oh no mr fruit can finger blast his wife okay yeah but i didn't need that that reminds me i was at one game night and i won't say names because you finger blasted someone i don't think they watch but it's still but yeah i was saying something made a joke like dude i bet you having no sex and like everything just got really serious he's like and he's just like dude you have no idea like like it was something and something happened so i was like dude you guys probably like super vanilla all you ever do is missionary and then he just like breaks that but then it gets real he's like dude we're freaky dude like we i'm like okay no that's i didn't it was just like i don't need to know i don't need that's cool i'm glad i'm happy yeah like if i told you you wouldn't believe me i'm like that you're right you're right yeah that's good yeah yeah man yeah keep the keep the flame alive dude happy for you what the hell were you playing to like make that kind of joke like i think we were playing the cuphead game i think oh that game's fun how far yeah um i don't think as far as we went or no maybe a little bit but anyway it's like the really fast like die rolling and something like that and so he was like fumbling around and just having trouble and so it's like something along the lines of like just not he wasn't creative enough or something so like yeah the whole thing and then i'm like i regret this i just imagine like i think everyone's like cracking and it's like you probably guys only do missionaries he's like you didn't you don't know and for some reason everyone else did they're like in a tragic missionary act is he only ever the missionary you know there goes 15 knots but this is all according to playing rob just win and we're all tied up i'm trying to all right all right all right of course dude the entire thing and he goes for me first uh i'm too busy talking about my friend's sex life dude how am i supposed to manage but actually i'm not i'm not in this at all it's been funny if claire's like at least they have sex or something like babe i thought himself in the mirror and he's like all right babe i'm done rob you're so cringe you better kill the entire team i should kill the entire team what if i don't waste it wasted potential and probably only well we all know that we all know rob's favorite thing yo so i have a question here and ironically have you guys asked what well you already know the answer to rob yeah dude like did you remember that in the face he has an acquired taste like what's the oh no sure but like un-ironically like yeah never like gone for the stink hole showing them the the the stinky the give them give them the little stinky pinky giving them the okay no we get we get it you get it i get it yes slapping the the slack of the gap i don't think anybody says on behalf of everyone please stop poop loop in the soup loop you know what i mean someone might say that someone might not us no we haven't washed it yet i mean ain't looking great but we don't watch him ultimate did my bullets just disappear on that dude i'm grabbing heavy can we just play with the mud flaps blue just asked if you play with blood flaps yeah yeah if you ever just nice it goes full circle i'm doing everything i can to do nothing but also everything's huge that does heal prime evil take down that prime evil we're gonna win oh god they're bursting i don't think they're their dps phase we lost oh okay well we tried i guess all right scoreboard come on i actually don't know how the score works for gambit so i think it's most no i mean it's just screw me oh no third it is modest [Music] that game went really quick yeah it was sick not as quick as me nevermind what nothing dude hey many women have come out and said guys you're too obsessed with with last long you know sometimes they don't need that sometimes they prefer explosion mcluge you know that sounds like that sounds like copious i should also probably stop because at this point the entire the entire video has only been sex so i'm just gonna change i'm just gonna change it we're doing a 180. um what's the purest thing i can think of cupcakes sure have you had cupcakes recently or you know what let's talk desserts there's definitely no gameplay to talk about because it's gaming i have banned claire from getting these klondike ice cream cones she keeps getting um because she's well she's like yeah they're for me except she keeps buying them because she doesn't eat them yeah because i eat them and i keep telling her i do not have self-control if it is there i can't help myself how many of you how many they're so yummy um i've had up to three a day three oh my gosh that's a lot of ice cream they're only 250 calories so it could be way worse but still like 750 calories that's like half my calories for the day so neil should say i've been doing very well i'm gonna die i'm like babe you got stuff she she and then she buys these cinnabon things oh my gosh what do you mean by that they're like these things there's somebody gets it everybody gets it god damn it now everyone's just going for moats the secret the team yes yes i'm banking the moats brother everything hurts brother please don't hurt me brother hey you hate that they just shoot a rocket at you and you die welcome to gambit brother oh yeah yeah you cringe tonight not gonna get any of those the cringe night not the green knight the green dude will you die thank you jesus oh we got enough to bank brother worst i'm i'm so last oh wait it disappeared why did it disappear i have no ammo i gotta grab that heavy no no no no no no no they're covered out we got him we got him he's dead let's focus that prime evil brother maybe after we kill the uh that's fine actually you know what i'm going in dpsing boys good luck i gotta make sure they don't get the next phase let's get the heavy stupid stupid ah um how many good jolly horns do we got cheese that's the secret mr fruit this whole game mode is geller horn they nerfed the tracking i'll be there and other people yo we want a gambit game brothers we banked them my depression is slightly lower i got two weapon drops that time let's go my depression through the roof let's go congratulations mr fox yeah congrats mr fruit wait what was final i don't know i think i got third last so i got four total you win all right shut the [ __ ] up rob was close okay i was close i was rob got five okay i mean we don't really have to ah sometimes when i poop i piss myself it doesn't happen sometimes when i piss i let a little turtle come out my butt shut up man i mean vomiting now yeah now you're just like you're like michael scott you don't know where i just kind of let it ride let it flow all right we need to light the dado torch one last time tattoo torch [Music] uh a snorri fr5 on milan fluid dynamics frenzy stats for all wow ducks infused enhanced battery uh chamber combustor and small bore hey if it's up to me that wins rob uh we got the crowd pleaser it's you uh that was actually my nickname in uh high school uh quick draw uh genesis uh high explosive ordnance augmented drum quick launch and uh that one linear compensator yep uh invader demolished perpetual motion alloy magazine small bore and night mag fun so what do we think data um uh i would say maybe either the snorri or the uh the herrod potentially okay doesn't look too bad um i'm not blown away by anything though feels bad i'm not blown away let's take a look at uh blue next trust me this is it uh four times the charm turnabout and skip over that one perpetual motion turnabout yep skip over that one this is pretty much good we got grave robber focus focus all right yeah much like rob i'm i'm not blown away so let's see that means we're in here i got steady hands snapshot thoughtless okay and perpetual motion rampage red bag go for yourself with accurized rounds oh with the sidearm keep that in mind sorry i'm sorry i i i got it in mind um the thoughtless is not too bad the false is not too bad it's very you know it's it's for the handling it's for the handling wizards yeah because uh hover over steady hands again and so it kills give you more uh handling oh and even more handling yeah um that's incredible that's incredible of everyone it's probably one of the stronger selections but again if if i'm judging things on pve and pvp you know pve wise like that thing is ah dog wow none of these are really that good at all across everybody oh you guys got f'd on rng it's about time um yeah all those god rolls we got you know can i award zero points if that's what you're the judge i mean yeah you're the judge if you want like it's i'm i'm i'm speechless at how incredibly bland and beige everything is here wow that's what people say about me yeah and i would know because i'm i'm just as beige so yeah this is i i was hoping for something to really stick out yeah and uh i i cannot say that anything i do have a chess piece sticks out at all no that's not that's not a weapon rule um all right well i guess we all lose that's okay just i think i also have like bias against sidearms like perpetual motion i already told them is is like it's not a bad roll at all on a sidearm but i'm just i'm just judgmental against sidearms i guess if i were to combine like the quality of all the guns you guys got uh i would probably give it to fruit if like i was gonna take take like the average of everyone's guns okay but that's the the most i would be able to give you give like point one of the point to christian yeah i would give like half a point to mr fruit congratulations mr fruit because you had like the highest average of guns yeah i will take the least bad consolation prize from the top row boom hey mr fruit hey nice dick nice dick dude you won nice yeah hey everybody let's get on the podium and the winner receives the king arthur that what you've always wanted oh my god well uh yes please take your positions yes okay and rounding it out at three points we have hunters we've rob congrats in second we have blue and the warlocks with four four-point something like that i think four-point oh okay and lastly the titans you know him you punch him mr fruit with eight points i think congratulations mr wayne a half yeah they leave this yeah this we might not win guardian games but we won the dreamtrips and that's the one that only met that's the only one that really matters that's the one bungie really caught talks about the most yeah the community definitely cares more about oh my kitten boys [Music] [Music] you
