oh my god push push push i got you guys i got you got a truck this runway where are you guys we're busy saving your lives hi eddie everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to battlefield 2042. it has had an interesting launch to say the least but personally i find the most fun in its new hazard zone mode it's honestly closer to hunt showdown than escape from tarkov because there's not so much looting in game but you still go in you can lose things you're trying to get someone to extract you know the drill playing with my friends enjoy the video grand theft auto at least vice city on the switch is not as janky as everyone's saying nice cat that does not count is that a hot take i don't know my vice city save god uh i'm like waiting for the call and no one's calling me i've never played a gta game in my life so all right gamers you ready to yeah jump into that hazard let's do it i'm playing hazard zone dude i don't know what this is it's like super scuffed tarkov oh super scuff bottle i thought tarkov was all right yeah there's no looting um oh well you find data drives and you gotta get out and there's only two extractions the entire match so if you miss it you're dead okay is team killing on because i've learned from back for blood that i should not trust you mr fruit um i don't know i'll shoot you and let you know okay thank you uh someone has a hdd drive am i right guys i don't know i don't imagine loading slower than playstation people couldn't be me i'm confused could not be me oh hey joey i forgot you're here you're so slow you guys think i should get my hdd drive out but we tried downloading more ram uh yeah it made my computer really slow for a little bit oh there he is welcome welcome that was like a solid like i don't know 69 seconds or something was it actually me right the gas was like in 20 49 that sucks don't remember what this is called uh 2069 uh that's right how could i forget ah looks like we're going to operate storage center nah i'm going to pour no marshalling yard okay poor customs actually yeah there's three data drives i love it a lot of hostels but we don't need to worry about that who do i play as who's a good one okay somebody needs to go dozer just trust somebody go dozer uh i'll be the healer uh i am on an extraction streak so if we could not lose that that'd be great you know you playing with me is like like i don't basically need eating cap right no no no no okay you plebs so here's how this works yeah we go in um and let's see so i'm going to die like immediately is which is probably oh okay each of us can hold two data drives all right um but let's keep calm this is very serious okay mr p mr mr fruit what's on the data we're here to uh get the uh furry porn from the uh senators uh oh it's top priority they said 69 on ground transport oh yeah marking data drives is this good no we're but we don't want to go that way oh okay sure whatever well i mean you wanted to go to the place
