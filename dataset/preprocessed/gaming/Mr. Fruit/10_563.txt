doors okay okay okay just let everyone else do the work for me oh what a time skip there with the oh wait no i got pushed go go go go go whoa whoa come on come on come on yes that puts us at a tenth place which means we've qualified for the next round thankfully for that uh that earlier round i was able to just have other people do the work for me but i'm thinking some other minigames that might not be as lucky but there we go yikes taking no prisoners 15 people immediately disqualified i'm gonna go all the way first game you heard it here first folks next up is dizzy heights how to play navigate the obstacles and race to the finish line obstacle course dude this is me this is my game now unfortunately folks i've got word down from the officials most of these people if not all of them have already played so they actually know what they're doing meanwhile i haven't the slightest clue so i'm just gonna use okay they apparently know a time skip they're they're doing so well oh but i'm doing even better i'm practically already in the lead just oh who just who hit me somebody hit me oh no oh no i was doing so well and then tragedy struck avoid the big massive balls oh that's nope that ain't me couldn't be me run run run as fast as you can i don't know if i'm gonna make this don't push me i'm trying to get through what you do your best but there's no there's no need to play dirty man jeez skirt skirt look at this time skip i'm nuts skirt just go around go around it's a little easier okay oh i must be the first 33 but there's another oh oh my god what nobody told me there was a gap there fudge oh my god it looks like that insider information all these folks had really coming into play here jesus i can't i can't get a oh no they've almost qualified watch for the balls oh no are you kidding me my question is why wasn't there like a you know caution cliff right in front of your face well we go again i mean look can you blame me for that performance i wasn't expecting to have my face stuffed with giant balls okay hit parade navigate the obstacles and race to the finish line another obstacle course yes because this is the redemption arc i need to redeem myself to be fair i'm already at a clear disadvantage i'm in the second row not the first so not a whole bunch i can do about this do these things rotate i certainly hope they don't whoa oh what the wow that is way more brutal than i thought it what the okay that's fine move move we didn't get a great start and now these people are gonna try and screw me over with these walls and the answer is evidently that's exactly what's hap oh my god okay we're in we're like in last but that's okay because let me show you god get through the ticket oh my god you guys get out of my back okay okay through the oh god oh more balls what the fudge is our obsession with balls oh no no people are already qualifying that's incredible make it up the glippity glute glop of the ah god okay maybe not what can i can i oh my god i'm not gonna make it i'm not gonna make it i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it i'm always white how can this game be so cute so adorable and yet so devilish gig crash avoid the moving doors and race to the finish line all right i'm just gonna say it look anything moving out of my control i don't know how to handle it oh but they pity me we're in the front this is good let's get going i swear to god if this is the moving one immediately oh what a jump what a skip and then great timing here okay i'm timing it i'm timing it oh what a dive okay i can't tell which one i should do we gotta wait we got wait what does this just not move i've been what and then it moves i was i was like actually in the lead from once in my life nothing ever goes my way oh god i'm getting destroyed by a shish kebab i swear to god i'm gonna make this get through the glippity glob through the glippity glob i can't get oh there's who puts these why are there cliffs everywhere oh yes okay i've survived the first gauntlet the first colleen it shouldn't be that hard but you would be surprised how bad i am sex to sack i've been there it's not fun it's actually quite demoralizing let's go next up roll out move between rotating rotating rings to avoid falling into the slime what did i say don't give me rotating things what do they do give me rotating things glippity glop will not get me today i have no idea how this works should i be moving should i be oh okay this one's moving wait what are we how are we oh wait so we're just trying to stay oh you don't want to get eliminated here oh god but i don't like that one okay leave this little penguin dude he's just he's vibing i respect it okay only six out of 18 have been eliminated i'm about to be eliminated i'm about to be eliminated oh god i don't know how long i could keep this up so i need other people to hurry up and and die for me that would be fantastic only half the people have been eliminated why are they so good at this ah okay okay i'm just i'm vibing between these two 10 out of 18 ice soup yeah there goes another one i assume it's going to get faster and more hectic as time goes looks like there's more obstacles on that one yeah this purple one's big chilling okay just one more lemon yes oh my god i did it i did it actually see that one was good because it wasn't a matter of getting to a finish it was just staying alive and apparently i can do that next up is the block party avoid the moving walls and don't fall off the platform ah jesus it's another one of the eliminated i just said i was good at not dying so let's see how this goes jesus oh my 26 eliminated oh my it's like two-thirds of the lobby jesus what are we looking at where are we going where the walls oh i see them there's a way to like see them coming up early or no where oh god he's like right we're hurting each other oh god go go go go go move move i'm grabbing this guy he's i'm not letting you go he's like bro wait what's this oh i thought they were gonna like rotate i thought it was gonna be a big job he's not letting me go i'm gonna hold on to this guy nope that was a mistake all right you know what don't sabotage other people let them just die in their own it's overrated i don't want to get too close because someone can just push me off the front uh oh we got to jump this okay okay another one another one time it time it see like if i if i go up too close someone just pushed me off right i'm gonna hold this dude okay that's why we don't sabotage that's why we don't sabotage it's not worth it man okay god this is this is actually getting my heart going why is this so intense oh i want to win so bad i couldn't explain to you why i'm just a pink blob but this means so much to me this is everything i've lived for for too long my brothers and sisters have of the blob world have suffered oh jesus christ that's a good thing the middle's chill okay six people have been eliminated but that's not nearly as many as i thought definitely thought we would have more people dead here oh this is insane oh oh oh somebody died there all right oh oh so it's either survive until time over or people are eliminated let's go that's gonna say like 26 that's pretty insane oh yeah that would have been everybody okay we're top 17 hey look at us right there next up fall ball score goals by getting balls into the opposing team's goal work together to get the win oh it's a team based one interesting well blue team's going to win because i said so all right how the fudge do we do this we just ram into it i guess oh dive
