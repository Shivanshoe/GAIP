hi 80 Holdren money mr. fruit and welcome back to carve duty modern warfare and it's time to celebrate good times come home celebrate I've been grinding the launcher so long I wanna die but I got him play why they gather the RPG dirty though every other launcher looks great just put Platt right there I don't care just just do it the Strela looks absolutely fantastic the pilla as well and the Joker is a unit and a half I tell you what what the fudge why doesn't it show Platinum on my hello boys and gentlemen screw it whatever I hate everything let's go in and send out the launchers with a little last hoorah before I put them away forever because I hate them so much now I've so much pent-up anger towards these things and also every teammate that ever shot a kill streak thankfully I no longer have to imagine finding them and strangling them every time the shot went down Oh everyone says this is the hardest so we've gotten out of the way and my god if I don't get Damascus now then I wasted so much of my life getting platinum on launchers so I have to get Damascus now we'll go through and cycle through all the launchers oh baby it's so shouting era boom take that for me first blood we just go ahead and rank the launchers from easiest to hardest in my opinion we start out with the pilla that I'm using right now definitely the easiest then I would go the Strela which is free firing and was annoying but not nearly as annoying as the Joker which did lock-on but because of its slow time to actually get to the target that you want to actually shoot the odds of someone else killing it are you just missing the kill streak entirely because like unless you lock-on as soon as like anime you I've a in the air guess what the rocket won't get to them in time it's it's stupid and I hate everything but that's how it was and then last but not least the RPG it's free firing and it is similar to the Strela except the Strela is like at all we can shoot really fast so I don't know they were both pretty bad really it was the pilla that didn't like make me want to just absolutely drive off a cliff and then all the others which did make me it's like first and then way way down second third and fourth and it's it's just I'm miserable now and I'm also working on Golding gilding whatever I still don't know I'm getting the EBR here apology no no no I want the ammo no no no I want to do whatever doc Jesus did what he done this also means that I can finally put killstreaks back on I don't have to have specialists or if I use specialists I can change the perks that I'm gonna use it shall be a glorious day now the thing to note - the reason I had the Joker so hard - is because the Joker and the peel actually almost every rocket launcher well no that's not true the RPG and the Strela the cameras off stuck on phalanx for aerial killstreaks but for the pilla and the joker it was ground killstreaks and vehicles now I know that there was an exploit you know two three weeks ago since the beginning of the game where if you just win in to a lobby of ground war we didn't kill him that you could just shoot unarmed in neutral vehicles a whole personal radar oh this would be this would be the best day of my life but I don't have to worry about those anymore not today Satan not today I unfortunately never got to use the exploit plows out and they patched it by the time I started doing launchers so yeah it was rough if you did the exploit was up you would early got all the ground vehicles and stuff and like just two games nunu nunu that was not it for me and that's why I was so annoying with like the whole week the Joker and stuff because it can't really get ground killstreaks itself so you have to hope for personal radars counter UAVs and beetles and those only come around so often you're getting the lobbies and just hope people without those kills reason they're done of those kills raised and you just be sad is never-ending cycle all right nice Cal let's check out the ll Strela I and I she a beaut I'm still convinced that platinum isn't really worth it but say okay this is what you had to do for the Strela CRPG you had to do it but this phone nope and with this if you learn the timing right and depending on how far away the UAV was it was possible to get UAVs with this they were few and far between but unlike the RPG I actually hit them probably like 20 percent of the time RPGs were straight-up like 2 percent of the time maybe that's probably generous thing that sucks about the Strela though very little blast radius I know it didn't look like it there but it's true especially when trying to get kill streaks and stuff like ground kill streaks you pretty much got direct hit it you hit the ground like next to a century does surely that open new and we don't do it my friend oh that's good as to another RPG here why don't wait dad I'm waiting and okay we get oh hello yeah ah no it's breaker oh also pro tip yeah I didn't know this but you guys pointed it out I thought I knew just about everything there was to know about rocket launchers but you guys proved me wrong you can actually mail a ground killstreaks with a rocket launcher and they will still count it'll count as a kill on that kill streak with that launcher which is so important with like the Joker because you have to be so far away and you have to lock on and all that kind of stuff not anymore my friends not anymore Oh specialist bonus I didn't realize I was frag it out kog'maw I was freaking out but I've really can't hit anything for the life of me got him so much for the specialist streak okay let's go back to lunch and some people I'm sure to look better with Damascus but yeah God Platinum is underwhelming can't get over it so it's sad you get all the way literally it's just platinum isn't no matter if he asks I got platinum it's yes I'm just that much closer to Damascus really how about this coupons see if that was an RPG zip probably did but with Z Strela and no it does not work like that I can get you a more kids come catch em Oh oh my god this is the most annoying thing ever there we go so often oh hey hey give me that kill so often I go to drop ammo and then there's a weapon right next to it and then I could never get ammo because it just wants to constantly keep picking up the new weapon gonna be first no radar oh happy day wow I got stuff alright let's check it out oh jeez this is a unit and a half isn't it it looks pretty early that oh I gotta take the ball screen yeah boy are you thankful I know exactly what to do here black guy yeah really take me on about every map now and I'll have somewhere that I know old commits come here come here come here come here yeah yeah yeah yeah come here come here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let's keep it going come on just imagine this was ground killstreaks oh you're not escaping me boy come here boy ahh alright I'm lacking out here captain don't kill myself I've gotten a little bit better at that but it is still way too easy Skoosh unfortunately does not appear sets air pusheen sign is friggin so yeah yeah oh my god mr. fruit you need this yeah there we go ah fudge there we don't this is actually good though I think this is the x51 of all the snipers I still need to do the camos aadmi and any amount - long shots whatever illy can't do anything oh my god I suck just killing come on peak again do it do it I'm ready this time I'm ready this time a long shot hey what I say what I say not this time saying cuz believe me it's rocket launchers are Satan now I'm gonna finish out marksman rifles but then after that will you let me shoot my thing I think I'm gonna finish right shield a knife but I know I know I just tortured myself with rocket launchers why I don't want to do that well quite simply because then and only then will all the the worst stuff be over with I believe I know next step worst will be riot shield and then knife and then everything else won't so much be difficult they'll just be tedious oh yeah triple kill that's always the fun with the Joker sometimes you're ran and we just get like oh hey quad kill quad feed cool yeah though they're meant to do that ooh actually pilum does look pretty good in the RPG I just wish they would make the payload on the front Platinum as well I know why they don't but like come on now also yes screw me where were these lobbies yesterday I'm not kidding you guys I spent the entire day aside from going to the gym finishing up launchers it was terrible I wanted to quit so many different times eight nine games in a row with like no kill streaks or anything like that like way and then there'd be one game with I to personal right like this one there's actually kind of like the one ionically got in the video yesterday was just like an incredible amount of kill streaks that just doesn't normally happen and yeah if you saw tomorrow you would have been at Jesus never happens it's terrible one day I will just spank my killstreaks personal radar counter UAV and then like sentry gun or something and it'll just be for all those people doing rocket launchers I'll be able to go ahead shoot them down buddy get those get those streaks get the aerial and ground kill streaks all in one go you're welcome and also for the love of God please if you're gonna shoot down a counter UAV at least use a rocket launcher so I can pretend you're also going for camos even if you're not because if I see you immediately start shooting that thing with a gun for no reason except to destroy it and help the team which like yeah you're helping the team but no okay there are people out here struggling to feed themselves with killstreaks okay so if I see you just go and destroy that him home it happened so often before I could even lock-on with a rocket launcher - OH Meimei I was hoping I could predict that oh we got a met John I hope with the mp5 I haven't used my ass from Gees in a minute that's right Platinum them up and then never use them again but I could now have a full platinum loadouts now huh huh yeah nobody really cares about that really hard to tell like what though with the launcher it's pretty easy to tell with the SMG I mean no we're q8 people definitely go the RPG round that was the easiest now Joker was easy because granted see I'm already like let me shoot the red I don't need to anymore joke it wasn't too bad because if you got domination on shipment it was tough because like you'd only get a shot off every like five lives because you would die before you ever get to lock on but if you did manage you would just walk on into a corner near a flag and I mean in like two games I got all the attacker and defender kills which thankfully I got that stuff out of the way because well there's no more shipment at least in a dedicated players did it makes me sad don't you shoot - Shepherd [ __ ] Shepherd don't just with my mag on there well then get on the HQ we're running at it Oh God I'll finish this in style because otherwise you're gonna run out of time both game over that's cool it was just a mental grind man between having to make sure you always had the right perks making sure you always have it queires swapping go paying attention every second there's a kill streak open you shoot it down is so stressful and like I said I better for you can get Damascus cuz if I went through all this and not get Damascus mr. fruit mr. fruit mr. free what the heck do you think get down you owe it to yourself now - bet you screw you to finish it out and we're probably just gonna rock the RPG here near the end because like I said it's the best I think for just killing some dudes oh yeah hitmarker yeah sure thing buddy old pal oh Jesus Adam hold on you know what for the road here nope alright when I was screwed I don't have to care anyone last night though when I got my last kill streak and it showed gold unlocked platinum unlocked platinum unlocked platinum unlocked platinum unlock clap my hands put him in the air guy thank God did I quit the game and with the bed that was it I was just like God Jesus I mean like I mentioned in the last video I wanted the triangular launchers out of the way show oh I'm so excited I'll still destroy it for that you you don't be that guy even saw me tried rocking it and you know it does he still shoot I don't need it but I'm looking out for the people that do all right screw you gg gg egg 13 let your pleb to everybody's a blab but now when I do a gold camo whether I'm unlocking it or doing a video on it I can now just use that singular gun I don't have to think about eight different things like we did you famously saw in the golden car video yesterday where I had like 80 different things on my mind and really half the time was just using my launchers because it's like the hold up wait a minute put a little love in doing it those words while they are now oh come here good news direct hit predicted uh-oh my wrists hurt what the fudge Oh carpal tunnel striking again the worst to yesterday was when I kept having people on my team and I to be like friendly person already I am bad I'm like no and then the enemy team never called him I was like why can't I get you on the other team right see look at least if I do this okay oh I was gonna say what the fudge so used to the Strela but see at least somewhat easy I was like oh he must be a you know grinding the launchers and bleep me once upon a time I was and that time was not too long ago screw you you know what fine you want to do you want to you want to shoot me normally yeah I'll shoot you normally too huh how you like that I can't believe I'm done I really can't when I first look at these I thought these would be thing that broke me and I would never I'd do everything else but I would never get to the launchers and so Damascus way but I did it III rip the band-aid off first saving assault rifles for last which will be I think simultaneously the easiest and the hardest the easiest guns to use but or rather not the hardest but the longest because they're things are stupid smg's are fifty long shots while a ours or a hundred SMGs are fifty mounted a ours are a hundred this is a completely unnecessary why we why would you do this to anybody why do you hate hate me ba ba da da ba ba da da mo oh you know what I actually got platinum on - I'd never shot one down before but it was an EMP drone yeah it was just kind of zooming on and Retta me and I was like hey let's see if this counts it does so if you want to shoot down in the MP drone and it counts as both aerial and ground so there you go wrote it for you did zat there yeah on the house - also that's good yeah see human feely act the last thing I have to do for the e BR is get the three kill streaks but honestly I'm hoping to do all the other weapons or at least work on them until the next double weapon XP and then at that time that's it and then next job when we get double weapon XP I'm going to be using the assault rifles just because they have the most amount of levels so if I can max level them all quickly then I think that'll be best because then I can work on all the challenges and knock them out simultaneously rather than one at a time or have them knock count all that kind of good stuff it's what I done with the smg's and that made things a lot easier what my anus oh my god yeah I lose but you hit the darn dude yeah that was a kill let's be real oh god I'm stretched oh but you just killed me no I kill you never mind the few shots it took I didn't see that happen so no no okay okay we're live we're live this is good it's good I don't want him to see my laser yeah that's all I wanted the three killstreak you can kill me now I'll accept my fate thank you fair enough totally warranted understandable have a nice day what am i doing I was trying to melee him but I couldn't find the button which is why I was just running into him for a while there but ya know I found the B button we're good we're good there's a will there's a what are you doing up here okay okay Hey it's to kill streak No whoo get your face out of here ba okay okay one more uno mas we get a lot of we ought to get a lot to kill streaks kid can you tell but today we get third AI wasn't pretty but we did it there's another three yeah skulduggery and nook thank you all ah I was about to camp that tack insert and that little rascal showed up at a yeah what's going on here siobhan in the van van is it's not busy hard point is yeah watch this quad kill foam it was all short all that quad kill home yeah no we got one okay oh my god mr. fruit it a shot please okay okay okay was that to one of them was the RPG though I don't know if you actually need in one life three it has to be three kill speed with that weapon polish which means that one there's no Scout I wasn't sure if like one kill was from something else but then two are from the gadem I just shoot dudes until it says Gold unlock and I go nice start the new years off right big old chunk of the Damascus down if you two are grinding out there I recommend to just have them always in the secondary have the right perks equipped and then whenever you hear the right amount of yeah whatever you need if you need aerials than anything works if you need ground then listen for the specific ones and then just swap to it and shoot it it'll make you way more sane than just specifically going for one Oh but man I that burn me out you know but the grind never stops we good did yeah but I said thank you very much for watching have yourselves a fantastic day I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
