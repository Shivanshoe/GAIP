this is what happens when you let pc play with us we have cheaters there's no way you could have known i was there i have ghosts i was crouching and you didn't see me just know where to quit today i hate this map i hate every single map in this game there's not a single good map in this piece awesome oh they're not even kill streaks anymore because you don't have to get kills you don't have to streak to get them anymore they're just three kills somebody like to explain why the smg's are more powerful than rifles in this game don't wanna i wanna rank up this rifle you're gonna get my nine millimeter every time just so good i'm gonna sit here and aim down sights and wait for somebody to walk around the corner we're gonna sit in the middle of the map and wait for people walking out of order such great we're so good [Music] helicopter look at that i know the guy did nothing what a great game i paid 70 dollars for this piece of hi everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to call of duty black ops cold war and in today's video it's the most wonderful time for the game i say that just because there's double xp right now not double weapon xp which would be great because i'm out here for ragging that's a relative term you know i don't wanna nobody frank whatever kids are different these days outside but man the weapons are slow to level up even slower than modern warfare with modern warfare like 500 600 kills and i'd be like max level in this game it seems there's gonna be a couple thousand like my goodness it's the m16 it's a burst fire tactical rifle and thanks pretty nutty seeing some good results with it or i may just use the ak74u because i like submachine guns i don't want to use the mp5 because i'm different and where everybody in the moment everybody uses mp5 oh my god it's overpowered in every lobby just like nothing that's what i say before i swear to god sorry about that as i was saying mp5 is totally balanced not a problem at all and i'm trying to level up here because god would i love the ninja perk dude god knows all these kids are out here with their turtle hyper astro beach but based frag damn bose dolby their head they just sound horrend dude i can't um i don't know one that i'm like super and even all semi alright totally fine semi are right with i don't know the weapon design between this and modern warfare it seems like we're getting close to like them making a hybrid between call of duty and battlefield and i don't know you know what i i miss the three lanes you know at this point i used to be like man stop remaking maps but at this point if that's all they do fine you know what release new cards with old maps because at least then i don't know maybe i'm just a boomer dude well i mean we knew that but oh my god you all just got pooped on by this dude but i stopped him sucka i don't have the stem on me do i even have that unlocked i don't know now the reason i've been enjoying this this uh burst rifle i was gonna say pulse rifle it's ain't no destiny mr fruit look at this i'm gonna swap up my positioning they're never gonna see this coming they're all dying horrific horrific death bop see didn't even think to look here okay they're all above me oh my god oh my god don't bring him over here bop spy plane yeah now they're gonna hear multiple spy planes spotted above and they're gonna have to shoot them all down or hope that they have what do you mean see like i'm talking and i'm gonna be honest i have the master audio track at like 30 because i like to keep my hearing intact but apparently that just means that you know i am i oh my god that's my first melee kill in this entire game i was literally spamming buttons because i forgot what it is by the way it's default e melee button is e on pc you ever heard of that because i know i haven't bob there we go nice little dubliner keep it going bob why are you laying prone i've tried to ape in this game and i just can't at least not without ninja and for the longest time i didn't have ghost either so aping just screwed me over and honestly in the lobbies i play everybody holds corners uh plays pretty slow or they're just hyper aggressive and they're oh my god and they turn every corner like like that like that's the lobbies i'm playing and you guys might think i'm exaggerating saturday night you know it's like the day after release my friends just got it not my content creator friends but like irl friends from high school no yo let's play and i'm like yeah sick dude let's do it and needless to say they don't want to play a multiplayer with me probably ever again and i can't excuse you sir and i can't really say i blame them oh my god get finessed even though you had friends i can't finish the thought before i keep getting killed but they hop in there and then they're like oh my god like yeah this is what i had to play with i'm going to be honest i wouldn't play the game i wouldn't think it's fun i'm like thank you you now know my pain because there's like these guys are they're sweatiest dry hurts and i'm like i know i know you know they were going like point three in lobbies when they were killing it otherwise and they get that skill mat skills matchmaking is helping protect them but that's your [ __ ] they thought they were at a high skill bracket where is this hey stop stop running from me that's my promise like i have to try all the time which is like fine whatever but it's a problem when like i can't even play with my friends now i can't just chill out and have fun with my friends because they're like they hate their lives you know like skill basement they're not gonna do anything it caters to the plebs and everything and it keeps them playing and that's what gets some money so go hey hey ah they're taking my century gosh dang it where um yeah somebody was clearly having a lot of fun not so much yo by the way you see how it took me so long to get a helicopter and it's gone and i don't think i got a single kill that was cool that was pretty cool i'd say bob gotcha but yeah that slimes like i don't know if it just seems very evident that like in whatever skill bracket i'm putting nobody's really having fun and that's just [ __ ] i don't blame people for trying hard because again at our skill bracket you either play hard or try hard or get pooped on also you like that little three piece oh okay i'm so glad their helicopter can get killed oh game over you kind of have to just play how they're gonna play or else you're just not gonna have fun hey look it's me bob kill come on show me the double i'm getting a quad feed here ready pop there's two wait four wait what i feel like don't tell me this is the end of it what i got like a triple after this i was like back to back to back why would they not whatever normally i'm not playing single player games but nowadays it's just like you know this is nice i don't know and maybe it is me getting fatigued from skill based match man because just like this isn't this isn't fun i can't like just chill back and do okay i if i if i sit back then i'm mauled because i'm like oh and 30. skirt where'd you go oh oh we got a little jump shot see i got a jump shot his jump shot let's breathe ring around the rosie i'm ready i'm ready i'm ready for it see i got a whole line just like normally i'm apron right now you guys know me normally i'm a fiend on the sticks well i'm on massive keyboard right now so also it is like impossible to manage throwables in this game because i have the arm of a of a i don't know a professional quarterback look at this like i just want to throw it now maybe that's normal but i got used to modern warfare if i wanted to throw that far i'd have to be like you know like oh i'm sorry i cannot avenge you nice camo so who knows maybe i will inevitably go for the camo grind because honestly for a majority of modern warfare that's what oh fudge me grinding the cameras because that way i didn't have to mold over every little thing it was just like ah whatever you know i made progress towards my camo but i don't know let's see and the game is the game was fundamentally i mean it's sound there's something here i don't know you know what exactly they have planned post launch but just like there seems to be a scarcity of weapons which is people are hypothesizing ooh nice proximity mind kill me yeah totally skillful they hypothesize that's why it's taking so long for weapons to unlock so that people don't get through and then realize just how few weapons there are because i feel like this is like the lowest amount of weapons in the card at release i don't know maybe i'm wrong why are you all up there and you notice i'm doing a lot of crouch shotting and uh what the fudge is it called drop shot and that's simply because i'm i'm having to adapt like if i don't i just i die you know i'm having to that's the thing that's gonna mismatch me you know it's making me change my play and and try harder but you know like i feel dirty and sometimes i don't want to do that but you know whatever this wasn't supposed to be a what oh my god i hit someone flak jacket watch out watch i stunned myself like that it ricochets it's like hey nice mb5 don't say that anywhere i hear a spy point now whatever i'm not gonna bother yeah it's not my job i've shot so many of them somebody else can do it for a change yeah you like that like that you'll empty five feet you have got to be kidding me that actually just got a quad wow i feel like i always put too much on it and then when i want to put less i don't put enough you know starting to think i'm just bad oh get down i avoided my own bouncing betty all right what do we got here we got uh we got two fiends oh okay [Music] oh he did got him i thought he was in the corner there talk about maulding i don't know where all these people are they're spawning over here now that's a yes yeah yeah is there um like a secret tech here skirt oh no no there's not how long can i hold my breath for now find out in today's episode of okay that's my limit now check this out you're not gonna see this coming you don't get to kill me you don't get that satisfaction again i'll just say this you want pubs to be sweaty and push skill-based matchmaking fine but for the love of god give me a rank and i know then the same argument is well then the plebs will see they're like bronze or whatever and then they'll feel bad why is everything for the plebs you know what i'm saying don't show the plebs and then at a certain threshold start giving ranks i don't know what do you want from me it just feels like i'm sweating for nothing but if but if it was ranked then you know it makes sense but whatever i'm gonna keep grinding i want to get to the famasi mas which is uh uh how do i ah it's not until level 40. so screw me anyway with that said i don't think all much watching episodes vantage day i'll i'll i promise i won't uh ramble and rant so much you know what from here on out cold war skill-based matchmaking you're never going to hear it you're not going to hear me talk about it okay that's a promise see in the next one farewell [Music] you
