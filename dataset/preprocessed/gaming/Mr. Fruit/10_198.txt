lasts the very first round but whatever yeah i'm not buying anything it should be like if you get x amount of kills or like win x amount of win rounds like you get a life back or something something's to wear like i don't know if you're fragging and the fact that they don't show the mass stats tilts me me too i want match stats to help prove my bias [Applause] oh i can't ping but he's right behind middle tires [Applause] oh my god dude through the wall he doesn't even see me i got the life it's all good [Applause] that one oh right on me right right in front of me right i was mid reload sorry

here i bought a spy plane nothing i got armor and that's pretty much it i wasted it all upgrading my weapon v2 rocket 25k drops at v2 rocket killing all players on the map and ending the match automatically activates in the next match [Music] how do you even get that much yeah 25 you just absolutely fragged you'd have to frag but like almost because you can't split money you would have to have somebody like pick it all up and everything oh free match oh never mind he's here put the [ __ ] wait what we have just remember we have spy plane activated they just don't get respawns he's on the left side yeah i see him got him nice i'm grabbing the life yeah push this guy wait wait let me reload though there we go let's go well done i'll do a little upgrady this is our game this is the one okay wow ruthless give his team easy yeah yeah let's knock him out again i just spent my money though everyone else is fighting yeah i just spent my money too i'll get to demolition oh that's what i saw them doing earlier they're like trying to kill people on another map oh yeah i see him right there yeah fly them up bonus buy round aka bonus frag round i wish we got just a normal round though because then we could uh get a life at least all right give us easy fudge hey nice i'm right side going up both on right both on right i grabbed the life we have a spy plane remember that i made it they're weak right i needed oh he's back left little oozy bird they're both back still back left i'm getting i'm getting wall banged i need help i'm here i don't know where his teammate is oh it's all on him it's all on him he's in that uh red container i'm still getting shot behind you what you lied wait they said one out of 12. so like why else and he wasn't popping up on the spy plane like ever yeah there he is look at this by playing my friend he's back right now all right we're done all right fine get my money get money get money don't spend any money so we can see if we can uh i don't even have enough but oh easy was eliminated anyway just us and george to be fair our worst round was against george now i think they beat us this was our worst round i don't have enough for an extra life oh i do never mind oh you have what do you have enough 3050. oh nice okay i'm gonna buy this [ __ ] uh yeah somebody had a good point the number is how many respawns left not lives so if it says zero that doesn't mean yeah you know okay they bought two i think so it's all tied up what how does mine not they're near me i mean i think they're just pushing my i think they know i'm here back right got one wait what i guess he is incendiary or something no only two lives steady i hate that they can see you through walls i never looked at blair i got him middle no it's on you nice i just got forever second dude like the beginning didn't even make sense like i guess he swapped had a machine gun and just like one pop and i was up yeah i think sad dude i'm not satisfied until he went
