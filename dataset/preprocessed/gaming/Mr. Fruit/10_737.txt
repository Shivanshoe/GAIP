all the fortnight loot or the twitch prime loop right now worried about you have you heard my theory on seizing AB what you want to do is when you're in public and you sneeze is do a silent sneeze because I think people in the world only say bless you just so they can talk like they don't really give a [ __ ] that you sneezed they just want to say bless you so they can talk that's why I don't sneeze out loud so people don't get that opportunity you know I have to show up I'm 13 and that is deep someone sneezes and I stayed in my head why don't I talking when I used to sneeze in class and then 80,000 people would go bless you bless you bless you best place to place you bless your hate with hey I've never said a word to you but bless you God shut the [ __ ] up like all you want to do is talk cuz of AIESEC cuz I sneeze so that's why I always do that it just sounds painful though well like you're gonna break your rib like cuz I guess you can pop a rib or something like that if there's
