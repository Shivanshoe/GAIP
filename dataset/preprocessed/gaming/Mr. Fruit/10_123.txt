if you've kept up or played the game yourself you know there's a lot of gripes around the progression battle pass system well there's these challenges and they they ruin the game for me because i can't not do them some people like you don't have to just don't do the challenges i can't do that that's not how my brain works so unfortunately i'm enslaved to these stupid challenges and this video is a perfect demonstration of what the challenge is to at least the journey to get them for me looks like so please enjoy stronghold that's not oddball ain't gonna grind for the rest of the armor today i'm doing challenges right now and literally like i can't even get to new armor like i've essentially almost hit the cap on how far i'm getting through this event passed this week so and no matter how much i do it it will not let me wait is that camo or overshield i did i was just trying to see my little weapon charms way around he so rudely had to come in here and shoot me where's the triple it was right there i choked i just refused to adapt that's why i complained okay did not mean to [ __ ] yeah i'm dead just stop just stop shoot just kill me check this out and i can see it coming they saw it coming okay yeah what are we all for are these guys [Music] that psychic an overshoot defeat like is it another thing about is there anything stopping me from queuing into a game seeing it's not oddball and then leaving i don't think so i don't think there's lever penalty is there uh i think i'm gonna reroll this one when i get it though stop five killing sprees in fiesta wait it's the only way to get stay tuned for more details stay tuned for more details stay tuned stay tuned stay tuned available in the store stay tuned what the [ __ ] there's like no way to get armored

two people while holding the ball god all you gotta do is bait them to me take the shields out and whack them you know punch them once and you take them out all right exactly it's a lot easier when you have a pal to help you that's right get up right next to him and my dude just swings it air he's like i'd rather not hit him something tells me the blood the blood pressure is a bit upright no no it's great you've been playing you would feel like the entire day i've been here for a while yeah only like an hour and a half but it honestly i'd rather die okay regen the shield you know he's behind

yeah but thank you i got you joey oh my god now i'm that guy oh oh i saw i saw all of those yeah i have the ball now though behind me joey this guy used two spanker shots to kill just me like what's the way to help me okay well i'm dead because this guy blew me up with a rocket oh my god no freaking melee launch dude okay okay god i gotta go pick that up all right you're gonna need to weaken them let's go around here all right okay here it comes we can yeah but if i could just get it over with now my life would be exponents like my blood pressure could actually just drop behind you go grab this pump oh my god why am i always taking a grenade for you i take a girl for you i'll let you punch him with the skull okay i'm gonna bait this down on the countdown but i need you guys to weaken him for me okay that guy's crazy we oh okay that guy behind you is not crazy dude push them this guy is sitting there shooting at a door oh he's checking his corners doors and corners the door isn't holding the ball okay okay so you know if we had arios in oh this is a bat i'm out of position got it i'm headed back someone's behind me joey okay this guy's shoot super weak they're both right mr
