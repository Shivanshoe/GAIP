hi-dee-ho one my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to more colony modern warfare you might be asking yourself wait a second you can't go video on a new assault rifle yesterday you would be right so surely there's no way I've got another one boom baby that's right golden weeb Odin doesn't get much better than this this my friends is in game now for attachments I I got to put on the Colossus suppressor it's just a job uh suppressor gives you sense a brush and David range and recall now using this thing on shipment seems like a terrible idea but whenever Odin factory for twenty millimeter barrel that tack laser yep tech XO it go and that's light at hand so of course as with everything I always do give me a DSP baby I know there are some pretty crazy ways you can customize the Odin and perhaps we'll try that once I get Damascus now I'm actually relatively close to two other assault rifle golds which means we'll be halfway done with assault rifles but make no mistake they take a while they're not hard they're just tedious it's just a lot of certain things like oh it's not like 150 mounted kills or something like it whose idea was this oh oh let me get it on this hey hi hey hey hey I want to be like that one kid in school oh we're doing this I'm cool I swear oh oh right we're playing the game oh it's oh my god that's how you know you've gotten into the sweaty it really got directed by rocket launchers totally find the leaders prediction ready prick that was my kill bro Oh bro that was my kill dodge as soon as you start getting destroyed by gas grenades as soon as you spawn you know one you're either sweaty or you just enjoy being the worst thing to ever live and walk this earth I would say okay I would say that that's a Jesus sponding so what I could win I got there look at this they're posted up wait you didn't die excuse me oh here we go though stupid why is there no counter to that and I can't do it I can't stem a whole man died god I enjoy this game so much more when nobody's using gas grenade however that is few and far between I'm afraid now Odin's rate of fire is already slow I think that's been actually a little generous pretty slow as generous but aim for the chest and above and you'll be surprised I realized oh my god this is way better when I do that tonight not I can't tell if I shot him I believe it one taps headshots which as far as I'm aware no other yeah no other assault rifle does that I don't maybe yeah FAL doesn't do that does it I mean obviously anything like one shot headshots in hardcore but this very hardcore baby this is core yeah oh there's a okay there's a Wilson just absolutely farming I'll save you team I tried just keep firing far away far who we're we shoot it down oh my gosh guys shoot it I got it I got it oh please please okay I'm I was alive very momentary a second I don't use scopes really with my guns actually think the Odin could benefit a good bit because I not a huge fan of the iron sights and I quite often find myself kind of losing my target if I'm being real with [ __ ] but that was a nice little pop off life now look at this uh-huh uh-huh oh I'm double cheeked up right now uh-huh death from above suckers oh wait okay see how did I did I what is oh my god okay I'm at I'm at ammo get off the roof mister fruit you're not Santa Claus up on the roof top click click click that's the sound of their gun when Miss shoot me uh improvise here all right I got a thermite where is he yeah we stuck in we're gonna do minimal damage but if we do that enough times ready yeah your I think I got him again yeah I did and I'll keep dying for my country yeah I think I got him again just keep throw up job just keep throw it your stuff med yeah we got oh my god screw me yeah we were in the lobby was some guy got a juggernaut how does it happen no oh wait oh he was probably the guy really he probably was the guy with the wheel cinnamon just had kill chain that would make a lot of sense boy why am i dying big mood well here's the secret mr. fruit we're all dying slowly some of us faster than others all of our days and times will count oh my god this is yeah I told you is gonna be bad I wasn't kidding we are we are in this what it dared Dory my friends and I mean to be fair that's pretty much as modern warfare selling up look at what I'm spawning into gas grenade mall top predator missile also I know it's a cruise missile but I'm always gonna call it a predator missile just like half the time instead of saying VTOL I say Harrier it's just ingrained in me okay and you would think after this much time a plane that I'd be better at it but you give me too much credit and I'm spawning in a cluster strikes and thermite's a death destruction sadness god I already have enough of that in my life right I don't need extra you guys don't need to help me out there really oh god what a spawn yeah when the hard points in the middle just expect an absolute clown fiesta leaders leaders leaders ah Jesus you know sometimes shipments to play and sometimes shipment isn't right now this is what we live for yes chaos chaos is a wheel and we must break the wheel well I can't be too mad cuz I always have my my waifu for life who owned my gun she's always here with me both and oh god someone they they got another out boy they got another Wilson which means he's gonna get another jug or not find his body we need to find his body if we can kill him before he gets all the stuff for juggernaut there might be a nevermind I just I just want a quick second to breathe there we go start playing a little bit slower didn't never mind yeah shotgun in son of a-- thankfully I have plat shotgun so I never need to use another shotgun again in my life and believe me I'm gonna live up to that I have no intention oh that Dulli that that's good only problem is Odin can't really buff much of its sprint to fire speed which it definitely lacks but c'est la really plus of course gas grenade we have a juggernaut now Oh heaven and the tides of turn oh my gosh my god it's just if so I I hate it did the guy uses juggernaut to kill the Harrier cuz if so you're not a real team player dude it's really simple you got juggernaut like a limited ammo like that suck out ah now that guy was danger class hello my friend no no say beside subside don't hurt me okay well now I understand why I was struggling so much my team was feeding my teammate seemed to be confused thinking they were the turkeys the enemy the pilgrims and this was Thanksgiving let's let's try this out deathmatch domination scored by holding points and by getting kills now I can play domination and actually play the objective Wow we actually got shoot house okay well that's ironic but klas a sniper I was expecting the bigger map then this this might not be what we're looking for oh my god I can't believe we X we got that shot I didn't put the Colossus sniper back on the class of snipers what am I getting shot by oh my god I couldn't even see him take my mom now well mom need I don't know what the score limit here is cuz know much 200 now that you can also kill and get Wow get score I'd be interested to see what exactly that would look like you're my friend I'm so sorry my biggest complaint though is definitely the the sights and the recoil I so often lose what I'm trying to shoot or just can't control what I'm trying to shoot but I guess that means I could double down on recoil yeah that's probably what that means but it's not what I do and somehow I'm not getting any kills cuz I suck at the poopoo and I am dying alright you know what let's figure something out here okay I have to die before I'm able to implement this always gonna try and kill my friends he still killed me though I have swapped all attachments oh my golly this 80s speed yeah oh my god this is gonna be atrocious however I have fully expect in the recoil control and I have a sight so now I have no excuse the recoil is definitely improved so that's something and I had to keep sleight of hand because it's already slow enough without it oh okay okay recoil is still alive and well can't believe I missed that imagine that I couldn't I would I never make mistakes like that yeah what nope not this guy sad thing too is I can get this a DSP with the Odin to be even slower can you imagine I know I can't all get destroyed that wait are you still was that my friend shooting I think it was Oh lolled I'm surprised we got there but we did ah fahh just realized time specialist not that it's really matter it's not like we would have gotten a kill streak here ever let's see if we if we sat around and tried to mount up would probably see a lot more success but it does not help that I went from shipment to shoot house wasn't entirely my my idea I was assigned with a shipment idea you know show some chaos but then I was kind of hoping for a better a longer map definitely where the Odin shines but you know c'est la vie I guess oh ho you like that doubt uh-huh revenge is a dish best served with the Odin pretty sure that was Muhammad Ali he was so ahead of his time all right well we mounted up it wasn't a pretty kill I just can't aim apparently I need to get warmed up the old balls will thumbs so it gives us an edge over the rest of the food chain to come out actually I mean obviously there are some in the food chain like primates and stuff that also have opposable thumbs but that's not important we don't care about those people but also have you heard about some I forget which monkeys and where they were what primates I yeah I forget but some scientists were watching them and they're kind of documenting and talking about how they're they think the primates are entering their own Stone Age isn't that so weird to think we're watching them evolve into whatever they're gonna be because they've noticed and to be fair it's a little bit different because I think they're mirroring what they've seen from humans but they're starting to fashion their own like Spears and tools and then use those for instance they're like spear fishing almost I'm becoming really proficient at it yeah we're like straight up watching them evolve into their Stone Age it's kind of crazy to think about who knows where they'll end up what are you doing up there get down let me heard that Nursery Rhyme or story whatever like 12 little monkeys jumping on the bed one fell down and bumped his head something some something I see your laser there I barely killed you but you're still hell dead I'm crazy oh yeah he didn't expect me to come there huh uh-uh oh he wouldn't push like that oh that's ridiculous too brazen no one would do that well you you doubt me my friend I do the dumb stuff bother someone up here good luck my friend push frankly wait what it was here I don't like this I do not like this it looks like it goes to 300 that's my final answer Alex I guess I would work better for it wants to be a millionaire scored a 300 Regis final answer congratulations you are now a billionaire actually came to this realization yesterday when I was talking with my fiancee I'm not good at trivia you know like especially because a lot of it's so like update current stuff like music and stuff and I just did I don't know most of that sigh I'd be useless and I was like well I'm not I don't really unless it's video games I don't obsess over anything that I think I would be knowledgeable enough for trivia honestly the only one would probably be Pokemon and if you excluded the anime past Giotto cuz then I didn't really watch and I think that's kind of sad you know I I'm not well-rounded because we went to trivia night a little bit while back and our team got second last I did that with my fiance and Rob Rob was pretty good at current music contemporary whatever the only music question I got right was about like a 50s jazz band I got that one though so can you believe it nobody knew Dave Brubeck take five oh my god it was heartbreaking but I always think when I see game shows like oh man if I were up there I would fail I wouldn't know any of this it's funny cuz you don't pay attention to like half the questions they're asked but then there's one you know oh my god I would I know that oh my god I'm a genius I would I would have done so well but would you but would I ladies and gentlemen the Odin we didn't exactly pop off so not exactly the greatest showcase for it but that's what you should have come to expect by now and with modern warfare skill based matchmaking it is what it is you get some good games you get some bad games we've been doing pretty well recently so we're in the upper echelon right now so I think we did fine plus I'm gonna say I'm just not a big fan of the oven with that said thank you for supporting me and my road to insanity I mean road to Damascus we'll get there I love you everyone's fantastic I'll talk to you and the next one very well [Music] [Music]
