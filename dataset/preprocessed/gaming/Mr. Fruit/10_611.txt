hi 80 homes won money mr. fruit and welcome back to call duty modern warfare season four that's right brand-new season and brand-new stoop to take a look at no surprise here we've got a brand new battle paths but with it comes some new weapons and while we'll be checking out today the CR 56 a max or rather the Galil there's also a brand new SMG the finnick we'll be taking a look at that one in another video these are always exciting times there's also some new playlists the trench moshpit sounds too good to not try out and then scrapyard 24/7 which was a modern warfare 2 map and has been in the ground war map for some time now but now it's a multiplayer map but first up we'll be using the Galil with its brand new blueprint the emissary look at this throw black and gold together and I'm their baby it comes with a compensator for eco control the ffs 8.34 em downside speed of movements bait the F tag Spartan for a milwaukee movement speed commando a foregrip for that recoil stabilization and aiming stability and the XR Casey are 56 rubberized wrap for recoil control so from the get-go the attachment certainly look like my thang we're also gonna be using the specialist bonus because it dress got buffed to wear at the specialist bonus not only do you get perks but you also get weapon perks including like disabling wounding FMJ all that stuff so with that let's get down and dirty in the trenches its trench moshpit time oh my I thought it would be a little more than that but yet straight-up 3v3 you'll look at the gun though looking good and I also got some new some new watch look it has the mini-map on it doesn't really serve any difference I mean if I'm relying on that then you know we're already worried some trouble and that's a quick hill oh it packs a punch it sounds crunchy it shoots crunchy they might bet mister what does that have to do with anything don't don't worry about it it matters because you know I'm using it and I want it to sound dope and it does that's a quick kill skirt let me reload here quick Jerry do the hard stuff oh my god my aim sucks alright I'm going no man's land baby that's right I'm not afraid of anything I'm above-ground you want to stay in the trenches have at it oh yeah see that's what happens I'm a sneak up on you why is my friend trying to knife me brah I'm Jim a friend a friend Nate oh nice maybe no man's land ain't the play ah Who am I kidding fire detective God it just it's so sick hmm hex uh punch mm-hmm oh you tryin to see for me not today shoot you through the smoke I don't care stay frosty oh jeez I'm nervous trying to stay sneaky above-ground it's kind of counterintuitive pop there's a kill get down get down maybe we'd get back up maybe we feel a little dicey you know maybe boo maybe we play around with it but no I think we're on the flank or on the flank I'm the worst I'm the worst never mind assist it went exactly how I thought it would it's Kurt oh it's free and cinderblock whatever the fudge II was behind barricade worked out rather well for him but I won the gunfight however he had the teammate super overrated is it the same dude I don't know where this feller is but he's over here there he is screw you no it's that guy okay yeah revenge mm-hmm come on if you're gonna go no-man's land you get up like this no fear ah fear fear is everywhere I'm scared I'm scared okay oh and he's not gonna see this skirt oh there's almost super policy didn't expect that I don't even know where he went is he is he dead like I have no idea what's going on right now oh I've got him in my sights look at that range they keep killing me which is disappointing but fair since that's the whole point of the game coach I can't believe you'd like kill me dude I thought we were like friends even though you're on the enemy and it's the first person shooter where the entire goal is to shoot someone else go hoo hoo almost turned on you so fast and poor oh he's going for the triple I'm about to give it to him cuz I'm potato okay apparently if someone else that see for me but nonetheless I got embarrassed oh my you know those longer sites wouldn't be against getting a site that would help the recoil can be a little bit a caress ship so you must take back control assert your dominance and pull that gun down don't let it kick you off don't let it nae you I don't know what I'm doing oh my you just got embarrassed oh my friend just saved me thank you my friend oh my god I just saw him spawn run as fast as you can you can't catch me I'm the gingerbread Maron they're spawning somewhere else now go to them yo is it me or just like this thing killed faster than that's unusual is that that's kind of what it feels like right here oh no he's over there fudge I got played like a fiddle now I don't really like fiddles actually you know if I'm being honest I don't know someone could probably play some musical sounds I might be able to point out a few instruments but if they played a fiddle about what the fudge is that thing it's a fiddle no no no idea what a fiddle sounds like oh no no no I say mmm this guns dirty I wants me to call it daddy or something whoo that a lot of issues you need to unpack there and suggest a psychologist I'm not trained for that tones up victory don't get me wrong that was fun but I'm heading in this scrapyard cuz I'm cotton price no actually just because the other game went to time just it's just a little slow for me you know I bet you guys don't have this gun yeah cuz you're smarter than me and didn't buy it hey it's for the content all right yeah look at the old scrap card here ah the good old days I remember getting some nukes here this one was pretty easy as soon as you get a Harrier like that's it you got a new in fact I'll show you I would sit up in that building on the second-story lay down Hall in the Harrier and then you just get that and then what the pave low whatever and then the nuke because back then killstreaks counted towards the nuke that's pretty easy killstreaks counted for killstreaks which in some regards I kind of well no I wouldn't really say I miss it that much no just became a killstreak fiirst uh-oh okay mr. fruit Wow I mean you got the kill but did you really deserve it what are you doing in me swamp get out me swamp oh yeah just needed it well played I must admit that hurt yeah I'm pushing I'm pushing the issue Wow oh god this Maps flowing weird right now though can't figure out where they're spawning they're in the strangest places they always seem to be on the edge of the map oh oh oh wow what you doing there Oh starting to my self and my aim I was asked my like right hand dude what you what you're doing you're my dominant one you're my a mean hand like come on don't fail me now actually that's a funny question that I don't actually know I'm sure there's some people watching who are a left hand dominant do you do you use Mouse with your left hand or have you just adapted to play with your right hand anyway like normal I don't know I don't know if that's like hard to do I mean all I know is using mouse in my right hand so just thinking about the other way hurts my head but I know some people do I just don't know if like that's all left-handed people and isn't it a little strange that for some reason we've developed that most people are right hand dominant like why would that be left hand dominant is obviously like a treatment not inferior what do you call like Oh what is going on here a non dominant trait that's the word I'm looking for so one you think it would have been like weeded out by now or whatever okay yep thanks for the stun dude in to those people who are ambidextrous is an thorn I don't know kind of sounds right I just said it so there we go ambidextrous how's that I wish I was you know we'll just interchange between your hands do anything like that no I dude I'm a one-trick pony right hand or bust oh my skill oh okay maybe mr. foots getting into his aim here I will say again you know anywhere pass like 10 feet it's a little hard to see things so I'm doing the best that I can okay I'm pushing Louie this though I'm pushing I can't find people it's like look maybe now they're behind me mama cranks running out but cranks run it out what happens do I die I do it was literally no fault of my own I ran around through the middle of the mat for 30 seconds I didn't find anybody bizarre where is everybody chilling these days - I miss a memo or something like okay okay I hear them over here fudge and then their dad back okay Oh check this out they're not gonna see this coming old old where the fudge that's gonna assassinate somebody I this is okay okay okay I found someone nice we're in business we're in business shops are open baby but at 50% capacity you know I'm saying guidelines are still in place but we're open got to make that money I'm a small business I'm one of the 40% it probably can't last through this so Florentine ah okay okay nice kill me nice kill come around I'm dead I'm technically a small or independent business definitely been rough but at least I'll I can stay in business and keep doing what I'm doing but obviously unemployment rates and stuff are at a huge high for a reason oh my oh I thought I got that kills like what but not just in the system makes sense okay ah so we got a guy being a guy huh yeah perching up where I used to is he shooting straight up I'm not I'm gonna be a hundred with you comments-section I have no idea who is shooting me okay well perhaps it was that man I don't know yes this is where they been all game what the fudge you guys make me sick yeah here I go bump bump bump bump bump ah God doosh doosh doosh oh what a job will kill this gun is absolutely nutty I want to level up to using a war zone obsidian here I come I'm just kidding with that said we'll be checking out the vectors soon so look out for that a Brazil is a fantastic I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] [Music]
