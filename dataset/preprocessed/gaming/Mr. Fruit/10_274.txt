heidi hello everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to more the last spell thank you for journeying with me on journeying me on this journey that doesn't let's get into it we are back once again night is almost upon us some of you have judged me for my barricade placements this makes sense i guess they only need one shot blah blah blah mr fruity dummy just go with reinforced walls ah pee pee poo poo you're not wrong uh but it's too late okay so here we go our economy is thriving i don't know if i needed to put down all the material camps and scavenger camps i might have been able to just wait on that but it's too late time is of the essence so let's just deploy our forces one perk pointer oh what who has a perk point [Music] oh it is okay well crossbow friend what would we want to give you extra multi-hits but you don't have any of that currently not that you might in the future but not going to do a lot for us right meal debuff said they can't dodge might not be the worst idea i've ever heard i think i'll do that just to be ready spaghetti equip my new gear okay i wouldn't really say new gear it's all poopy gear but this gives one movement speed pretty sure everybody already has yeah i've i've upgraded everybody's armor so never mind i have to decide with myself i think we put two people here again the question is do we go arranged or no poor supriya got your work cut out for you that's for sure all right maeve you'll chill here birdie you'll chill here we got two crossbows we got a crossbow here i guess two would have helped if we're gonna do a single person here but frankly i don't really see any other good way out of this i'm going to i don't think they can get to us i don't think so i'm going to buff us with our critical i'm gonna keep you right there you've got night movement speed that's plenty i'm gonna throw some evasion on you even though it doesn't matter armor you up to just because i can frankly um and yeah i think that's pretty much it as people point out too my armor value should always be halved when i'm getting hit by melee i forget that because physical damage melee damage is 200 damage to armor so this really only works against ranged people and magic so i need to keep that in mind when i'm trying to calculate whether or not we're going to take some damage um so way to go me but i want to say this is good might even you have seven movement you have six might even put maeve right here worst case i can kind of pivot not really but whatever all right screw it here we go night four without four people probably not my best idea but the crossbows already popping off or the ballistas my apologies how papaya of me arch is really harsh in my vibe but that's fine so now how do i slaughter them all that's always the question isn't it um the buff will last for a little bit i could increase our critical again but how many action points one two three or five or four i might use four but it all depends if i don't crit that's probably not gonna happen well our damage is 130 to 149. that should one shot everybody here especially if i so balls let's land some crits why don't we bop there's a crit bop and it's already ruined okay unfortunate really unfortunate didn't kill you either not how i plan this to go how much health do you guys have 20 so i can't even execute you you bone errors all right we high rope the pog we're getting a hit by the archer but we should be fine we're also going to get hit by him but he's doing 18 to 22. i think our armor would stand both of these good luck supriya now we're back up here i really wish i had other weapons because i totally forgot it it showed us during the tutorial whatever but totally uh past slipped my mind rather is even if you don't have your other weapon equipped it's it's status like perks and stuff still apply so if i had just like another one that was like plus 20 magic damage whatever and i'm not using it that'd be insane and i'm using this i would still be getting that bonus but i'm poor and i haven't had any other weapons so forgive me in fact i don't think anyone has yet no one has double weapons so we're not doubling up on any of that um whips but i guess i'm trying to decide can you hold it by yourself yeah i believe let's just do our magic first probably just debuff a whole bunch of people although it looks yeah it looks like you're going to gain 13 okay so we can use quite a bit of your mana quite a bit indeed requires line of sight of course it does stupid line it's like oh my god and i can't because of the stupid okay what if i did this aha i did not mean to double hit the archer budge okay well he's dead my bad how about just okay he's dead whoops well now suddenly we're just we're just popping off and i don't i'm not even trying to all right everybody's pretty weak everybody's really weak actually no one's even getting close to her walls maybe out close okay but see now i'm just trying to think though can i get back in time to shoot the other well maybe um i don't even have line of sight on him yet i don't have a choice so i could help you with this guy and then come back you're kind of vibing so why not uh i don't see a point in not just going ahead and finishing you off okay i should have saved one point maybe to help you move back but i can do that next time if i need to and then that's pretty much it looks pretty good to me chief all right a lot of runners don't like that but they're all getting taken out by the ballistas oh and you don't even get to melee me the ballista hits you first what are you shooting that random thing for boom okay so we do get minus one movement speed but didn't pierce the armor so that's the good news i'll also be able to take care of this oh man if i just moved i might be able to help a little bit or maybe not at all maybe not at all indeed okay maybe this one's up to you okay oh this always hurts the old noggin how much health do you have 20. yeah i can't execute you stupid i won't be able to shish kebab any crazy ways or anything because of how you're all positioned so maybe i'll just do this first and i think get here hit here it only takes one movement to leap over somebody that's nice uh i'll just weaken you and then i'll finish you and then what's the their best mobility like that so i should be fine right there um i think if i let's see if i come over here how many people could i even hit uh one two so i can use one of my shots let's just go with let me go here i guess so i can just make sure to hit him okay okay and that's all the help i can give you chili chef but then i can kill that we can you i have extra things but i can't do anything so whatever screw will just give you some dodge then i need to start maiming all of you as much as possibly hold on undo this he's going to be hitting our walls it's not good so before i decide to start killing anyone god they have all this armor and it ruins everything uh huh yeah we're gonna be eating up all this mana or whatever there's not much i can do about it oh that's four out of five just hit you for oh oh okay well then who even high rolled the bottom i think it was a crit i can't tell we have one extra point so let me see you're not hitting you will be you will be you're gonna be doing more damage so let's take care of you taking care of business every day taking care of business i'm working over time all right ballista light them up oh you don't even get to touch the ball no go for the archer what is you doing the damage though the walls these blasted arches they've got nothing else nothing better to do than be dead be a couple of bone bros [Laughter] because they're made out of bone i'll see myself out all right they're really starting to just a lot of them all right yeah i guess it's time i uh start pooping on kids if i could just move one more freaking thing that'd be sick but i can't i mean that's not bad i just don't really want to waste my hey let's see i can probably save uh okay we'll use another one of these name as many as i can perfect and let's just finish you off hurt you and then i'll give you an extra action point so dodged sick okay so if i do this now you should get two movement back so i could do this then do i get a move at all again i do so let's see what happens noise some good contact we're not going to get as good of value anywhere else so i'll just do this and then [Music] uh not miss you pog i should just use my mark to make sure i didn't miss that one but say lavi they're gonna start doing some damage but that's okay if let's see if this freaking if this archer could get out the way i'd be able to shish kebab but i don't think he's going to let me do that so instead i'm kind of boned because we don't do nearly enough damage no we don't uh well let me tell you these walls are about to be taken a licking and i can't execute any of you because you it's very annoying okay well then i'll just leave you in the front so close but you're wounded enough that we like it um i can't use that move anymore if i punch you will you die i need to hire all this are you kidding me i swear to god okay i can execute him okay so slight problem is i think the splitter will be hitting the wall or maybe not because this guy will go up trying to hit the wall now and then the ballista should hit him and then everybody else should be doing nothing i think it's my plan and i'm sticking to it it'll either hit me or the wall no he won't have a chance either way i don't think right alysta should go off here in a second good damage yeah oh wait i didn't realize yet there was one non-wounded that's gonna hit me oh okay that goes through the armor that wasn't an excessive amount of damage but it was still more than i'd like and if we take pretty much any more damage i'm gonna lose an action point which i don't want to do uh our wall is in shambles not surprised i skimped out um so many of you over here i'll just do this one because there's less to think about currently there's never enough room though for me to shish kebab everybody what the and no one will ever bother to just freaking die you kidding me well i gotta win this dude okay i can execute you don't mind if i do i can't get to you all right that's not bad uh you know what is bad the fact that i'm about to get pooped on by 8 million zombies hmm i think that through it's about as good as we're gonna get there i think that was not a very good turn no it's not my best all right we still we still got a couple uses here before uh we reach our mana threshold if i want full man the next day and i'll be getting the fourth one so i might be a little more liberal with my mana usage today i might want to see what i want to do here first i think 100 do you one shot guaranteed no you have to high roll of course you do so instead i'll use them to finish that off then hit you up her uh let me make sure i don't miss this nice demos um now i can give you another action point and i think i'll do just that uh let's see let's hurt you hyrule oh oh baby it's a crit uh okay now you all of you guys need to just uh chill till the next episode okay poc i'm gonna do it again except this time i think i should look for a couple more kill shots but then again there's so many archers and stuff i don't know no dodgers no dodges pog okay most this guy is one health will you just bleed out or something like what the fudge just go back and forth back forward and do the hunger you ain't do it all about all right let's see just how bad this goes huh okay nice kill ballista oh you hit the run at your nuts no hit the guy at the fence you stupid what shoot me past the fence rude oh my god oh the triple they didn't break my armor though man wait does all the movements speed stack up it does minus three movement points what up uh sound a lot help okay we've seen almost everyone oh jesus all right so we're just gonna have to keep these guys at bay as long as possible without dying clear this out asap and then we come help i think that's the only place so i'm gonna yeah i'm just gonna keep using mana i don't think i gotta be uh picky here just what what's our trying to see i think we just dunk on them like that okay then i'll need to do it again and then if i give you another action point you can use more of your mana how much do you regen not nearly as much but you do what you gotta do i could come over here and do this very nice okay that might even be enough for me to just dip now and start heading down this way let me debuff somebody for you bringing that guy so that you don't miss okay let's do some more uh let me i kind of don't want to kill so i can get my multi hits off and then i'll kill next go around all right now we full send just probably kill everything right high roll on that last one come on pog all right we're out of action points but everything else should be hitting walls all right friend glhf lhf indeed i could come back here high roll because we're nuts shish kebab through there kill you i need to get to her she's not wounded at all but i can't there is no possible way to do this we're going to sit right behind the gate like the coward we are hit the runner maybe let's see that's wait did one of those blisters mess kind of thinking this okay well we killed one these blisters are coming in clutch i tell you what i hated the walls anyway so that's fine we got a couple stragglers over here i don't like that but do i just full send this man in here i think i might okay don't kill anyone yet now go for anyone that's threatening panic on the city i'll just do the front line who's threatening things i don't like the archers screw we're going to sit a little bit more behind the wall they they'll probably cause some panic but they shouldn't be able to kill why are you not moving much i think you should be able to move more than that okay well i thought you'd be of some assistance but evidently not like over here can you see anyone no if you go over here can you see anyone no okay so you're actually useless okay so then i need to need to use all my energy here all right that's all i can do i've run as fast as i can help is on the way my friend oh wait i could do this hog feel different you're nuts still haven't wounded this person though i'll hurt you a little bit and then oh actually i'll just jump this so we're behind cover all right we're down to 26 so far no panic our walls are looking have looked better but aside from that we're chilling so far okay okay all right now you should be able to clean all this up yourself if not i'm ashamed oh my god you can't even we got one more thing we can kill pog now because i can't do that i'm gonna move back shoot the swimmers through what are you doing because he has an extra action point i can't do anything with and he gives two movements to be back so it's like we never did anything all right chill uh i think i'm gonna pierce here and then maybe just start lining up kills for [Music] our friend that's all i can do i'll debuff him even though i don't think that will do much for him um we can shish kebab here nobody died okay somebody done i can execute you can i execute you kill you easy hide behind the barricade you're a big chilling you're a big chill okay one action point and one here didn't move oh well i'll move him then the action points on the uh our arch which can't do anything okay so far panic is chilling come on ballista oh you dirty girl i've always hated these walls anyway so that's fine those barricades were meant to be broken i'm not exactly giving you a hard job i really just need you to not suck okay if you punch him what are we looking at death you're not okay we'll have you then clean up these people how much man do you get back four so i'm actually gonna shish kabob one more time well actually they're just like lined up perfectly to where i can't really i can execute this guy for free let's do that kill you what do you want to do kill them of course hurt them cars line of sight perfect can't help any other way oh yes i can hold on let me do this you're on your own over there is what i mean though easy okay now this is just like taking out the trash for you bob oh what the fudge except the trash didn't want to die and then run away all right just three people left we freaking did it look at that zero panic i mean yeah all the resources i put down we lost but i'm not too upset about it let's let's give yourself a crib okay we'll just sure and then that should mean bop bop let's go i'd say it's a pretty clean night yes only 21 hp lost and i think it was on supriya my apologies but so that's an s rating supriya holding down the fort again by herself holy that's city protection don't mind if i do see it seems like this jump doesn't matter at all i guess as long as you just don't let them get to the first tier but still getting free items that's nice 1500 essence that's nice night four well that was easy yeah s on night four oh and the fog just rolled in like two tiles or something wait what [Music] look at this that's 75 gold 60 free materials and a new item there's going to be an epic there wasn't what does this give us pardon me less accuracy but health health regen and magic armor dodge and magic block way off hand resistance and magic damage we can't put this on supriya because she has one arm [Music] so we could give it to one of these guys for the extra magic damage and block in the same vein we could also do this here because this we can only give this to um not maeve uh birdie because everyone else has two hand well maeve has a two handed and then again one hand this isn't bad i just hate the less accuracy i don't want to reduce anything accuracy-wise because god knows when we do that it's just freaking gg see i could give this to birdie or give this to anyone well no i guess birdie takes either these rings let's just go reinforce shield and hand it on over to birdie and so see this should still count if we swap weapon sets we're still going to get the block resistance and magic damage bonus so i don't think it's a bad idea i think i have enough tainted essence to get that extra ap ability oh booba welcome to the oraculum commander so that's your true form uh the unfathomable inextinguishable can carnal pure ecstasy behold the true face of your savior am i luscious petty human does the shape of meat please you yum i now get rid of this exposition will you sell your tainted essence to me dear you're freaking me out man don't make it weird oh yes we can and here's a generator of another five minute i feel like i definitely go for this one too they're just too good not too man all right so they're coming from the opposite ways now we have quite a bit of gold i would like to build and then i think i have to build it i don't really have a choice here but let me see i thought i upgraded i thought i'd upgraded one of our wait did i already upgrade all my gold mines i can't remember improves passive production rate that's very nice i feel like i should i should unlock this on everything real quick because like let's see worker wise it'll take what three four workers then we'll be left with nine and then two four six i think we got enough just clean all this out so i think all the rubble's gone nicely done me so then increase production because i'm actually getting my gold back so i'm going even technically on these upgrades this round at least then we can upgrade it to 100 but so see i just don't know this only happens with the passive production which would give us 50 gold every morning which will pay itself off real fast but the problem is we need an n right now so i'm gonna do that first before anything else and then let's see how much you guys cost we get gregory for five 110 but he's level five comes with minus one bag spot extra movement point but less mana extra resistance daily health regen extra range damage he's holding like a scepter or something it's not terrible it's not great [Music] i mean it's really it's really not that bad i guess we could make him ranged we don't have to otherwise we get like sandra level three minus two block but extra movement and then jack of all trades i think she has a the melee staff looks like i don't remember what that was called this guy's got a pistol and a shield he's level three thirty percent extra experience geez 10 reliability i think i would just go with gregory right just because the level five is that good but then again i don't think i'm gonna get enough gold to do that so let's get our gold first that leaves me with seven workers five workers this will lead me down to three let's grab our gold okay i definitely have enough to grab gregory a prowess has been accomplished oh has it now do tell we gained the cursed set sure get me outta e let's see what gear do we have herself a long [Music] have i bow i don't think i've used a long have i it comes with long shot what is it watch out so it just gives 40 dodge it's pretty good snipe shot range 7 to 14 with no dodge it costs 2 movement though interesting and then arctic blast not a ton of damage but targets nine people with a 50 chance to stun minus 10 reliability which is unfortunate but extra daily maintenance region we could give another a better crossbow where are you the only difference between these is this gives plus three critical and i think that's worth it everyone's got decent armor i guess everyone doesn't have the best pants though kinda think i can sell all the armor i don't need all the armor okay let's think i've got three workers left i could use them all my production and then whatever gold i have left over i can figure it out i guess improves production effect that's good but not what i want right now yeah let's just go get a hero griggery duh freaking welcome friend [Music] you weren't cheap that's for sure but you're worth every coin i'm sure of it 40 more gold which structure would i want i think i need to get c or asap manuel and temple i think i can kind of greet out a little bit longer so maybe i save gold or i could just get increased nah i think i'll wait all right so my workers are all good to go perfect math there we had just the right amount what can i say i'm built different this does mean we could um buy some new gear too so grigory for instance mainly seems to want to do range damage we don't have to specifically go according to that it might be good i'm trying to look i've never used this scepter before [Music] i don't know if melee is the play um raining crystal less experience gain but two extra action points [Music] whoa but it costs three mana and two movement points uh i don't really like that oh extra multi hits i wish they had a hand crossbow thing here i'd be all about that where's birdie difference between novice's wand and wand i think this one just has better flat damage yeah it appears really the only thing i could equip this for less accuracy pass none of these weapons are killer the question is what do i want gregory to use i could buy him the longbow let him have fun with that [Music] why not i'm gonna get this power ring for now i'll give it to um birdie and then if i get a hand crossbow i'm definitely gonna swap that over we got 34 more gold um [Music] i know so many options i don't know what to do oh me oh my all right i think i'll save all right gregory you can keep that on you i guess let's swap that and throw this on birdie come here birdie all pal perfect all right now let's start leveling everybody up birdie wants for show and none of these and none of those okay you rarely receive healing but yeah i guess okay but here comes the fun part patience super good i should have honestly bought the other wand though because we always have like an extra thing to use whatever first man and consuming skills definitely tempting i think we can do that yeah thrifty it is thank you very much sapria my one-handed queen let's give you eight percent extra physical damage yup and we can keep going with the momentum [Music] a little gamble we don't know if we're gonna get something better these aren't the best rolls but [Music] i don't know if i want to risk the biscuit because that's not not necessarily bad perks for you [Music] debating could do the armor master and they need to have 10 movement i think i'm not mistaken less damage but extra critical power and uh magic damage you don't need first man and consuming skill used during the turn you almost don't use mana in the first place patient you're you're usually using everything aren't you uh i don't even know what traps are yet we haven't gotten there so really yeah there's nothing crazy [Music] so either movement play dead or patient [Music] oh maybe giving you back protection isn't the worst [Music] let's let's just give you more movement all right you got 10 now we're making our way downtown this is our archer um yeah sure just five percent ranged i don't want a gamba uh better daily management might be worth it because you're not getting a lot back but honestly i think i'd rather prefer like accuracy or something [Music] let's see what perk i'm gonna give you thrifty could be really good then i don't have to worry about it quite as much action points and movement points stored could actually be pretty good too while at full health 50 extra reliability which currently with your current one doesn't matter that much you would be doing 80 to 85 i believe if my math correct if that's how that works so you don't have a big variance i mean it would be nice i guess to be a little more consistent but i think we go with thrifty and then uh i'll go daily main region whatever now grigory this is where the fun starts for you my friend you can do pretty much anything you want two extra movement points that sounds great another movement point that might be a little excessive i don't like any of these gamba that wasn't good [Music] um am i really good do i want to gamble again gamba all right sure you get four blocks congrats you don't use physical damage [Music] just give you extra block i don't know what the god if you if you went physical damage i should have just swapped to that you'd have like thirty percent physical damage down don't want to fudge i gave you some range damage [Music] 20 more points four accuracy yes please um daily main region sure accuracy you know it this is our last one reliability up 20 that's pretty good all right giving you experience now might not be that that impactful so instead we'll give you steady aim i don't think you have propagation or multi-hits in any kind of fashion or whatever don't you have the chance to stun you do we could make it a 65 sure let me get you something else maybe cherry picking extra reliability on isolated enemies [Music] and then i think you either get how much man would you want to use you have one mana one mana nothing crazy so we could practically cash for free however i feel like confident for you could be a good idea yeah because you actually lose reliability on this thing anyway oh screw it we're gonna counteract that we've got a good amount of defense material things to use here so unfortunately none of my crossbows are really at the ready here um let's see if we can double up i'll put one here it doesn't need vision i'm just worried on how it's gonna prioritize targets i think i'm just gonna do it here and then one here god they're so expensive though yeah is that even worth it [Music] all right i won't put a wall on one of the sides um i'll put melee oh well this is a bit wider i'll put melee over here because we're going to want people to be able to rotate a little bit quicker so i'll put the gate here i don't think i have enough yet to really use reinforced yeah i don't have enough all right that's just enough to cover that with all this on fire it's not going to make that easy but that's the best i got i reckon so let's end the phase okay gregory your time to shine buddy you've got omega range so worst case if someone needs to rotate i'll put you there supriya glhf they're gonna be so cl i have to try and get like the seer next time i don't even know if i'll have enough gold but i gotta push this stupid fog back it doesn't give me a chance at all uh birdie you'll chill right over here where's our other one mave i'll put you right here you'll go right there you're gonna sit here but you could possibly well you you probably need the most line of sight right look at the range yeah you'll have best lines of sight over here so there may be birdie over here something like this let's give you crit uh just arm yourself up arm yourself up and dodge yourself up girl all right this can only go very very i'm not very the bad it is nice go crossbow go only we had more they're already hitting the walls is that even legal what the fudge man oh well sausage fun but again see like if i had the thing pushed back i could at least see more what was coming and then also pick them off but i can't and of course we got bats there's always bats all right well what do you want to do with your life birdie live your life i can't target like anything and these bats are already gonna pose a problem because who's gonna get to them i guess i gotta rotate birdie even though we're gonna have tons of people i don't know figure down a second let's see what what damage you can cause friends can't target you okay well then why don't you come back any line of sight okay screw me oh wait i can't ah fudge are you kidding me all right well that was prepaid of me really preparing me hold on i gotta save a movement so i can get behind the gate or do i even need to do that okay i guess i already did so yeah me all right apply another critical that's not a good start okay let's just double check what you got we can give people dodge we can of uh pierce any dodge and just do a lot of damage frankly only one target but the range is freaking massive and it's a good amount of damage or we can stun people okay or we just shoot people so what if we how far back would i need to do for this still can't even touch him what the fudge i don't have any more movement speed all right i can do this twice then it'll cost all my mana oh i just realized too he yeah he was generated with six action points oh shoot that's so good uh so let's see what you want to do do what you're born with your bone with my body do with your bone and put your ball with my body or speaking you weaken you kill you and then we'll just let you clean up i'm gonna like this long though i tell you what all right eight action points remaining yeah yeah you're telling me what the fudge is acting hot time time what what did you just do holy suck i just want to beat night five man stun resistance 50 does this guy is flat 25 damage every time and it's magic and it's 250 health okay that's pretty good and why why is everything in their mom going over here can we talk about that why are you guys they said you'd be coming this way not this way when they're like oh arrow's showing this they should have been like arrows this way with the fudge that ruins everything does is this even shooting anything i don't know well when in doubt slice it out what else am i gonna do oh nice high roll or crit on all those what the you're nuts lord if i went over here can i give you another no i can't so let me do it right now can you one shot these you don't want shot them anymore what are you good for six multi hit so that's nice dodge that's not nice i can't reach anything further so screaming please stop dodging i'm begging you please stop dodging i hate you now run back behind the wall that's as good as we get there and then yeah what the fudge do we do about this huh how much damage are we doing because it feels like not enough this will do a lot do you have any block you don't you're out of range of course you're to be fair i can be pretty far back though crit no what why did i do 111 wait when i hover over this it says 177-194 yeah against everybody else it does butt loads of damage what the fuzz is like what's you don't have any black you don't have any armor what am i missing oh cuz the farther you are you've got to be kidding me i can't really go farther man watch all right well what are you gonna do aside from cry out of range oh my gosh now all my range people suck because they're all so close get away from me i can't she can't do enough damage it's as good as we got kill that thing you go over there let me debuff you sure i don't know what we're gonna do here but we're gonna do something an arctic blast here might be just what the doc ordered come on stun m pog and whoever didn't stun it practically killed pog you are not as much of a threat as him although it's barely going to go through his armor so at that point does it really matter let's kill this guy okay we've beaten knight five haven't we i think we've done this before it's why is it so difficult and i see some bats over here being dummies there go our walls okay what the heck what's going i see a couple baddies what and i don't mean baddies is like bad guys i mean bats like bats everywhere leave me alone oh ebay i mean cabeza the sad thing too is my line of sight i i would have to be here go all the way over here to see these guys so i gotta kill who i can while i can if i go here i can hit still can't hit that bat but i can hit u u u u u u long then use the rest of our mana shakes for ah five for six darn it they lived somehow they're lucky the others won't be hyrule oh my god you're the best this will do a lot more damage uh i can execute you kill you kill you kill you and then chill out again you've done your country proud and kill that thing all right well this guy's this side's going much better then there's this side and it's a fiesta let me tell you i got to worry about the bat splitter the i assume the ballistas can hit the flying things right oh i guess i'm betting a lock there the fact that this mainly takes movement speed though more than man is nice quite nice um i don't know how do i want to do this i think i get the most value piercing shot here and then i need to do as much damage to somebody you're a big guy and i don't like that death to you and take that oh that's the crate or something all right now let's just start cherry picking we got four shots we're going to use them all i like this long though yes i do how about you it's gonna take another two but we get three kills and then just let's wound you more severely yes and then just farm those movement points how am i gonna low key i think i have to wait for them to destroy this wall i don't think i have a better option because if i try and wrap around oh wait wait i got a crossbow over there that should be helping okay they do hit the flying things now there's two of those things and there's bats in like every which way but see at least that gets the runner oh that was like the entire wall are you kidding me because look at these things we got bats there bats here about i'm surprised they're not just randomly coming through here without even telling me why not right and then look at this one two three four five six seven did you did you knock down what all seven things right there or something for six because apparently this was already broken oh i'm just gonna say this we're gonna we'll be lucky to make it out of here if the entire city isn't panicking because uh it ain't looking good chief uh what this won't even kill it no these guys are just tankier i don't understand i guess oh it says their resistance is higher maybe they resist range damage more for whatever reason well it's a good thing this side is all range damage 100 percent gonna have to freeze everybody in their mom this takes two action points but i don't see another way out of it we froze two people please freeze more 65 man come on i gotta kill the runners right yeah was this one not gonna kill anything wound you 100 got to use our uh shenanigan right here although i should be focusing everyone that's not stunned good golly mrs molly come over here out of range son of a can i jump over this big brain oh my god you didn't die and i don't want the city to panic so i don't have a choice let me debuff you kill the runner before he gets out of hand although there's an i don't know i genuinely don't know get back here for okay there's a barricade in front of me which is nice and then our line of sight isn't obstructed that poorly i have to hope that works in our favor all right there's so many and i see more of these lobbying penises that's right they're lobbing penises at me i can't even target them god you need to see her so bad oh we need to give you more mana all right whatever i'm going to kill things either way oh i can hit this dude now wait a second just don't high roll for once oh you okay well whatever oh actually i didn't have enough mana to finish anything else off so i gotta kill that before it gets out of hand hi me and then shish kebab you shish kebab you shish kebab all of you boy kill you and run behind my gate oh you're just gonna keep chilling here buddy you're doing great i don't know i thought this one was going better and now it's it's all going downhill i don't know maybe see i invested all my gold and i felt like i did as about as well as i could but i think we need better gear like weapons i don't know maybe the hero i picked wasn't good or making them an archer wasn't the right play i don't know i don't know maybe the ballistas are a bait i don't seem like it but what do i know what the all this dude can just hover over of course you can don't you dare touch my ballista you sick son of a all right the city believe that city panic though jesus people are not happy understandably so um i'll just might requires line of sight what can you kill him you can't okay thank you um oh but it's literally eight million stunned something you've done most of them actually stunned everything you didn't kill way to go that's big uh this ballista is an imminent danger i don't like that not a fan of that this is not going to do nearly enough damage what the yo did a runner get by me no that one's still stunned um how do i how does one uh kill what you can this requires the rest of your action points but it could potentially stun a whole bunch of people which god knows we need it's time to everyone except that guy that's pretty big i'm not gonna lie to you it's a hit it's a hit now this guy still be doing 15 but that's not crazy so i need to make sure i don't miss this guy right didn't even get through his armor okay well screw our end leave the end alone man i just bought it it's really expensive real estate value come on man we're all at x points over here chief so oh suck wait wait wait wait wait minus two action points i just who debuffed me this is it why am i what that ruins everything oh suck well this is bad as if it wasn't bad enough before what i don't know what happened i'm not able to multi-hit him of course i can't hit you now though god these stupid bats man gotta weaken as much people as i can we're spending all of our cash i don't have a choice i wish i did okay and then just finish this guy off this guy's gonna poop on us i don't know what else to do oh i should have finished him off i don't know what i'm doing uh run back here you run back here i don't know oh i mean we're down to the last wave like what we see is what we get now but jesus i don't think we'll lose here i'm just hoping we don't lose any buildings our economy is in shambles at least um hey see let me see what he debuff at least our um they haven't even touched one of our actual buildings but whatever minus two action points it is these little boner things fudge i hate them look at the city there's no way i kill everything in here what the fudge at least i have all my action points back sweet moses i hope you didn't want any of your mana birthday cause we ain't got time for that you see we're gonna we're gonna tag everything we can the next one we're going for every kill shot that we can okay kill shot kill shot i don't need to worry about that right now hopefully kill shot hopefully kill shot not quite a kill shot so i'm gonna insure it okay now the rest is up to you my friend hold the line but you're really not gonna kill him either way well then we'll cut a swath this way if this doesn't kill word troll okay so then i gotta use this on you then i'm gonna get you to do some of that and then how much damage you can do like a hundred damage holy jesus your armor does not stand a chance it's not hitting a building now currently though so i think i'm gonna get you to run back here i just don't want to get hit by the minus action points but i don't think there's any way i stop it frankly so this guy will be able to hit me though fudge okay well then what about these guys jesus and then he's gonna get on i don't know whatever going on over here our bullishes haven't fallen that's nice you have minus action points of course we have to try and freeze as much as we can again that might be the entire turn again you have no more mana oh suck well that's bad requires line is height oh no hold on jump over a wall this saves us a little bit the side some of these are just not going to die and there's not much i can do man i'm killing what i can that's big i come over here and point blank you gonna take a couple fudge me weaken you a little bit and this boner is going to try and hit me so i come back here he can't i might just corner myself though i don't know oh god all the city panic there goes my free items and gold and materials ah jesus right sweet i i get to knight five and this just i'm propagating am i just that bad at this game i don't know minus two action points i didn't need them anyway if i guess they can choose to do that or attack though that's interesting all right this side is looking a little more well is it oh my god my ballista no it's not okay you have no more mana so we just gotta do this old school which means you might have to punch because we want to be able to use all of your action points that's nice uh we gotta use more of your mana [Music] and one more time wait oh you have enough action points right of course you don't i can't stop jesus he's gonna i can't shish kebab because there's a water there wait if i go here no i don't do this this is definitely a puzzle currently all right that's probably maximum value we're gonna get there i'm gonna hide behind the tent so that you don't reduce my action points and then pray you don't kill or production i don't know wait wait wait i might be able to how much more movement will you have you have three i think it's worth it you're gonna get pooped on but i'll try and take some heat off you i can't afford much though um where'd the boners over here go where'd he go did we kill him i don't remember killing him what happened oh oh this crossbow probably okay pog way to go crossbow way to come in clutch um i'm not far enough away of course i why aren't i killing you anymore wasn't i just killing you last turn in one shots requires line of sight what oh my god ballista get out the way i also have to point blanket what the well what else am i gonna do oh my god net now they're two oh  we are in a bit of a pickle here folks that doesn't even i think the blisters dead unfortunately okay well punch how much is this gonna do not enough oh we're desperate can you tell oh my god you're not dead he's not doing a lot of damage though maybe i can chill with it all right trying to think how i salvage this if at all there's much damage to those things okay where are you going if i come back here how many action points you got left you can punch your way through this who needs a bow let him know i can't hit you um now let's just stop him from hitting that building okay i'm puckered i'm so puckered nice job ballistas great job oh thank you actually on the kill puck the n is not liking it oh okay there goes the armor oh they debuff me i think they double debuffed me wait oh less resistance okay still that means i only have three i know we're close to salvaging this whole thing i have to keep this ballista alive i tell you what it's way too expensive i do this okay figure that out later kill kill kill severely hurt now i'm out of this i'll just punch freaking punch shoot you shoot you all the last ones one two three four five oh it the number didn't update when i looked i was like uh we're missing somebody this is the last bit of my mana do i might not have to um no hyrule of course that means boom okay just one two two left what oh all right that's what i say okay i'm controlled all right we did it i think we'll at least live to the third exclamation mark bro these fifth nights brother i tell you what they hit different still have yet to get anyone to level seven we can survive the next right night all right guys right oh so a few things i wish i'd gotten a free free item we could have used that no it's a lot of essence though to be frank it's an a it doesn't feel like an a holy i can unlock something yes but what blah blah blah sheesh we're on our way to another five mana and give me all my goodies thank you thank you thank you thank you we do have 277 gold hold up could increase your capacity by one and get another one but um i don't uh yeah i don't know i i need to buy the seer i need to push this garbage back dude please let's level up first there's such bad gear man unless you're buying gear you like but it's so expensive another sword though and extra physical damage okay focus level up we need some extra physical damage on you yes ma'am daily mana regen not worried about it um five percent extra damage not really worried about more momentum sure whatever if we rerolled i know it's just gonna be trash i should power but less damage it's just a bad idea i don't know what to put on you next girl you're not even full health maybe play dead because we might lose you what's my current health regen no idea daily health regen 21. i'd get 10 armor yeah i don't think that's really worth it uh i don't know [Music] either play dead or slowly build up my crit i think i guess play dead it's this way if i need to sacrifice him i can i don't want to but we might not have the luxury of choice this is all garbage for you so whatever we'll just take block i guess and accuracy lord knows we need that was increased by 50 of the cur kira's current mana that's only seven magic damage but seven percent right 18 i don't know what dance four is it we get you an extra movement point could give you more reliability patient might be the play um whatever we'll just go magic fuel yeah we got seven percent whatever i don't know what else to grab uh you my friend need none of that yeah extra movement point i'm not risking it now that's good 12 extra accuracy yes please or has that been my whole life patient maybe maybe we don't have good crit chance i don't think it's worth it while at full health greater reliability again doesn't you know what we're just gonna do it whatever it can't hurt now i need to build new structures i think i gotta build this here doesn't feel like i have a choice pretty desperate right now we want to build it though sure oh what is this oh that's my question for christmas well that's not very helpful i could have already told you i'm gonna be seeing those what is this moves the fog line two tiles further from the city what it takes three workers though one worker reveals the ratio per direction of incoming enemies oh that's that's really helpful unless the guess who build it reveals the fullest of enemies requires two workers okay first off i'm gonna repel this stupid fog real the ratio per direction coming in these how about i get my gold first these four workers okay i think we can do this that has two skulls that so the same amount i paid for it just to tell me it's gonna be fit infinity whatever this is nice i like this thing was a good investment we could upgrade to get another hero still but i think i might have to wait until next turn to do that if we make it through this night cause i just don't think that's gonna happen i don't need to repair you yet that will help hopefully i might need to repair you upgrade wait first twice assuming targets are available wait i never bothered to look if they could be upgraded oh ho ho well i like this recruit new heroes i don't have a room man i don't want you talking about so i might need to buy some new gear and i'm going to need more defenses but to be fair i've already i'm not going to invest in any more crossbows right now i don't think you're ballistas i don't know why i keep calling them crossbows um so we won't need as many materials i'm buying some new gear man this sword doesn't seem bad um plus two mana regen extra skill range extra accuracy and extra healing received that seems kind of nuts but health mana resistance is it also pretty good daily main region a scroll i've never used those maybe those are good and i've never really bought consumables that's probably good too i mean to be fair this is the first time i feel like actually money i can spend i'm gonna improve passive production on two of these i think right what else what other structures would i want temple and manuel the manual seems pretty good but i think i'm still able to wait on that armormaker blacksmith bower magic shop those are also all really good but if i just do this you know i feel like it'll just pay more out more dividends in the future we're just gonna keep upgrading and then i'll have enough to buy stuff in the shop let me do that improves production effect gold 25 to 55. i mean it costs a lot don't get me wrong all right we have nothing else to do with our workers so we're gonna get some materials right nearly four hundo let's buy some gear i think we just get a better sword this seems too good to not do i don't have enough i'm one gold off are you kidding me is this real life here's the thing i could give this to her on her second one to swap in between but it doesn't give us any extra benefits and yeah we pretty much never run out of like we can use all of our action points she has enough different skills to make it work so extra skill range i think we'll give this to birdie again but this does mean you can sell this now i could get this if i wanted i guess my problem is i still just don't really understand resistance because see this is resistance reduction is that the same thing that's just the one thing i'm not completely clear on giving birdie this wad isn't a terrible idea some potions maybe i don't know maybe i don't get the helmet but maybe i get the helmet i don't know at the very least give this to birdie oh you already have a trinket though so you do not want this okay so who wants better mana regen and skill range i don't think skill range works with melee right i don't think that's how that works that'd be broken i could just stack that yeah i think that's how it works let's say it's between maeve or gregory gregory already has insane range i'm thinking we go here and you get a little extra accuracy oh yeah yeah there you go there you go champ then i wait on buying anything else no new structures to get could repair a little bit needs 80 gold oh jesus screw that so let's build some defenses do i go reinforce wooden walls yet are we boozy enough yet let's do some math here 30 we need one i'd probably demolish that two one two jesus christ three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve i'd have a gate 12 that's 360 that's like all of our materials but it would be all reinforced when walls but that means i'd also keep these as barricades because i wouldn't swap them out um balls maybe i'll i'll i'll do one every other i'll put a gate there uh gate rodder uh-huh and then destroy destroy destroy this only hampers possible line of sights so whatever i have enough for one more of those all right that's a good compromise some strong some not some strong some not we got our ballistas unlocked to prowess something about probably buying or placing a certain amount of defenses or spending a certain amount build 200 defenses unlock stone wall stonewall defense stirred in this wooden counterpart but at the cost of blocking eyesight yeah i think that's what the city kind of gets at the start i can only imagine how much would this cost 60. let's reinforce stonewall or stonewall for 45. which might not seem like that's much of a step up oh do it but we lose line of sight which big deal pretty big deal if you ask me we have no way to get past that aside from ballistas currently and very few weapons or skills seem to uh ignore that and i don't think we have any of that so with that we head into night six pray for me my friends please please pray for me i'd really like to beat this next one that'd be nice a man can dream and i feel pretty confident we got four heroes and if we survive that's just it i'm gonna have five heroes probably because i should have enough gold to buy someone else from the end and then we're going from there and the seer freaking sick i can keep pushing this miss back which is huge cannot understate how big that is all right maybe we stabilized maybe yeah as i said like everyone's still rocking like default weapons pretty much suck what do you do i would like if if we can survive next night without city panic i'll be able to get something for free i think that's maybe why i should also start building production buildings to start getting better gear maybe that's next i don't know with that said i want to thank you all much for watching have yourself fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] so you
