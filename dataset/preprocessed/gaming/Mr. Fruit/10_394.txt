hi there everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. another destiny 2 video so soon mr fruit schwartz is going on i'll tell you exactly what's going on my lady a brand new exotic is what's going on with week two of season of the chosen they released the dead man's tale exotic mission mr fruit i love you i love you more it's fact long short they all in the same way that's right we got ourselves another tex mechanic exotic rifle my favorite but generally text mechanic are my favorite because i got the whole west vibe going on here and even better we get an exotic lever rifle that's right it's a scout rifle but who really cares because like i said it's a lever rifle it's freaking sick it's intrinsic trade chaining precision hits grants bonus damage and quickens reload speed short skinny to the point nothing complicated that's what we like about text mechanica but here's the interesting thing it has flute it has hang up but transformative this is only the second exotic after hawkmoon to have future drops of this weapon will have random roles so what can it roll with will it be make it better is there a god well to be searching for i don't know there is a catalyst socket we don't know what the catalyst is yet as far as i'm aware and i haven't used it yet i went through the mission and i will say the mission was sick that much i got a little party down here it just knocks those people in oh you want to hug come here buddy bring it in here we go so yeah the mission was sick i hope they do more stuff like that there was like puzzles mazes and it was all super fun except for this that's right after spending like 10 15 minutes to get the stupid boss to like it was literally last cycle i was like yes and whatever so i shouldn't have to tell you all what's up because we're headed into pvp we're off to battle and i need to decide what super we're going to use here you know i'm basic dude i'm i'm just kind of a hammer kind of guy so see we have a sky rifle maybe we should get something more close quarters i don't have a shotgun so smg it is and sure all right i haven't even equipped it yet so let me [Music] look at this thing oh you like the little lever rifle uh huh and then it reloads two at a time and it comes with an a anti barrier rounds apparently as you can see bottom left but who cares about all that shenaniganery because i have this thing okay that there's a lot of flinch there all right a lot going on cannot be held responsible for what happens to me a scout rifle though i didn't look at the rpm is it very fast doesn't seem excessive but i will say okay we did 81 with one headshot hit one to start stacking the buffs i don't we're doing 87. suddenly this man is dead we got 66 going on here okay cranial spike times two that's a sick sound and buff come here i don't know what that guy's using but it sounds dirty wait is he using the same thing we might be using the same thing hipfire hipfire hipfire i feel like ash and overwatch i'll figure out your name next time and i'll see if you two are using dead man's tail dead man walking how can he tell a fudge dead man can't tell no lies he can't spin a web of lies deceit and stories he only tells the raw truth look at that accuracy and the aim assist let's be real that's pretty generous come on come on would that do this skirt skirting left and right holy cow come on i guess i got that together am i gonna am i going to contest absolutely not i'm just going to say absolutely i got one i got one headshot stack two headshots stacked three headshot stacks we were doing 97 to the dome there i'm practically two shot and right salvador salvo huh well grenade launcher huh i will say this is nice the aim assist is indeed insane i don't know okay wait who's that core man i'll kill yeah yeah my man core man using the dead man's tail he knows what's out but i know it with the very least that five stacks leave that we're doing 63 base damage but then suddenly get a clear and now 91 out of nowhere if you find somebody with enough resistance and by enough i mean not enough hold on i'm trying to kill this dude that is very debatable caveman take that what a prenate didn't work ooh but i like the little animation when you pull the gun back out okay we traded oh he was using the dead man's tail i'm usually not a scout rifle kind of guy but i can make an exception currently this is the closest thing we have no land beyond whatever and even then it's not even like remotely close so i don't entirely know what i'm talking about but you get it okay oh we're gonna stasis oh how fun how fun it's just wild west dude give me any wild west gun and i'm there we got what last word huckleberry which unfortunately i think of all the text mechanica huckleberry has had its least amount of time to shine then we have uh other ones somebody help me out here should be able to remember them all but for some reason i can't right now oh dude what the fudge oh my god i'll take the kill jack could easily cosplay his ass you ready just bob go get him you know what i'm saying get him bob all right can't see anything i love this where to come from where to go stasis is really stupid favorite song to sing in wild west days little known fact okay wow i missed way too many shots on him we eventually got it don't get me wrong but it just didn't feel good the guy's level 64. no season pass what the fudge what is this i'm almost 16. is that even legal like a level 20 he's 51 what the fudge all right we just got some real grinders out here i guess they also probably do the bounty hoarding thing i don't do that then again i hardly do bunnies in the first place so that makes sense all right now let me show you what a full auto dead man's tail looks like okay or maybe i won't maybe i won't show you what that looks like because that's just too powerful what could one man do with all that power oh i know absolutely obliterate the enemy come on girl high chasing my lips faith their desire to swing your hips in the brain down a little more realistically though it's like with the big iron on his heel big iron only here there's some other wild west songs wow we both suck buddy i walk the line i walk the line i be the boo homies all this time i will just decline i walk the line okay yeah i'm realizing when it comes to wild west songs i know about a word two words maybe in sequence and then that's not even full sentences to be fair okay here i go here i go here i go skirt skirt okay wow i just could not make up my mind see we're doing pretty solid though considering i'm still apron you know we're going in it's like wait a second this is a scout rifle you need long range what if i just said no and i make up my own rules you're stupid you see i don't even need a clever comeback i just ruined his career you're stupid ha drop the microphone that's all you got that's all i need what do you mean there's a kill come on give me another one don't give me that one no don't give me that one sir you can go away okay oh okay making a new bid on the scout he says absolutely except i'm dominating with the new scout okay apparently i was hitting my barrier i don't know yes sir i didn't mean to type that cast huh it's like i'm yelling at him yes sir yes sir he's like oh jeez all right i was just asking here we go this doesn't matter so i throw my hammers get a couple of second kills don't know why i'm singing so much in this video it's just one of the host days well we um second you know second most kills and stuff so we got here elimination absolutely not rumble possibly ranked nice one showdown no i do like me a rumble test but this is a scout rifle you know and robot means we're gonna be getting a couple smaller maps and i ain't about that so we boot up control once again what i like about it and i guess also at the same time what i don't like about it is how straightforward it is it's like boom here you go here's the trait but i wish there was a second one that kind of you know mixed it up a little bit but then again who carries with the lever action rifle baby and they done messed up so you can get an ornament for it of course but i actually think it's worse i don't like it it covers up the gun with the stupid looking hand-me-down levi's that you tore apart and threw over your gun okay the best part of the text mechanical weapons are that wood the gold the black that's that good stuff worm haven okay all right all of it okay ooh nice trials armor couldn't be me you know not going to touch trials with a 10 foot pole what's that there's a new pulse right foot i ever get yeah uh missed me with that because here's the thing it's an old pulse rifle to the messenger which we had back in d1 but we're gonna get some good rolls or whatever with it oh i didn't think i would meet somebody right here hey get your head in the game but i should take your head out of the game what's on your face you got a little something all over i've heard a lot of people have found success with accutane or whatever maybe you could uh maybe look into that okay wow that's just a grenade launcher special grenade launcher correctly one shot me probably can't one chopping two you know why not oh and that's a shotgun all right i lied maybe i just won't get the chance to shoot this thing the good news though about this exotic rifle is that as long as you you need the season pass but as long as she has the season pass literally to get the exotic it's a mission one mission so all you got good team shot batman the fudge wait moses lord above i guess i'm sticking with my team because i don't have a chance or choice you are getting chased my friend by a shotgun fiend i got him it wasn't pretty but i got him well now i'm hip firing like a fiend bada bing about a boom bop get in there bob let me just clean that up you got a friend over there oh my god okay time street cranial spike how long does this last i don't know let me see if i can stack it let me see if i can stack it come on now it's gone all of it all my stacks are gone oh nice barrier that we can shoot through i should think about doing that from time to time oh my god they're all so weak throwing my nade through there oh he's dead he's on he's got to be dead right he's 100 dead if he's not dead oh it's because i was burning a barrier rip me none got debated there has been a noticeable lack of western brawl through this video and that's 100 my fault and i apologize i know better i should be doing better quite frankly come on now it's not every time we get to use the western gun out here in the space world of destiny i want to feel like a real rootin tootin space cowboy yeehaw brother oh that was nice looking and of course you pushed me where there's keep on dancing to the rocking road saturday night you have a shotgun or is that a grenade launcher doesn't matter my friend was there to assist me thank you fred in fact this does have anti-barrier mods why is that is that do i have that actually on my armor i might actually just have it on my arm look at the range though oh dang it i thought the anti-barrier rounds might be intrinsic but they were not false alarm my apologies still though this season they can get it which is still nice right what is going on over here the chosen strength prismatic linton's acquired i don't know what happened but i did it get stasis come out completely outplayed how does that feel huh feels real good don't they're gonna they're gonna spawn see i'm calling it no they're not they're still spot responding see i knew it never doubted myself see if i can just oh right there oh that's what i'm doing that's what i eat that's what we like right there give me the range let me pop my super tube before i never use it because that's me every time i might why why are you like this see and and then the one time i decide to pop it what do you know it's the dude with thunder crash right next to me because it's grooming ooh buddy old pal i think you're getting um tethered or at least they tried oh he's soaked come on fight me with a primary all right i mean like a real man well technically fighting light is no fighting line is energy because it's void i'm saying let's duke it out primary battle come on machine we'll see the real one is after that huh oh my god i'm also not fighting to my strengths though i should be sitting back having that long range with no fall off that's what a scout rifle does best but maybe i shouldn't do you've got to be kidding me what the fudge hey that boy do be zooming though i need those longer range engagements with my scout rifle are you what what is happening right now okay i'm hiding oh turns out you can feel pain you are so dead my fr that guy's level 84 in the season but 73 how it's been what eight days eight days what do you all do you're all at manimals good lord not even mad i'm genuinely impressed 100 has to be bounty hoarding doesn't it oh look at that dude i try and get a decent line of sight and it's the entire team mr fruit you hopped on to play with the wild west weapon and destiny 2 you knew things were going to get a little tilting come on you're better than that and you know what you're right i should be better than that oh you want to break this try me [Laughter] out played out what oh i'm sorry he just survived a point blank emma strike how exactly there's a super roaming around by the way you guys have fun with that because i'm out oh and there he is [Music] okay somebody is tethered or they're just marked what fun and a wreck all right that's it look see the problem with scout rifles is i just i don't want to sit back that's not me you guys know me i am ape i hold banana me no think zone b i don't want to play careful like this like see i probably could have killed him oh okay that's uncalled for okay okay we got we got a stack we got a stack look at this me playing carefully captured who'd have thunk not me but i can't hit anything oh my god you died everything's not awesome everything's painful i want to die oh that was the that was in the uh director's cut of the lego movie if you guys didn't see it it was great it's just fan freaking fantastic hurt my hands are clap so hard like i barely play the game because i just i want to play a lot of games you know and at this point it might not even be necessarily destiny's fault it's just no game can really hold my attention for more than like an hour i have the attention span and memory of a goldfish so i don't really blame destiny so much anymore but that's not the point i come back and we're still up there in the skill-based matchmaking when i'm just trying to shoot with the gun on my head with the big iron on my hair i hear somebody being an absolute boner yeah you like that grenade burn burn girl yes you're done burning okay that's a shotgun check this out they're not going to see me like i said i'm an ape oh my god where where'd you oh i almost killed him yeah i set that up we're about to oh my god 10 seconds 10 seconds nobody died nobody died we don't have zone advantage sit and spawn i swear retreat your enemy has defeated you let's have one job literally sit and spot no not this time i still want positive i guess second most opponents defeated for my team third in the lobby actually so but what do i have to show for it except for a couple of fat l's well a couple completed quests i suppose i am almost level 72 or whatever i'm right behind you guy watch out ladies and gentlemen the dead man's tale and yes you have to say it that way you can't say oh yeah i'm using the dead man's tail i'd be like sorry what i haven't heard of that one what is it the dead man's tail no no i heard what you said but that's not a gun oh i'm using the dead man's tail i go oh that dude that's one of my favorites that's so sick it's pretty cool it's pretty straightforward we'll see what the catalyst does maybe that pops off and maybe you know some random rolls is like the wave on this thing who really knows either way i like it i'm gonna use it in pve because it's just fun to shoot and that's all that really matters right anyway enjoy the video uh or i hope you enjoyed the video because it's already over whoops have yourselves a fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
