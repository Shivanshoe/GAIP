hi 80 hope you won money mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny - yeah hi how are you there's a new exotic in town and this guy got it it was a pretty long taxing and extensive quest so I will accept nothing but endless praise the Hellfire was a commercial about 15 years ago I would say Devil's ruin so easy to get a caveman could do it believe that exotic side aren't been a while huh but it's the best of times the new exotic times close the gap its intrinsic variable trigger press and release to fire individual shot hold to charge up a high-powered it's staggering laser strong against unstoppable champions and probably anything else that moves pyrogenesis it straight fully charged and laser refills the magazine from reserves it's weird seeing charge time on a sidearm but here we are this is what it looks like the default and then you go ahead and slap on that Polaroid ornament we out here living in the 80s now my friends if you want to see a slightly above average PvP player use it in said crucible while doing his best to not talk about skill based matchmaking well in that case welcome home we've missed you now apparently there's a hidden perk where if you release the trigger at the moment it creates the beam it does like a cooler bigger brighter beam it doesn't do more damage but I'll automatically reload from the reserves and stuff I don't know will I ever do it probably not but now you know what AG hey everybody good to see you here it's Devil's ruin time we're going to holy cow I started a lotta ammo we are going to alternate between some regular fire some laser fire I don't know see how it all works so this is single fire but that worked great so far friendly fire and team shot is is great how you thought I was gonna say that sidearm was killing it now I realize my damn my team has been doing like all the damage but check this out ready ah sec okay I thought I could hold the beam until I wanted to release it nope as soon as it wants to release it does okay starting to think we just don't use the laser there's gotta be something else to it looks like it can kill in one fell swoop the only problem is you have to hit every part of the laser or just get a little bit closer huh does the laser do pursue I said it does lie loser do some precision damage I don't know if it dies and there's only one way to really tell it dies the more you know okay we definitely definitely need to try and figure out this laser perk cuz gosh dang it okay hold on no no no ah bodge I keep letting go just a second too early oh I did it real tight time in there Bob also why do they all have shields in everything this is terrifying mm-hmm well they're screwed now dude I am gonna master this laser thing I messed it up again and I've done okay nix the laser mastering I do wait but what if I'd use it on a super well he's dead that works pretty well huh hey question though why are all these boners just using ace of spades and all this shotguns where's the devil's ruined man we just got it like come on use it or has everybody used it one game and I've been like yeah new thinks well you just don't know how to think outside the box and I pity you pppp you travel time on a bullet velocity here is making this a little bit difficult if you know what I'm saying but if I go well my friends stop pushing me oh my god Oh team mantle holy suck he's right behind me oh my god I can't believe I just lived it's incredible here he comes Wow I know that was mainly your shotgun but that's not that point and we got mercy rolled sick it screw it let's try momentum control wait I was gonna try that with with Devils ruin but it's just gonna be scout rifle the game will do a game of Rumble first oh oh oh I forgot I was playing rebels like everyone else is that to kill me an intern I'm out to kill them single fire single fire soon fire almost died that's embarrassing this is all fun and games and we can shoot the side Iron Mike it's a normal side R but let's get that okay it's a solid 20 day whatever would quit running away here I go right yes we traded my little ledger I'm gonna put that as a W for the all sidearm here I also could have sworn is that an hour blast you little rascal I thought I charged it in time much yeah imagine dying to a sidearm in 2020 oh my gosh starting out the year by getting them fairest I see what am i do my god this charges way faster than I realized Oh God Oh God okay turns out using heavy was a mistake and also why did I just spawn in that man sightline god I always don't let it charge enough I keep trying to do the amazing laser timing and honestly we wouldn't make the gun a whole bunch better if you could get used to if you could get used to that but maybe I should just work on just shooting people regularly first because I'm not used to it and instead of looking like an idiot and cancelling my charge every time I could just tell them I'm trying to get my charge out there but it keeps canceling it's like you no longer have any funds transaction denied oh my God look at that why is everyone around here can I can I get some peace and quiet for one second please leave me alone oh my god I can't believe my doctor and I can't believe I escaped that just by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin quite honestly last Friday night we were something evident I don't really know this song isn't that like everyone dad I decided to sing that's okay do you know looking wow wow I don't know I don't know what happened there you just kind of start dying oh my god okay just go through the head mr. drew the precision damage just kind of starts to turn on at one random point in time Oh God what did you put a joke what did you shoot it normally ha wait a second ladies and gentlemen I believe we are on to something here we are tied in first place with using a sidearm never thought I'd say that fudge you tried to take that kill from you well played my friend Oh brah yeah just hit your shots it's that simple but it really does kick oh you got a couple shots on me ahead of time oh my god I'm gonna die but then boom a couple precision shots next thing you know about a Bing about a boom I just wasted my boy yeah you know how it is sometimes it'd be like that you know only problem is I'm not really finding the primary ammo so we almost did run out of ammo but 500 IQ I died because I knew I was gonna run that AI was like screw it I'll just revive and get even more ammo I know actually is kind of a pro play if I'm being uh haha okay I'm a 100 sent dead here will my chinny-chin-chin survived today let's find out wait what oh yeah that first melee clearly didn't connect uh-huh Thank You Bungie my anus bro I wonder if my anus ever gets offended that I I called out so much it's like bro whatever do to you hammer to your face blah and funnily enough we actually we were doing some solid damage to that door super oh darn it we almost had him Podge oh god it's so hard I try and I try and I fail and I fail story of my life man how many people was Rumble usually six I thought it was eight there's only five in the lobby anyway so what does it really matter here we go ready okay and there we go right back to the respawn hey hi how are you I missed you guys you ever play the game I'm not messing with that ah but it sounds like you're out of ammo no you're not are you kidding me yes you are Oh get melted under array to look but we still did half damage bra and obviously we felt like it didn't even land my shot so the biggest thing is you just got to predict when you're gonna find the enemy and prepare the laser then I was like wow this does a lot more than I remember yeah no that's because that's not how that are you kidding die or you keep thank you Louise would yell I don't know what you oh fudge can I kill him though no no I cannot alright and now we're down to four people apparently okay they just keep quitting this is fun and interactive I know I know they were getting salty they kept dying to a sidearm but sometimes you've got to accept your fate brother okay now I gotta clean up on this I'm a janitor on Aisle seven yep heard there was a cleanup that needed to be clean cleaned up listen I'm a janitor I'm not a wordsmith okay what do you want for me here we go oh my god I'm doing it don't don't don't don't don't go the drums of war are beating no that was your kill I never did any damage in the first place yes yes this is possible and there it goes again now we are going to rush this tunnel that's long range and we will undoubtedly be added oh my god I'm the only at that that was incredible that was fantastic mr. fruit we're gonna need a play-by-play on that one later in the mind of mr. fruit and how he does things okay watch this ready predicted Oh I'm insane I am actually nuts with it and what's that body found from someone I wasn't weak enough jinan again I don't believe it the screen might say it but that doesn't mean it's right okay God all right that one was a head shot well played check it you Lodge all right we're I'm just gonna hit him normally with the sauce you watch watch okay mr. fruit maybe let's just put the hammer away for now you get a poke your eye out kid rev it up i skirt rev it up ah didn't see that if you rev it up in time around a corner and you acquire your target they'll die before they even know what hit where is this guy oh there he is I found him serpentine help me friend help me ha ha yeah sex to sir I wouldn't know what that's like throwing hammer and throwing hammer and throwing hammer and just like that it's become a throwing hammer vide nah I'm kidding I'm kidding kind of I'm debating it right now prepare the laser that's to be so frustrating but granted you know there is a little skill gap to it yappin ah well played but the devil's ruined I see takes a little while charge so you have to anticipate and then you have to immediately start hitting them with the beam because you need most of the beam to connect in order to kill so there is some nuance to it it's not just hold to charge profit as we saw in like the first game are they all hiding in spawn or like what's going on here there we are they playing the game or are those are the less Jesse oh what a nice grenade oh and I'm burning some people why not that's it we're doing laser drills that was what that was frame perfect I understand I'm gonna have to ask you to not sir Oh these fall off the map he did whatever we'll take it I was gonna fall off the edge anyway if someone didn't come that works because I didn't have any more ammo because I am a detriment yeah I just there doesn't I'm gonna have to be way more consistent at it which I am NOT so currently we're just going to avoid doing that because yeah else probably gonna do is get me killed and I like being alive I don't know about you guys so oh wow he actually died really fast though right oh my god yeah this is so much fun Wow a new exotic that's fun to use in PvP I don't remember the last time this was a thing huh this is exciting oh my god man look at this look at this dude look at this it's been a while since I've had fun in PvP yeah yeah get your head in the game sell dirt oh wait wait Mike mr. fruit I'm gonna die but alright what am i doing yeah now we got the ornament uh would you believe that Wow ah it does have a noticeable weakness an incredible lack of range it's not even debatable there's there's just like no arrange at all to compensate you got to get close you got to get personal but if you can you shall profit my friends that is a nice grenade by me how tell me how sway there's like eight people on the point that disappear into the abyss did it ricochet off of stupid geometry somehow probably I'm won the bet that was it look at me playing objective boom zone a captured Wow mr. fruit haha why do I bother going down that Lane you know why fly fly oh there Sears mr. Devil's ruin hey hi how are ya excuse me I'm trying to get to your what none of that makes sense I'm confused I fear no man but the devil's ruined now that is terrifying come here Baba come no come here baba come hither a Baba come on come on yo who wants some more y'all a what the fudge that's my cue dodge I'm running out of time right now time hey we got a fat guy uh miss true what do we say never run down this Lane what are we doing running down this Lane I love it I love it that's right screw Authority or whatever spectra blades come at me I actually just destroyed him it is super bro that is embarrassing oh my god poor guy huh let me finish this out and strides I'll wait ten seconds guys this game was going on for so long there's one oh my god let's go I got I gotta be MVP right you think yeah yep a pa-pa pa-pa-pa top of the team top of the lobby with a sidearm baby I've never really felt compelled to use a sidearm in my life ever but you my friend you have converted me Devil's ruined actually worth it and not only bad it is so easy to get even I was hesitant to log on ma'am literally it took me I'd say maybe 20 minutes maybe I think it's worth it so do it I think it's pretty fun to mess around I don't know if it's viable in PvE or whatever but who cares about that it's fun to using PvP that's all I care about what they said to have yourself in - I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
