i didn't realize i'm actually just cheating right now i just hold right click and spam left click come on auto aim yes auto aim's the greatest hi dear everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to hyperscape except this time the open beta that's right it's out on pc right now if you want to play it yourselves console should be coming within the next couple weeks if you're curious but i'm going to be trying some solo queue pray for me look i know it sounds dumb but i normally don't play battle royale solo it just gives me so much anxiety i couldn't tell you why so i'm gonna face my fears let's get into it hey i'll see you out there on the field how about you fight me i'm landing throne hall and you can't tell me otherwise now i'm curious because i haven't played solos i don't know how the whole resurrection thing works because obviously in squads you can just get picked up all the time but in in solos is it just one and done you know you you do it or you don't all right i'm grabbing things i'm grabbing things i'm grabbing other things i see someone what is happening oh there's multiple multiple tangos i don't know where i'm going oh what is this thing help me oh jesus ah there is no resurrection well that answered that real fast all right i'm thinking we land right here in t loop oh wait a minute there's no point in pinging i'm so alone oh geez okay landed a little closer to you than i would have liked i'm a simple man i'm looking for upgrades and ideally not the enemy at least not now you know just give me a second to get my bearings hello oop that's pop i can't find anyone oh viewers have chosen the reveal that hey that's actually kind of good for me well i guess it could work out of the way huh half the oh yeah half the the lobby's already dead so that's kind of where i think we stand on that one i mean i just reload oh no he's like one shot oh what the fudge see at least when i play with my friends you know i can banta i can joke kind of take off the edge but here just i'm alone with my thoughts and my bad aim uh you know everyone probably just drops immediately right so i might as well do the same if if i'm gonna die might as well do it early i'm looking for some lewd doesn't matter what kind of loot i'll take any loot that's my brand new song dubbed i don't care what i get i'm not picky like they always say you get what you're getting you're gonna die anyway i'm just kidding you know if i warmed up more i'd probably i'd probably be nuts now what the fudge oh jesus this sector's already closed i i just landed here man bro i gotta get out of dodge holy jesus oh it's going down right here oh shoot let me get in on this you like that damage let me just snipe him real quick oh my god i actually hit him i gotta reload though oh i gotta kill but there's someone else right here fudge oh he just has a fully upgraded noob tube hey we gotta kill that time and you know just another 10 minutes to do it all over again let's go okay uh yeah i'm thinking we just you know dropped same place the ribs that sounds delicious wait a minute that's literally food court we're approaching our destination hot i repeat hot i'm going in i'll take that and i'll take that and i'll literally just take anything you can get me right now uh okay what is this wait is this like it's like auto in oh my god i didn't realize i'm actually just cheating right now yeah you like this i'm cheating buddy get used to it except wait a second oh my god he's out of here all right well bye buddy oh and suddenly he's back i don't know what this man is doing come on oh he's using armor that's not fair oh god there's people everywhere the goat ball oh wait oh wait i forgot i turned into the ball i don't throw a ball i'm out that's my bad put a mine there and light him up with my auto him i'm nuts oh wait a second that that actually was pretty good what the oh but i'm all at ammo the sector is closing though i gotta get out of here man like zoinks i finally found my perfect weapon the one that requires literally no skill what up buddy can you auto aim better than me i don't think so what is that what the see what does that do in solo though this does feel a little cheesy i just hold right click and spam left click believe it or not i am capable of that oh i'm just being hard on myself i'm not that bad you guys know well actually i don't know you guys always tell me i'm bad so maybe i'm just starting to believe it myself you guys have worn me down alright there was a lot of shooting over here and now there's no shooting come on you're starting wow that was generous and i'll take it i lost him all right well i don't know sector's closing you have a nice day sir what do we have here is that a fully upgraded sniper oh jesus christ holy get me out of here i'm running i'm running i'm trying to hide oh no i'm too weak for this come on out of aim yes auto aim's the greatest yeah what i didn't realize is i should just jump around and make myself as hard to hit when i'm using this thing because god knows i don't need oh they're right below me yo what up yeah run away never mind wait why are you still engaging me oh what if i just kill you like this oh but i had to reload he doesn't know as soon as i get in the zone i swear to god it closes fudge oh my this again bruh i just got like two shots hey three kills we're improving we're improving kill me i should really start mixing it up instead of landing the same spot every time fine i'll go over here to the line must be the disneyland simulator that's your footsteps everywhere holy jesus i saw somebody are you running off too boy oh god wow he is running off i tell you what come here i'm not letting you go he's a ball that's not fair ow no i'm getting shot what the fudge just regains health being a ball must be a nice life man i found him all right hi oh come here it's just so easy to escape except i'm never able to do it so how's that work okay there's too many people in the fight now all right i gotta heal what the [ __ ] is going on oh oh oh what the i can kill him i will kill him i did kill him i'm actually a bit of a gamer it appears but first run away i have no idea what i'm ever doing are you doing so much damage to me come on finish him off the reload takes forever oh my god i got a kill i got another kill okay that's good that's good oh that's bad are you ah i even tried to use my healing ability just and then people come let me plummet towards our inevitable death yet again here comes the superhero landing oh terrible for the knees i think it's best if we just you know avoid people for a little while and now for your viewing entertainment mr fruit is proud to present the most embarrassing gun fight this side of the mississippi also i need to incorporate sliding more because look at the boost it gives you skirt skirt don't ask me bruh tell me how that didn't hit oh jesus here we go well it is impossible to hit but i guess that's because it does good damage go plasma launcher thing ah jesus quit what the oh oh we teleport i was like how did he what in the dickens [Music] oh my god i'm getting tubed up give me another heal bruh what is this fiesta all right screw this i can't hit anything this close i'm just gonna use this oh come on kill something come on get him yeah oh there's the other guy hey what you want there we go good damage just one more shot what where did he who is this why can't i hit anything oh is that a shotgun oh my god okay the hit registration is a little i gotta get used to shooting this thing but it does some nasty damage if i can never hit him i'm trying to whack him yeah god that was embarrassing you guys weren't watching right i'm get what the tickets oh jesus he's i don't even think he saw me the heck okay what's going on over here oh my oh my all right fire fire it up again just just i don't i don't want to hear it all right enough self-deprecation time for some self-appreciation is that technically like the antonym self-deprecation oh he's got a shot next next game is the one sweet virgin mary to the archives for knowledge oh we got a golden pistol why would they give that to me it's a debate they know i can't hit the broad side of a barns they're like let's give him this and then oh my god oh it sounds like they're what are they on top of me that's because they are oh they're one but they're invisible the fudge is this ooh golden this thing though oh yeah i love golden this thing almost got a kill and then there's they dip oh oh now i'm dipping bouge that was a lot of damage i just do that much damage they don't know where i am ready oh wow oh that was a lot of damage what the fudge just happened that i well i tried to do a lot of damage okay oh jesus it's that grenade launcher dude all right i need to get height advantage because i do know the farther away from the target the more this does okay it would help if i hit something though oh look at that damage that is the quite possibly the cheapest thing i've ever done i'm sorry dude i don't even feel good about that how is that balanced i love it as you can tell it appears i'm gravitating towards the least skill intensive weapons oh that's got to kill him [Applause] it's so much damage oh shoot i'm on the fire app i'm on the fire app okay missed that point blank sick you don't see me sir i wish you didn't see me you did i was seventh i mean i guess that's progress all right queer we're gonna have to go back to the drawing board here you know just practice up a little bit you know and uh come back even better stronger and with a squad with that said i don't think all very much for watching happiness is fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one farewell
