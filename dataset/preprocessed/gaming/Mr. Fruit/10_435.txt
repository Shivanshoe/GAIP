hi everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to scavengers thank you very much to scavengers for sponsoring this video scavengers is a strategic survival pve vp game it's not a battle royale there's large and unpredictable ai populations as well as fellow players as roaming boss battles that add additional strategies and threats to the world and it's all bundled up into a hostile post-apocalyptic winter environment with a dynamic weather system this survival shooter actually has me really excited to play it there's team play there's action there's excitement you drop in with just about nothing you gotta scavenge for some supplies but you're gonna be a little scarce then you want to try and get the most points in the game by taking out raider outposts gathering these crystal elements or you know killing another squad and getting theirs you do all of this trying not to get eliminated by ai or pvp players and at the end you wanna exfiltrate or exvil outside of this harsh environment up into space best part is you don't have to win to be able to progress with the game and overall honestly it's just super fun it's made by midwinter entertainment a brand new company run by x343 industry leaders and other aaa veterans if any of this sounds interesting to you which it should because personally i'm pumped then make sure to click the link down in the description box below to
