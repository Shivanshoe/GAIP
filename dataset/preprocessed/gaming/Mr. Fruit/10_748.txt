hi ad ho-jon my name's mr. fruit and welcome back God itty mountain warfare and in today's video exciting times we're throwing it back to the pistols which I know I got platinum on those a while ago why are we thought we'd never touched the the pistols again well hopefully that answers your question that's right season two they added all new perks to the pistols welljust akimbo but every pistol can now have the akimbo perk I haven't tried it all but I'm sure it'll go fine we're using the monolithic suppressor Eve forge tank extended by mill a laser lightweight trigger it well and then akimbo now I unlocked it but I stopped myself from using it in-game so that you can get my first impressions and we can experience this together should note they also buff the point man perk which if you didn't know it turns to kill streaks and score streaks and I doubt we're gonna be killing it but oh oh look at me what's up dudes everybody else seems to be using their pistols getting ready for it but oh baby bring it on okay yeah that's why I thought okay just yeah I'll just double tap them ah oh okay that hurt excuse me coming through oh gosh but reloading takes from both reserves at Jesus where at where you need to kill someone right away or I don't know I did get scavenger which looks like it's gonna be necessary there's a kill + 125 for the all scorestreak oh okay so far this is this is tough I love the little double lasers right there though oh maybe I should go like gah gah gah you know I'm saying take it a little slower instead of just wrap it nah screw it I'll just click everything as fast I can okay I didn't kill him yellow I've got to diggle's with your name on it in fact I have the Platinum royal decrees please show me some respect because this is a very rare skin until the the ma the gunfight tournament comes gosh dang it the gunfight tournament comes back now many people have it so like I'm kind of a big deal no careful yeah yeah I actually hit him once and I guess and you know it's the small victories ah okay okay the pointman twas a mistake I've changed a specialist well I guess I won't until next life but that that seems to be the play here good lord I mean I'm trying I'm trying the deagles coincidentally might not be great sets like this you know I mean pull Olli Hecker's I mean maybe on shipment but even then you know I mean like Matt Wow I mean maybe this is a better option to not run solo you know you're like fight guy oh wait I got a swatch I actually had something like but then I hello hello mother hello father thanks for giving your something to mmm ticks are no longer a bother thanks again for giving me canine advantage is something like that I skipped a few steps but oh let's go that's probably a long shot if it's not I have some serious questions all right well I'm out of ammo let's show uh hey there's a kill I got scavenger back which now means I can kill and get some ammo well I mean look at how much life is easier when I just use the UMP but that's no fun yeah I'm not here to use okay oh boy ah ah I'm just trying to live there's a guy right here and right Oh serious hey there we go all right yeah I'm thinking we need to alternate the shots here because do at a time just ain't really cutting it okay so how do I make these viable bigger mags might be a good idea all right we're gonna take those changes and we're gonna throw it into hardcore rust only playlist this is probably a worse idea but who cares deagle dubs might be actually the worst play ironically dry m1919 11 or x16 would probably be good choices we feel free to tell me in the comments which one I should go after which one you think is the best hey Russ never would have guessed those oil cans suppressors hey pay me attention look I got these platinum pretend I'm important thank you he's probably oh god don't know not that you don't understand what you're the can of worms you're opening the digs are oh we love you love you look laughs man you're trying to tell me none of those hit but those dead I guess I need to alternate but that is that is a lot to think about at once there we see that bump bump bump bump so then it's like we have never it god that's they're hard to hit Jesus Christ God I know you're on my team but like come on Brad oh here we go mm-hm check this out up goes despite or tip tip tip some god I can't remember any these nursery rhymes whatever like the spider goes up the spicket or the waterspout or something you guys know what I'm talking about oh yeah oh look at this hold on a second mr. fruit you're kind of killing the game right now he's probably chasing someone to fire help me that's just from double big man double cheek double oh I was having to find zine enemy because I ran out huh AB ran out of ammo thank you for dodging doc doc doc doc doc whoa whoa just don't work that way akimbo Tzar hilarious I never said they were good two very different things oh my god get a headshot that's right easy way to get challenges you know I'm saying gotta stop it yeah you're bullying me yeah I'm telling mom oh I know you could come up here leave this ready well I almost hit him no hey Jake so long to reload the 13 rounds in the mag does appear to be the play though so it appears crouching and not moving was the play we just need to get back to our perch which is much easier set then you you're the way I just haha there we go yeah revenge is a dish best served with a Kimbo diggle's it's just salt on the wound imagine dying - akimbo diegs I couldn't because I can't even imagine kill with these things and I've no one using him like well then why are you using them because look at this Tony this isn't SiC looking alright you probably know shoot you know I can't argue event that's a good point good point exactly I'm always full of good points I am never wrong I'm infallible however this was a bad idea yes it was what a marsh fish today here hm would you let me just live for like just two seconds all right that's that's a fat out rust is like small but also like super wide open that you can be pretty much anywhere on the map and see someone else I need like shooting house where at least I can come around some corners that's that's optimal so what I'm saying is we're entering normal quick play I know I too forgot it existed wait is this is this a joke I finally enter a quick play and then it just throws me in the rest okay well the gods have spoken but look at this guy's I'm an idiot I forgot to change the filter so we were still looking for hardcore rust only it's not important let's just let's just get past that crash okay not where I saw myself but that's fine now you probably get what you mean shy yourself we were you talking about it's all about that visualization test you're never like picture yourself where you want to be in life and it'll come true kind of thing you know so I was like picturing the map I was gonna be on and sometimes it does work it's kind of scary but it didn't work this time so with some good old confirmation bias I'll forget the times that it doesn't work and only remember the times that it does so in other words it's still 100% correct cuz I yeah you know what I pictured myself a crash what can I say yeah yeah what up pom pom pom but Adam you are already dead that is unfortunate oh my golly gee willikers I survived but only by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin trying to sit you I was trying to avoid the c4 and beyond to cool and smooth with it and some guy comes around and I miss on every shot I tried the tape without salt to tap da left right gonna keep that keep that alternation pattern you carried a whoa livin on a prayer hair ho ho that's all I'm doin right now I have hope damn I shot at the target cuz I have no control it's where I guess the best I can do is only that yeah crouch uh and eliminate as much spread as possible but that is still only going to get us so far just beautiful deagles got this platinum worked so hard on it just to throw these oil can't suppressors on it and ruin everything you know what I mean it's great I love it and it's just so fashion-forward why doesn't it apply platinum till the oil can suppressors that would actually be kind of be nutty I mean honestly no god I'm so gassy right now I'm burping so much I I'm gonna hurt myself I need to stop go back inside mr. fruit where it's nice and safe huh what did I say venture outside and nothing good awaits us out there just scary IRL stuff who most I can muster up in a day is going to the gym and even that's terrifying you know what I mean you know I'm saying or a necessary stop at a chick-fil-a or some something delicious uh some fast food but I'm better than that I'm trying to be God fast food is just that it's convenient it's yummy hello I should have just stayed on the ladder and stopped thought about it I'm just gonna crouch around so this way the double laser play can only work boom headshot Tjader dad I totally knew that was gonna happen haha nerd oh you I guess I'm the nerd I fired off like five or six shots definitely thought we'd have it by then boy alert we didn't all right yeah I see people sometimes like make this jump oh well that's how what do you know sometimes you just gotta believe you believe in magic and a young girl's heart well maybe if she didn't use a camera pissed otherwise magic is dead where's Adria's long we've cared their kind because that's what humans do we kill what we do not understand witches burn them at the stakes you know the Salem witch trials they were trying to finally be like yeah we can help you and we're like no no no no no no no death to you while bang collateral collateral collateral with my akimbo pistols pistols pistols oh don't mind if I do things for the ammo oh you are so dead my friend dun dun duh dun dun al dun dun dun dun dun well too much impact on the ol knees their dark said I should avoid contact sports my bad that is that that is official in my ward in middle school I was diagnosed with osgood-schlatters which those of you it's it's fairly common edge so if you're probably familiar with what I'm talking about I can still fire one come on o get destroyed that's embarrassing anyway osgood-schlatters it's a tear on the tibia plateau or something like that and part of your knee sex and the only way that you essentially is like you can't play any contact sports and said that was when I played more video games and went outside less and I never looked back and it still actually hurts and I still have knee problems doc didn't say anything about that so thanks for nothing doc whatever whatever it's not I'm not mad about it um it's fine really you know I didn't mean to scare you did I did I scare you well good you should be scared because like that there are people like that waiting around every corner they want to do nothing but kill you look at them those heathens wait a second only if five shots in my left what the heck why can't we like spread the love equally why can't we have like seven six but no five thirteen oh Jesus Christ you know it's funny I'm actually a Malia on my team no wait a minute no I I'm the most kills in the game let's go see it's it's the map issue that was the problem okay it's very technically gifted yeah if you use your momentum I'll show you wait they saying that I hurt someone open the door I don't know oh oh you're on the rooftop check this out ready Wow all right fine I'll do this I'm going sort it you'll never know god this is very ok this is this is can be a runkiller here and the in the speedrun I swear this this didn't happen in the practice runs okay Plan B is just I just wasted all my silence cutting it okay you know what we had a lot more success when we just ignored that part of the map so I'm just gonna go back to where things make sense inside I see comes full circle mr. fruit queue commentary it's fantastic you come up with this on the flight well yes yes I do how could you tell actually cuz she's crashed and it makes absolutely no sense I'm just trying to get a rise out of me you don't mean that you don't mean that take that back take it back now y'all talk don't do hop this time two hops is tomm and so Nene is hanjung the knees to akimbo diggle's versus a sniper at a distance guess who wins no really I'll wait for you to guess guess oh my god that's right how did you know you cheated didn't you you looked up the answer you're shameful you're like that people I had to play against last night at trivia night yeah I went to trivia night bunch of cheaters feeling so good about the answers what oh my god we're killing it we might actually like when this trivia round this is all just a bunch of boomers who have just this is what they do with their life they're just so good at it it's because they have years of experience okay they know all these obscures is it listen it's not it's really not important anyway so okay let's see worst and we're probably we were in last we finished and last then we didn't even miss that many it's like it way the robots the only thing I come up with is they achieve it they looked up the answers and whether or not that is true I'm telling myself that because you know what it makes me feel a little bit better inside and it's not hurting anybody else so okay a Kemp epistles I look sick but in this case fashion kills but it kills yourself at it's there's got to be a better akimbo it doesn't matter anyway with that said I want to thank you very much for watching have yourselves a fantastically I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] [Music]
