you know what i'm feeling real good oh boy oh my god that is a large hippo uh-oh all right fresh start i'll take that hi eddie ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to super auto pets i hate you fish ah clean sausages hell come on the sulking sausages ah he might beat me now we nah we lose no we win we win no we lose then we tie you know what i'll take that it's all right fresh start i just never know what to do with this stuff like what am i looking at um i guess this and this and this over here or something like over here oh we'll see what we get that we get a better qriket or honeybee oh honeybee [Music] all right we just don't lose all of our health immediately and then get into an actual build well it does not look like that's a good start okay maybe we're uh oh that just takes out my biggest voice a whole that's try again okay but uh okay wait a wow we tied okay hey let's go no wins but no losses we'll take that and saucy give the two friends behind plus one plus one well let's just and get it anyway and then put you in the back for now let's roll okay interesting sure let me roll again [Music] we could go with the old dirty rat i don't think it's too much we just we just need to win some of these early rounds that's all we got to do i'm going to put them in the back not right well i mean he's gonna always knock out the first thing right this early on like come on yo just not now we immediately okay he's not even gonna kill me he's gonna hurt that's fine dirty rat act there it is huge no stop doing that ah suck okay okay this is actually huge he'll hurt that which means that kills that and we win okay big big big baby okay okay wait a second we haven't lost out oh this is good only tizen wins and do i want to level everything up here do i have a choice no the answer is no okay friend i had a tax game plus combustion oh well all right forgive me perfect sure i think i had one more gold re-roll whoops whatever this um just some big stat lines here but i think we're fine feeling pretty good about this one i'm feeling real good yeah i'm feeling good about this one i'm pretty sure we win here yup yup let's go it was close but not close enough yes this is the run now we just have to figure out what our what we're gonna we're gonna pivot to because i mean it's not gonna last us but okay i'll summon right you still just you level them but i thought i'd already i thought that was gonna be level two okay i wouldn't have done that sheep's pretty good here gotta get rid of fish the only problem is i'm actually run out of room because if i put sheep here it dies only spawns one but if i put this in the front it dies and only spawns one but i also don't want to get rid of anything else i guess i could get rid of the elephant but i'm kind of banking he does something for us later but maybe i'm holding on to a dream well said friend we're gonna [Music] sure so maybe he'll take something down with him you got it buddy [Music] kangaroo with a meat bone would have made sense but here we are no what oh my all right this is fine wow this is not fine oh well that's fine okay if we had the horse we actually would have been fine oh we still talk wait ah if we had the horse we're still gonna tie dang it ah we're so close but we have not lost and that's the important thing ah i guess we'll just use this stuff yellow come on that's not terrible all right meatball in the kangaroo now it's good oh boy oh okay well the good new the good news is melon armor so you temp ooh so close but the sheep and then that okay oh but then the dog is gonna be oh and then the horse oh he has level two he almost has a level three yours ah i'm still not worried about it still not worried about it just don't get health oh that's fine all right we're good we're good okay okay hey let's go tier four animals a hippo the hippo turtle strap might be making a return i don't want to get rid of the horse because currently that's giving me 3 2 ram 3 2 ram 2 2 or 2 1 cricket 2 1b maybe i'll freeze them and see what we get hold on skunk starter battle reduce the highest health enemy by 33 okay so i'm gonna check with the same attack as this we'll upgrade to you oh friend faints kane oh my god wait we're gonna have a lot of friends fainting we put them in the back that's one two three four five six seven eight he'd be sixteen eight so he'd be 2012. that's pretty saucy to me and and maybe i get rid of the kangaroo now because i wanna buff all the things that spawn and then let the shark table take over tell you put you up put the shark back there what the shark doing and a sailboat give it to the shark fudge but that's okay i have to hope they don't have the croc and snipe my thing but that's not a good start but that's okay that is a large hippo uh oh i think the hippo beats us here we're giving it so much fodder definitely counters are filled and it has garlic really watch that's it that's just that's a tough hippo to beat that's a tough hippo to be new plan new point new plan i should have done this before i would have actually won that if i had this why wouldn't i have done that in the first place in turn game plus two plus if there's at least one level three friend friend ahead faints gain melon armor and plus two attack i don't think that's that big of a deal the only problem is i put these in the front then one of the spawns gets ruined because there's not enough space i mean the horse is just so good right now but maybe we sell it for now i put bison in the front i really need a level two shark though so we can get more health because if anything snipes the back line we're we're uh frank well we're just we're dead wait a second oh no it's the deer monka i think it's going to roll through us because it's just going to go run through all of our summons and because i don't have the horse anymore these do nothing oh and that's a waste i don't even know if melon armor helps maybe melon armor saves this um melanoma shapes us oh my god we win right we went melon armor oh no it's a tie ah hey still have not lost i've never been able to crash three wins but we still have not wait we did lose once okay i don't remember i'm gonna be honest whoa wait what give three random animals plus one and plus one well that's pretty good uh yup uh yup yup and re-roll yup what is this replace food shop with two free milk that gives plus two and plus two that's so good but the problem is i don't have room to buy it because essentially buying that lets me give anyone plus four plus four maybe get rid of bison i'll freeze it for now oh my what level two dodo oh my god he has a 1915 hippo with garlic armor now we lose this one there's not that's not even a competition what the fudge because none of my summons are going to get through him and he's just going to gain health yeah all right let's just auto play this one yikes yeah hippo eats my summoning team it's like a it's not a counter it's a hard count oh my god okay i got we still got two lives this is fine you have an animal plus one experience oh really ferenda had attacks deal five damage to a random enemy wait i gotta sell something all right friend okay i'm gonna get rid of you i'm gonna buy you oh and actually wait no no i don't need the chocolate now give this to our shark friend and then we're gonna sell you and then we're gonna upgrade you what does that do give two friends behind melano would it buy tier one animal give all friends plus one plus one well that seems terrible i think the snake will go behind the shark and then that has to go in the front although i mean i'll miss out on one summon no i'll miss that one or yeah with this let me set on one summon but this gives melanoma to these guns i think we keep this for now we'll miss out on two attack and one health but yellow lazy seeds oh no oh no oh wow i don't know if we went wait well oh my god we win four wins baby screw your bus i've yet to see a deer ever oh my god we're all four out of ten baby tier six animals didn't get a single one we wait a second i'm gonna be honest i think this is way better than snake snake at best gets like 10 damaging at the end and as we saw not that crazy but this turkey is going to come in clutch every tune and at this point now every summit kind of matters right whatever i'm going to buy sushi first and we're gonna re-roll what is this into the turn copy the level one ability from animal ahead oh my god what oh my wait or i could wait or i could get another sheet right there a lot of possibilities here double turkey here is sick but then we'd have to get rid of shark alternatively we could get rid of turtle but turtle's too good no but the tur the turtle given two free attacks and he does 10 damage off the bat but i guess given every summon well okay here's the problem though if i get double turkey we're going to lose out on a summon because i don't have anywhere to put get rid of cricket and have parrot copy sheep except it it copies the level one ability so we get two two two whereas this one gives us a two two and a one one but the cricket's six seven where the parents only gonna be three two this is this is too hard of a decision i'm going to reroll oh and now i find oh okay who do we give experience to i'm going to level up the turkey because i feel like a level 2 turkey will be a game changer all right here we go oh my god wait a second gg all right like what the fudge he's gonna give the front three people 24 attack i'm over here like man this is looking pretty good and then there's this oh my god and at the end of the turn with a level three penguin he gives everyone plus three plus three i've never gotten a level three in my life and this guy's got level three dodo and then the snake's gonna ha okay whatever whatever you know what maybe there's a where we went we don't know that we don't know that we don't know that we don't know that i know that melanoma is useless here if he had one more attack [ __ ] this is gonna hurt yeah yeah hiss no leave my shark alone no what are you kidding me all right well i think that's gg oh my american sniper snake over here oh my god random my anus god if it had hit the sheep instead we might have tied at best wait free level two turkey though give plus six plus six you're useless okay okay hear me out here oh no it only it only copies level one ability i was gonna say if i could copy the plus six plus six but we can't i think we gotta sell you buddy because the problem too is even if he gets the cop he's just so squishy get two random animals plus two and plus two and we could get a cow i need one gold though oh no okay i'm gonna freeze it but wait i won't even have an extra body yolo that's big yolo pretty good re-roll give all current and future shopping those plus if that comes sooner what is this give two random friends plus one and plus one another cow roll give an animal steak attack attack for 20 more damage once eh oh wait i should have put that back there so now is that how that's gonna work i swear to god oh it is oh no it's not okay okay look at that oh my god wait it doesn't what am i up against these are not natural well all right that's game what [Music] i feel like we we had something beautiful going on dude i think three wins four wins you're out there fighting for your life man is hippo best like what the fudge wait what is this where is this pay to win wait they just get more people [Music] give an animal extra life oh my god oh i can buy points or hats with points what the fudge gold poops 5 000 oh backgrounds oh that's what the dude had that makes sense [Music] [Music] you
