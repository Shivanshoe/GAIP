somebody leaked a birthday boy what the fudge oh yeah can we get a kick on that oh damn okay they saved it i'm plumpy not long ago on a night most peculiar there was a gathering of the world's most famous detectives they had devised a unique competition indeed each detective came prepared with two murder weapons look at the prompt on your device to see the first one you'll draw that be cautious as a murderer you also have a calling card a letter from your own name that you must include in your drawings do your best to hide the letter as possible you guys can start drawing now by the way yeah yeah wait what oh jesus yeah you can you can [Music] if it says something like a word right are we supposed to draw that word yeah okay by the way if you've played before you can turn off tutorials in the pause menu i promise not to take it personally thank you ladies i'm done just some i'm just build diff i am complete what the hell is your mom what are you guys going on to halloween um chunga i'm going to scott summers ugh oh sh i had my mic muted [Applause] i don't have trigger treaters but i said i don't think i'm dressing up this year sadly you're not gonna do anything like on stream or anything no what's that well we live like in a college area so if we had like trick-or-treaters it'd be like kind of weird you are not done wrong yeah i know that oh i thought you just i'm drawing my submission ass off i know you're shocked more than 15 seconds all right i see the shoei i'm trying to look straight i'm trying to think of what the guy i am the voice like straight looks very evil that's mine my secret my secret accomplice name wait roberta paulson i i'm surprised that caught on no it was funny because when we were doing like okay the name's roberta paulson i was literally walking around the house going roberta paulson oh yeah roberta paul's her name was roberta her name was roberta paulson may she rest in peace are you guys doing phasma after this ah you must write the name down and press submit it is hard to do thinking sucks but i like to think about it world's greatest detectives you know what i mean oh yes i'll take the applause thinking sucks but thinking about sucking hey yo yo where's the uh the rock sound it's about drive it's about power my drawing is so terrible mine's a little bad i thought those were all beautiful frankly i'm gonna introduce our guests uh here we have rocks maya yeah mav is from hotel transylvania who could forget mojo jojo who could forget candace pain go away my sex doll bingy give it up for our secret accomplices [Music] time choose a guest to murder on your device then guess which detective brought them to the ball use your knowledge of what your fellow detectives may have written or simply take a stab in the dark if you're the first to figure out it looks like it's someone's name oh it looks like there's quite a few by george someone report the body [Music] [Laughter] by weapons the bodies we can tell how many triggers like how everyone tries to incorporate other letters into the theme oh yeah each of those attempts oh my god does it say beans unfortunately we really only have time to solve one of these cases that means the other murderer will get away for now examine the evidence and talk through imagine that like oh yeah we don't have that much time to solve both all right which one do we which one do we think we can solve hector or blimp or ballpoint pen or blip there's a little bit more soluble what about candice pango away i mean i see like a w and x actor is i'm gonna go with maybe hector that's not a ballpoint pen i don't know what i'm looking at but it's like a syringe you have to look for the letter in it i see like a r yeah because look at the b look at the sassy baka and what's crazy is that's actually the same ballpoint pen i used all throughout high school [Laughter] [Laughter] all right who do we which one do we want to investigate so the chief investigator is whoever brought the victim yes oh i think mojo jojo yeah well he's trying to throw you off there's also a bee for the eyes let's not forget that's a very good yeah but see then do i look at the death by chocolate guy because it says death by chocolate card you know what i mean like okay but here's what i'm thinking with this drawing everything except for their head is a single line but they made sure to go over the head one or two times that's true they were going pretty hard on it and i did bring mojo jojo oh well then please this monster take the floor the person's drawing was right in front of us so it would be death by chocolate and then right i don't know though um well my chocolate is what they drew but you have to find the hidden layer in it which it which has which is in the person's name who uses do you think it's dork because you're the sea i think it's black i think it's plus bless it's blaster joey because bless has a beat dork you see how he has a b on the eyes of the death by chocolate and then you look at his blimp and it has come to be there good call good call oh hey [Music] [Laughter] something if we pick rock my ass i have a pretty good idea who it is what do you think dork who should we pick here [Music] i'm curious why the exact same thing twice well maybe he goes that is true that does look like a blimp and bad leftovers at the same time i see how you could you could spend that yeah i too see how that confusion pops up yeah um oh i gotta be honest i am sorry wait who's able to do that is there's an o wait is that oh i just realized oh wait yeah [Applause] [Laughter] he did it you know what to do where are you putting that hamster that hamster as for the murders we didn't get to i promise we'll get to it later candace that does look like bad leftovers it's time then then what that knees nuts guys the timing was good all right i somehow did it can anyone do a uh give it to me bless ah dude i my mind went blank don't worry dude my mind goes prank sometimes too after after a few years it to you after killing some yinglings uh that's how i settle down i don't always kill you but what i do five seconds sean oh yes excuse me why don't you introduce them [Laughter] latte cookie from cookie run kingdom anita handy cat girls from ff14 let's go joseph joesta nutrition facts hey thank you i've been looking for those everywhere [Laughter] i

all right what do we see here i love just ease like everyone just let's [ __ ] random letters oh my dude it's a meta oh all right i see a b like in in the bad leftovers one on the right yeah but i also see an a and another b and a i feel like it's we're looking at the wrong place let's be honest we know who'd want to kill cat girls from ff14 oh no do we want to pick that one i don't think so how dare you murder my dear friend cat girl try to see more team i think it's none other than this b right here what the oh no i don't think it's that b i don't know what about his a no it might be why are you trying to get us off of your bee bless yeah he kind of sucks look at these bees don't match mine wait a second birthday boys b wait a minute no you guys are wrong you guys are wrong i love cat final fantasy 14. that's the only reason why i grinded well i danced with them i don't know who to night clubs no no no we what are we looking for here um um i see weiner i see let's see devin carr devin carr that's gonna really my fantasy team who's devin carr i think i see more with like like i see a c i see a b i see a v i see e's what do we see in in america like e's i want to find out who killed devon carr that's what i'm picking okay now that okay is the ball point i see let's collaborate maybe it could be the squiggly on versus i'm going to get real meta with this i think what about what about looking here like the little squiggly here on verses and wait how are you doing here how are you doing like it's not the same though it's either fruit i think it's so are you it could be the a here and it could be the a on the arrow here look at the head of the blimp and look at where the bee is dude it's fruit i think it's oh is it i am uh you didn't even get me for the right reason actually i don't think we ever do so hey we take the dubs the classic i didn't get it in time either because i'm drunk classic okay so there's an a that's clearly not the a that it's right like what could it be like oh the right is an r easy yeah but who has gnar uh birthday boy we'll find that out versus birthday boy shark dork on your screen you'll see a board and that is like the magnifying glass and if you click over the board that's how you magnify glass whoever the the chief investigator is here chief investigator versus on your screen you'll be able to like look closely at um things by on the pictures on the screen well fruit says yeah it's an r yeah yeah okay and because you guys don't seem to realize the letters you have has to be in their name like when you guys thought it was sharp for b it wasn't sharks b but anyway so you see the cursive r right there so i'm thinking it's it's either birthday boy or dork or shark it's not birthday for sure it's gotta be where's jerks are it can't be tortured so it's gotta be dorks and dork it's gotta be i gotta go birthday boy no it's not birthday boy i'm going you if you're going with me i'm just voting oh that's right i'm already gone let's have it it's not me no what the [ __ ] oh no your detective skills need work it must have been doors at the end of the day wait what i think so there's one maybe i don't know if neither are you i couldn't see anybody it should be an a bro there's [Laughter] wait wait wait wait that's an l i think like like over i in cursive well they just use the e in pen and and just wrote pen and they think that's like going to get them sliced no oh my god of course uh what do we think we see i don't know i mean it's definitely not the p no there's no disfigured pac-man trying to eat the pen oh look at the actual hold on wait look at the pen real quick zoom in on it see it looks like there's drawing where like the tip is that over crosses the other thing so maybe that's just a big curse of l like bless was a little saucy oh it could be like you see in front of it you know you know i'm seeing it i'm seeing it too who's uh who's the l is that the time runs out me no all right [Laughter] you guys just did wrong yeah just kind of better oh we were wrong it was joey [Music] wait so you just pick who you think the cold cases were like the ones that we didn't get to investigate um you just kind of guess who you think it was that killed it mountain dew so who do we think killed this person what the [ __ ] oh my god again like how's that you just drew it's like a helicopter yeah what the [ __ ] that's a goated blimp if you ask me um i don't need this from you yeah i ran out of time it's joey maybe oh it's the h it's an eye [Music] that's too good this is a mystery that's what i'm saying like it's too good to kind of be anybody else's and that's kind of your calling card all right whatever oh my god all right i'm just gonna start scribbling [Laughter] like in the middle i have no idea no one has an x in their name i'm gonna go with jordan i also went with dork oh [Laughter] [Music] i hate you i like this one this is not mr fruit oh it was that yes gaming as hell i don't even see that you gotta like you get such i should have made my name just every letter in the alphabet but actually very little i think it's an s i think that's a capital s oh who did we guess for this one originally it's either versus fruit or shark or dork or birthday boys we all have ours that's also a really good drawing it's a pretty good drawing oh is let's see my name on this board hey nice oh nice you guys are too cunning that's a lot of murders uh [Applause] nutrition facts you guys like to do a different game that can fit more people yeah i think uh we need a game that
