3v3 hero shooter here's shotgun poo poo does no damage it's a field day they have different game modes some of you might have already clicked away and not giving it a fair chance yeah i've been enjoying myself quite a good bit hi the hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to t3 arena and i know you're like what what in the name am i looking at right now i know well it's um but but this worked out okay it's it's a fine thing i've made nearly 4 000 videos in the past like decade okay and only like three have been mobile games so that should tell you if i'm making one on it i think it's pretty good well if you played mobile games this is the way i relate a lot of it to imagine brawl stars but it's a third-person hero shooter and so if you're like well that intrigues me same and then i've actually been enjoying myself quite a good bit so if you guys want to see more of this let me know spent an embarrassingly long amount of time on this layout for maybe one video but that's that's okay yeah so 3v3 hero shooter uh here are the heroes i currently have unlocked and some are locked and i know with the full release there'll be at least one new hero to boot uh i like a lot of these people you know like definitely not tracer the five star difficulty who has dual auto pistols and dashes but ultimate sends out an exploding hologram so checkmate atheists we can look at a whole bunch of different people maybe two three i don't know we're gonna you know what let's start with someone i think is kind of busted frankly so hopefully i'll look good first game at least has a double-barreled shotgun that shoots paper bullets this thing sucks i never i never use it so you're like what well is she good well her ability she switches to a large credible assault rifle i pretty much only use that in her ultimate she sends out a timed bomb which i always miss doesn't really matter i just use the assault rifle and every person has a passive ability but you have to get them high enough level and then get it from a loot box thing which i don't have anyone nearly that high enough best of all controller support you can't remap the buttons which been unfortunate i really hope with full release you can because otherwise i i don't know if i'm going to stick the controller i really want to i'm a boomer all right and my body is fickle i don't know how you kids look at your phones i looked down to play a game for like 10 minutes on my phone i got a headache everything's cramping i think i'm dying heart palpitations the whole bit we're going to start off with a game of free-for-all they have different game modes you unlock them yadda yadda yadda look let's not delay let's just get into it so i can show you all the sauce some of you might have already clicked away and not given it a fair chance but here's the thing that whole gaming stigma you know 10 years ago i also gate capped also check this out if i immediately come up here and then i just pull out my assault rifle it's it's okay wait wait wait somebody's here it's weird my game froze or some of this weird so yeah here's shotgun pew pew does no damage look at this person out here being a little boner okay this assault rifle just does in illegal amounts of damage it's insane practically infinite range okay let me show you the shotgun already here's the damage leaves a lot to be desired frankly hold on go time to bomb that you all walk you body blocked all the bullets oh okay so that's the guy that has a real shotgun i see you hey no why are you backing up first off yo weirdo yeah mobile games have come a lot a long way and some mobile games are better than pc games okay and you're like ah but there's a lot of trash mobile games you tell me there's not a lot of trash pc games have you go look at like new games released daily on steam and tell me you know everything's saturated these days oh come here come here oh you went the other way then i altered okay this person doesn't have opposable thumbs that's the good news the oh okay okay i was barely just not leading you correctly i reckon there is aim assist whether or not you have controller friction everything i mean it's a mobile game what else do you expect uh there is critical damage as well if you get head shots as you can see there they died in record time okay hold on okay wait oh my god wait i'm stuck not cool dude first off yeah oh that's that's a kill minimum maybe okay looks like it did it's minimal amount of damage but enough damage then i got the kill anyway okay we're gonna get the last kill by being the scum aka just going to the top of this free-for-all arena come here oh wait wait wait that's the tank and he's pushing me oh that's not good okay but he doesn't know how to you stole my kill you will pay the ultimate price so free dude that's a free-for-all dub yup three out of four cards i'll thumbs up everybody even though nobody ever thumbs up me high five myself all the time whatever gold's across the board if it's a shooter game on pc console mobile i'm a gamer we'll keep going through characters actually just unlocked this fella labula and we'll do another game mode why not let's do um control now don't be fooled when you start playing uh for a very long time much longer than you also thought in fact i think i have a bot on my team you're paired with bots and then they slowly add a couple people in until it's eventually up but like i'm talking a lot about i was like surely they'll stop giving me bots and they didn't okay and and we're all just running in as a little team well that's cute but guess what i have aoe damage i thrive in this environment i'm just kidding i'm so weak holy but you guys saved me thank you so much so this plant-looking sprout little thing i am spawn a copy of myself that shoots whatever i shoot at and i die now my little copy doesn't move but as i found out you can if you kind of sit still and they don't see you activating your alt they actually might be fooled for a split second on which one you are and that could be the difference all right i'm gonna spawn a copy myself and i'm gonna sit still and then i'm just gonna spray them okay that's not fair she has she has aoe oh gosh oh gosh body block ah you but there's something so nice about the mobile games like this they're non-committal and as you all know i have commitment issues he just just asked my wife i'm just kidding wait i need another kill go extra me game over great job me cross the board nobody thumbs me up that's fine i'll pretend that all those weren't me but my teammates showering me with love and affection sure i'll show you guys this ironically i have like the most amount of crowns on this guy i don't know why i played him so much because i'm kind of bad with him he's a sniper very similar to the sniper and tf2 widowmaker and overwatch pretty much any sniper ever in the hero shooter where the longer you hold your shot the more damage it does let's uh throw back something normal something casu i don't have to explain this it's team deathmatch i love this map's aesthetic though okay see i'm gonna line up this shot and they went invisible oh and there's the headshot 7 500 damage i i don't know if there's anyone that can or will survive that okay and a little flick for the headshot see that's all you gotta do it hurts a whole bunch a fudge okay okay well that's missed that flick didn't miss that one you see and unless they're pushing me it's a field that oh you went invulnerable and invisible at the worst possible time okay get away from me ah no okay i gotta call my helmet out that didn't do much damage but get flicked on ah classic oh oh my i'm so sorry but i'm not okay i don't know how i missed that okay and then you're just gonna make my life real simple go invisible i'm gonna keep terrorizing this lobby and i'm up i'm almost starting to feel bad about it but i still don't and there's a flick it's it's that easy and this guy wait actually where did he go oh he okay well he baited me they're going to jump to their death in three two one three two two one five three two three american come here last kill let's get it baby oh okay it wasn't pretty but we got it oh great healing see i'll give you a thumbs up way to go andre 1086. i'm proud of you oh and andre thumbs me up i don't think i've ever had anyone thumbs me up i love you andre your your match made based on how many trophies or crowns or whatever they call it your current hero you're using has i'll show you guys one last game um with christine and we'll do crystal assault which is it's a base mode so you each have bases essentially crystals and you try and push their base and destroy their crystal while they're trying to destroy your bases crystal so you decide whether or not you want to go destroy theirs defend yours do both yeah whatever you know what i'm saying well golem says don't sleep on it i know it's mobile game lol to some of you because i know a majority of my audience isn't really a mobile gamer but um i'm just gonna say it's fun okay it's casual and i hope they have ranked at launch uh i'd be hopefully get like joey and somebody else to like actually squat like this is a game a mobile game i'd be willing to hop into discord and just cue and play some games frankly i'm trying to see where they are okay so they're puppy guardians so to speak uh so i'm just gonna let loose my abilities here i stuck him yeah that'll do and uh we do insane damage if uh we can get direct hits kind of like that and then we have this guy turtle turtling going for our base well not for long come here that's what that's that's that's it wait wait oh god ah it's so free i was never worried about it so i think it's pretty obvious at this point but yeah every character has one ability one ultimate a weapon but here's my old it's like a ham adult i throw down a whole bunch of mines um and hopefully it kills them he is like the tankiest hero uh and you see our guy just going in so that's part of it like this dude's just like yo i don't care who comes over here because i'm here to damage the crystal and as the game goes on you can actually do more damage to the crystal and multiplier increases stick some people with my things you know farm the damage had the kd miss all of my shots okay but now i'm gonna swing him from downtown funky stuff along oh my god i'm kind of eating oh sheesh wait wait this is actually so free wait a second why didn't i just do this i mean it took a little while sure just gonna alt you oh no he stunned me no you need to go away sir okay andy's off and he just wants to go damage the crystal okay i mean to your detriment just uh let him have it hey we go yeah yeah yeah yeah is the damage worth it buddy oh god no get away from me okay oh no okay but they're killing the crystal and that should do it our astronaut dude i don't remember his name had fun and interactive gameplay because good for him he played the obj let's see oh lmao his uh objective damage didn't even get on the screen that's embarrassing look t3 arena may 27th uh i'm pretty sure because it's just a beta 2 and everything i'm sure i think my entire thing will be wiped but i'll be playing it hope to see you guys there um if you see me in the match upvote my cards please and if you guys want to see more on the channel let me know but i'm sure it'll be decisive or divisive rather because yeah most of you are like console and pc people not really mobile players but i'm just kind of a gamer in the sense that it doesn't really matter where the game is i have fun with the game i play the game with that said thank you much for watching every single day today i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] [Music] you
