cowards yeah okay that's just the body shop but you know okay get this guy seated right now just fantasy oh jesus are you kidding me come on enemy team heidi ho everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and i greet you today as none other than that's right pepe the frog he's back i'm telling you this armor is gonna come back into fashion although i guess in order for it to come back in the fashion it had to be in fashion in the first place but well at least it was for me anyway that's semantics even though god i look sexy we're gonna be looking at uh new handkerchief because i heard it's the bee's knees and i like bees actually that's why but i do like knees look at it love the new design this season it's a stasis hand cannon isn't that cool yeah uh it's uh 180 rpm hand cannon which i guess is just like the rage these days but i i can choose between a chambered compensator for the greater stability recoil but a little less handling speed or full bore for greatly increased range that kind that kind of seems like the play i don't know uh increase magazine size or slight your increased stability and greatly increased reload speed sure shoot to loot isn't this fun shooting an ammo brick picks it up and automatically reels all of your equipped weapons from reserves in pvp i mean i mean harmony ooh neutrate final blows with other weapons improve this weapon's damage and performance for a short duration how short of iteration i don't know and how much doesn't prove it i also don't know but that's why i brought with me the adored i know it's a pvp sniper so i can attempt to get some kills with this and then switch over to the vulpecula and i don't know see uh see what that's like that's all i got for you yeah we're uh we're just as always we're jumping into it we're doing it live now there is iron banner going on and i could play it but um what if i didn't so we'll hop into control and then maybe do a patented rumble match i know most people don't care about pvp these days i feel like or like 6v6 or even really just as a whole 6v6 multiplayer in general even like call of duty and stuff people just like battle royales you know or or gtfo even though you guys watching my majority of my audience seems to not like battle rounds so i don't really know where we [ __ ] there i don't know like what what you guys want from me but down to play some more destiny you know i'm always going to come in and out in and out i've been keeping up with the story quests are a little bit behind but hey what are you gonna do it's kind of like school right you show up and that's like 80 you know you're probably gonna get a passing grade as long as you show up and pay attention now if you do all the homework you can succeed you know getting a plus but i didn't do my homework or at least not all of it rusted lanes good old throwback look at my fine team here we got a ace of spades a blue hand can it must be 180 or so error medium i don't know kind of sorcery is behind this i wonder i'm not sure but i know what i will do quickly headshot somebody nobody wants to challenge me here huh cowards yeah okay that's just the body shot all right get over jesus you got a death wish man ah everything hurts what is this okay okay yeah must get headshot fudge yeah we gotta kill but it's not with another weapon so i don't get the benefits of harmony in fact as it's nice nice okay actually as it stands unless i activate harmony my gun doesn't have any perks that help actually isn't that incredible you know i can shoot some ammo and i can hope i get a kill with another weapon very f ah fudge okay okay debatable debatable you know if i'm on controller dude amos is helping me out there okay this is one thing i'm trying to work on suck not that's that's not what i'm trying to work on what i'm trying to work on is firing this thing fast enough because i'm just used to older hand canes that fire a little slow so i'm not out here like slap it brother somebody take this sniper away from me this is actually just demoralizing this point fi oh my god wait what is that guy using 140 hand cannon that seemed to absolutely poop on me why the fudge made in a 180. you could have told me that oh oh wait wait harmony harmony come on come on come on give me something to shoot give me something harmony and it's gone are you kidding me i finally get harmony to activate okay harmony harmony harmony come on enemy team ah you can't get back what the fudge i finally get to activate and nobody lets me freaking guys got height advantage oh all right screw this and this is clearly never gonna i also don't know why they don't give me a cooldown i mean obviously it lasts x amount of time fudge me take that granada and now i run like a coward who wants to save his life oh my god hey that worked yo check this out shoot blue wait shoot shoot okay no aim assist on that shoot here we go uh how much was i doing 60 oh did i even have harmony i didn't think i had harmony that's right run away give it away give it away give it away now all right let me just uh shoot to loot oh my god okay harmony harmony again here we go here please man please please bro i'm losing oh my aunt is gone i'm losing my mind man gosh somebody popped hammers somebody's right above it go 180 yeah i don't know oh come on bro give me a shot let me add him boosh okay all right oh what is this man using what what the fudge was any of that what kind of lunge is that you would have thought we were magnetized attracting each other how far he jumped oh oh [ __ ] that oh my harmony harmony oh my god give me yes give me someone to shoot really mr fruit will remember this i'm gonna be honest all right i'm sloppy i'm i'm frosty oh jesus that was like an inch okay okay harmony harmony i don't have the range fudge god i'm so tilted oh my god stop somebody left our team huh cowardice deserter okay how would i just use the pistol first off because i've gotten exponentially more sniper kills than anything else so far and that might just continue oh geez oh come on man all right here we go here we go give fudge me you know what dude i'm over it i'm over i don't care anymore i don't want to preserve this life is this for real life or something is it just fantasy oh jesus who i don't know i got impatient i was like i'm never gonna pop my super unless i just pop it now so i didn't even look for an opportune time i just popped it to pop it in well that's how that went have i even gotten to kill the pistol yes uncertain oh my god where is my aim i mean we killed him but like yikers i don't know what the hubbub is about these 180s i don't know chief but again i mean like it's not like this is peak mr fruit destiny you know like i'm a little rusty but yeah you know when have you guys ever come here for optimal gameplay well i mean let's be honest you always have oh mike that was too eat that was everything about that was just so sad oh i got a kill okay i think this roll might be great for pve this ain't it for pvp jesus okay harmony harmony harmony come on come on try me try me no boner man and now he's gonna what are we doing here what what are we how did wow you took that for me huh i love it don't even try and tell me you secured that we all know you saw hey buddy why don't we have a little sense of urgency oh i don't know maybe throw out your barricade a little bit faster you could have barricaded we would have stopped the damage in fact we would have even healed i can't hit really i'm gonna need to see uh an instant replay on that one chief i don't think he could have seen what you shot me what where do you see me from huh what is da da you know it's ironic we've almost made a comeback and uh that is all because of my team way to go guys i haven't helped in the least what a comeback story that should be but they've almost won well that doesn't sound great oh come on i almost see you oh here we go yeah what an assist no harmony for me get him get him get him get him stupid stupid yeah oh but he still killed one of my friends well hold on i'm gonna help you buddy check this out okay yeah that inner accuracy though i got you buddy oh my god did you even hit him once okay one kill oh my god one kill oh my god i choked and almost ruined the game for us but no we win by one point i hardly believe it myself oh man really what happened mr fruit bottom fracking man really freaking what the [ __ ] is this thing man this is not as seen on tv it's like i watched an infomercial my eyes i don't know man look i'm all out of sorts okay yeah i mean this is like my this will be my like fifth crucible match in half a year maybe so i'm trying to say is a forgive me and i might have to try and grind iron banner while it's here so maybe i'll get a little warm but i'm just gonna be honest maybe 180s vibe with some people this ain't vibing with me i ain't a 180 kind of guy i've always been an auto rifle kind of guy are those meta are those metal right now i don't i haven't seen one somebody please lie to me and tell it's an auto rifle meta so i can just use auto rifles no allies and that way i can blame you guys but while somebody told me was the auto oh god it's rumble i forgot oh jesus i was just ready to go out there and live my life judgment again this is not okay people seem to be using 140s not 180s hello sir sir sir really sir are you kidding me this is what this is the lobby i ran into huh okay it's as if i couldn't see a shotgun barrel just poking out but whatever we'll get past that the jesus craw god just get just get more in top 50 mr fruit top 50 whatever just top three that's weird way of saying just say top three bop harmony harmony let me shoot ah what the fudge okay and it seems like the extra damage i get from harmony i'm still going to four shot no matter what oh my god harmony harmony let me shoot you i have harmony quit running from my thing [Music] i don't even think it i think it ran out that's pretty useful wait i could have shot it with my shoot to loot oh my god oh my god oh yeah yeah yeah all right this is my ark this is my training arc my comeback arc everyone's favorite in an anime even even rocky had an anime arc like that that's how mainstream it got [Music] harmony harmony jesus dude where are you plebs oh 69 nice wait i might be able to three shot actually with it you're in first place i'm gonna cut him off he's not gonna expect me to go this way okay what are you doing man put the shotgun away all right let me help you pop that's kind of okay wait maybe shoot the loot's kind of nice especially in like a free-for-all setting like this oh jeez come on oh i walked into that well played he knows how impatient i am yo you just killed him here i know you want his you don't want his ammo oh fudge me what are you using a fusion rifle you make me sick maybe i should be doing that whatever oh come on i know you're harmony harmony the more i the more i sing it one day it's gonna freaking pan out today is evidently not that day you can take your gosh darn fusion rifle and shove it where the sun don't shine mister because you make me sick are you kidding me not a crutch at all dude not a crutch at all happy for you in fact i'm real happy for you what up my guy's right what he's right get your get this guy's [Applause] i hate it here but soon enough i won't because i'm gonna win who am i kidding he has his old he's got 80 million fusion rifle shots apparently just just okay just use the hand cannon mr fruit just just stick with the hand cannon lean with it rock with it lean oh my god no wonder you're in first good lord what is that i'm sure he's got like fusion rifle scavenger two and everything so he gets like four shots every time of course you can just one shot with it it's just an easier shotgun you know it all makes it all adds up oh my god oh that was kind of nice i'm gonna i'm gonna be honest with you all oh screw you harmony harmony please man whatever he's probably still sitting around here with his fusion rifle yeah there he is harmony harmony so good you're such a good player man really bravo yeah deserved god how are me harmony i don't even have like stats freaking i don't have any i don't know what i'm doing you've disappointed me for the last time myself i make myself sick is this even a good i don't know that's a scout rifle probably not feeding frenzy opening shots yo screw harmony screw 180s i ain't gonna adapt uh-uh i'm using fusion rifles from here on out dude if i've learned anything it's that why aim when you can when you contain the fusion rifle not my best not my best with that said i don't think all very much for watching let me know if there's a gun you want to see me review um because who wouldn't want to see review like this again huh yeah i'll talk to you guys in the next one farewell [Music] [Music] you
