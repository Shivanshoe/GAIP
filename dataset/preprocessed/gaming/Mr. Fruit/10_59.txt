respect the content i don't want to be treated differently turn them in and let me invade it's a win-win for everybody god i'm such a daddy this is so embarrassing anybody gonna help that heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and fudge the sun just went behind the clouds it was perfect it was right over my shoulder but i had to turn some the moments passed this is what i'm trying to say here and actually great segway here because that might not be the only thing that's passed or is gone or should be put away i think you know where i'm going with this if you guessed that meant dredging then you're right that's why i'm a dredging baby because i'm hopping back into the just forgot the name of the pla the thing with gambit and i say hopping back into it because god was the last time i game it was on the channel i'm here for a very specific reason though it's broken like omega broken like this is it's bad i'm gonna try and demonstrate for you all let me put it this way the ariana's vow if you invade one shots with a body shot it just kills that's it you're done evidently what's been happening is all or at least some weapons in gambit are doing their pve damage not pvp so ariana's vows just pooping on people among other things it's just it's the wild west out there i was like i'm not all right i ain't touching that with a 10 foot pole but you know what i'm doing it for the content which means i i love you guys all right it's not like gambit is my first choice and we'll talk about why that is i don't have anything against gambit per se like personally i just don't find it that much fun when it first released it had some appeal gambit prime was like a cool little thing that happened but then kind of grew old really quick and then i think the problem with gambit is when there are glaring issues or rather let me rephrase that when there are issues they're always glaring and it's really hard to just gloss past those you know what i mean there are people who like like it you know i'm not going to say that it's not true and you know good for them and if you enjoy i'm not here to poop on your party uh but i think it could help everybody if they figured out what exactly to do with gambit kind of feels like pvp right now where it yes it is in the game and that's about all i can say about that you know like yes it exists it is a thing that you can play inside of destiny how much care does it get you crosstalk you know it's for another day all right i gotta wait to bank my moats though brother because when i bank i gotta be the one to get in and invade because i i don't know how gung-ho my teammates here are you know maybe they're a couple pvp fraggers like bro let me in and i'd be like no because i got the harry on uh for the content you know what i'm saying come on respect the content i don't want to be treated differently who am i kidding yes i do for the god give me this how do i not have 15 yet let's remedy that there we go all right if we all do it now we'll be fine except they're about to invade which is very bad except wait if they invade can't i just use my arionus yeah wait a second where is he um he's using it he's using it yep that whoa not not so funny and interesting when um you're on the receiving end got to say and look at our notes okay really yeah well what's the point what are we doing here why bother playing the rest of this game out oh my god that's just there's no excuse like what oh my god again okay well i know where he is he tried oh my god dude in practice it's so much worse oh my god i was like man that that must be terrible and now that i'm like playing against they're like whoever invades first with ariana in this game in this case it was like well that's the game okay i'm going it's my turn to torture them as long as they don't ariana's me first right oh but let me look at this okay ariana's ariana not ariana's ariana's little monarch ariana not ariana's what the fudge i think everyone that doesn't have ariana's is on my team and their entire team as ariana's guys did you not get the memo sarah i don't think he has ariana's foul let's see if he can get a kill because literally if the entire enemy team has ariana like that then you invade and you're kind of like oh my god wait he he got a hand cannon kill okay well then never mind he probably has the arianas well somebody else on my team does right so obviously something like this is uh is a supernatural or like super extra circumstance here that's not normal and while there might be some merit or stuff that people go hey gambit blah blah blah true don't fudge i don't get a date i'm trying to not be jealous or jealous i just can't talk right now greedy help my team by banking that uh we can summon our prime evil if you guys yeah there you go you gotta watch that you got a little stuff on your butt yeah you know different strokes for different blokes and if gambit's your stroke good for you and if you have gra or like you do like it but you just think it's not in the right place fair too you know if they want to change the game it's totally fine go for it i just don't know what it needs like i'm not sitting here like well if i kick it i could give you so much better i would yeah i got nothing all right i ain't saying i got the solutions now where is this dude okay he has ariana's he knows where everyone's dying but from where i i don't know he's that what the [ __ ] for the for the sake of the video and signs we're gonna do another one but oh my god just hope we get a bank first and invade first i guess let's do a little ariana's check here okay tommy's matchbook nothing i bet they're on my team dollar horn ariana there we go cajoler horn what what the fudge is this what okay there's only one other ariana's here that's nice so you know it hasn't reached all corners of the globe where everyone knows about it or perhaps some people actually have a backbone and spine and aren't doing it clearly that's not me cause i'm here doing it not i'm not happy about it i feel like that's something i should specify here as soon as this video is done i'm taking this off and probably just not gonna touch gambit anymore why would i i don't want to do that to somebody i believe the other ariana's is on the other team so see how that goes all right you know the drill team or maybe you don't because no one has ariana's on but we just get moats asap turn them in let me invade it's a win-win for everybody you just gotta believe me all right and i was like who are you what are you talking about man just trust okay a little blind faith never hurt anybody all right because that's what i need right now arthur arthur in fact i'm finna just go ahead and bank mine okay are you banking one he's he's banking one okay you're helping that's huh okay just let us bank first guys come on somebody just clear ad clear turn in bang those motes brother like you know the drill come on ding ding ding ding ding like you know game but come on it's never good enough that's 10 okay i'm gonna go turn this but i have 12 i'm close to 15. but i don't think i'm gonna i gotta stop them from being able to bank go go go go go everyone turn in turn them in turn please he's 13. he's being greedy come on guys somebody i'm actually god they're gonna they're gonna be i'm trying and so it begins and they're gonna invade first guys okay as long as you can get us 15 in though i i'm good okay put it in put it in yes okay they don't have that many moats to lose but okay well it's a problem when you're not as bad as i am oh my god i didn't even see him i'm so focused on the dude jumping oh my god this is embarrassing i'm i'm embarrassed i'm embarrassed what am i doing i'm like yeah it's so good yeah vision and well we were close to another invade but that ain't happening anymore huh there we go see i got it [Music] everything hurts somebody help me with this loaded cap any anybody anybody gonna have that i'm so focused on this uh i'm just an absolute daddy and you realize somebody could be this bad at gambit but i'm like yo hold my mouth brother because i'm dropping them all what the fudge am i doing dude okay i need you guys oh god they're about to be able to invade i need oh boy oh there's no way okay oh jesus where's the invader everyone and we're all dead yep all right well you got one of them jesus okay to be fair i could have prevented some oats you know it will not but again we only got one invasion they got two and don't you dare stop stop that's fine whatever i mean i i don't but frankly i don't deserve it going right why do i have two ariana shots though what i should have way more than this how about you huh any special ammo no what's wrong with you what's wrong with all of you why can't i pick up that mode he got three kills though okay way to go buddy god i'm such a daddy this is so embarrassing how do i uh i'm banking brother okay all right fudge i only have two shots but that should be two kills yeah okay see there we go one that that's one yet that'll do it he was invisible but it did oh we just got our primeval it's doable am i right or am i just kill me all right just get that on boy brother what why what's hurting me so much all right dps tps i'm going in i'm going it now got one oh my god i missed here's a rocket come on fudge i'm gonna run out of time [Music] no oh oh so weak hey that that better that was better you're all right i got you buddy shake it off i'll shake it off i'll shake it off uh i need special ammo new special ammo excuse me where is it oh god i don't have anything for this uh jesus it's 100 gonna be the hunter you guys see him nice oh my god wait wait guys we can we can win here hold on we gotta get these on boys quick wait i've got some dps invader game or on boy gamers though hold up hold up this is we focus this it it's possible hold on oh my god i have no ammo come on oh my god what look at us okay never say never wow good job team i sucked all right one more go i just need to go go in there and wipe the team okay team of four this will be fun hold up hold up oh none of them oh that's a cool uh ornament i've never seen it none of them are very honest so invading i have a cooler advantage i have a three on my team though with ariana's tommy's matchbook jowerhorn okay so this mr arianas might be like hey let me invade sorry buddy okay personally i'd like to see a game be a little something else i don't know when i initially heard them pitch pv evp i was like i was like oh my god that sounds so cool and i don't i don't know it's it's okay it's all right but again i know for a lot of people this is you know this is their thing and people love it and that's fair but i think it is i don't need to see the numbers to know that it it probably is the least played like main activity so to speak or however you want i don't really know how you describe it but like obviously there are less people who do like grand masters probably maybe even like trot man probably not trials but you know what i mean but i feel like the big difference too though is like grand master doesn't take many resources this is an entire differently game oh with different assets different like i'm sure this is a lot so i'm sure some people like well you could just you know use that energy somewhere else personally i wouldn't mind a little pvp love i think that's supposed to be this or the next season or something so you know i can't say much until that time hey look at me look i am the captain no i'm going through all right all right i'm come behind them i don't even actually know where i'm going to land but two down where you at huh 10 seconds left okay this is embarrassing there we go come on one more nah ah fudge oh put it i'll go back in i'll go back in i'll do it oh i'm doing it okay here i go they won't even be able to clear the blockers i won't let them dead dead it's that easy dead wait what okay he was invisible or something where's the last one oh ah there you are yellow rascal dude ah i'm sorry guys yeah that's all right but i think we have a little bit of time on our hands here yeah not not too much of a hurry personally maybe my team disagrees but yeah i think we're uh we're kind of vibing here birds flying high you know how i feel you know how i feel i just don't know how they haven't like fixed this immediately because like i didn't bother do something i was like oh this is getting patched like asap it's been like a week now and nothing and this is pretty egregious like this isn't like oh well i mean this is literally game changing if you have ariana's and the others don't you are at a significant advantage okay hey what you doing down there man what's the envoy doing yo let me invade again huh huh i wouldn't do that take this nah screw your time gates health gates whatever all right he's around here somewhere i found him i wonder if armor of light would save him they might enemy wait oh my don't tell me wait does that shoot through bubble it kind of i thought it was in bubble maybe he barely peeked oh my does the armor piercing go through i don't know oh my god that's disgusting all right let's just end their misery please come on guys okay all right you're free enemy team i'm so i'm so sorry um but not i'm taking it off all right i'm taking it off we're moving on so what have we learned today you know let's let's just assess gambits are very messy and it has been for a while and i it just i just feel like it doesn't have its identity right now and you might be what are you talking about well just hear me out you know i something's there but i feel like they gotta figure out where they want to go and lean into it more i think for most players it's just not their cup of tea mine included but i think i can speak for everyone when i say please fix this as soon as you can because like unless i was doing this video i i wasn't even gonna do my three matches to to just get my pinnacle i was like i ain't doing that and i'm i'm sure i'm not alone there and probably the people who don't know what's going on getting destroyed by ariana's like what like what's going on dude see it hopefully gets this fixed this gets fixed like it's kind of frankly when i first heard it i just kind of laughed like this is funny i don't i'm sure they're also like how did this happen like what spaghetti noodle did we accidentally you know mess with and it just brought the whole thing down but i hope gambit you know gets some love here soon and and finally becomes what everyone wants it to be and um hopefully those pvp changes also come soon pvp hasn't been touched in a long time i'm starting to feel like overwatch too over here [Music] [Music] you
