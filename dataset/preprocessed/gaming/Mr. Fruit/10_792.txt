hi ad home run my name's mr. fruit and welcome back Cobb UT modern warfare and a new decade happy new years everybody I hope you had a safe and wonderful time with a new year and a new decade comes brand new opportunities I hope your future brings you nothing but happiness health and good fortune but unfortunately 2020 means we have to say goodbye to shipment shoot as 24/7 is back which I'm not upset about but I am upset that there's no longer shipment now mainly I miss shipment because well let's just be on it's the best map for challenges and you guys know me I'm on the road to Damascus and 2020 is the year we get it well I guess it's a good thing we got another gold weapon I told you guys I'm doing the marksman rifles we got the car done currently leveling up the EBR this thing is hot garbage I hate this we'll be using a sim card custom 21 point two inch barrel dad to AK laser step i'll griptape hmm it's the monel cool reflex i drew in the f2 export to him stock you guys know me i like ma'am down to site speed I like my sprint to fire speed that's what we're going for and of course in the back we're going with the rocket launchers I cannot wait until I have rocket launchers done so one I can go back to using killstreaks and not specialists and two I never have to use these stupid things again it really is driving me off a cliff right now like I am who for myself I've already put a lot of time into this game for some of you like those are rookie numbers but for me with all the stuff I have to do and all the other games I like to play this this actually says a lot but three and a half days doesn't seem like much because apparently the consensus for most Damascus people are talking about it took them anywhere from seven and a half days to nine and a half days of play time so looks like we're barely getting started but look at this thing oh girl you looking good yes you're I do love the marksman rifles the car the carbine and as far as I'm aware the EBR that's just an estranged okay that rip it's like an estranged cousin or something we just we just say it is it we have to include it in family dinners and stuff because we're morally obligated you know it lost its parents it doesn't have another family we don't want to but we do we have to you know just because they're family doesn't mean you always have to like them but you know you have to try and play nice and that's what we do with the the EBR because yeah if you can't I I I just don't I don't like it I like it okay I said it I said it and I'm not taking well what Wow it's like we're playing shipment huh oh this is bad this is bad usually Oh hold up cashton I need to be more vigilant The Joker also drives me crazy because if there is anybody else on my team shooting killstreaks we're not gonna get it because it takes half a minute and then depending on the kill streak unless you are able to find and shoot it immediately you're not gonna get get a kill because it takes so long to get there we got that one though so that's good the worst part too is the ground kill shrieks because everybody I look at videos I originally will just go into ground war and shoot neutral vehicles guess what they patch that like two weeks ago so I can't do that anymore and you know how many people use ground kill streaks almost nobody and then on top of that let's say there's like a Wilson well with the Joker you have to be far enough away to lock-on which is like never and then on top of that you have to wait for it to get down point is it just it just all that was a hit marker okay okay so oh oh this is pretty all all let me shoot it no person who UAVs are the best because they count as aerial and ground killstreaks don't ask me why oh but anybody that uses it oh I love you I love you I love you just wait for those magical words to show up nope yes cut off boom okay UAV down we can do this I will get these launchers and everyone says launchers are the worst get those out of the way and it's smooth sailing figuratively speaking deal I apparently consult rifles they'll take the longest well aside from rocket launchers but they're not nearly as infuriating you know and my numbing sir if you could refrain from killing my friends I'd really appreciate that you know not really big on the whole murder and my friends the hanging arms and wait okay it's just oh wait right behind me what is that dude doing I don't know oh yes yes personally God who is this keep fragging my son keep getting a three kill streak and then dying over and over and over oh this is perfect this is perfect oh yes yes yes yes yes oh there's another UAV yeah give me yes oh wait she'll turn wait a minute this is another ground kill streak this is even better okay if I do it right there is that good enough fudge oh my god I just killed myself with Oh God oh jeez hold on I don't care the bath UAV as much of drag this week's are harder to do kinda this you heard do come on come on shoot the stupid thing okay okay okay oh come on missile don't destroy the shield tert whatever you plebs do yes we did it we did it we scrapped it I know I know this is a car video mr. fruit all you talk about is the rocket laundries cuz you got a double dip my friends two-for-one special if you're not doing both at the same time then you're doing it wrong I'm always on that grind man I don't even know if I enjoy this game right now I'm just so blinded by camos I'm just like whatever did for the camo it's not like you you only live once wait oh jeez this is amazing who is who uses these things I thought I just don't know how I can't walk on - Oh Jesse I'm too far holdout sir is this like in the Dickens okay well Oh Oh collide problem is though I can't lock on unless I'm far enough away so I have to try and sneak behind the enemy nobody killed no you son of a hey what the very least I guess I'll go for UAV whatever and a personal radar this does count for both so we're double dipping I am dead though yeah welcome to my life by the way like this is what I have to do every game so if you think this is miserable a hoe you sweet summer job I can't wait until I never have to destroy another kill streak huh goon I want to use the car I do Oh kid welp sentries gone anyway alright it's my turn just to start frag and that's right I can start shooting you guys a kid you're out dead bar wait what made the dickens well Custer's trying watch me frag out here Oh but Wow okay the camera challenges and stuff too for the car actually not that bad look the laser disappeared oh come on come come come come come come on come on yup lab I see you're right I see you're pokin I missed okay I quit I give up on life enemy personal radar yes yes seriously who is this guy you're the greatest and it's even better because my team isn't shooting down killstreaks I was getting so frustrated I was about ready just like tweet out like yo I don't care your skill level I don't care what you do I'm just looking for a full team on PC all you need to do is not shoot killstreaks thank you because I was getting I'd do this and then I'd see some other guys rocket just home and on it and kill it before mine every freakin time and I'm telling you if your aim is on point and you're warm dude oof this thing can be nastier no that's why I love this in the car buying the one-shot possibility and everything EB are can one shot but only to the head it would appear otherwise it's usually a two shots sometimes a three I've seen at least I feel like I have I don't know could be some sort of a bias come get you ammo come catch ammo kids and most good for the soul so my grandma always said it grenaded get destroyed oh my god I'm just an animal do you know would like to note I'm top of my team while spending half of the game shooting things in my rocket launcher so yeah I think the car practically speaks fur at dodge it doesn't speak for fudge no one speaks for fudge fudge is a proud independent dessert and it it will cheese I'm so glad that guy has absolutely no situational awareness otherwise I was dead seven different ways to Sunday yeah if you think I'm sexy and you want my body come on baby let me know I'll have you know all use stem stands gotten way better at it alright it's actually making a difference now okay what is my controller keeps getting all sticky controller mr. fruit what are you talking about you mean your mouse and keyboard you're right my peripherals apologies have died using a controller come on now oh that's a UAV I'll die for this I don't care i don't have killstreaks anyway good who's yeah I haven't been able to get my favorite war crime and God knows how long man it's just not it's not right yeah wait what I was taking a sip of my water staying hydrated as any good gamer should ah where's that dude that frags and gets personal radars you want to start fragging again I will take the UAVs we'll see the problem isn't the aerial kill streak because I can walk on with the UAV it's the ground kill streaks whereas it was the opposite what is this man doing lying on the floor you know how gross that 4 is how dirty it is yes know who dish who see I need names somebody on my team destroyed that she'll turn without letting me destroy it and I am no no I'm not ok with it there are the free firing rocket launchers these were the problem aerial killstreak because you can never get the easy lock cons with UAVs this way that's not the case this and the Strela earth knows the pilaf sorry a guy dude I feel like I could tell you about everything there is to know about rocket launchers right now and not that I would ever want to but unfortunately it's all that's been on my mind and all I'm using and all I have a over although still very happy with the marksman rifles don't understand some people have brought out their brought up rather why does this count no this isn't the ground oh oh oh there it is ah love you and a UAV well don't mind if I do look at this utilizing all of my ammo skadoosh why the Dragunov isn't a marksman rifle and the car isn't a sniper they're twisted but it's perfectly fine because honestly this is what I like to do with my sniper rifles but none of them can really long really short scopes or even like iron sights and that's what the car can do we love it oh this guy so dead I was gonna mail I am but he he turned around it's gonna whack whack well I didn't need to demonstrate we're pretty sure how the whacking goes wow wow wow you'd actually let me move some weight bro I think in exactly light and you would just toss that thing around like a stack of potatoes actually no it's not that easy to toss around potatoes so I'd take that back shield Turk chill Turk shield turret where is it requested years hold on hold on hold on yes okay okay we fired away far we know one destroy it yes let's go when Stanley this has become a great game for my Joker launcher let's hope it stays that way oh my god the lord hath deliver it look at this another one again we love personal radars fudge if you are any sort of a self-respecting person you'll put on personal radar so that everyone else trying to grind out rocket launchers can do so sort of painlessly okay ah screw ya where's this UAV there it is I remember when I could just play the game before and not have to worry about any different things and as soon as I hear a UAV or anything just go ahead and shoot that down also going to your Witcher Oh Valley Oh plenty oh hey it's me I just play the game Colette for the trip Oh grazie right showing off a golden gun while trying to get another Golden Gun simultaneously oh my god okay we destroyed all aerial killstreaks which means all we have left is ground-based vehicles 35 more for them screw it whatever man whatever man whatever man okay I'm recording this you know January 1st in the morning a couple hours before you guys were gonna see this it had a crazy night last night trying to recover you know what I'm saying yeah I went to bed at 10:00 p.m. I just pretended I was on the east coast so it was like I was i waited for the new yeah look I'm an old man okay what do you want for me I like to go to bed at a reasonable time so that I wake up around the same time every morning around like 6:30 6:45 keeps me bread minty to get a good amount of sleep it's the most important thing in your life to staying healthy making sure my joints and my muscles get to get to heal up and all that kind of stuff okay so I don't need your nonsense also if you use mustard gas I hate you I'm sorry now that most maps put on shipment don't be that guy just off Sponge Bob hell every corner is like eight mustard gasses you run around you can never even shoot your gun because you're just like my lungs oh that was almost glad I thought about it boom you're dead oh you a B C I don't need to shoot those anymore though those are useless to me and we are only looking for counter UAVs personal radars because those both count as ground I believe and then well any ground vehicle kill straight so in other words just personal radars counter UAVs are few and far between personal radars are probably oh you get that ask and you shall receive stop stop stop stop stop yes yes yes more personal radars pass a coin do yo which room ovalle hope lend he could not get that song stuck out of my head I don't know all the words yet but we'll get there don't worry a humble bard came across a ride-along with Geralt of ribs fudge there's another personal radar so [ __ ] this is incredible no no no no stop shooting it knew me I didn't even wait did I not even get the first one oh no no can I give me a van privileges I'm kicking him I'm kicking him who the fudge thinks that they're good enough that they can just shoot down this kook they're not even using launchers they're just shooting it down with normal guns that doesn't even make sense you don't need to do that stop oh it went from so good to so poor so quickly please you hate to see that you're dead you're dead you're dead hahahahaha that's three head shots to see I deserve this personal radar what is this other Joe Schmo doing huh except for being a boner fart not a whole lot honestly it's a teeny-weeny little boner too but a big old fart as I make you feel boner fright you're dead god I love the Marchman rifles gonna be sad to stop using them yes yes but no I swear to God the problem is I'm actually marking them for my team when I spot them but I mean they're it's not important I'm watching this I'm making sure that I am getting this perfect you're not disappearing are you yes okay whatever that's what we got when the White Wolf fought the silver-tongued devil is army of elves at his hooves did they rebel ten another personal radar you're the greatest okay which one am i shooting that one okay so we're gonna go for this one oh my god please more more personal you this doesn't crowd a ball if I could get this done sooner rather than later oh my god I'm just nice with the marksman rifles that's up when you were insane mr. fruit is he pushing me I bet he's pushing me screw it I'm out of here Oh leave us steamed up baby and I got a lie I've got friends in all the right places oh he like he like crouched at the perfect time that's incredible move yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes let me shoot down there for sure no prude or I think I think I'm addicted yeah I think it's some sort of like an endorphin release or something I don't I don't really know but ya know give me give me these killstreaks man I can't help it over here like you'll get any more this personal radars I'm in withdrawals that's what I'm worried about one day yeah I know I am determined like I've set I've set myself up I've made a goal and my god even if it's super hard for me to do with my normal schedule stuff my god I'm doing it for you guys I'm do it and for me I don't know I think this point doing it more for you guys than me because I want to be a man of my word but I'm going to do it and then I'm worried though the moment I get Damascus now what Oh personal radar though I'll just have to like play the game normally I know it's weird okay I'm pretty sure there's another one no which one am i shooting I just can never tell I know whichever one dies okay we're not we didn't shoot that one let me go oh come on come on come on bow cut off yes this is actually incredible because if you've been using the launchers trying to grind them you know a game like this does not come along very often normally you get like two or oh you already dead like two or three that kill streaks you're looking for in a game but we've already got what I personal radars or something man if I could keep this up every game oh man my life would be so much easier what's the less just off budge tis not whole I don't even I don't even need to be able to see in order to be able to kill you boy that looks like we got to veto but I don't care because first the radar you guys are actually does the beat all I think the VTOL might actually count as a ground kill streak the thingy behind it is that it just flies so low to the ground but uh don't ask I mean I have no idea just talking at him about are we gonna kill it if my thing can get there quick ah fudge we didn't even kill it oh my god yes mr. fruit is this a gold car video are you grinding for rocket logical yes my friends yes it's both simultaneously isn't it beautiful like a look into the madness okay just want you to understand what I suffer through every day oh oh oh like this I'll get this excited in my life I hear any personal radar above and I'm just like no to answer your question yes something is 100% wrong with me I should have stemmed right there but personal radar really yeah this this might not is it great how many is this in this game alone whole wheat crap how many did I need to get like 30 more dang we probably gotten like six seven eight either way we are we are far above the the average kill streak game normally it's honestly one to two and that's if the enemy is even running the killstreaks you're looking for oh yes no I'm just tired about rylander's bla bla bla bla and then just for Ag him with the car because I do love me these marksman rifles so good at this game did God it's incredible oh fudge yeah it's embarrassing mr. fruit don't capture chickens before they hatch or don't capture it at country I'm pretty sure that's what it is how the enemies about to win ah fudge guys stop him wait no they have personal radars they can still do no we got a lab in that game let's go oh yeah the gold card yeah no it's cool I'm starting to think maybe I should finish the rocket launchers before doing another gold video so that I'm not distracted the entire time by trying to go the rocket launchers but finishing all the rocket launchers oh boy I might be closed on the Joker but we got it ooh so I hope you guys are enjoying my road to insanity I mean Damascus like I said I made a chance for myself and my god I'm gonna do it I'm a stubborn person so I appreciate all your support not only on my camera grind but on these videos really to appreciate it with that said happy feels fantastic gear and new decade I'll talk to you guys in the next one very well [Music]
