oh what the [ __ ] oh jesus christ that's my friend yeah i think i might just do it again huh oh baby hi everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to halo infinite the brand new event has come out and with it fiesta one of my all-time favorite halo game modes so let's relish in it and perhaps pop off along the way so the new st whatever this is event is out fracture tin rye comes out three times during the so you have like three different weeks to go through the whole battle pass i need this i'm close let's be honest i need it and look at this look at that and of course there's a little sword which is unfortunate that this is the free one and uh you go to the shop and then the the 20 times better one is 15 bucks for that and uh an emblem doesn't even change your melee if it changed my melee i'm gonna be honest i'd buy it right now but it doesn't so but whatever um so yeah level 14 on the battle pass probably doesn't seem like that much of an achievement i haven't bought a level i got to be like top five in the world okay believe this limited edition complete a limited time challenge point one percent of players completed all challenges last week i was one of them why did i do that to myself i don't know but i did it i finished it like 30 minutes before reset now the funny thing too is uh everybody ends up getting that weekly visor because 343 messed up so there really was no point but i did it anyway so now there's new event challenges and i think you only level it by completing the event challenges which happen to be in fiesta which is sick the only problem is like kill any spartans with pulse carbine that's not gonna happen in fiesta let's be honest killing these partners defending their zone and pvp i think it's only fiesta slayer or is it let's screw it we're playing some a fiesta except little sags here the challenge is stop an enemy killing spring fiesta you think i let people to get killing sprees against me you fool fiesta fiesta i love it okay so i just need to spawn with a pulse carbine probably never get a kill with it but i got a challenge for it all right and i need to hurry up and get that so i can i'd be one of the first ones with the samurai armor and assert my dominance br energy sword actually not a bad start can't wait to get rocketed right off the start because i didn't get him oh nice skewer there buddy el pal what are you doing say hello to my little sword oh there's an assist oh i just completed the challenge let's go oh my god i think he was afk whoa is that was that a box that wasn't a bot oh my god i felt like i'm not and i mean that in the best way possible calling someone a bot is ever a good thing let's be honest yeah i don't think these guys are going to be getting a killing spree just going out in the limb
