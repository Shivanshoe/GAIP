welcome back to another paladins video did anybody ask for this who really knows but i'm supplying it because i like the game and apparently in my absence i missed a new hero release so obviously jagaroth was the most recent but previously vora released a new flanker and i like to flank that innuendo well that's up to you she has this big old scythe and you know too long didn't read she hits people with the scythe hitting people the size gives her stacks use those stacks and other abilities and it makes them more powerful and she heals when she consumes them otherwise she's jumping slashing grappling you're hurting whacking yeah so there you go that's how to play vora i often get asked how do i make things so digestible and you know it's it's a skill really i've cultivated it worked on it over a very long amount of time not as many people can get across the amount of information i can in the same span of time i don't know what's up with me and word vomiting on the paladin's loading screen but let's the love of god get into the the match okay obliteration sounds as enemies came second charge dark side for not deals in additional timber send it well that seems pretty good okay so see we throw a little sight and it goes in like so like fast slow slow medium or something and the damage is different depending on what part of the combo so those do the most and then we've got our little ability that just like hurts people we jump and slam i'm widowmaker i don't know why we don't i mean spider-man kind of started that right so i guess i'm spooderman and that's pretty much it i don't have much health though because i'm a flanker and i'm 100 gonna forget that and i've never played this map before i don't think this is wait no no i played this man have i yes yes i have i don't think i've ever won on it though does that say something i don't know just not my map you know oh look at this look at this they don't know hit him with everything hit him with everything oh my god they almost still killed me what was i doing okay oh oh they see me ah fudge i have been discovered oh we okay but see downtown funky stuff malone i'm trying to get max stacks here okay i got max stacks i got max tax this means i heal a whole bunch wait a second i hear him naying all over the place okay hold on hold hold i'm going in that was maybe a little too little too gung-ho i'm actually i'm i'm oh oh i almost pulled that off but unfortunately for me i don't have teammates all right we're back in this we're going to hold him here and we'll we'll recover i can't flank anymore so we're just going balls to the wall shoot whatever's right in front of me you know what i'm saying and it seems to be working so far i am behind the enemy screw you ruckus boos gaboos look at this okay wow damage do kind of be fatty though okay there we go me there we go ready spooder man i need to make better use of that that's for sure where's this guy yeah yeah that's what i thought oh and i got my old oh this is gonna be fun oh i hear him stomping around here i don't think they're ready for this here comes the flanker and all his glory you ready for this yo oh okay wait i don't think they're ready hold up oh my god look at me going douche i'm gonna die okay i'm i'm i'm doing a good job at flanking uh but then i only get one kill and die so i would maybe it's not really that good of a flank believe this dot damage i'm doing oh holy jesus what are they doing to me i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to all i don't have a choice or do i or do i i don't think i have to because watch this i thought that was going to be a lot cooler what is going on here yo screw you yay that was my ultimate if you were curious run away run away oh my god i actually got away okay so i guess that's what i should be doing and now somebody's holding oh okay good get the high ground we're flanking we're flanking them on the high ground oh we're flanking we're flanking here we go screw you ruckus is trying to be a hero not on my watch go booze can i oh i forgot i can pull people to me too with my tendril so that's something to keep in mind okay wow okay it's getting it's getting fun in here wow yeah that was a party okay all right defense success i i feel like i'm fine i know what's going on now i got this i got this should i just get more movement speed i think so duration of crowd yeah that's pretty good i am an ssong subtlety is not my strong suit but we're adapting i'm going to learn how to be better about that and i'm going to continue these sick flanks and i need to get better about exiting i think i need to save my tendril to get out you know what i'm saying my sling web thing there's also like this griffin i'm on ha ha that's not a griffin sorry i just don't have a good grip inside i guess oh my god that's a dragon that's a full-on dragon oh this person oh they're right here while they're in their dragon who killed them they didn't even know bob hit you with that that's max stack so that's a lot of damage that's some fat damage yep you did you did what i didn't think you were with me how did you get up there uh over two wait what they're gonna get it again guys yeah i mean they 100 guys kind of a little late for that come on get him guys yeah all right we almost have victory god everything just hurts so much here i come okay all right i just gotta wait oh okay i think it's time to wait where did he go i don't know what he does which is probably part of the problem oh but i destroyed that person i can tell you that much then i'm gonna come over here and i'm just gonna whack you come here why can't i whack you wait that was my old what the fudge okay that clearly something went very wrong there it's not at all how that's supposed to happen i'm too fast for you see look he doesn't know where i am let's go that's how you use the tendril and now i'm wait i'm getting shot somebody's chasing somebody's chasing me oh what up you want to go go booze i don't think you do i don't think you oh yeah you don't want to you don't he he wants this though quite frankly he's tanky he might be able to get it but not today yes yesterday fudge get tendril out of here run thinking maybe like some healing or something like that too basic all right this match is going to go to the distance let me tell you that let me tell you that uh huh i am behind you you're dead here we go ah fudge me they've got the stupid tanks oh my god i'm flying i did not mean to do that i did not mean to do that come here alter ultra ultra alter what are you what is the hunt your enemies increase movement speed select your nearby target damage right that's what i'm doing when i'm in there i'm supposed to like tee up and hit him like a golf ball wait what i just spoke what just happened to me okay i don't know what's going on here but quite frankly i don't like it this guy is so nimble wait what oh there you are ah god everything hurts oh god oh god i gotta go i don't have a choice i don't have a choice okay we got one kill though okay i'm gonna go for an old can i actually hit somebody this time i got him okay he's almost dead somebody please oh we were successful all right somebody's got to take care of that boner dude what what even is that thing we got this team big or go home i love the attitude there buddy i'm going to do the same flank maneuver i've done every time and we're going to see if they see it coming i'd be surprised if they they didn't let me tenfold up here bop hit him with that that's nice damage over time you're 100 dead there we go i've got max stacks which means i'm going in boos right onto you hit you with that that's gonna heal me you're dead now i'm gonna change you out of here uh-huh uh-huh suddenly i'm i'm a force to be wrecked where is my teeth what do i gotta do man what do i have to do flanky doesn't work when the whole team is looking at me which is exactly what's happening ah fudge me oh we got this boner over here he's so close to dead imagine having teammates all right we lost the objective again even if defense is successful i feel like this is just it's going to be the same thing over and over and over do i just go in i really want to i'ma pull you to me oh okay i'll just pull myself to you you're welcome oh what am i doing right now oh this is all gonna hurt isn't it oh yeah yeah yeah okay i have my old but again what's the point because we're never gonna get the initial thing so screw it i'm ulting and i'm grabbing you did a lot of damage to him it's like it's like what are we doing you know let's just let him win quite frankly because then we don't have to defend again i'll try and get one more kill i guess no okay yep that's let me let me look at this look at my damage look at the rest of my team what's going on what's going on team sorry i'm being toxic let's we go again we go again this is gonna be here i think i mainly just struggle with bora because the damage isn't front loaded i guess and you have to like really manage your stacks to like heal yourself and well quite frankly i clearly don't do any of that stuff where's the boar i am uh what am i galactic vora or something cool like oh i got them fishing that you know what i'm saying oh look at my scythe that's dope looking oh look at this listen to the sound effects all right unfortunately we have no front line and three fifths our team are flankers so team comp's not looking great but that's okay i think i think there's still something we can work with here oh oh hold hold okay you were supposed it was supposed to be a surprise but i guess that's out of the door caboose i'm destroying this person okay never mind their whole team showed up late to the party and all went right side that was my fault as a flanker you know i didn't take proper time to assess the situation assess what exactly i was flanking so that's my bad bop you're okay you're dead easy peasy i think there's there are people on the objective bob hit you oh you are you're so dead you're so dead actually you are dead and somebody where did they run off to i guess somebody killed them or something nicely done all right now it's time for me to flank fudge never mind they know they know yeah i'm gonna pull them to me ready yeah loose go booze we already got the objective oh and i'm gonna get this kill okay things are already going exponentially better than usual and i'm behind you bob oh you're so dead [Music] come here buddy booze double kill let's go let's go i feel alive i'm hiding they don't know i'm here i really hope they don't know oh they they actually don't know they actually don't know oh fudge me oh he doesn't know okay and then i'm gonna hold you ready wait what okay i that is really confusing i was in my old mat like sometimes i i i t up and i give him the yay and then other times i just kind of i don't know if cause like to target i may be too close i really don't know but i'll do better i promise and let me just uh tendril up here let me just stop him from getting on the point boom okay oh okay this is going much better increased movement speed seems nice decreased healing man you know what let's just take less damage all right everybody mount on up here we go let's go let's go let's go okay so they're gonna expect me to flank that side like i did last time but no i'm flanking this side which i don't think i've ever flanked and i guess they were expecting that so that's embarrassing now i'm not flanking anything oh jesus okay okay what up maybe can you defeat me though no you cannot and then there's this fella bop hit you with that max damage heal me up thank you very much and then i'm going to yeah ye this person yes there we go the yay worked that time i think it is i think i'm just too close as well as it sounds now i'm hiding i'm hiding don't bring him over here i'm hiding like that damage okay oh jesus oh god tendril out of here tried to throw a big old bomb on me i'm hiding behind the street they don't know they don't know oh my god i'm a chicken oh you saved me just in time i could never repay you okay here we go i'm fully stacked pop pop uh-oh tell me to go tonight but it's not bedtime it ain't bad time where are you hey come back thank you okay i'm almost dead i need help too oh somebody oh i'm not healing yep yep a little dps or dot damage over time whatever i know the difference let me snipe this person oh my god you didn't even have a chance let's go yeah we're camping you no shame in our game now that was a statement we practically had most damage let's be honest should have uh best kda though objective time is abysmal but you guys know me i'm um you know i'm not i'm not a objective kind of player now ladies and gentlemen is vora honestly one of the most fun champions i've had with feels like you know the the buried entry on the champions pretty pretty low it's per usual but i feel like there's a higher skill ceiling there's a lot more you can do with vora but yeah i'm actually a big fan so i might be playing a whole bunch of her in my own time and feel free to let me know if you guys would want to see just some more gameplay it doesn't have to be only exclusively new champions i mean a lot of that rides on the fact of are you guys going to watch it all so anyway that's it i want to thank everyone for watching happy results a fantastic day i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
