hi ad hope you own my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to smite champ realm of the champions God said the juice whatever battleground to the gods that sounds right it's your favorite new player trying to not be bad at the game who picked it up because avatar skins are coming and they looked sick so we've done videos on hive dollar we just did one on sup who Susanoo who is gonna be the Zuko skin in today's video we're gonna be looking at Scotty another one of the Avatar trios this one will be Korra is if you couldn't tell well there's Korra and there's her bear in this case it's Scotty and her wolf cab quatre covers something and actually we were supposed to do Merlin but added it all that out because as you're gonna see here IQ upper mid but we don't get mid so I make a last-minute change and we play Scotty so enjoy the video okay funny story guess I'm just gonna have to redo the intro we're gonna play Scotty which is gonna be getting the chorus kin because the game auto-filled me into a random Lane and the guy that got made didn't even want mid but he wanted jungle and so the jungle in mid nobody wanted solo and I'm solo Lane not Carrie but still I wanted to play one of the the avatar so I'm Scotty solo okay I know she's a carry bear with me I'm and bringing by some things here and I'm bringing I guess I don't don't come now you might be curious what Scotty does and I am too let me read real quick okay so this will be interesting especially because I'm not supposed to be a solo later I must definitely carry I focus on auto attacks which granted I guess I did the exact same thing with hime dollar I went solo but I don't actually know kind of seems I could carry okay seems like he helped or did he grab a jungle buff you know I'm not entirely sure I don't even know who that is alright I'm just gonna hit you with that uh-huh do some extra damage oh and just like that junglers here do not fear oh good job I got that last minute snipe I did miss a little bit but let's just pretend we didn't notice that yeah I missed that one okay wait hold I think you miss that too but you summon the bear so I could summon him right there and he'll attack enemies in the area and he has four health bars you'll see right there and when he dies he comes back to me on a cool-down and then when he's ready to go again i can re-summon him and he's like ha just kidding dude I'm all good you're like okay good I was worried so I'm gonna summon an ice portal right there or a nice spot I circle out what is it technically called permafrost ah yes I am going to lay the ground literate with permafrost now if I do this ability and hit him though my autos will actually do more to him and then I'm gonna summon the bear on him and it's not gonna get anything so I'm actually call him back no point in him just dying for no good cause I prefer his death to be Noble and worthy he's skirt he skirt right now and so at the very least that intimidation is worth an immeasurable amount of gold so I'm gonna hit him with that Scotty's gonna go on him I'm gonna slow him he's one shot let's go Scotty wait no I'm Scotty let's fudge what is your name Calder you're Calder yeah have I been saying the wrong name this whole time I don't know it's all very confusing I'm Scotty that's Calder don't worry about it I'm gonna try and be a little greedy here get these last few kills and now I'm out of here we gotta roll we got two freakin kills to our name already we're killing it this might hurt us late-game though because we're gonna be kind of squishy and that is completely my fault so I'm looking at a build here I still don't know what to build myself it says this and I can already buy it so that seems pretty good warrior tabi I guess is the next thing I want so let's get that and then I'll buy another health potion I don't know where he is and I don't know how to say missing so my teammate will just have to briea themselves that's sorry guys I should have also figured out what the fudge my um my item does I don't know what its passive does that's fine for the time being I'm just gonna whack this turret he spawning something okay I think they're coming to me I guess he's tired of feeding me so he's just left to go do whatever it is he wants to do I guess oh there he is well I'm just gonna try and take this tower although he's trying to clear the minions while I can't take the tower but Oh ho-ho my friend your tower has almost fell here comes the fun part I'm gonna slow him spawn him on you and then I'm just gonna Auto a little bit call him back do some auto damage oh my god wait what the fudge a huge - I don't know I'm gonna all go Scotty come on Scotty let's go oh why do I keep calling my bear or wolf Scotty I am Scotty what am I gonna realize that go call dirt whatever you guys understand I'm saying or maybe I'm just typing myself up like yeah this character sick maybe I'm a core I mean maybe that's just what I'll have to happen I don't know I really do like suzana though and I do like Merlyn although of the three I think I'm the worst at Maryland so far okay there oh may go fighting in the right lane which is you guys are doing I should go help I'm sure tonight okay I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming they're actually destroying them yeah I don't even think I can help okay yeah great job guys then I'll just keep the pressure up you know so I'm just gonna keep this up we have a lot of money I'll be able to get some warrior tabi whatever but for the time being keep the pressure up keep it pushed in most of them are mid lane they're not able to do something about them yet but action that I'm looking at it they can get to me pretty easily I have a feeling I'm gonna get ganked and just because I'm sitting on a lot of gold I'm not feeling too confident okay so let's get that movement speed is always nice and then I guess yo Tain's RAF enemy missing right okay enemy missing lat left note whit enemy missing whoops wrong one yeah it's the thought that counts okay I'm gonna get the totem of kungfu or whatever that's called for my team now I kinda just want to go all-in on this dude and I think that he knows that I could mess him up and the way he's playing it definitely seems like it look at this wave clear right now hold up wait a minute you know the carries are supposed to usually have you know someone's supporting them a guardian or whatever its called not get off me I'm gonna I'm behind whoever this is and mess them up maybe okay okay yes yes I am because they're going in for a gank but guess what I'm here alt boom boom the fudge get away from the ground why the this guy can just fly forever like what was that all about dang it I should have killed him so whatever though I'll give this turret yeah that's not a terrible consolation prize they're trying to kill it I'll let them do that there we go oh oh oh well then don't mind if I do that's a kill bada bing about a Booma now I'm moving on to the next jury this is going exceptionally we're foreign oh this is incredible we're already taken the tier to mid I've already got my Lane down there fighting in the jungle or someone's getting chased oh my god I didn't realize that we didn't have any more minions oh my god they're trying to chase me he missed his old llama but I think I'm gonna die Scotty save me Kaldur whatever okay did he die I think he died well okay okay but now I'm getting a little greedy here I think it's time I uh skits cats good dude a lot out of here oh they're coming for me oh fudge okay well we can buy that ooh that's nice yeah I think I just keep the issue pressed on the left lane I'm gonna take this buff real quick spawn Calder there help me out buddy you did great come back to me oh wait yep I should pick up the buff I'm so used to League it's just like whoever gets final hit takes the buff and that's obviously not how it works here you have to pick up the buff herp derp level 11 we're feeling pretty good and with all of our new good items we might be able to take this tower although everyone's missing mid lane yeah there's mid lane actually he's right there so I'm just gonna try and get one last hit in okay let me make sure he's not chasing me I'm just gonna I'm just gonna tango with this guy for now though he wants to wants to fight I'm down although I am really pushed up we have no vision which is completely my fault we could have vision I just never remember to use my awards I'll make sure you go do that right now make sure I do it right I had teleport last time and I thought I had Ward's everyone made fun of me rightfully so this guy is gonna be slowed okay oh my but he excuse me what the fudge just I was I was like full health I'm a common right lane move house what the fudge I'm about to raise the roof I tell you what all right all right hey let me let me get in on some of this and it's not even like a close fight that seems like oh yeah we're just destroying it all right well never mind I like damage let's get a damage camp come back to me called her great we got this buff all right they're still kind of fighting kind of it's kind of a skirmish of sorts which means I'm just gonna take this time push mid out we do almost have this turret between the deceased and the ones fighting I think I should be able to take this tower yep by the way the comment down below if you know it seems like there's like no abilities like Auto Attack is the only way to kill a tower right like there are no abilities that I'll hold up what does this fellow doing oh my god wait how does he just like I know he just does something and then he like turns into a ball or something I know I'm doing so much damage though come back to me called her yeah I don't know what he does she gains a lot of health and stuff but I mean still overall we're doing just fine yeah it's fine I ain't too worried about it ups and potions pop the potions I'm sweating oh wait a second oh wait that's not what I wanted to have happen okay hold on I'm backing up oh but wait a sec I'm gonna destroy this dragon looking thing but he just flies away what it's just their entire team just like transforming the balls and fly and gargoyle looking thing I don't know I guess I assisted but what the I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming okay I'm not letting you get away this time actually probably I miss like all my abilities oh but Calder's lighten this dude up help me called her colder yes oh no the minions oh oh the auto - oh my god okay back to say we are weak I think we're at ten health at one point what I mean to say is not even close baby not even close let me get another damage camp bada bing bada boom come back to me kaulder I'm glad that each one of the the champions are the heroes or the gods that the Avatar skins are going to be or all gods that I enjoy playing I'm coming oh oh I'm coming I'm coming come hold on buddy there you go yeah oh my god and there he goes again it's insane I don't get it I grew old my and then there's the damage from that stupid dragon thing what my feet are tired these boots were made for walking but not that much so I'm just gonna TP he didn't realize that I showed up here so I'm gonna get called her to sick him a what up dude so who did I just kill who's on Risa oh it's cam cam oz oz or something amaz toss don't ask me what the fudge that is like I said some gargoyle you think ctp came in handy he's like oh I'm free to take this where did you come from yeah yeah you had no idea did you no you did not okay oh there's only two of them left and they're all Rylan yeah I'm I'm so low right now this is easy we'll push Phoenix here I already did a little bit to the mid Phoenix let's go they surrendered hey you best watch out now I may just be getting the hang of this I mean six one and two not too bad I made my lane opponent literally just give up they forfeit it so you didn't get to see me destroy them even more but that is a that's a hardy dub that's a pretty decent showing for myself especially since that was my second game as scauldy skirts I don't remember what the fudge I'm called and on top of that I was prepared to play Merle in in the mid lane that's what I was going to do but then autofill evidently had something else to say about that so I'll take that next video we will Merlin will show off all the avatar characters and then we'll double back once the avatar skins come out gonna be freakin sick hope you all enjoyed that hope you guys are enjoying this might hopefully you're seeing me improved slightly somewhat I think I am and with that thank you much for watching everybody I'll talk to you in the next one very well
