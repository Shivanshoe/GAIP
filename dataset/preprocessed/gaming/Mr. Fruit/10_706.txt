hi everyone my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny too and don't mind me and my clean outfit because I've got some good news for you auto rifles are back on the menu and in a big way gather round my DEA's here's some content for you you could have some there you go the cirrhosis regime or the swag regime as I affectionately called it back in Destiny one is finally Matta cirrhosis legacy the bottom half of each magazine deals bonus damage has a chance to return health on kill that sounds cool but that's not even the best part spinning up hold down the trigger to increase the rate of fire because as you'll notice this is a 600 rpm auto rifle those got the biggest buff add in the fact that you can then make it shoot faster and there's a reason why you're seeing this everywhere in the crucible it brings a tear to my eye so we're headed into the land of clash to slay our foes also for the first time in what feels like forever I have master worked gear in anticipation of trials I figure I should at least have some more stats and stuff Oh welcome back to the cauldron it's been a little while hey you look like me we're like light and evil twins light and dark I don't know I say light and evil good and evil light dark that's normally what Heather talked about oh my god the range is just non-existent yeah that was actually weird I don't really know what um what's going on there also you see this how fast the 80s and the target acquisition that's his seasonal artifact mod you've got to love it and also I am 11 the Souris right now wait what is it lightning frickin grenades everywhere we're doing some solid damage to the face but if we use it like the sweet business leave that thing we just start firing this thing up God can you let me just live my life please I am quite simply just trying to spin this thing up I hear another Souris oh that that's a sniper oh okay well that hurt night as I was trying to say oh my did you see that look at look at this if I'm able to actually like find fun do I have friends if I'm able to if I'm able to get on target woohoo they melt and it is a beautiful thing except ah a fellow suros hellooo we're getting teamed up here and the the days of me just popping off are just long gone I barely play PvP but when I do every game on brokens and just that the absolute sweatiest of the sweatiest so more power to them I do have the acting war rig on with which I'm gonna get sniped yeah I don't I don't know what I'm doing I mean look it does good damage it fires fast but the range isn't the best so you have to account for that and if you can well then you're good to go and if I could have just killed your friend I would have restored my health really the suros does about the same damage as the tommy gun Tommy's matchbook because of the way it fires up so where dps is the same but instead of hurting yourself you can actually heal yourself so yeah it's better than Tommy's mass booking that about every whit feasible and holy team shot Batman yeah I just I just don't get it the skill base mastering I understand it I've been playing so many games with at this point I'm not here to complain about it but it just seems so aggressive it like immediately just throws me into the OL or ring or you know I'm saying I'm gonna pre fire and hope does their team ever separate can I you like I'm not even that connected in the Destiny community or no all that of the cop scene but like every game I play I recognize somebody like why am i playing with you why why why are you here I am quite liking the suros though and again the fact that everything I'm dying to is the serous is in a weird weird way refreshing you were seeing me actually shooting the tower barricade there and you might be like what the heck why would you be doing that because they super a mega nerfed it it's really easy to break through now oh see oh Jesus hello there mister arts death that is one problem I'm worried about in trials my intellect stat is pretty garbage I have everything like resilience and friggin just leave me alone sir that's resilience resilience and that's really not my choice it's just like friggin every Titan thing ever is just wait way too much resilience even when it seems like it does absolutely nothing in PvP but anyway yeah I'm worried every was just gonna be getting there super so fast go ahead brother I don't got now that oh my god that Nova bomb just got destroyed oh I'm spun-out baby I'm all spun up and he's running okay ah and I'm hurt by superhero super here probably a bad idea but maybe I just go in like a missile right there oh I want to it I wanna my god I've got a dude go dude wait really just one there's another guy in here that didn't even die where in the world could he have possibly been located that my Thunder crash did it literally and no damage to him that is in gravely so many snipers - I don't feel safe anywhere I go so instead I'm just gonna slam it slam women I'll see you like this new ornament though very clean very clean it reminds me of that Magikarp gun that was everywhere look Oh what you were supposed to Thunder quick God 13 shot is impeccable is this what it feels like to have teammates god I can't yeah I shouldn't be challenging the snipers but if I don't it's the only people I can shoot what else am I supposed to do all get melted but I don't go up killed by a bow and arrow absolute respect my friend okay he just got domed maybe I don't do that instead I'm gonna do the old loop around they're not gonna see this coming good are you got that melees trash give me some armor or something why do it or like why do I have to hold this like the cool Superman post so long in the air just just slam down you know I'm saying like come on bro life's on the line here pretend like you care a little bit oh my god the reload speed though is so much faster than I thought and a little Crouch shatter that could but it was a fellow serous so it is what it is oh you trying to a puss this ain't the lobby for that my brother bringing everybody and they'll mom out here keeping their distance trust me I've I've tried to get in several times and Elden rezar ibly every single time yep believe that oh I want to go see that cut oh nice nice nice nice nice nice oh that's not nice tough al but if you can't hold now you can't hold a double you know so by the time this video is coming out trials comes out today so hopefully I'm ready I am currently sitting at 970 light hoping light level doesn't completely bone me wait what yeah I'm not gay and then immediately lost I was debating my choice and shader because it makes me stick out like the Saurus thumb possible but then I also thought that's probably not the thing keeping me alive nessus that wasn't a headshot sauce sauce sauce check this out oh okay well I tried if we push together friends anything is possible because friendship conquers all what I'm saying is get in there yeah oh that's a solid Nate he's stuck how is he not dead how's he well he's dead that's what what just punch him babe is that how you got movie the weak huh huh although a shotgun montage probably you sicken me is there anyone else spawning around here I have no idea but I got to kill we're spinning up we are I'm all spun up I'm spun I'm spun I'm so spun I am so spun I got that kill but not the health regen god I have this like nervous tic I wouldn't even really call nervous take just like this I got a got to keep adjusting my microphone even if it's like perfectly fine and I can't stop touching it it's like right now it's like wash your hand don't touch your face and it's just like oh my god apparently it turns out I touch my face all the time they took the lead not if I have anything to say about it haha I do have something to say about it okay now check this out I'm finally gonna get a male 3 oh wow I actually got the kill I mean he was like so close to being dead that it really didn't matter in the grand scheme of things but I will absolutely take some of that credit I know he's gonna you know it turned in this corner wit where it Oh were you hiding back there the whole time oh the suros just started melting though you were like cheese on a shut Ikuo billboard or that I don't really know how to say that but a fine assortment and yeah mine benders am my ATIS hmm ORN threats that I don't have acting up again sorry this is what it means to be a hero what I was about that I'm actually I'm just the worst I'm just the worst thanks for watching the worst player ever really warms my heart and for that I guess I'll start playing the obj for you guys you scratch my back I scratch yours which is the itch of actually playing the objective because I never ever ever forever never do thank you for trying to fight me because it did not go well in your favor and I Robot even with better friggin recovery just takes forever for my health to come back man alright well skadoosh we on that is laughable oh my god yes good I'm going back to me on the nose I don't know mean Thunder crashes fun and stuff and PVE I'm having fun but god I just I can't use in PvP man I need my Roman supers and I'll need them we barely got that kill let's go he's gonna try and rush me no no no no no no no no no no none now my god here here yeah he killed a soul come on everybody is to hamster dance clap yo feet instead of the bend I don't know what I'm talking about you're not gonna die martz copy so very hard and it didn't pay off and there's a guy to the other side the other side the other side of me the unfortunate part is you're probably like well you're not absolutely destroying is this really mad at ya know it is again just skill based matchmaking is about part of the course so everytime I get a kill at the primary it's a miracle because all I died to are special weapons still have I died to a primary at this game I honestly I don't really know maybe one hand cannon can't remember though just like that part of it hasn't changed a bean still just works I'm just tired of things one shotting that Mjolnir you're supposed to hit him okay okay we can do this okay that's a kill oh you want it you want to go boy boy oh I'm gonna be near him so hard to never mind his team just spawned here what am i doing what am i doing i through me all nerd yeah it should just be pretty self-evident that if I'm getting kills of the primary that is not a hand cannon and the kill isn't a secondary weapon or special ammo weapon then or like a heavy than you know okay oh shoot there's some to it and that is exactly right my friends there is something indeed to it oh I was almost with collateral if only sorry when I get a crispy snipe I just turned into a turkey gobble gobble we can make this comeback team okay Who am I kiddin I don't really believe that I would like to don't get me wrong that's a nice incendiary Oh he's burning he's burnt they're all burning they're all burning I got a kill this is incredible I got another kill spin him up mr. fruit spin it up let's like spin the wheel oh look at that we still got that kill don't we do that's amazing it is pretty funny there is a literally just cirrhosis everywhere it's kind of incredible oh wait I have another super though can I turn the tides no absolutely not go dome but I'll try I was gonna say is that not gonna it hammer like wash wash wash go dome good oh oh we got him we lost them turns out in order to catch them double use you just have to catch only else but the Souris regime definitely got a W with this update I'm not sure if this entirely sold the Souris but hopefully it should have because it is fantastic I love auto rifles and you should give it a go thank you very much for watching heavies listen man - actually I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
