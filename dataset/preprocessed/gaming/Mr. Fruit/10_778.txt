hidey-ho ruin my name's mr. fruit with me Robbie being Belleza because we're not dead the podcast is back episode 2 1 1 or 2 1 e 1 it's 20 odd 112 I think yeah I think it is 21 happy 1 12 we'll get to that on this podcast we talk about Pokemon Pokemon we thought we talked about some before that TV shows we still talk about some before that we talk a whole bunch of random stuff stuff on the peel boxes heal box we go here on my shirt very cool right harder than it stunk but that was at the very Aryan actually technically right now you guys could smell it please don't you know it smells like you smells like when somebody takes a big dump and then just goes with a little bit of a breeze so you get like 4 breeze and poop that's what it smells like you're welcome and with that this is the the podcast enjoying you to audio listeners we're caught back up surprise actually I believe we're titling this one contrary to popular belief we're still alive yeah not only us but the podcast and actually before we get into anything let's address the most important thing in this podcast oh my sweater like that I don't understand like why they use that picture I was telling a Christian because they hope is his door he's wearing that okay I know I literally took that picture because my grandma like is has start early dementia and I was like I don't know if she's gonna make it so I'm gonna take this picture with via so that was literally the picture that we had I know it's been a little while yeah I know it has been a minute for the other sweater it actually is nice and it's not late on oh it's not iron on there it's oh no part of the sweater for the auto listeners in blue because I didn't tell blue about this either I have this ironically texture really comfortable is actually Christmas sweater and in the middle is Rob's printed faith in front of your big pecs yeah and I got this in my peel box the guy like a couple Christmas presents I guess this was mine yeah and I couldn't resist yeah we also got other stuff from the PIO box we got a shout out to the guy who knows about cookies and stuff the good thing he didn't spill that I know I should really bring the letter so we know the names Oh so unfortunately the guy that sent this just has to know that we know they know we know yeah we just don't we don't remember the name right now but I have the letter okay Thank You Craig that was a guess maybe it was not crazy it's probably not and after listening to the podcast about Rob dipping his cookies and Oreos he sent us the dippers the order Thank You Craig now I no longer had to get my fingers know what now Rob can understand what it's like to eat smarter not harder Wow yeah that's great came up with on the spot thank you for that I also had I don't know if they listen to the podcast but they definitely watched my videos and streams and they saw that I played titanfall 2 and so they sent me well I think you're the only guy who still plays titanfall 2 actually have you not heard about it I mean I heard that like it was free on PlayStation Plus the same video popped it had more players like concurrent players that month than it did ever that's so weird I guess like the PlayStation 3 game really works that was like at one point like 90,000 people and at once geez is a dizzier clan like still like active and that because I know you still out of clay and we got we're like fifth biggest behind like if yeah so is it they so this person was head on this project and they worked with respawn right uh-huh and they did these diecast models and so there's six random guns okay and so she sent me like 24 oh because I have a whole other box trying to collect them all so I'm sure I have them all now if I open him but you can go ahead and open it okay on this little hard more than likely gonna get a Mozambique yeah let's see it well I don't think of Mozambique cos oh it's I in here and then we have um the r101 the g2 triple take I think that's I don't know that one but I don't the r9 9 and a weapon no no no so what one of them is the stand oh you can put it but they're actually really high quality and for our audio listeners just enjoy the a some more I guess this is like p.o box opening I didn't know we were gonna do down is this sweet big P o box right here hopefully yeah okay good I'll talk to that any guy I know I know means good guy pretty good look oh I got a g2 scout actually yes good one Rob yes that is it you know that from apex I do I do know that for me you say is how do you know that oh and I got the melee weapon oh that is not an apex no well actually it's not even in I think this is the this is a rare drop by the way the weapon that Ronin uses the Titan what do you how do you like putting a sword yeah I got the sword dude how do you put it in the stand I can so well you're putting the stand wrong you have to put up like like this I like that okay and now in the letter she did say and there are stands and like in parentheses that kind of work yeah I was gonna say this doesn't work at all so try and be really nice oh they tried but then like she kind of knows about it so yeah this doesn't work but not only that these are no longer in production oh so these are all this is mine now yeah you can have it Merry Christmas thank you well actually on behalf of whoever sent this which I also did not remember next listen I'm horrible with names faces I remembered it started with an ax Oh Agatha nope okay we tried wasn't anything but thank you I got some other stuff I got the Quran yeah and translated I'm saying with nothing it was literally just addressed my peal box and it was the Quran no no no letter no nothing just so I misplaced it I've seen the light now I got some other stuff I olive and Appa even got a card themselves no way yeah they didn't care about me was it written in dog no okay but it wasn't I think it was from the Netherlands and yeah somebody else like his dogs addressed our dogs and they will picture their dogs with a little pen pals yeah there's a I think a pug and a chocolate lab I was talking you know what man I was talking about somebody who has like a pug not a fan of pugs man they just like they're all up in your [ __ ] they breathe really heavily and their eyes look like they're about to explode I think freaks me out I think the draw pugs is that you're taking care of this sweep sad thing that at any moment could died but that's the draw of it like oh it sounds like you you struggling to breathe like boogers and so yeah between that and Bulldogs I know like Bulldogs their problem with likes just straight up just yeah so live I love them though if I can like it a bulldog I would which is like weird because I wouldn't get a pug when I'd get a bulldog Beckett the the gym I used to work at when I was in college it was like this small underground like musclehead gym and was run by a previous guy it was at that apartment that I used to write and it was run by a guy who like competed in mr. Olympia and so his dog it was a girl bulldog just was there all the time super sweet but yeah just you're like hey yeah it was super nice and everything but yeah thank you yeah but at the same time nothing don't worry that's the intro I'm glad we're back though he has a long hiatus it's the first episode of 20/20 little did you guys know we were not going to come back for this decade podcast since last decade and I don't understand why we tell people about the audio because I still had questions like every other day about hey do you know where the audio is hey do you want audios but you know what that means people care I know and that's great but like we told you where it is alright and thing is audio should now be caught up these episodes are up and ideally this episode but the aisle should be going live hopefully but the same if not the next day sorry and it's not that we hate you audio listeners we mentioned it the whole thing with a studio and the holidays is messy yeah but we're back and we're not dead the show's not cancelled yet not yet the guy with the cane hasn't come in yet we are guitars anymore we are about like 6.5 good yeah we've definitely been bum can you tell us what we actually are I think you have a review so I think you actually have it in front of you well on the plus side we are still 5 star rated podcast ok you might be an mike 6.1 stars at this point we are slowly losing become the first eight star podcast we get a but I do have a really kind review here from Chavez well here we go Chavez dropped a five star review thinks we chose is glad you still believe in us when we don't only five whether it's being allergic to the Sun or figuring out if door and floor I'm in a different language podcast always finds a way to make me laugh with misery fruit and the boys dive into a good time with a lot of laughs and good moments that being said it's time to upgrade to a nine star podcast well Chavez we're working on that and unfortunately it's not happening it almost sounds like I still sneeze every time I leave the gym I will say that it almost sounds like he's leaving us for his clothes a nine star rated podcast is there one out there there can't be right I mean I hope other than ours no probably no this is for tribes' well not not the previous weeks where we failed you but moving forward yes is indeed a decade yeah a new us new podcasting exactly except it's not it's the exact same all right I'm gonna have to choke does like oh my god you give me the Heimlich you should uh should plug it a little bit yeah it's out here we're really making moves we are we are drinking it right now it's good I like it a lot advance Gigi weep while we talked about on the podcast a while ago when we were trying the flavour but my flavor is officially out now didn't get it it's not tight on totally and I was really afraid that I was gonna drop it oh yeah very freaked out and then I almost dropped it on the carpet but I did not yeah wasn't bad yeah you would notice that you would be upset would not recommend that yeah cuz then you go to clean it up with and then the powder and yeah I guess you'd have to get it back yeah it's like you're gonna put water on it and then suddenly just it's a murder scene all putting water rag on that idea awful that's how you do it just bleach anyway yeah you guys can pick this up I guess I'll try and include a link at least in the YouTube it if you want use code salt or use code fruit or other ones but those work you could use Bob's code and it benefits us both yeah but anyway we're shipping on that so I thought we'd talk about that but aside from that we don't have a clear-cut topic here because what a better way to start the decade than with absolutely no agenda yeah I thought that was the best way to do it I was like I said that was like what are we talking about uh-huh every time we go I don't know and I say you know what we'll figure it out boys and you know what we do we're not figured we don't we don't say right now we're kind of hurtin we look like a gdq oh and they're like we got 30 minutes to kill what are we doing that was bad and then that's pretty rough but that'll killed the couch he did such a good job watch this a GDQ Destiny to run first of all it was sick was the sickest run of all time sub what 30 dude that was a quick time I can't believe they had a 5 man a couple times - that's so hard to do is five Manning well blue why don't you explain - at the end of the agdq run something crazy happened and if anyone here knows the specifics and the statistics it would be our resident destiny expert I know a guy let's let's ask blue les little blue hey hi welcome how are you hello everyone so yeah so here's some commentary on what was an incredible event of the latest WWE pay-per-view it was I mean that's any pay-per-view and buy a destiny pay-per-view I mean it was free let me go watch whatever you want yeah so in the at the end of the destiny all encounters run I don't know if it was the same dude who got the gun twice or two different people because the same dude what it was the same dude so the same dude got to 1,000 voices he saved his keys for those you don't know you can save no way the keys in last mission you don't have to use them at the end he had saved keys he got to 1,000 voices for reference it is a 4% chance per chest to get the 1,000 voices so getting 2 in a row that doesn't hit up an often what is that like a 4 ^ no boy hey let's ask our resident math expert Roberto hey welcome Roberto the chances of to 4% chance drops happening twice right I'm gonna go like how I actually think you do it okay so that's four out of 100 you can you can bring that down to two out of 50 which means you can bring that out of one to twenty five chance so one to twenty five goes into a hundred 25 goes into 100 four times you're right back to your like this is why four is out of a hundred because you can have twenty five forty right so as I was saying four so four out of a hundred you can bring that down to one out of twenty five and back to four now 25 goes into 100 four times right so you do four to the power of 4 and then to the power of two so you do like four four and then like put then you put a 2 so I could cube or you double it why so so for four times four is 16 16 times 4 is 30 for 18 is 64 64 times four is 124 128 192 236 so 236 times 4 is like around I would say probably like one in a hundred chance is that's how I got to it like one in like 8 48 50 whatever 2-4 times 262 is how it was what I would say there's like 1 in 800 something chance here's the way I would do it yeah or over 100 yeah but you can make that 1 out of 25 or even just point 0 4 times point zero 4 that's it now but if you wanted to like visualize it you four over one I'm trying to like see it like one out of this many chances like that's what I'm trying to like get to you can't do like one out of point zero zero one six chap like you have to like a big number yet that like a real number there what cuz one doesn't go into whatever point four times point four is it's too big what it's small what do you mean it's small but so point zero four is we're just saying or percent yes I could have a hundred yeah yeah anytime is buy another four percent and that's can tell you how many times out of a hundred because right there point zero four tells you how much it is out of a hundred you have a four percent chance like four so but like how many times do you like out of and I don't really know where you got this for - for two - it's cause like you got you got a cubit so like if if I had fewer three well whatever like rhombus or something I don't know so like but if you just cube numbers together that's the probability of it so like say I'll do this okay 0.04 times 0.04 I'd be point zero zero one six yeah it should be and that song is right there but that's not see like an answer it a decent answer no I'm looking for the one out of this you can't have it you know but yeah but you can't have one point zero zero one six like I want one out of this many chances so is that how many times that goes into 100 so how many times is point zero zero one six go into 100 it would be it's like that's where we would get the 1 out of this many cuz like any one out of how doesn't want that one out of 625 OC house close the big Matt you just you were doing math on your 800 it's off God fell over it - broken again because unfortunately the last thing blue had to listen to is you trying to map think about that I can hear him right now rather stay dead why are you putting me up I can hear him right now don't touch me moral don't like that I just want to I'll just never forget okay so four out of a hundred you can bring that down to Twitter 50 which means you can bring out one down to 25 not 25 goes into a hundred four times yes yes that's what for I hated math I mean I like math like where it's like basic as soon as they start putting like numbers and letters and are not numbers but letters into math that's when I was like alright or just like degrees like or like like this triangle is like 28 degrees it's like why do I need to know that like don't care somebody does about and that triangle certainly didn't it was proud of that 28 degrees I don't think it tried it had to cut a lot to get a 28 degrees a pretty acute pun hey yeah nicely done I suck anyway blue if I'm not mistaken I think they were saying on the couch but in a last wish run there's only a possibility of two thousand voices right you can only get to like I think people can't like you whole fireteam can get one no oh that's what they at least seem to say this doesn't I don't think there's actually a static chance of of what the limit I think it's tied to the key okay so I mean I know specifics I feel like how many of you got one thousand voices it's not that deep it's like if you get it again if you don't you don't pivot here right okay but yeah I think it's tied to the key I don't think there's like a 2 out of 24 chests of every run I have the 1000 ways this type of thing I was I was like mimin in the chat I was like I've only completed this three times this is so hard like this is a tough run yeah all I know is the odds of it were pretty high astronomical and then on top of that he got another one right after so it was still pretty insane how many times if you just asked if I have the thousand voices I probably got beaten I've gone through several encounters but probably beaten Riven like three four times okay that would require robin furth to play destiny apipa hey hey you're right I've done I've done three we'll see like here's the thing I love doing the raid day one oh there's nothing like it but then I kind of well well here's the problem - I love doing it day one but then I get burnt out mm-hm well and then I don't want to do that rate was your grind in the week before did I get raid ready and you're busting your ass and then like when the contest modifiers off it's you literally walk through the race but I'm also not robbed who does a raid crown of sorrow and then Oh terrible whoa that's assuming you getting a thousand versus your first run that was sweet I did get the church for Baja it does Sacramento so nice there's that it's okay I use it all the time just to show it off and just to say I have it because then people like whoa he's a grinder yeah Wow how many miles did that take you one you wouldn't believe my first or my second I guess my second technically yeah no that happened in speed running which actually had to explain to Clare what speed running yeah cuz I was watching it I was like trying to grind some camos and because my life is nothing anymore except for trying to get this stupid Damascus camera what you gonna do when you get it I thought I don't know like literally I don't even know if I enjoy the game anymore it's just I'm I'm just playing to get a cam oh yeah so I think I'm just gonna feel empty inside so maybe I'll hold off on that last game on forever maybe just well no no I wouldn't if I only have one more nah screw I get it but on the other monitor I had agdq up which we should also mention for those that don't know where don't know what we're talking about it's a stream they do like every January yeah they had two events yeah they have awesome games done quick and they've Summer Games done quick and basically they just take any kind of video game that's ever been made then they'd like people who like submit runs and and stuff and then they just have a bunch of people play those games and speedrun yeah they come in and speed runs and the whole thing is to raise money for charity for us charity it is prevent cancer or cancer prevention and I think summaries games and quakes like Doctors Without Borders or something but last I looked there near 2 million but they always raise a ton of my yeah and so I was just watching some speedruns I forget what I was watching I think it was like Super Monkey Ball that's a dope speedrun but couldn't know what it was she says this it sounds really like that hard way and then meanwhile I had the headphone to the Congaree like okay so right here you have a one at a sixty chance on this frame is hard to like to hit this button if you don't miss this bump you completely ruin the run she's like always doing he's just someone you don't get it okay because what she missed was the fallout speed runs I love watching those all those like they'd like complete cuz there's like that's just name you're like yeah we beat following like 12 minutes what and you're like yeah we just stash out you go here you break out of the map you come here quick save here I jump I did that and you're in luck okay and game over so what that's how you did it excuse me um so it's always really fun watching that stuff yeah my favorite one is to watch his ocarina speedrun that one is insane they get like a jar on the B button or something like okay now this I can Able's us to like pretty pretty much get any item we want I just have to put the Deku stick on my left stick and it's like oh my god like what not even like they're not even like playing the game anywhere they literally like just break it you should have seen they were doing the Final Fantasy 6 speedrun and I just hopped in there for a couple seconds a couple minutes rather and the spirit are supposed to take like 24 minutes and they're like 12 minutes in and everyone in the chat is just like oh what that means like we have no idea what's going on and then of course there people may mean like five head like I understand yeah and I'm sitting here like the people on the couch are like absolutist and it all has to do with like you have three save points you bring this character and this party here save warp exit turn the game off turn on other save this that's sake that creates a war point and now this person's and then and then you go into this and then you warp here and like talking at the speed of light yeah and let Final Fantasy 6 mmm no but I was sitting there trying to understand swing I don't I don't I don't know if I'll Oliver I'll ever be able to understand this I would love to learn ascended if I if I like wanted to learn how to speedrun a game it would it would be super hard to do I love like my favorite one that watches Super Mario 64 super mario 64 speedruns are the sickest speedruns ever and maybe just cuz Clint dozen and I'm a big Clint viewer I'm more of a streets kind of guy oh wow dude guess what tomorrow is 112 yeah we're celebrating okay this is the episode oh my god that's very cool that won't happen again for years how has once well affected your guys's life so let me where do I even start blue what was what do you watch speedrunning if so what's your favorite honestly other speedruns that I'm like crazy interested you like Mirror's Edge speedruns all those are cool though that that would be I haven't seen those but that would be those are cool for like like you have like them like parkouring through like little matt bounds sexy sick have you uh have you seen like there's this agdq one-year and there was a glitchless Mirror's Edge run and some guy on the couch is just like [ __ ] on the runner cuz he basically like uses glitches in the run but the runners like nope that's not technically a glitch he's like you're using like a barrier outside the play zone to like bounce off of it he's like nope it's it's and then bounce move that's out it's so funny dude he's just like battling this guy the whole and the guy in the couch is so pissed is so funny you don't see that stuff as much anymore they're way more oh they're super like well like the application process a lot harder than gift like essentially show them the whole run and they like check in like I hate that like the chat is sub only mode because chat was like the best part of agdq like that was like why I watched it if you like to look back the internet image well agdq used to have like two hundred and fifty thousand two hundred thousand viewers and then they put sub only mode and then it just went away and then it was like 120 thousand now yeah imagine only having a hundred twenty thousand concurrent viewers on the screen did dad couldn't be me useless I have never done any speedrunning but the closest I feel to it is like check hero for instance when you've like tried to battle a boss like two hours it's like any Dark Souls game or any game with like a boss fight mechanic kind of yeah you fight in a fail for like two hours like cuphead like two three hours with nothing and then you get a perfect run you never hit you optimal on DPS and you just beat it here like that so I can understand why some people might speed run or do something like that like it's just so satisfying I think but the part that would piss me off my speed around the most is like when you're in a run for like an hour and a half and then you try like one trick and then dead run like the runs dead I guess I'd have to choose a game that's like under ten minutes I couldn't do an hour indeed I'd be so we should all make like a new year's resolution that we speedrun one game and we make we get world record time minesweeper oh I there's got to be one where you thought I'd get beaten for sure is in a way is there a tetris speedrun I'm sure I'm sure there's something I'm sure there's a speedrun for what doing anything and think of and know we'll never beat it and destiny to this apparently there's great speed I know we can't be done yeah maybe worried speedruns of the future that'd be sick but it was actually very eye-opening how bad testy to looked when like they had to widely because because someone couldn't pick up a rally or like they couldn't teleport to the okay and then two people's games crashed then got the wrong way to cheese ribbon was hilarious I was like you have one job the go left or go right and he went the wrong way cool and I thought he's gonna make it and then the door like closes right in front of him like that would have been made - did you see him standing there died like it did do that once because I was doing ribbon and I think blue you were showing me we were like trying to show me the cheese back and I like first discovered like alright you gotta go orange door whatever you know where are you I mean not a campaign it was definitely blue room or whatever so that I can I can understand that guy you know I've been there and then the game was crashing and that what what do you mean blue that the game was bad because they've had to wipe for so long or like well they got two more guess they had to wipe because I think it was it was either because someone can pick up a rally's that have resources or it was because there's a glitch do you remember your heavy though like five people can do this by themselves either that or when someone came back to the fireteam they couldn't there's literally three different things are gonna happen one someone really wanted a rally to someone someone really someone could not spawn unless the team wiped like they couldn't no they come because they spawn because when their games crashed I am pretty sure that's what happens so they couldn't even saw them so people say they were just like okay wipe it or three the person spawns at the base of like the jumping puzzle and sometimes the jumping puzzle will just disappear so they can't make it back that's a big time waster - you lose you're losing at least 20 seconds on them well blue I think you forgot the fourth one Oh was this ad break oh hey like that that was a good one what will we ever do I'm [ __ ] except for continued this podcast regardless yeah welcome back hey can you guys fill me in on why I feel like every other life every month there's something that Pokemon fans get superb either one you should just become a Pokemon because I see like I see it all on Twitter everyone's like this experience passes sick or it's this is [ __ ] stupid dude back in the game freak days not the game free EA oh yeah days and then Hokie a - so can you please explain to me as an outside Pokemon person why the hell you guys's fandom is so up and down all the time I don't get it I mean welcome to any fandom really I Pokemon more so I feel like a bunch of grown men just complaining myself included so people after and it seems like people have been really entitled since Gen 5 which we call gen fibers most of them are very nice people and we love them because Gen 5 is one of the best games of all time Pokemon wise also in general is that ante and all them or which one is I just stop talking don't worry about its luck third point is this was like the golden period of Pokemon where he had heart Gold you had gen 5 yet black and white - you had amazing Pokemon games that were just incredible yes and then X&Y happened and stuff started getting a little more barren we lost stuff like BAU frontier we lost a lot of endgame stuff mostly people seem to complain about battle frontier which is matter spectable sort of moon was the difficulty curve why I thought it was one of my favorites because of the story but a lot of people didn't like how we started like losing like difficulty curve the story started getting a lot more linear we still didn't get a touchdown frontier the unskipable good thing the cutscenes like the start of every game it just gets worse and worse like two hours you just like presentational even the battle trees looked a little more barren than he usually did and just general post game started taking a dip now sword and shield comes out and all the leaks come out and people just go [ __ ] a mat and that's when we talked about like that was the Pokedex thing yet exit and you guys actually the decks it was the thing that really like broke the camel's back okay and I think people expect a lot which I expect I think everyone expect a lot because this was the first switch game and a lot of people assumed o3s limitations are why they keep pushing Pokemon as far as they can but they can't fit everything on a 3ds cartridge or on like a digital because 3d is only has so much storage space mm-hmm and then sword geo comes out and everyone expects everything and people get I mean was pretty standard Pokemon game probably like X&Y level content maybe a little less because I mean I think sword she will typically rush what more can you put in it anyways people get super super mad because this is not like a switch tier title which I would agree it's simply not a switch to your title no it's not but this wasn't a very good tailor but the point is that's why Pokemon fans continue to be mad and however I'm gonna go on a little bit of thing here when the DLC comes when they announce the DLC there's no reason why people should be as mad as they were there's two reasons why people were really mad as DLC because robbers talk about right before the podcast right about how we were like oh if there's an expansion past it brings back to Pokemon like I wouldn't buy that because that's so shitty mm-hmm here's the catch people seem to have a somehow convinced themselves that this expansion pass because they are bringing that Pokemon they announced when they announced the DLC they're bringing that Pokemon everyone seemed to convince themselves that oh we have to pay to get Pokemon back we don't have to pay to your Pokemon back the Pokemon update is part of a free update so the Pokemon are coming so the Pokemon are coming back they're updating Pokemon in you don't have to pay for these to get these Pokemon okay so I don't have to buy the expansion pass to get ahold of these new updated poke commands that I really want in the game No however you do need to either trade them or bring them from previous generation through Pokemon oh that's no problem which is how it's always been people seem to seem to think that Pokemon home is now for some reason a paywall well guess what someone's Pokemon bank but you didn't complain about that [ __ ] right anyways so then they get really upset because oh this should have been in the base game yeah you could say that about every [ __ ] Pokemon game couldn't you could say that X&Y could sit about cinnamon but of course you're not going to because you're just gonna ignore every gen fiber I guess Gen 3 and Gen 4 probably sucked too because those should have been in the base game too right anyways the point is apparently that I think that everything should be based in the game like for free for some [ __ ] even though the devs literally said as soon as we finish finishing sword shield we started working on new content and I mean it's totally fine to think that a 7-month post post launch DLC is just something that they happen to hold back for the main title like the devs weren't working on something cool and new like a totally new adventure also apparently people seem to be really upset that oh I don't I don't want to have a $30 DLC I'd rather have a $60 [ __ ] new title that has the DLC instead I don't want to play through the entire game over again to get a whole new shiny charm and not come in with my [ __ ] bros that I literally just did the adventure with these DLCs I don't know why you're mad because most of the problems people have don't even exist in reality would like to pay for a new Pokemon and literally like just [ __ ] transfer them from home I don't know why you're mad not ever not no Pokemon game in the past has ever let you naturally catch pokemon normally or naturally anyways point it's not crying I don't know why Pokemon fans bring man babies and steals he's sick why so but like why are people upset that a DLC costs $30 when back in the day you guys would buy a whole new game that was dogging yeah the practicing that's the thing is and people are also confused they thought it was 30 because there's two parts of DLC caja and people thought each one was 30 it's not 34 so mmm-hmm now it would be 60 if you want it for both games but like both experience both games which he could but even then for both games that's the same price as just getting like an ultra Sun which is literally the exact same game except for like rainbow rocket at the end for an hour really have a full price game with like half a DLCs worth of content no that's it like that's the thing you people would rather pay full price for a game they have to play through again which is marginally different if at all for a little extra thing at the end where hey guess what or it's just DLC and there you go and it's certainly definitely these unskipable cutscenesthat's that that like it feels like it should have been the base game because sword and shield in parts is definitely lacking and like the biggest argument is to put it in perspective I think this is a pretty accurate percentage but it's like Pokemon is 30% of the entire entertainment industry in the world he's just right yeah and here we are getting like slivers of game where it's like how in the world are we still like 15 10 15 years behind in video games and they're still waiting like when they could they have the money they have the manpower they have the following to to make that breath of the wild ask to do something and crazy but instead it's just there they just refuse to push boundaries and stuff and this is where we are personally I just I've accepted it's not yeah yeah it makes Game Freak like game EA freak or anything like that I think it's I I don't have any hope that it's gonna change anytime soon so like I just have a more realistic yeah like expectations it is Pokemon Tim Tim hey looking forward to that though yeah do we like that or like that it's time it's pretty penny to blue uh yeah I mean I've played it off and on since the alpha this is the alpha but I haven't played since that how many times are in like the stress tester well so early access release there's the twenty first and I think it comes out with like eighty some like that but um what they're gonna is really cool uh fanart Pokemon them and yeah and cute they're poisonous but the thing that is so this is early access technically so it's not a full release full release will have I think this head over 160 and then what they're doing is once the game is done that's not it they're gonna come 10 you supporting it with new tim-tim new islands new endgame challenges like so it'll be a kind of a games of service uh-huh gonna be like a generation 2 Tim Tims a huge 60 new ones it'll be like he was like three new ones yeah probably something like that like sprinkled through however they decide to do it I like that approach where they're just gonna be supporting this game moving forward for a long time maybe Tim Tim to comes out you know years later but yeah it's not obviously overwatch - it's not just like a normal pokémon game where like you spoke my black alright your later here's here's a like how call black - yeah your later okay well he was XY Tim Tim is is exciting - because it gives a lot of combination of Pokemon because all the stuff that fruit talked about and which we've talked about in several podcast before they're all valid concerns like there's really no innovation there's no why don't we I mean obviously Nintendo wants to sell obviously stuff but we would like why don't have a Pokemon game that we just that you continuously expand on and you could just sell DLCs but when we optimized like in corner the market you you get to do whatever you want pretty much yeah so tempted physiological stuff I was expanding and then there's a lot of focus on like fare competitiveness which I haven't really got into because I mean the game's not obviously not complete and there's no like what I was noticing like in the battle system but the battle systems a little bit different instead of having like power points ppph removes for instance you have stamina physics ID yes if you decide to use move let's say my snazzy has 30 stamina hmm I want to use uppercut which will do 80 physical damage but it's gonna cost me 12 stamina oh so it goes down to 18 oh and in a fight let's say you get down to 0 your overexerted hmm so if you use a move with that PP it costs that much health uh-huh you have to use resources and properly so otherwise you have to wait yeah cuz PP you never ever get down to like zero with your PP f you never want to run out of PP so trust me you need all that PP so like you instead if you want to do that you'll have to like literally click wait like for that turn it's gonna wait and just get some stand in the back uh-huh so you have to decide some moves are more powerful but the sake of stamina some moves to our only active once you're in battle for X amount of turns so there's a move you can only use on term one another one that'll come back that you can use turn to and you can't use the same one oh that's I turn to with the turn to that kind of stuff and then status conditions aren't RNG so like if I put you to sleep it tells your to turns until you're awake or if you get hit okay or like if you're poison it's three turns that's it is there chance like if I do like an attack on you like if there's no strike okay so there's no crates and what if I do you like a lightning strike and you get paralyzed from it is there like is that if they would be guaranteed if that's part of the attack okay yeah there's no orangy whatsoever in any of these fights nope you might like a little but I think for the draw like it is that yeah it's the cut and dry like you know what what you're gonna expect you're like that way you can plan accordingly not like Jesus crash that got crit and like I know for some people like some of that RNG is fun so who knows what to do but that's instead of going with this orangey tree I like the idea of like stamina because it actually like makes you think like cuz you're never gonna use like a like for me when I play pokemon I never use the text like it attack Rises or like its defense lowers like you're never gonna use this height earthquake earthquake earthquake solarbeam this old earthquake wave like and then you get a lot more like in-game strategy to certain gyms because there could be gyms that absolutely punish you for going to balls deepen your stamina yeah gyms are layer designed around okay you need to manage your stamina because this the gym is designed about endurance so if you use all your stamina then maybe they'll take advantage of the fact that you can't do [ __ ] for a while a lot of avenues and they've talked about liking them like legendary Tim Thames or anything like that or is it all pretty much like yeah I'm sure but they haven't said much about it okay what is it fully launched I don't know if they have a full launch yet okay but the early access is 21st and the thing - I forgot to mention is the battles are all double battles Oh every battle some about yeah whoa so that's part of the strategy because they're also why you care you're come on Tim Tim I know when I was playing it's gonna take me away but there are some moves too that are called synergy moves so like let's say I have this poison move or it's toxic it's gonna hit this person for X amount damage but if I use it in conjunction with a toxic ally it now poisons in per 4 turns or like there's one water move if you're paired with something yeah you have like a team comp you can get certain bonuses so you can plan around that the AI and the game by the way is just punishing which is so nice i-it's not like bug trainer Joey or like I can't tell you how many times it died I was having to like constantly go back in heels like I don't I forgot about this yeah because pokemons held my hands for so long because I tried to go all the way to the first dojo which is like a gym mm-hmm without and that route is punishing is that that's such a long route without like battling any wild Pokemon realize I'll just battle the trainers mm-hmm ten times brother but yeah Tim Tim I'll just battle the the trainers not the Tim Tim wild Tim Tim oh my god I like that too like yeah the first like this like enemy battle like battling Lance as your first like trainer pretty much but you go and Pokemon or Tim Tennessee are like fainting left and right even trying like I'm like right I need to actually use items I need to actually look worried about swapping people in a now I have to actually think about what I actually have to grind wild battles yeah it's just so refreshing uh-huh now how many in your party six okay so it's the same but you can do co-op to so you can play through the entire game like do well mmm oh and the way that works is one Pokemon is you take the first three in your party and they take the first in your party match your team huh so when you're fighting you only have your three and there's three that's cool like they've always should have that and hopefully Pokemon like sees that and only hope and they're like we need to innovate because Tim Tim is good competent the other 70% of the company market now like because like if all this means is Pokemon literally rips every idea from Tim Tim cool sacrifice it wouldn't be that bad because I mean literally all of Tim Tim owes its franchise yes ideas to Pokemon so fo c'mon diddle rippin off bad I mean I'm out yeah they it's capitalism baby they can't completely do it either because again Tim Tim has set itself out a little bit different because of the the battle system with stamina and no rng so at the end of it they'll still be a difference mm-hmm but yeah like if they started bringing in the MMO aspect the coop aspect I mean that kind of stuff like thank God it's about time but they're only bringing in Galler inversions of glare by the way those legendary birds we like those so we do like those I will say the continued advantage of Pokemon / attempt him which is a very big advantage and why tempt em will still struggle a lot to like compete as Pokemon designs are just too good Articuno is sake the the the people who design the Pokemon are just continue single Jenny brain somehow managed to make oh [ __ ] is that a [ __ ] dragon with a jet plane on yeah [ __ ] sick what's the what's up with that legendary Pokemon that has like a big big thing on we don't know you got some hits you got some misses alright but that's just the breakfast of this gen what is that what is that Pokemon called I don't know oh oh yeah I was just gonna say deformity like monstrosity Oh with big brains 5:05 had deer remember I was thinking about two minutes ago but I can remember like Pokemon names like that depressing all the uses information yeah that's the drama with Pokemon which was your favorite bird that day announced its it's between Articuno and Moltres they're really sweet yeah they're both really dope I think I'm between Articuno and zapdos Sambo's is kind of basic but he looks just so medicine he looks like a ground type now or something like that or like a like a chicken mom my boys by the way finally getting their respect Giganta max being a soaring Blastoise yayi oh they're in there they'll be coming so what does that was Giganta max mean so there's Dynomax which is they just become really big yeah but then there's Giganta max where some pokeman when the Dynomax have a different form oh so like there was the whole moon there's literally a Pikachu that Giganta max is into the old school Pikachu were so fat chubby yeah yeah uh-huh like that's a form um like Snorlax has ejecting into max form is that the chart has one too right like Snorlax he's laying on his back and he's giant and his belly is literally like great like an island uh he's got like trees and everything no way so everyone has like it there some Pokemon had this dragging into max form and so they announced that these people Blastoise and venusaur get one yeah which first off they'll be back in the game which is nice because we're late Charizard line and then on top of that they're getting Jackie our people upset now the people who are like chores or gets everything if they mad that the first gens now get Giga maxes or whatever well so I'll admit this part because I still thought it was bogus where Game Freak was like we're only doing 400 to keep the competitive balance yeah but then they're like Oh 200 more and apparently they're adding like all the most ridiculous overpowered people is like Landorus yeah and stop Landorus is one of these legendary Pokemon from black and white Andres is the reclusive dev of Pokemon yeah but so they're adding back these Pokemon that like are just broken yeah like there's gonna be no reason to not use them again so what's the point can they just ban him and like oh they won't they only ever ban like the legendary legendaries like the cover legendaries and usually like the secret one like a tournament or whatever and that's UV even then like in their official competitions which are like VGC tournaments they'll still let stuff like [ __ ] mega Rayquaza in doubles like they're even letting all the Giganta max like all those and oh my god literally the only band ones are the to cover legendaries and the return of this which probably would even make the team like no they would oh they would just as their raw stats legendaries have raw stats that are like just busted research that's is it like a fixed role like everything that they get or is that sometimes they could be like Eve eat or whatever it is well I'm so glad you asked they have effort values and just like default base stats so like a pseudo legendary for instance usually are the best aside from a legendary like drag a bolt dragon I'd the Haxorus and all those I think they're based ask it like five fifty or something right blue somewhere around there I think Salome's you know those are base 600 oh yeah base 600 which is like pretty big that's a Twitter as good as you get big boy stats before legendary but like a turn of this as a thousand something like that it's like yeah yeah GMAC but otherwise he's like 750 or 800 which is just jehovah like Charizard like 5 10 or 5 times that's insane double six like you think I think I think the point is the legendary is just inherently are just stronger yeah and then if you were to train them correctly would oh just are you allowed to use legendary pokemons in the trading card game or those banned yeah okay I mean all the cards are legal okay do they have that Giga maxes in the trading card games now because they're linked games okay yeah I didn't like a new cutter like that new game pallet each other power tree new gimmick it's the power creep dude there's now GMAC Snorlax has like 340 health back in mind like base set for instance yeah base that pokes on hi old heist you could get 120 HP charger I have 340 340 like I didn't dad I was like muck or whatever have like hey look like 270 it's up there but we've never had we've had one card hit 300 before and that was a Wailord that's the biggest Pokemon there is like but now you've got over 300 because the thing is there were cards you kill me at one prize then they started making ones exas not of two prizes but they're strong then they made tag teams which are three prizes and even stronger and now they're gigantic max which are still three prizes but just like oz and say is that like for like you just beat my yeah like you just wax I lose yeah but that's I guess that's nice yeah I still remember my Pokemon rules that you need to catch for prizes to win six but we did play and modified because we had smaller decks so you're not wrong yeah I was you were right for our little tournament okay you were there how was that was fun 19:17 so good oh yeah you saw that saw that last night yeah what do you think so really I've been so excited for that film I thought it like I had already come out I thought it came out like in December yeah well that was like the misleading marketing it I always saw Christmas was like sick yeah I want to see a Christmas but it was in select theaters there was none in Colorado oh so when I see select Lee doesn't like oh just like it's in theaters it's like it was limited release okay and then it didn't properly release until what was January 10th uh-huh so I went I'd been waiting yeah weeks and yes II by yourself is you snowing that Clara it did not disappoint and the thing too is because I was so interested because I heard it's one take I was like how in the world would they do that and it is like from the beginning another maybe yes from from the beginning in the movie to the end no cut no cut I was looking for it because they didn't done film and stuff so I was like I wonder and if you know where to look you can usually see where they kind of but at the same time there were some really clever ones where I was like maybe mm-hmm I don't know cuz so much of the shots were just focused on the characters - mm-hmm like there's no way they could do this but yeah it follows this like 12-hour window or whatever it just goes through how long is it um like an hour 55 minutes it was paced super well yeah the cinematography phenomenal with the acting yeah like yeah can't rave enough see I think I'm gonna see uncut gems before I see 1917 as I've just been hearing insane I've heard uncut gems but I'll be honest I'm a sucker for war movies oh yeah especially like I love those kind of days that's why I was already excited yeah and the set pieces and everything I mean it's just like I've been reading more since scene about how they've been doing stuff it's crazy mm-hmm how they're able to do it but ya can't recommend that enough there's also there's another movie up either now or soon that I want to see but I also want to see I want to see uncut gems just because everyone's like well yeah cause it's like I'm saying he's getting an Oscar like but apparently Adam saying way too also said like like I'm never making another movie unless I win like Best Actress yeah which is I he sounds super it sounds awesome so I mean I'm in I don't know it'll be interesting yeah but I thought I agree man up because I wanted to bend bring hum Oh 2019 was such a good year for TV shows yeah yeah and I know blue Greece with me on some of these but I'll start with I'll start with one you guys might have not seen okay and I feel like was slept on Umbrella Academy umbrella oh that's like the superhero movie that not movie but like series I was on Netflix right they're like kind of like bad superheroes or somewhere like they don't understand it or something that is you might be talking about the boys oh that's the one I'm think which is also on Amazon which also came out last year which is also fantastic thank you for mentioning that but Umbrella Academy it's about like six or seven kids that had he's like mutations or powers and they were put into this thing called the Umbrella Academy bah-bah-bah I won't say too much fantastic I didn't really know too much about it put it on one night and stayed up til 5:00 a.m. fish hoping he liked you guys are talking about this I told you guys I was gonna watch Mandalorian and I just didn't watch an attack on Titan again even though I've already finished it like it's I don't know how you do that I don't either I just enjoy it like I just like rewatching something that I've already watched I don't know why I wish I liked tree watching things I don't I'm so like reluctant to start new things I wish I hated watching like the same way yeah so blue obviously we talked about us Mandalorian mmm-hmm yeah there was and I think the one episode where he was um it's like the third or fourth where he first meets the girl warrior the previous rebel on that island with I only care about spoilers by the way on dude that whole island with like the village that one was a little weird not a place but aside from that every other episode about it yeah I've heard nothing but good things about it from both of you special episode was like it was the fifth episode the gunslinger which one was that one that was the one where they go to the desert to hunt that assassin oh yeah yeah that was when I was like this one but the rest was Game of Thrones 2019 you know that was pretty probably the most disappointing okay while I wasn't gonna bring that up that's your fault I'm under saying like if we're gonna talk about how great TV was we can talk about how bad it was at the same time man I don't even want to think about Game of Thrones fans said we didn't think about Watchmen yeah I've heard that's which I finally finished still so mind blown better than Mandalorian in The Witcher I think so yeah because then we had The Witcher yeah I thought was fantastic and I'm so glad they're they're gonna keep going like literally the the casting and that shows so good and Henry Cavill is not perfect how he's also hot yet I doesn't do my my fiancee whatever I do like I'd let believe me yeah but you can peg me to yeah but that show is fantastic and I know some people had problems at that one with them being able to follow it I didn't have as big of a problem with did you see that IGN reviewer ever he's like it was an Entertainment Weekly he's like I like sees like I watched like the first two episodes I skip to six this show sucks well he went he watched the first first and then half of the second and then skip to the fifth and then wrote a review which by the way fifth isn't even the last episode there's like eight however and I was just like how this guy yeah you order get paid to just oh my gun he's like I don't have eight hours in my day shut up are you working there yeah this is your job watch the show I actually do know what my 2019 show of the year is oh I think about it this ad read uh I actually had one but yes this ad Ritu and welcome back alright my show of 2019 Chernobyl I haven't I haven't seen that one oh so I'm a sucker this is not my fault I am a sucker for like history kind of documentaries they all I have right and like I think the Chernobyl disaster two is probably one of the most interesting things to ever happen on the earth average moment oh it is so and then like the way that I could explain it like how like dire like the situation was and it's so cool well here's the problem I wanted to watch it mm-hmm but whenever we watch something means query usual wants to watch it and she doesn't like depressing stuff or like too realistic stuff she wants up be happier which I understand like she does so she wants to escape in like a happier place yes me is I don't care okay if it's like war I just just in its raw uh-huh and so I wonder what Chernobyl yeah he's like like we don't always can watch something else and so it's always like I'm gonna watch to normal but can't we like finish early can't we want yes I haven't been able taluk so that's my show that you easily that shows awesome but I need to be really really risking it really putting it all on the line right now mister fruit I know you have a show of 2019 blue don't mean it's mine it's man [ __ ] incredible oh [ __ ] Chernobyl was dope and then the witcher was really really good too I don't I'm pretty sure this was 2019 but carnival row I have never heard that I was on Amazon Prime fantastic as a rule and Oh bloom and somebody else but I love the world that was set in that was done really well yeah but it's just like we're living in the best time right now for TV yeah because the budgets they're getting and stuff like the line between a movie and TV shows getting blurred and I'm living for it I'm going for it that's the bad it was crazy because people were talking about like in 2015 they're like oh we're in the Golden Age of TV it's like no it's good now we're in the Golden Age of TV well like personally like I've come to the point where like I've always like wanted like a halo movie but I totally rather have like a series because I feel like a series can do way more with like material and all that much more satisfying in the way storytelling machine like you Leary have hours of a show to tell a story that you want to tell as opposed to fitting it all into a two-and-a-half-hour movie that sucks right Skywalker not this one hey that does remind me that I'm pretty sure I think it's stars is working on the Halo series I think they just cast their master chief Oh cuz I yeah you actually he's not here about you've got to wear like three footsteps but I think I want to say it's slated to release like a whole spring 2021 is that probably like with like a Lord of the Rings with the Amazon series that their designs could be had to be so tight like I feel like the - as people are so much more interested these days and I'm as well and like fantasy pieces or like old time pieces or like these things like people desperately wanting Witcher to be their next game of Thrones even though they're like completely different things but I feel like people are looking for that space because right now - just give me any story but take it out of modern times where there aren't cell phones it's immediately so much more interesting yeah and the possibilities are so much more endless and like we just plays out like modern day stuff to me is kind of boring honestly so like all this new stuff where you go back and like fade out like interesting then futuristic can be done well which can still be it's a dystopian kind of like future or something rather than like flying cars or around yeah but like I don't know for me a lot of modern time stuff just isn't quite as interesting mm-hmm and I believe I was reading the whole piece on this but yeah it's like just bring any story and then take away the modern technology and it's just so much more intriguing and yeah the way the stories are telling the characters interact are just infinitely better yeah that's why I definitely it's a little bit of fantasy just really goes because it really makes a difference because that's what the to be fair that's what the we spice brothers did whatever well mm-hmm was I mean that was their pitch originally like we want this super deep fantasy war like complicated series to be accessible to like dads moms watching football yeah who like my industry would say it I don't know CSM they did it CSI Miami like I love that so like they did down play a lot of the fantasy mm-hmm but just like that I feel you've been it got all those people I don't like fantasy really wait this is this could be free oh this isn't okay and then they get more interested well that's why Game of Thrones was to me I was always like wizards and like dragons and all like witchcraft is like whoo but is sweet and I'm all about it now but then you have like The Witcher which like fully goes into the the fantasy stuff it's so good yeah one time about that 2019 and I can only imagine 2020 I'm around well candle it's funny we talked about television because we're gonna move on to the patreon question for the podcast which why don't we go ahead and just mention our podcast patreon stamp that'd be great we love our stands out there they'll support the patreon guys are still out there yeah we're not dead here for you we have Wayne Angie Brandon Smith B nerd Sean Logan Boyd thrown Lozinski Chris Yeager Blake Russell Deb Halle Jayden Blanc Marya brynee Asst GP hash and of course the stank big sexy Omega arts and safe or the stag Omega save big sexy arts right yes the stag Omega saw big success though thank you guys for keeping me clothed Paul you're the your stance and we are you yeah we may we may string down the font size a little bit so beyond I'm looking on the patreon if you we want to get a little bit more episodes that start getting back rolling okay so I have some questions here for you guys it's funny that we start with the TV show questions Blake Russell asked best TV show and best movie of the decade of the possible why do they ask these hard questions I I will start good so you guys can think because I do have one that I think and I think it's next I think it's gonna be the same as yours you go Oh yep that Breaking Bad Breaking Bad is probably the best show of the decade if I had to pick one show of the 2010s to define the 2010s it would be Breaking Bad but I can't even remember the whole decade that's a while that's a lot man let me look this movie up if it's in the last decade we'd have to say this and then the movie for the past decade my favorite movie this past decade was war for the Planet of the Apes I know you're all about that movie is so awesome I love how it draws a lot of like things from World War two I love how it draws like it shows like illusions like the Holocaust and stuff I it's a dope movie you guys should like watch that if you have not seen that that was my movie that's a top three movie for me I love that movie I'm looking at a list you looking at a list oh how many good I'll give you some time to think so it's best TV show and movie the decade right yes okay my movie is easy arrivals so much that's easy too easy favorite decade for me a [ __ ] love arrival I will never stop talking about how much I love arrival movie I'm sorry a TV show I honestly want to say is this is kind of cheating the season 134 Game of Thrones it's still the best TV I think I I don't blame you if you could say yeah I I would still put Game of Thrones like - behind the reason why I put Breaking Bad ahead of Game of Thrones now is because of the most recent season before that Game of Thrones was like it you know I mean yeah I mean breaking bad overall TV show no doubt I would I mean that's as perfect as I can get if but like as far as like the TV show I genuinely enjoy the most as seasons 1 through 4 Game of Thrones man yeah well I can agree with that sentiment my favorite TV show would be Game of Thrones okay even with you know Lancome mm-hmm still I think not only because of how good it was but what it also did for TV it's true I think it's like redefined it and now you see people wanting to recreate it but that I feel like Game of Thrones also showed that you can invest this money and get it back in TV it's not just a like how you said right like you're here for movies becoming like TV or TV becoming like movies well Game of Thrones is like the whole reason why that's even possible and like all the big-name actors are now going on TVs and TV shows was tough because one the money's their bigger production bigger budget Hollister it's just so sick you have it's just so much more satisfying having hours of storytelling then yeah to enough our trash movie that totally ruins a lot of the franchise star wars the rides of Skywalker you know wrong they remember though I don't think I could pin it down but like I was literally just looking through a like like popular 2010 movies Mad Max I put there I think it's fantastic action looper interstellar I put interstellar Stellar's amazing oh that's a good pic to fullfil wallstreet Django revenant I love revenant that movie's great to Dunkirk dunkers great um you said interstellar yeah I love interstellar I'm just looking through these and I can't like yeah there might be too many of those okay yeah too much this next question is coming from jelly who is the worst teacher you've had and why were they the worst teacher you've ever had no I guess I will start um okay I'll say his name uh mr. Wade he was my sophomore year a geometry teacher and let me mr. Wade was like the football coach so he wasn't there to teach he was basically like the football coach I'll never forget it was like it was like mid September like football seasons about to start dude puts on at Kenny Chesney the boys of foam and like we literally just watched that and he's like all right guys we have this quiz like dude you haven't taught us any of this I was just watching Kenny Chesney the boys of foam and like literally just watching Kenny Chesney sing about being a high schooler and playing on to the front and that light and I was like dude what is Pythagoras theorem mr. Spade I'd literally call him that cuz I just didn't understand anything I was like mr. Spade what are we doing and he would literally just all right boys today we're gonna better do the geometry here's worksheet I'm just gonna two over here and go out someplace what I alright dude blah do you think dude and then like two days later he like alright we have this test like we didn't learn any of this none of this says like in two minutes in what is Kenny Chesney's lyric mean like no they were actually geometry questions so easily mr. Spade or wait I guess [ __ ] blue okay so you guys have like really innocent answers probably my freshman year history teacher don't remember her name mm-hmm she was just super racist oh like extreme charade up a racist like really my kind of teacher alright darkness described really obviously in every school you have cliques that stick together or not as many clicks right but like but I get what you're saying as I went to a predominantly white school and as a child I went outside so I actually looked Mexican as opposed to now I'm rather pasty because I never go out outside yeah gross so obviously a lot of us would hang out around each other because we relate to each other much more yes me and a couple friends were in this class and then obviously you know not every single flat and kid knows each other but it was very obvious she was very biased against everyone who was not white and she would many people would be sent like in-school suspension which I never had I had like time it was baby like worst attention yeah and like I'm sad was always it would it would it would always be this panic its and which was just like and at first we were like oh I mean I I guess we were kind of loud every now and then but as the as the year went on it was like you know like [ __ ] I think Tyler over there that's been - has been sense is as once and he's literally Larry called teacher [ __ ] what does he was eager to ISS boy that's sucks I was like the most blatant that's probably most blatant like I don't want to say like T's shitty person she's shitty team sucks that's like one of the first times probably the first time I ever like genuinely feel discriminated against my person as in like a position of power again it was it feels bad anyways I get sent the ISS twice and one of the times I wasn't even in class but and she said she said it's because I had been absent too many times oh that's why I got mine but I wasn't absent that means I've been apt in like three times the year see I got mine for doing so that's whatever when you like we're late to class and the stupidest thing they would you'd be like 20 to like 15 seconds late to class and they would literally like go to the xxx table anything by the time you get out of class have to go to your locker and then probably go on the other side of the school that's five minutes if you're lost so dumb and then you go to the tardy table so instead of me missing I don't know 15 seconds of class and now I'm missing like eight because there's another 20 kids in line who are late like I was and then then I think when you got like six or seven it was like in-school suspension and it was the class where I went from power weights which was on one side of the classroom all the way to eat pod which is all the way on the side of that stupid mr. Miller all the math teacher who's not my father and has no no relation in relation to my heritage but gave Miller's a horrible name and I had him for he said gaben it's Greg what I thought it was Greg his name what I didn't say Gaiman Oh gave no gay box he was the worst math teacher I think I had him for ap statistics I had him for that what a class to have him for failed the AP test oh you did would be the one or two like one or two I yeah because I was not because I line on that test cuz like I have not learned this I've worn none of this he was the worst teacher I've ever had uh-huh and he would also spend half the classroom you in a yell fight with Hayden uh-huh Hayden yeah and Hayden was an atheist at for about two months and then Hayden one day said eff this I'm out walked out of the room and Wow yeah yeah mr. Miller is like a little baby he didn't teach hidden no idea what he was talking about I had him for Algebra one I think my junior year I'm pretty terrible teacher but I mean it's a lot harder to mess up algorithm well yeah he's listing and like he wouldn't teach it's what I just read this book and then tests were just ridiculous I passed his test and his class with like a 98% or something hmm cuz that part was easy and on top of that but you're not there to pass the class when you're no I was trying to get college credit yeah I couldn't I didn't get any so there were just a year waste but I mean between all the yelling he would do he cried a couple times like just it's just like what mm-hmm what is going on here and it was just stupid not all teachers are bad let's just say that so my mother is a fantastic let me ask this who is your guys's best teacher if you guys can think of one I will start shout out you know who you are miss Klein she doesn't watch I don't know acting that she was so awesome well like when I went to high school like I was I was a cool kid like I'm showing up late yeah I have a girlfriend like I'm doing all the cool things and I like walking to class late like the second day of school on the [ __ ] and so hard yeah and she's like what's your name I was like oh my like she's like you're late I was all like my bad and I just like sat down so like we like going through attendance and stuff and she goes uh mister my bad and I was like oh like you calling me out like like you don't even calling me Robert like mom so she called me like my bad for like the first two weeks of school I was like okay miss Klein likes pretty funny let's move on like that's like cuz she's like she called us he's like the first teacher to ever call me how much [ __ ] like that and then I was so and like I was so bad at algebra to trig dude I was so bad on it like like I said I had to like try so hard to just get like a seat in that class like I would be there all times is trying to get a seat so I could play soccer and she was so sweet and so kind and like did it make me feel stupid or anything like that and like I went from like hating her and then you know how like on her senior year they had like all the teachers like lined up and you could like thank him and stuff like that she's like the only teacher I saw and like I start crying cuz she was like the the only teacher that I felt like truly believed in like me being smart and not just using my charisma and might be me being funny till I get past everything you like I actually believed that I could like be smart so shout-out to you miss Klein we love you will marry down I think so it's not climbing boom yep about you but sorry question I've got a lot of really good teachers actually and say hey the mall it's funny you go first for you I have to it's like a tie right now and had to figure out which one well yeah it's not because I guess mine's a cop-out to either miss Towser or miss bar mrs. bar I never had miss bar what was she like English or graphic design oh that's right she was like design all she's like for the photography teacher to write she was all practical arts I think yeah she came in Saran takes a junior year and senior year and she was fantastic she would really made a new class for me we didn't have AP graphic design hopefully until I went to a graphic design and she went as a there was like a graphic design do graphic design one two and three mm-hmm and I entered in wanna have to start there she said okay well I'm just gonna bump you up to two and then okay well you already we bumpier three and she's like I can't even give you this work so she talked with like the principal mhm and they were able to talk with like that board or whatever and make AP so I got credits that's sick and make me an AP graphic design class and so on did you have a good AP test at the end of the year mm-hmm oh you did and at the during class cuz everyone else was in the room she instead sent me to her private office uh-huh and so for that class I just got to sit there my own like in an entirely separate room uh-huh small she posed or just me for a whole period and I got a do I bet those were the best block days ever and I got to do my projects and everything and then I bet you could do like homework too for other classes if you're like behind or something like that it's been a lot of time watching Starcraft videos thinking back there you're actually like grinding and stuff and you just oh well because I wouldn't then I'd get done it was like unblocked days like hour-and-a-half I don't have much time was it was it this computer like block to youtube videos or suffer was it one of those computers that had access to everything not only that there was like hot cocoa machine in there and oh my god yeah I had it made in that class that's fantastic was that senior junior senior okay and then mrs. hazard because 8th grade and then all through high school amazing that was our computer teacher and did all that stuff I saw her the other day then I was like talking to some kids at the school and I was like you're the man although we love you she's fantastic I said we I get you some merch copped Emma she helped me with all my classes and that stuff she got me in editing she made me like after effect classes and stuff she'll just do the announcements would you accredit a lot of your knowledge to editing and all your thumbnail work to these two teachers uh not really oh really cuz I'd already done it beforehand like that's why when I went in the graphic designer like I mean I do this already yeah so like it that's why she's like all right well you're advanced we'll just put you up here ap and then same with don't mean a step because I always want to do YouTube and whatever so I'd always yeah I had already done only home videos and stuff yeah so she would like accelerate and then make programs for me missus Towser as well and then a couple years for lunch we had the Lunch Bunch she'd let us sit in the computer room for lunch that was awesome play like Minecraft or anything any any shooter we could get through it was like halo we could like you had to get janky halo you had to get through the firewall every tile did it Genki thing I was sweet though yeah just chill with friends in there like shooters well I really liked one of the teachers was like you're just gonna like let him sit in there and she's all there's a Lunch Bunch they're good and they Christians like I don't want to do this anymore that there's a name attached to it listen I guess with lunch lunch now and I was like God but um yeah she's definitely she definitely the bestest well blue Christian did too so if you haven't decided that was easy probably my middle school Spanish teacher Miss Montez she was really sick guys did you need a Spanish teacher no it was kind of like yeah free yay I took it until high school rode that free A+ everything I did I would I never got higher than a scene in Spanish ever my dad speaks fluent Spanish I'm terrible at it see that the thing is Spanish classes really don't teach you how to be fluent Spanish which is unfortunate they all the teachers like vocabulary and stuff I dunno vocab tied don't so as a little bit as much as people take Spanish classes when they're growing up so I'm gonna be fluent Spanish class eternity should be fluent it's just okay yeah anyway Spain for you like Ben you'll be fluent yeah I mean that's no joke if you actually want to surround yourself with actual people that speak your language which is why I'm really not fluent anymore Peppe hands no sub-bio no symbol that was the onion that's all I need to know got a thing what if a blower no sube oh no so BIOS about the only onions no unfortunate okay so anyways my Spanish when says she was like I think was like my she was my teacher fourth or third and fourth grade because she was the only Spanish teacher at the school so she would teach both Spanish a--'s or no it wasn't third fourth it was fifth and six what's middle school [ __ ] what guess now it's yes okay what's seven in a cuz middle schools three years right anyways excuse my Spanish teacher for two years and I think she was the first person who really like was like yo like you should be like super proud of like your heritage wherever you come from so that's how I got really into like celebrating stuff like Day of the Dead mm-hmm and really like focusing on trying to be like a good well at the time I wanted to be good at Spanish cuz it wasn't my second language or anything it was just something I've learned every now and then so she was there for the reason I learned to speak Spanish really well for time which I really don't anymore and be really proud of like history come from which no one I mean I went again I didn't exactly grow it what when I was a kid I grew up in a not amazing neighborhood so I had my homies with me but then as my parents you know got more money and better jobs I went to like really predominantly white schools so I kind of lost a lot of like what I felt like my roots and my Spanish teacher always reminded me that just to be proud of where you come from so it was like that was where I found like a lot of self pride myself so I cannot I can never thank miss when does enough for that because it's probably the reason why I'm so proud of being well the best teacher now don't teach you things they teach you things about yourself like that's the exact kind of teacher yeah it was for you and then my other teachers probably mister so Sierre those one of the sickest names of all time my french t he was always really encouraging of me when i had video stuff cuz i like you really naturally talented at this why you are you are very talented at it every once in a while but he pretty much immediately which is like hey do you want to edit the video announcements oh what I was like I was like absolutely I want to add the video announcements so he gave me the opportunity that and he was like why don't you take this class next year because I was just in like basic video editing mm-hmm and then literally my my sophomore year he let me into the video announcements class which you have to be junior take so I was really excited to do that and he was really encouraging and he was like hey really good this you should pursue this so then I did and here we are hey shout out to all the good teachers out there we need we need more of you you're important yes we love you but not as important as a man is it hey we're going for that nine stores for Chavez oh I remember the name I forgot that's incredible anyway sorry we'll try them out there this has been the first did you ever
