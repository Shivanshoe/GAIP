of stamina fudge me dude i don't i i hate it the fact that you have to do all one go means you actually have to have teammates helping you and that never happens because as soon as i'm out of stamina i can't do anything for myself anymore oh and i guess my teammates just gonna not even gonna bother with them though like oh but they they can just win yeah go for it really guys really bro i three games in a row they have not given me teammates they have not given me teammates of course another tiebreaker i don't want to look at this look at the difference i have five people oh my god and like look at the point difference the scores i'm grabbing it i've got the flag it's mine and of course i'm immediately dying getting absolutely no assistance yep okay look at my score dude i am trying my best i have 35 gates the rest of people in this entire match combined don't even have that many board i'm trying i got him it's okay team pull up oh my team what are we doing see like how they're killing me chasing their flag carrier that's what my team should be doing [Music] i'm out here for bragging [Music] all right stream we have to watch our boy this is gonna be it he hits plat here hopping on board here with robbie v trying to hit platinum here and judging by the 96 rp up there it's all but said and done ab getting torched losing shields but it's top three rob aggressive as ever oh he got the prowler full auto no wonder dude it's over as he walks into a little bit of the incendiary grenade bm he's like i don't care about your grenade he's chasing he's chasing that's what i love to see tries to grapple misses that's the prowler and just like that 1v1 as soon as i leave they went coincidence i think not or he just needs to move it over to the left you know because he has like currently you know he needs to but he upgrades to red [ __ ] that's not important he's getting torched on top uh oh he's in trouble but he's got his friend ab kip he's panicking he drops to bat still 1v1 here folks it appears that the enemy team is a little split ab appears to have caught the revenant but now he realizes he's found the entire enemy team rob with the prowler this thing is no joke look at that a literal laser prowler full auto is insane if you get it in a care package you just win the game but something happened ab i'm not sure he did bm though and he's in the black hole he is getting sucked he's running and he made oh kip is fragging that's it it's just down to him in the revenant always rising oh this is easy oh it's game it's game it's game this is easy yeah bm oh he's so close let's go boys let's go i'm more hyped than they are but whatever 10 17 brick squad not bad damage though and you know it doesn't matter how about it a win is a win but here we go you hit play pause go oh it's flag again oh we're done watch this i'm invisible but i'm not it was a ruse oh i'm gonna grab the plan because nobody else will oh my god i have a teammate who actually did you're you're nuts dude i'll follow you i won't let him get to you ow in fact instead i'll just take the hits i'll take the hits for you ah get off of me friend i'm coming i got a kill yeah i got another one no i tried my friend well it was a good try uh yeah yeah uh oh there you are you'll rascal boosh wait i didn't kill him oh okay he's dead now 100 there he is yeah and then now it's my turn
