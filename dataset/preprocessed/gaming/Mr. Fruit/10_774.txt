hidey-ho jean my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to gob duty modern warfare in today's video the last shotgun we need a spotlight on our road to Damascus that's right it's the r90 my favorite shotgun if we pretended the 725 never existed I'm actually a little sad to put on platinum because I do have this hard hat blueprint for it and I love it it's got the whole SNES 5 here we go platinum I do think this looks a little bit better then the 680 or whatever that we recently reviewed I loved the r9 0 and then I unlocked the monolithic suppressor and then I really loved the r9 0 so that's what we're using for the muzzle forge tax entry for our barrel by Mel watt laser blade grip tape and that's sleight of hand no more shipment 24/7 so the shotgun won't quite shine the exact same but make no mistake it still can be perfectly fine now unfortunately oh hold up oh look at that Platinum it is still incredibly underwhelming but I like the shotgun and that's all it really can't say thank you for throwing me into this absolute fear instead of a game where we're not even we're not even competitive at this point but the interesting thing to know about the r90 if you have not used it is it shoots twice and then it has to somebody told me what the phrase was it's not cocking a gun it's railing it I think some like that I don't know forgive me if I if I don't remember we add shoots twice and if I shoot once and then I wait a little bit and shoot again I can't shoot twice it still has to do that so really your best bet is to always just shoot twice even if the first one's gonna kill somebody unless there's somebody else around but it's it's gonna be the most advantageous enough with your pro tips with mist or fruit you know you guys are already gamers if you've watched my gameplay for any amount of time then you're already the best gamers out there look at that ranged oh oh oh oh I'm so gassy right now oh no foof I think ate a little too much for lunch ate right after my workout which I normally do but it's not sitting right this time is anybody hiding in the office anybody anybody hello oh jeez you scared the heck out of me the hackers are no longer with me you have literally scared them out of me they have left my body like a demonic beam if you did some sort of a exorcism the power of Christ compels you I had a thought and I lost it which is not new what was the front this turnaround uh-huh Oh watch oh I missed that first one but we gucci we gucci stem up i don't need to reload yeah I'm gonna be at PAX shelf from Thursday to Monday which pretty much means I'll be missing out on shoot has 24/7 which is unfortunate because I like swapping between shoot house and shipment because they both allow for camo challenges and different lays well placed grenade master fruit here a crack shot shipments but if a closed recorder two-stepped whatever or just things if you need to kill a whole bunch of things or level things up where a shoot house notably the best part about it is mounted long shots we love that you love shoot house for that everybody loves you ask for that come on there that's right I'm hitting you with a shotgun and then I ain't gonna stop and watch this turn the corner I missed dead black hope no one sees me get freaky I'm nerdy in the extreme whiter than sour cream I was in the a/v crab and beat Cobbett even the chaste team on question I thought was hard do I like her Black Card it's been every week in the man oh yeah I lost it I was actually pretty well on the lyrics there can't tell you the last time I listened that look at that range though that's what I'm saying it's the old double tap a ruski you don't always kill them with the first shot but you don't have to just got that is the exact noise it makes oh okay not that time hmm wow I was about to say how in the world okay I need to I'm hoppin serious Oh serious can we are we done are we done now are we can we be mature about this are they defusing are we winning how they are defusing oh no I could have helped stop the enemy we did join that game in progress though and I think we made an impression actually I don't know what my score was 2kt nailed it you guys want to know the best feeling in the world I'll let you in on a little secret if you don't understand it's probably because you're just a little young give it a little while you're understand when you're older but the best feeling in the world is making plans with somebody and then having them cancelled relatively last-minute oh my gosh oh it's a fantastic feeling I know that sounds dumb but maybe it's also just because I'm a bit of an introvert but not only is it just like oh okay I don't have to socialize right now it's also like I had already freed out that yeah a block of however much time it would have been so the fact that it's cancelled now meet really what was he a car watch and he had shot me how does it did I jump what I can't complain it's pretty good drag chapter well playing certain well black I still hate you though and this dude just killed my friend and I killed you back all right now push me push me watch I didn't think it was that close he did push me and I did ask for this so here I am so whole tax thing is important because like I said I won't be able to play a shoot house so I won't be able to grow darnit same problem I have with the 680 shotgun the whole railing the gun I really need to I swear that's what they told me the terminology was I'll have to double-check that later screw me but anyway you take your two shots you got a rail the gun but you use a stem and while using stem it refuses oh wow hello just one after one after one EJ Khaled is shedding a tear somewhere so many another ones but a dead mean by the way haha oh what a nice kill that Mister fruit oh I should not have killed there but we did well played did I rail the gun it appears I have you got lucky kid don't let it get to your head I just love my stem now ever since you guys were like miss your fruit you could use stem you'll really like it and then I used it and I was like I'm never gonna use this and then I got used to it and that's my crutch and now I always want to use my stem but when the gun makes it so that I can't stem or doing so has an adverse effect on my weapon well then as you can't imagine I'm not a big fan don't get it twisted I do have a big fan that I go to sleep with every night I have my overhead fan and then another personal fan that blows our rat on me mmm mmm between the white noise and the cool air I live for that but that's not the kind of fan I'm talking about [Music] do do da da da how many of there are you what okay this is a apparently give me a power boost oh my god this is insane sing more oh you penis that's right you male sex organ screw you it is a scientifically correct name okay so let's not be immature yes I called him a phallic thing okay but weed it doesn't have to be immature it's just a nice it's a good thing you know penises are important in because well when a man and a woman okay I'll stop sorry parents watching with their kids or hey I getting ready to turn it off I am mr. roat their father but what I shot this guy but it sound like he had a friend near him going merlocks from Oh what so there was a rascal over now I just spawned everything over there I tweeted about this and I talked about Isabel on podcast but 1917 you haven't seen that movie yet you're sleeping on it man show good+ if you love war movies you're not gonna be disappointed i love war movies they're movies in general and it delivered on both fronts i was a very happy camper oh my god i got the kill but now I'm weak and I'm steaming and I'm running run boy run this world is not for you who around a boy run he's the missile no I knew he was the one commanding that Christmas was like ha I'll kill him before he can kill me did not go so well so it does have a decent range but if it's at a range where it's not succeeding it doesn't really matter how many shots you pump into it it's not gonna work you have an RPG I just killed your entire team what are you gonna do about it you're gonna lay prone well but you probably sad mr. fruit in the kill feed myself or rather the name my mr. fruit because it was taken whenever it not important they saw that and he's like you know I missed fruit insan' aggressive player I know exactly was in dere right here he's gonna push and he would be right because that's all I do baby we hold W if I could go back in time and make that my senior quote I would just under my name it would be just hold W forehead top of the team now let's go I know it's a bit jarring going from shipment where everybody's dropping triple kill digit games even in the team definite where there's only 75 kills per team I know how does that work it's not important but where it's super crazy all the time that's still a decent game but because the pace is so different you don't notice and the odd thing is shipment actually makes shoot house feel swap and then you go from shoot house to a regular map and it's just like molasses but ah another losing game huh they've called in the cavalry I'm the entire Calvary unit what they only sent us one man like sir it's mr. fruit like oh my god we don't deserve this what a nice kill there mr. fruit check this out ready ok hurts hurts now he thinks that I'm gonna push after destroying his Claymore but little does he know oh wait sir sir careful buddy wait that was my kill that Wow ok well I don't know what's happening anymore well how did they really spawn right there well I can't say I'm surprised really mmm didn't expect the r90 around the corner did you I'm a bit of an idiot that's nothing new but the first time I could I got killed by the r90 I didn't know better and I was like is that that is that the origin with like some sort of a double-shot attachment cuz I yeah that's that's interesting but no it's it's not turns out and then I use the r90 by itself now it's like holy cow think about your 9:02 is pretty much out of the package out of the box it means business now check this out ah because if I do anything else ok how did that hurt me from this that it doesn't make sense ok hold on watch the radar ping or that what ha ha ha Chuck didn't even kill any of them because I did not recruit link I recruited bunny rabbit I needed some more hang yeah oh wait no that's Fox and that's not really link okay I said I would help us win so far I have not been doing that no more time to focus on slay mr. fur this is the game we focus on the obj this is obj time mr. fruit this is obj territory I shouldn't have stemmed I might have been able to kill him just get a hold on to be na I'm doing the math right now 150 hundreds of course when you fifty more points they need 36 okay two in the same turn every other saying well anyone do that if they don't get any points can we add crunch clinton and carry the 1 okay yes this should be good but just in case i am going to cap charlie so then we have triple now they're gonna cap a which is fine but this gives us a quick second of a triple cap that's right domination oh my god mr. fruit I've never seen you be this dedicated to the to the obj I know to new me unreformed now check this out oh you got a great what did it cost you a again wait a minute we're losing beef that's an important objective in fact that's a staple to the war if we lose B we lose everything do not lose B gentlemen I'll clear it don't worry Oh a star B we're losing C and B man what did I just tell you we're clearing ballast baltha okay that's that's a new one ah claim oh not on my watch spotter mm-hmm well done mr. fruit oh I see one B mmm oh you're dead a clean point B that was a fairly some text so thankfully I'm not dead you're friendly you're also friendly I'm paranoid that's a claymore that's an enemy he's dead you're dead to that Claymore you should have seen that use spotter idiot okay they're trying to take a we taken the lead and not just a lead an incredible this is insurmountable dare I say they'll have to pull a mr. fruit and triple cap but considering they have no cap cap no cap cap no no cap cap kappa anyway we're on B I'm clearing again that's right this isn't I am just shooting my friends left and right that's freaking Oh I told you they'd bring they bring in the obj man himself Frank brought whatever doesn't matter I came in nobody expected this out of me they thought I they called in the Slayer not the OBG player little did they know oh all right well I think that's enough obj play for the rest of my life how's that guys oh you think I'm joking euro 9-0 didn't get the spotlight that the other two shotguns did that we used on shipment because shipment isn't here some stead shooting house so it's performance might seem lackluster but in comparison believe me it's not use this on shipment and everyone was talking about the origin and then then then enough are nine zeros the play thank you very much for watching have yourselves a fantastic I'll talk to you yes that's right you in the next one farewell [Music]
