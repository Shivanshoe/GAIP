[Applause] i've activated my power i can jump higher oh we get it for 20 minutes delves and dungeons can be found across the world oh yeah boy yeah you can parry oh he's weak [Music] okay my goal today level up my workbench to three and me too but uh it's a tall task because you need like eight million leather poop and can't find boards for the life of us well apparently get this you can tame them and make them have babies yeah but apparently it's pretty it's a little difficult so one we would have to like make a pen and then draw them in and then you lay berries on the ground and then you have to leave and be and then they'll say like hungry and then they'll go over and munch it and they'll do it and then you have to keep doing that and they're 100 tamed and then they'll be like hearts and then once that's done if you have like two of them then you know they make the babies every now and then so that way you could slowly just have a boar farm but that seems very end game yeah that's the very end game pretty involved pretty involved yeah i see elm has stored plenty of stone lumber yeah he's got a beehive that's very fun i'm gonna extract that i'll give it back what the somebody almost knocked the tree onto our house what the [ __ ] yeah also i am team no stump so if you see a stump please do um your please don't be a trump get your stump i i can do that my liege anything for you you don't have any [ __ ] the forest is moving yo are you kidding me fudge i just got here oh jesus what do we do what do we do what do we do uh just get ready to fight oh my god what there's a whole thing they're already here oh god what am i spawning we need you here we need you here oh they're in my house they're in i'm loading almost at most dead i must lead him out of course we gotta

think we're safe more or less yeah i think we're good now also we have to change our where our fire is or like a chimney because when it was raining yesterday our fire wasn't working at all while it rained because the rain just kept obviously covering it so we need like an official chimney fine but it doesn't look as aesthetically pleasing maybe we can make the chimney somewhere else we can like you know keep the aesthetics good idea wait is the workbench level only like per person or is it per workbench per workbench it should be yeah as long as this one says one on it for me what yeah i can't upgrade anything because i require level two but all right i gotta go oh wait for you what is the star on the top right no yeah same thing oh i think someone destroyed my hold on oh yeah when they knocked the tree down it destroyed my little penises how would the tree get all the way over here okay yo and check this out ready i have the power whoa oh you gotta you got a pickaxe yeah so now

i didn't mean to wow dude does the carpet or give you like a new recipe yeah it did no it just said new like resource whatever oh that's right then raw or needs to be refined in a small tool to build a smelter you need sterling cores search for the dark places apparently though we need curdling uh stones or something in order to we need what maybe the curdling stone maybe we get there from a type of rock yeah in order to make a refinery or smelter and it sounds like the only place to get that those dungeons and we know where we found one of those says i'm carrying too much i'm carrying too much too how much is copper white holy jesus it weighs a ton let's go sleep how come who created the whole like z's when you go to sleep like why is ease oh i need to make a shield how many bone

you just understand what you read uh i'll be to the all father hey sounds good to me what is this dude there's four boars chasing me and dwarves at the same time oh oh is that you oh no that's you christian yeah you saw this too yeah so we can summon another deer god here apparently because this is what we had to do last night yeah that's what i figured it was that's why i didn't touch it with a 10 foot pole you want to you want to form it so we can make more pickaxes yeah easy clap more leather all right where are you finding these bores ab this is random damn up in front of us like while you're walking they just spawn in front of you i know i never get any of these spawns though oh there's the level two deer yeah you saw that thing yeah i'd already hit it once got it stupid gave me eight deer hides easy clap can we make a uh like a what are they what's called a good like a boat yard or something dock yeah dock um i actually think you can but way later i think there is a way to like make a dock or something because we don't have the blueprint yet but you can make like an actual viking long shift yeah i saw something like that we will have a small raft oh god well let me probably get as long as arius isn't on this raft i'm in and no advanced grills we're good day 17 what the heck wait really that's what it says oh yeah either that or they played a lot last time last time we played it was like what day six day five or something like that yeah um do you have any wood um i got like one do we need to get wood again yeah we might need to start whacking some trees all right i'm gonna finish cooking these up i'm using the i'm using these over here so i can cook i guess i can use all three and get omega cooking is this somebody's oh yo there's been at a house with money in flint here abandoned house right next to our houses that we no one ever looked it much respawn because rob found one too rob found a house nearby with money and yeah i found one actually earlier i found 15 gold i forgot to tell you guys that might respawn that'd be pretty cool god freaking i know we meet someone later on that we can use the gold one oh we do never know what the point of gold is yeah i saw someone playing and they're talking to a merchant you could buy like really cool armor and stuff with it yeah we're not good this game is surprisingly like really good like when i first thought i was like oh another survival game and i was like oh norse mythology the first time i played is like these are the graphics oh you had no idea i like it i i like it now i just logged on though and i was like this is not what i was expecting i like it gives me because it's like a nice charm to it like the lighting makes it look pretty too which is cool i made a lot of food by the way so we have like a lot of food well level is your guys's uh like how do you see like your stats and stuff is there a way well no what do you mean like like where it's like you're running like this is 15. press tab and it's next to the crow icon on the top right the bees need more open space what why would you tell me that now the way it just blew up now um okay i'm trying to think i wanna like if we think i don't wanna like we should think ahead and not just place it and have to knock it down again i guess i'm trying to think i mean back here seems fine right we just have like a row of beehives maybe it just has to be close enough to the workbench for this work yeah i mean that's fine the bees are happy and happy bees happy life right well we have to figure out do you want to set sail here probably right why yeah for sure it seems the like to play look at us look official got the leather armor yeah helmets we are truly viking hold on i will be joining you guys oh wait fudge what i need to work bench does this work ah yeah just fall from this guy too far wait what does that even mean oh hold fast wait maybe let me see if i can make a chest oh put the chest on it yeah oh i don't have enough wood you hand me that wood you got i got you um just be aware though things like like if we leave our boat unattended they can't destroy it maybe we just leave it where we have to swim so the enemies can't okay i'm coming so like we'll jump out where we can swim safely uh i don't think it's gonna let me nah well dang it tried to big brain dilly dilly we hold fast boys we are so [ __ ] what is your armor should you go get better armor nah i'm trying to figure out how to oh okay mr fruit i don't know how this works oh i'm i'm doing it oh are you just use rudder oh oh it's up to you robert then we combined fruit we all won is this what i'm doing gotta steer this [ __ ] right i'm on it this thing is slow but that's all right she'll do the job hold e fast well i'm thinking if it gets like stormy or something that way you don't just um there's no like monsters in the water right that'll like make us lose all of our ideas see if you can turn the sail to catch the wind oh yeah i thought you turned it i thought you turned it christian i'm trying oh you just break it no oh man we should we're making slow but steady progress yeah i'm scared like something's gonna break and we lose all our items in the middle of water wait why am i running like what are you doing what's going on it's also not great that we decided to do this on the foggiest of days this person says the water is calm thus little wind the wind will turn the sail if you're at a decent angle the wind will turn it so we can't control it i guess not we picked the shitty day to sail but do you control like where we go i mean i can do like that it's just i think the we are dead at sea yeah i think the sail is more a matter of how fast we're gonna go i repeat we are dead at sea i'm moving as much i am going is i want to go home it's too late you can't get off this ride i don't feel safe i'm gonna throw up oh here we go okay i'm gonna throw up okay now we're picking up how [ __ ] funny would it be if we found aries just floating and we were i was like nope nope like that nope yo ho yo ho i mean did we really go anywhere though well we're not done yet we're not landing here you sell it goose hi pear i hope you guys find a cool island have fun get back we mean getting back i'm on the same island we're dead in the water trouble do that just have your weapons everything out ready the burial chambers i'm afraid like spike's coming up or something oh my god back back a ghost i don't want to fight that that's a boss right [Music] you
