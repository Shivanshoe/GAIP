hi ad hold on my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to call duty modern warfare and now that that Damascus grant is over and I patiently sit here dreading the master came out grind about to come up I've been messing around with a few things and locking some attachments and whatnot that I have not previously had the chance to enter the model 680 and the Dragonbreath rounds they added a whole bunch just like how they added you know akimbo for pistols they added some cool Testaments for shotguns for instance Dragon's Breath 6r max that's right for the low price of no custom barrels movement speed or damage range you get detachable magazine tighter pellet spreading outside speed and then sandy airy damage and of course bonus points for Damascus this is also helping me unlock the VLK rogue shotgun because during my Damascus grind these weapons weren't necessary so I didn't bother welcome to Atlas superstar please make sure to keep 6 feet we need to practice social distancing here actually did go to the grocery store yesterday and they oh Jesus they did make it so that lanes are like one-way you have to go down an aisle if it's the right way to promote self distancing and or social distancing or whatever I'm never gonna shoot a guy from that range let's be honest now funnily enough I've never played this map but I have played war zone which kind of has this map in it so I sort of kind of know what I'm doing but at the same time I don't really know what I'm filming he boxes boxes on boxes he's burning is he gonna burn enough though is the question where did oh my god obviously incendiary rounds you get shot yeah you want to find this jacquard I want to extinguish that fire but you can't always okay he's burning you see those little extra hit markers ah you're not escaping me doesn't always grant you a kill and perhaps not using it and using different attachments you might get someone shots that you normally wouldn't but that's not as fun plus it's cool to burn someone walk away see those hit markers tick down and then it's real easy to get that clean up kill this reminds me of all those times you would see those videos of people in like grocery stores setting up forts and stuff and just be an absolute joy I was good at excuse me house way did you not die but they'd make like forts and five Walmart and staff and his eyebrow what he doing he like secondhand embarrassment from them you know and it's like but somebody's gonna have to clean that up why why are you making this person's life more difficult all right but that's neither here nor there I'm going dead silent he's burn and we got the kill I have to fudge stem up i i i mean literally a ther there on are a and he hold the phone first off fantastic gold pistols you got there alright just completely outplayed out skilled outsmarted and two other words christmas all about i don't know how to kill people i can I squeeze through that yes yes I can got a shimmy my way own in there shimmy my way downtown mmm fly and fast and explosive payload it's gonna kill you better put them in a bow vampire a fabric damnit a spell about by the fidelity that you're burning but a pedometer but they have flat jacket but a pedometer from who runs that am i right why do I sing all the time I can't help it it's my program mean that's right I'm a robot it's true I just told you booboo Bob Penniman a monomeric this guy knows I'm here washes washes washes get up late get outsmarted I'll plate up did he not wait maybe he didn't see me because he's evidently blind as a bat by the way don't go eating bats fear you're picking up on a button-down skirt oh oh oh that was you Loki that yeah I was kind of sick oh yeah you tell me not a single one of those bullets from that massive spread hit that dude it's okay though we outplayed him so oh my god fudge jeez ghost isn't he yeah yes I was looking at my radar and radar said there was nobody there but there was can't rely too much on that in jail mr. fruit it'll get you killed was that a head shot if not how what else do I have to do for a head shot if there's anything to take away from this so it's this no aim no brain I'm a Winston mate no aim no brain I'm a shotgun man need to do half the time I don't even 80s it might help I'm not really sure there's another guy over here by the way where did he run off to you little rascal Oh is there a way hold the phone ladies and gentlemen we can get outside so there must be a way to shimmy on up there oh oh what oh ah I got you and we can get on top of it during war zone probably not during like the actual match though huh oh my god it's a small Armada and I am still alive this is incredible reload love that detachable mag comes in handy at times like this how's my Tamagotchi doing how are you doing oh my god you're terrifying I mean I love you all the same you are the best what you doing bro oh there's the burn feel the burn this Bernie isn't anymore how topical jokes we love those here flak jacket really well joke's on you you thought it'd save you but I still kill them so it was a nice parting gift some long lasting burn jamage it gives us true damage that's it so League of Legends joke probably goes over most your heads because there's like there's a summoner spell called ignite and you can put them on and it does true damage whatever but also reduces healing which is nice that was my kill through and through not very cool can we also talk about though my immersion ruin with these incendiary rounds like one shot into some of this stuff and like this whole place would be lit ablaze really I'm in the crossfire I know I'm not talking about that oddly enough incredibly popular shooting game over in was it China or South Korea and one of those I can safely say it's not North Korea though oh my god I'm a Fragger it's what I do I'm a Fragger I'm a straight-up eff the fragging life is the life for me shoot people by day make content by night the fragging life is the life for me I gotta say I blame Bal right now cuz like I always just want to swapped like my knife now or something move faster do some like cool knife twirls but alas it doesn't work like that apparently and we also joined this game obviously in progress and I think I might top fragging on my team already so I'd say that's going well ah hey get out of the freezer section bro you can take my toilet paper you can take my milk you can take my eggs but you stay away from my frozen boots up fudge no aim no brain and I still can't hit a dude how's that work check your corners corners and doors kid corners and doors Oh oh my god flack jacket was huge there I was like well surely this close to shots just the pellet damage alone and then the incendiary would still do it no no this man is impervious to fire he's fire retardant it's incredible we must analyze his genetic makeup he is the solution he is the fudge he is that we talk about a dead meme huh oh no oh cranked 10 B 10 on gunrunner wait no is this gonna run around remember I can't remember the maps name for the life of me but I do know that Timmy 10 on this map will make this a lot more interesting see Timmy turns on his maps feels right it feels like a constant amount of call duty action that one would come to expect having played previous Cod's before I just tried to click shift to slow walk like I was in balance but they can't hear me I'm a detriment destroy your Claymore holy jesus he's like oh my god they're everywhere did I just get wallbang I really am playing about what's happening I'm so happy things that bother you never bother me dodo boto bum bum I'm trying to figure out where we want to hover around I'm thinking we go on that warehouse over dar oh my god nice close quarters gives us a decent amount of card ok ok ok well currently step one is get out of spawn then we'll improvise as we go check this out they're not going to see coming uh-huh Donna what are you doing all right well I wanted to go into the warehouse but they are there watch that like a couple of hawks oh nice way to go me oh ho there's someone here I the incendiary damage did its job I'll be honest yes sometimes incendiary damage seems frivolous and completely unnecessary because like otherwise it does well it probable to one-shot anywhere or like it didn't it didn't why would I go off there terrible decision making and me name a better do oh no give me my gun back wit give me my gun [Music] Wow speaking a terrible decision making huge play by mr. fruit here as he walks into the enemy's cluster strike interesting strategy let's see if it paid off spoilers it did not oh my god get absolutely turned on Brea I'm cracked right now Oh No see like I would think you know maybe the incendiary damage would be able to finish that guy off right there after I died butch did not so yeah sometimes it's like well what's the point bro I'm gonna mess some people up in this warehouse check it check it oh shoot and they can't hear me they can't hear me why did I just make monkey noises for my dog I don't know I was just so excited the good boy showed up and people were the enemy was around me so I panicked I come here you disgusting piece of filth yeah oh how many times you're gonna hold that corner Brad ha ha ha Damascus Tegel at your service I mean at this point I should probably put a launcher on launch around the home baby don't you butcher a lot around shooting down your friendly sorry sorry there is someone not friendly in here though he's around this corner moo-moo-moo breach Bank clear it's clear I can't make that jump we said you just dolphin dive off this roof you know not quiet fragging as well as we did this first game I wonder why I thought more people here would mean I'd have a better chance of just absolutely to show up my shotgun but turns out it just means there's 10 enemies holding angles and I'm having trouble setting up to a place where I can properly ape but now I'm kraang dang you dude I was about I was about to throw up some 90s bro be like dang he's cranking has anyone made that joke before I bet probably I'm totally original down what is that song I'm thinking of I want to say it's like an older song maybe like 70s 80s but it's like doo doo doo doo doo yeah it's like something like Tamia Tamia baby because you women I don't know we took a fat L here let's draw your next on your disgrace well Dragon's Breath shotguns there's some nice memes and it's just fun running around with them is it viable I'm not really sure there might be better setups to with it but I out of 9 man I'd made his up on the fly what do you want for me now comes the fun part while we wait for master camo down in the comments section below feel free to give me some attachment ideas or loadouts to use for videos some challenges or something or just something really wacky we'll try to make it work I don't know either way I think it'll be fun so with that said I don't think about much for watching have yourselves a fantastic I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
