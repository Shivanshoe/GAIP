it's a farming creature collecting battling yeah let me put it this way it's like if you grew pokemon and then had them dance battle each other that's ooblets i'm excited to hop into it so let's do this your life has been a giant toot wow i feel that so far you've spent all of that tutti life on the isolated arrow island where the people are stuffy and there aren't even any ooblets no ooblets well they get me off of this 2d island you know what i'm saying no ooh butts what what i look like that's why you've decided to leave ah i'm a thinker i'm a tutor and a thinker one in the same and as nice little fisherman is bringing me to the distant shores of mainland ub i get it the land is called ub and they these creatures hail from the land of ube so the products of it making them ooh blitz clever clever a place you've only heard vague tales of a fabled land of oddity creativity and title drop ooblets how did i know look at this quaint little town hey hi how are you guys new here oh what the heck it's mayor tinsel oh bittle boy darn i don't think i've ever heard that word before but i love it bittle boy that needs to that needs to become a staple in my vocabulary from now on are you from the uber high council that said it with decide is this a surprise inspection did i fail i uh no add fruit why am i making myself uh i guess i am a girl though well i know i'm fruit from arrow island oh then how do welcome to badge town my name is tencel oh and i'm the mayor what can i help you with i like this little lady that keeps trying to walk she's in the way like excuse me i'm going to start a new life somewhere oh wait possibly here splenda not to be confused with the artificial sugar replacement were you looking to buy a house maybe invest in the local economy well i have nobody or skills or personal possessions so a true entrepreneur then it's like they're talking about me i can work with this though yeah i've been needing the helper for my ever expanding mayoral task list and there's an old abandoned farmhouse you can have if you help me with all the junk you got to do around here perfect what is it about always having random abandoned farmhouses people can just use apparently i just need to move into small towns and they're like hey we've out we've got a couple of acres there's some nice land honestly it's already got some good property you just gotta like spend a couple days and you're good to go for the price of free you and free houses don't just get offered every day uh apparently they do live ed what can i help with first i love my little like when i talk to a little head fantastic first off wait where are your ubers well i don't i don't have any they don't have any uber where i'm from ah not even an ugam it's gonna be tough to do much without ubers here well your local oobleck club will probably be able to give you one what club are you in uh we don't have uber clubs web prep either what sort of ah no bother you can join one here let me fetch your local club later so you can introduce yourselves to some town folks in the meantime okay thank you mayor tissel tisselton whatever um your name was all right let's uh oh hello ara digging your whole deal you got going on here very confused chic lab fruit i do here my fave type of person one i don't know yet i'm a raw confused chic that's exactly what i was going for how did they know what up meloo i saw your boat pulling so are you some sort of rich tourist come to buy all of our postcards and novel t-shirts no i have fruit and i'm looking to start a new life here what am i supposed to do with all these novelty t-shirts i feel that i feel that an entrepreneur just trying to be and do what an entrepreneur does how do deary my number's not up is it i'm fruit and i move it to the old farmhouse oh good i mean and i run the little gardening shop here so i guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other if you have any spare produce you can sell it to me and if anyone starts asking too many questions tell me first is that a threat to other people well this little kid you know what like a super odd bizarre art style kind of reminds me of katamari damasi i think i think i've always pronounced that wrong but you probably know new uber spotted a dumbberb well that's not the not the most flattering name but what up taffy taffy do yes it's true okay then i'm fruit go away now okay farewell taffy boo it's pole oh how do you do looking for a bun i don't think so i'm just moving to town to badge i can't even remember the voice game well i'm pulled local bunga bee delivery fella here's a little gift from the bungle b company to welcome you in town some bungle beep bun nice and soft the way they're like like replacing words with certain things like berber being burp bat is nice and soft a good source of energy the finest pre-packaged treebees anub eat bunglebee buns for a quick and easy boost to your energy and mood probably i appreciate the uh truth ragnolia are you the research assistant i requested three years ago no i'm just new here at fruit introductions okay sure i'm ragnolian i operate the learnery which surveys it serves a variety of purposes too complicated to get into right now and if you're going to be sticking around you should have this grumbar it keeps tracks of all your tasks items from friends that sort of thing how does it do all that science and magic and junk mostly junk you'll figure it all out or you won't i have no metric of your aptitude for these sorts of things open your grimoire with tab or sorry grumbor ooh i have stuff i have friends booblets badges and the almanac which like none of that's full right now but uh hello charles you're standing awfully close to me oh hi i'm fruit i'm doing chad i suppose you'll be wanting to know my name now hmm that's okay you could tell me what you're ready okay fine i'm charles i may close at my shop kebab on i'd shake her hand but i don't do that social distancing good churls good he's already on top of it there's a tree a little fruit or something but i i'm unable to oh wait what is this uh something hidden but it won't let me well let me interact with it oh hello it's double trouble double trouble a customer what can i get you bee juice spreadsheet sorry i don't actually have anybody not winning customer of the month so far well when you do scrounge up some money spend it here at cuddle cops i'm double and i serve the best and only being jews in town well then the competition isn't fierce these people are uh most of them are a little off-putting but that's okay you know i'm sure the appeal of badge town will make itself known sooner or later splenda everyone is here now so basically oobleck clubs are all social groups they each have their own themes and personalities these are all google club leaders i thought i'd let them each give you a quick pitch to see what they're about oh they're gonna sell me on it okay we'd love to have you join front buns we're delightful we could get tud whatever that thing is or peak snubs pig snubs don't do pitches you should be pitching to me oh i like this guy oh yeah like go in reverse okay i'm gonna be honest this little beetle dudes in a weird way very cute we have memphins i don't really know what to say about memphis or what to do with my hands okay i do like sideki though if you like adventures the outdoors in nature you should join me at moss sprouts now the shrombo is cute but i can't tell you the last time i actually stepped outside so i have to rp um so i think we're to go with the peak snubs and biddle the club of born leaders strong competitors and just generally successful people well golly gee wilkers i belong in peak snubs uh join peak steps no yeah at least you have a distinguished fish now you'll need to start providing or proving yourself as worthy being a peak snob i'll do my best captain let's see what you can do with this little run oh what up biddle okay get down with your bad self let's do this uh you two look like a perfect match we are aren't we oh now that you've gotten uber you should try getting into a dance-off did somebody say dance-off okay ubers are mysterious creatures and they apparently love dancing it's very important to them all we can do is support their interest and set up elaborate contrived competitive dancing areas for them to show off in uh isn't that so nice for the ooblets you'll be amazed at the sort of conflicts that get resolved through the medium of dance you know i wouldn't be upset if our modern world adapted this idea got a problem oh here comes a worthy competitor to let you practice think about all the the wars and stuff we would have we would have skipped if people just did a dance-off also i'm i'm drinking uh some of mr fruits cherry limeade from advanced gg link in the description code mr fruit thanks anyway i feel like i'm from badge town now like oh a new person i don't care about you i just want your money dance challenge from lump stump uh not the most flattering name here's where you pick which ooblets you want to dance you only have one so far so it's an easy choice level one oh shoot i gotta level up my dancers let's freaking do this dude oh oh i didn't think it would hit this hard okay [Music] i love the little dance circle too like oh we got a dance off everybody's like oh like this is what we love everybody show up people are yeah look they're in the background showing up like somebody say dance off each turn you draw a random dance movement is free to choose from oh dang yeah this music is kind of okay is this just me i don't know you have some basic moves that will always be available e jubilee also has its own unique move freaking we got biddle has pilfer polka watch out dude with some experience they can learn new moves moves cost beats and you get fresh beats to use every turn fresh beats i i get that to start with you'll draw four moves and have three beats per turn some moves increase your points lower your opponents or do other junk ah yes this that or other junk the goal is to get this number of points before your opponent 20 okay pick a dance move to perform um this says steal four points but they don't have any points so let's see what happens i don't know like how do i select oh there we go [Music] oh we'll get him go side to side okay yeah he had no points so i got literally nothing for that oh i could have just done the flip floss for seven points well fudge well do you we're gonna do the little lindy nice little flip there buddy old pal okay go ahead and end our turn we got nothing else to gain three points and one hype what the oh i just get a gain of beat rhythm and grow feel that beat man now we got four beats a turn they're done and i can flip floss add a move to my hand earn two points i think i'm just gonna flip floss flip floss i was taking a bath uh i don't know what my deck is so i'm just gonna do rig a jig oh okay just oh fudge i thought i would be able to choose which one uh yeah it didn't work gain four points in one hype oh shoot this boy's hyping up the crowd oh no they're taking the lead yo yo lump stomp calm down bro [Music] uh so i could gain eight total yeah that's smarter because uh otherwise we'd only get seven from the other one not quite as opt oh oh i only gained one extra beat that one turn oh my god i'm literally throwing i'm gonna lose the lump stump his name is a lump stump and i'm losing to him fudge he only needs a couple more beats i think we lose fudge uh i'm gonna rant at a random move maybe i get the one that steals that would be nice what did i get i oh sick i didn't yes okay we just have to hope they can't get four points i'm about to lose about a little lump stone this is embarrassing flea battle get out all right yeah we lost the lump stump that's embarrassing oh now the music's getting all set he's still trying though he's still dancing okay you know he's high spirits still he's looking next time huh i really didn't think he would lose that me either but i messed up a lot anywho you should head to your farmhouse now get settled in she's just like jesus you just lost to a lump stop bro meet tinsel at the farmhouse where's the farmhouse is it up here i shouldn't go running off yet all right can't go down there hello mushroom friends oh we found our

make friendship stickers but it's all goofed up fredship stickers oh that's just the little thing i came up with where people in badge tech give each other stickers to signify their friendship the more stickers you have from someone the closer your friendship with them is people were really into it but then my printing press got all borked up and now the time sticker spies run dry if you wanted to help me find the bitties i need to fix it we can get it printing stickers again in no time lucky duck splenda i'll leave a box out for you to drop things off in gotta do everything around here but

you wow i can show you the uh that would be great oh what up milo you're still here yep sorry if you're sticking around you should get on my good side it might come in handy wow all right well so nice so nice lovely people really good old badge town in the meantime now where the fudge do i find this stupid freaking cloth what is this reconstitute uh cleared all the mystery cans being dumped well i picked up quite a bit please do not like the reconstitutor i wasn't about to do anything like that apologies we've had some prior issues with invalid reconstitutor inputs what is this recounts the tudor is a machine that transforms a variety of things into slurry sad slurry can they be processing the sea dangle bait of course see the eagle bay sure you must know c dangling c dangling it's when you put stuff on a string and dangle that string into the c to catch things look there's a sea dangling spot right over here wow i can see dangle i've always wanted to [Music] try it yourself it's very simple even for you here's some bait people are so rude what is that supposed to mean simple for even for me well let's see if i can't uh catch them choose your baiting cast your dangle okay i only have this bait so i'ma catch some ready what button do i press oh my god oh i already got i got a cd grow yes again i don't think i have any more bait i don't think so see dangling very straightforward if you collect any mystery cans be sure to put them in their constitutor to get more bait and again do not let the reconnaissance it's worrisome that you have to tell me that so many times but okay all right i should have oh wait i can turn a lot of something into something wow oh okay so it takes a little while but then we'll get slurry which will then turn into bait oh i need 10 slurry to get 10 bait okay i don't know if i have enough but i'll have to reconstitute do what the reconstitute does and in the meantime we're going to end this here let me know if you guys do want to see more it it'll depend on how well this does on the main channel um we could possibly move it over to the second channel if you guys didn't know i have a second channel more mr fruit uh and maybe play some more of this at the very least i think i'm gonna be playing it on my own time i love this little game it's like that nice mix of farming and then like the little card battling um creature collecting like dance battle it's freaking sick i love it it's zany cool graphics i'm all about it but we'll also be doing a ghost of tsushima play through though and like as soon as it releases in like two days so i don't know how we'll juggle everything at the very least i just wanted to show the game off uh i hope you guys did enjoy this with that said i want to thank you all very much for watching have yourself a fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] you
