the first time in our life we start the podcast within with a review you do have it ready so that is pretty appropriate that we do start correctly well actually i've decided this one's gamble review so i haven't pulled up uh and we're just gonna i'm just gonna stop it they're all great dude they're all fantastic look i there's they see it in the webcam i'm just swiping i'm swiping we're stopping on this one oh what did i do oh i opened this chord hold on we're swiping which one is this one it's not that hard okay that's my notifications dude boomer i really am okay it's like it's a call why is it so difficult dude you know what's hilarious it accidentally clicked our gg easy episode called okay boomer appropriate all right i can't show them because it messes okay and so he says come on house answer larry we have here um from poppy westlaw lovers 69 420. okay this is a meme there's someone out there uh 11 stars fruitful um i can't read the rest of his title um he says have you your shirt this is the one you select have you your church's your content in these hard times been unfruitful if so he like capitalized fruit if so and if you've had success still i have found the content for you no seriously this really is very very fruit full that was it that was the review why do you [ __ ] why that of all things so you don't get yankee with noah brim but you get fruitful no i'm not laughing at the fruitful i'm just laughing at that that reveal that's pretty funny dude these past two weeks you have like slowly become like older and older it's kind of concerning dude missing out on a new meme ages you like 20 years you have truly proved that we are closer to the 30 than we are 20 at this point actually that's i think that's yeah that's true yeah yes now i thought about that the other day had like a midlife crisis kind of thing trust me i i think about that a lot because i'm super into zoomer memes but i'm still technically a millennial but at the same time like i'm right between zoomer and millennials so i'm in this middle ground hellscape where i still get blamed for everything but that's perfect like at 30 are we going to be looking at memes and they're like look at these old guys trying to meme like and then are we like supposed to not be meaning anymore like i'm just worried that like you know there's like that that subreddit like uh insane facebook appearance or something yes like i'm worried that when we are older there's going to be like something dedicated like us where we're doing something stupid or like trying to be hip and they make fun of us and it's like see but i feel like we've come so far from because like we grew up with the internet so i feel like there's always going to be a level of having that internet like we shaped it in this we'll remember our roots yeah we're like the ogs so it's kind of see but there's like there's like life before and after internet as far as like how well you meme there's no there's no i mean yeah there's like that sounds like a game show there's like boomerangs but those are like people who adopted the internet whereas we were molded by it we were born and it's molded by it and then like they just took over facebook i remember like parents are getting on facebook and it's like you still go on facebook it's like get to twitter man like just come on now well the thing all for me the the thing is with all these this memory it's like looking back like to think a lot of this start like you look back at like uh troll face and like rage memes i look back at those i'm like that's this is you mad bro yeah like those are so dumb but we've got but we've gotten dumber okay because those might be stupid those might be stupid but like we have had some pretty the beam of the month is yankee with no brim that makes no [ __ ] sense but it's hilarious oh no okay uh you know how i know i've gotten dumber like you remember like when you're like 13 14 and you would get in the deep depths of youtube and it was something called youtube poop and it was like literally like mario youtube like they're asking and like well here's the thing back then i used to be like that is so dumb i don't understand it's just loud noises like like colors and stuff and now i see that i'm like that is the funniest thing i've ever seen like over noise like i'm like like dude spiderman poops are the [ __ ] best they make no see but the best part about poops is like the people who make them will make poop stories out of it so like the story will like see okay but you understand like the deep fried story essence of it i just see the loud noises and the that kind of thing and i was like that's funny yeah that's pretty true i mean someone literally turned spider-man 2 into a whole youtube poop but it turned from spider-man 2 and by the end of the movie it was spider-man lord of the rings it was tight all right is this like one of those like anime dubbed things where they totally changed the story no the entire the entirety of the movie was just youtube poop memes but they somehow managed to like start putting lord of the rings [ __ ] and by the end like peter parker is like frodo and and and the dude it was so it was tight as [ __ ] i'm just gonna see and we came down we came that from like funnyjunk.com and getting yeah we came from umad bro to i'm trying to think of like my first meme like like before a meme was called a meme like you know what i mean like do you remember like because all of us have tried do you ever remember like a meme that you tried to make like you were like oh that shit's hilarious and you tried to make a meme oh dude i ha i have i could link you right now my funny junk account from oh no like 2010 and it has some banger posts on there like hold on let me see if i can find it it's a it's a it's robert it's like a national treasure i think is like yup i found it yes sir yep robert is dope is for some reason my account name i mean it's just oh my god all right let's see what we got here we have to log into funnyjunk though that's the problem so like i don't have an account i don't either level 150 content faptastic was that even yeah hey i used to grind i remember i got i got i got front page uh one day i get i it's called dogs at war it's hilarious it's totally repost none of it is that guy none of it is oc what you're like your entire account g3 you sprinkle some in no there's no ocean oh you're that guy there's no oc like where did all that that that e-cloud get you [Music] nothing i mean that's the one thing i don't get with like people who like like karma farm and stuff on like reddit like people buy accounts with karma i don't get it there's literally no value there's nothing i don't get it but people are like obsessed with these these fake points dude i i can't even oh i never even thought about that like meme said cause i feel like twitter is just the meme emporium now like of just organic memes i've never even like like who actually like goes to meme sites now though uh people like robert is dope like dedicated meme sites i feel like there's so many social media outlets that do it for us you know oh you don't need to put an email to create an account you can literally just like make a smurf username 1300 upvotes i got i owned i ate uploaded january 28 2011. that reminds me did you guys ever uh see our dream team hashtag back in the day like back in d1 and on funnyjunk like it was actually our people made some memes about us like a lot of them yeah oh man they were really funny too if you clicked that link that's what got me front page um i was so happy what about this cartoon network one oh that got me from page two that yeah that one has more uploads oh yeah it does dang that was a banger one was a nice repos i see here uh no no that that one's oc the cartoon network one that's oh really wow cartoon network is oc that's oc johnny bravo f yeah curse the curvy dog f yeah it's so n eddie f yeah dexter's laboratory if yeah but it's i'm right though cartoon cartoon fridays the good old days 1992 to 2004 now to the what is this this is a gigantic meme too what the dude okay so that's like classic right i cringe at that i can't believe i posted that's like class oh it dude that looks so bad yo like god i hate myself see that's like classic but look at you know what's worse you'd go to the ones that didn't pop off all right like those are the really bad ones do i want to like french and young cat irl how many well i want to see like if there's ways like how many posts you've made for audio listeners long story short you're not missing much yeah it's just like terrible memes that i like tried to have pop off see so we went from that which kind of relevant memes that like had like some like they had something to do with it mayor's proposal epic and literally from that to where we are now i literally made this meme like a month ago oh really that we went from this to that like from that to this now a 2005 mitsubishi evolution eighth generation it's like that we've gone to rage to literally a comic picture of a mitsubishi 2005 evolution eighth generation and it literally just says that yeah so this is without a doubt a 2005 mitsubishi 8th generation mr gsr ct 98 2.0 leader for g6 inline four engineers six speed close ratio gearbox vortex generator there's that because yeah i clicked on your cartoon network and it speaks to memes now because i was like or you're you're like dogs at war i was like reading a few panels like how long is this and it's like scrolling scrolling scroll it's like a novel yeah memes of see memes have evolved now where it's like that's it that's all you need it's like a story it's like a second or two it's not much reading involved sometimes this is dumb audio clip see but there's like we've gotten dumber it goes from like long form memes and now we just have like a single picture of like shrek and then like at the bottom it's just f you better like just like sometimes not even font it's just like deep fried or something but like you can see a picture of a sad track and all it says is f but you understand that shrek paying respects because of a call of duty game that had f as it's a lot of layers it's like an ogre my personal favorite are like just like the text ones that are just [ __ ] stupid here like this one i'm gonna post it they're just [ __ ] stupid they're just stupid i don't want to catch oh oh my god i don't want to catch feelings i want to catch a comeback what is that like it's nicki minaj and like i think what is a tiara but they're sims caricatures and balenciaga and they're all like they're all like stretched and skewed there's some guy some dominatrix dog truly is like a deep fried meme we went from like terrible 1990s like graphic design to like in the 2000s and the 2010s and being like we kind of we want to make our memes kind of high quality so like back to like now we're in the 20 now we're 20 20 and we're like how can we make like a shitty 1990s windows xp comic if it's not low quality it's not worth it i remember when i first heard meme i pronounced it mimi i was like what is a mimi and i was like oh that's what like that is that's a meme so like and then like that's when you learn and then like that's when a whole door memes opens up you know what else is a really good meme what evo online 2020. that's actually a really good segue that was a good segue i was i was [ __ ] i was i was going to let the meme talk like go a little longer like right before peter stop moments well played yes evo online 2020 for those unaware evo is the evolution something i don't know what the rest of it is it's a fighting tournament and evolutionary no it's no okay just i don't know bacon yep evolutionary vacant everyone's favorite tournament series it's huge it's um always hosted in las vegas and like the summers but obviously currently things are a little different in the world and because of this uh they obviously can't hold giant tournament held in las vegas so they're going online but because of this there's a lot of drama because they've dropped a lot of games that would normally be huge for them because online is trash yeah the games that they dropped it's because all their online is trash ruins the competitive integrity and then on top of that nobody wants to watch troubleshooting issues and people complaining about this or that because of lag blah blah blah i'm one of those being super smash brothers ultimate and everybody's super upset spaghetti about that although understandably it's not there okay wait they're they're upset at evo for not having her or upset at nintendo that like where is the blame being i mean definitely on both yeah like some people can't you have it so so the main problem with nintendo's online which you can honestly you can't blame me though i i i say both but you really can't blame evo nintendo online's really bad uh you look at animal crossing that's like probably the most high tech their online has ever been good it's not bad and but then it's like bad when it should be a game as simple as animal crossings it should be seen exactly you should have to please wait your yeah and then they want to leave please exit your window someone else wants to show up please that's like oh my god my expectations are already so low i'm like this isn't bad hey this is progress hey nintendo good job yeah i mean it's obvious they got rid of it because smash online is just an absolute joke and i don't know if you guys have been watching like the quarantine series stuff i have no idea with moist crystals whole thing and alpha reds and yeah it's been bad it's there's been so many times where people will just drop like the connection will just drop and they have to restart yeah well and then like and you know how it's bad it's like no other game franchise or like has been i mean they have it a little bit but you're able to still hold like cs go has a major coming up here in like i think a week and they've been holding it over like online and they've been able to do it because like it's not how it is in smash at all and can actually hold a stable kind of connection rather than mario jumping up like this and a lot of pulleys and levers back there but let me reassure you the fighters are not experiencing any of this lag at all they're like terrible part of what wants evo to host uh smash because then it would be bad and then maybe nintendo would get a grip and understand that they need to fix this i doubt it yeah unfortunately not purely because nintendo has never put any money themselves into promoting like the smash competitive scene like it's like once once it the only time they ever like actually promote it is when they do like when they're promoting the new game and they're like oh let's get some smash pros in here and play our game but that's about the extent of how far they go so it's pretty depressing uh especially for ultimate because ultimate is their current game i know people are like mad because like melee doesn't get support but it's like bailey's never needed support it's not that's left this isn't they can't make money off i understand that like i've gotten to that point but ultimately like promote by promoting the ultimate scene and like selling your own gamecube controllers for the pro scene or yeah could you imagine just like if they uh if they treated it like how riot treats league or something like that like if there was like a set a summer set and all that kind of stuff it'd be sweet smash is like easily the most viewed fighting game by far uh on twitch like easily so it's kind of you would think that it would think maybe maybe street fighters close if you were to if you were to inve if nintendo were to invest into smash i mean that there's no no mistaking that smash would be easily the biggest of all the fighting games monetary wise and i just like how capcom does it with street fighter i don't understand it like maybe i mean it just makes so much money dude as nintendo that they just don't care that's what honestly that's it nintendo is just raking it in especially right now last year for evo ultimate was their most entered game such like tournament bracket ever and then it would have very well probably been this year as well easily easily but of course we would have entered because we were going well i mean if it was online i also would have if they'd done it i would have done yeah i mean i wouldn't why not like 15 bikes or there say hey i played emo sure but yeah i wanted to go too obviously bummer but they're missing out on that fact and i'm sure evo's not happy about that like they would have wanted it but there's no way they could there's no integrity if they were to do the online dude i think they knew that that it would literally like make their tournament look like a [ __ ] joke i mean there's the worst thing is i've been trying to watch these like wi-fi attorneys they're doing like blue was talking about and they have like lag tests and in the middle of a match someone would go like hey like i think like there's some lag here so then like all right hold on we got to do a lag test so then like spectator to leave so you're watching a stream for like 15 minutes while they do nothing and then they have to individually test each user get different people from different servers like lag testing people and then come back and go yeah it's okay or in some cases they've been like yeah this person had too much pain so like they're disqualified but and you're sitting here right tournaments like this this is so stupid or people just do it to stall sometimes or they'll lose and be like a lag test and it just it's just a nightmare like behind like logistically a nightmare it's just a bummer because it's like i think part of the reason why smash is so popular too is it's super easy to watch and on top of that so many people including myself years ago when i first watched smash competitive for the first time i'd played smash before but never realized that level existed so for a lot of people they first off have an understanding they're like oh yeah i played smash once or here and there at my friend's house they already understand that there's not i mean the nuances get deep obviously like for pro play and stuff but on the onset you're just like oh yeah okay like just hit him off the stage this is okay and you don't have to understand like intense uh button combinations or high level blocks and all that kind of stuff so it has a lot going for it uh but all nintendo has to do is not have terrible internet and that's exactly what they have so well that's not and it's like what servers technically well yeah whatever net code and whatever they want they just don't have like their services i mean nintendo what is it a hamster and a wheel money that's all [ __ ] sure their online is like it's taped together with like a hint of like glue and wd-40 little elmer's well little elmer's a little little little higher the pipes are leaking like it's fine this is good just put some more cement glue on it let's get the tape get the duct tape get the pullers and levies the players aren't feeling this no i've saved the duck so what games are in evo well not smash no smash i think they did well so they they announced some too that will be like exhibition matches and stuff like dragon ball fighterz will be there but not in like the tournament capacity because again it's online a lot of people um dislike i know one of them for sure is like grand blue fantasy verses yeah i see it right here uh under knight in birth dragon ball fighterz tekken 7 street fighter champions edition soul calibur i don't even think street fighter is a part of it either because their online is pretty bad it says street fighter 5 champion edition i think that's just a part of the game and then samurai showdown and grand blue fantasy v-net or versus um trying to figure it out introducing evo online five weekends of fighting games what though yeah it's like a whole it's like the whole month of july um like one week it's this game in this game the other week it's this one in this one because what i'd seen was like what um like leffen had said um says yes so evo online is not including ultimate street fighter 5 tekken or dragon ball fighterz because of their net code and that's pretty big i mean those are big titles i mean why is it fighting games that just have trash connection like well the problem is like they probably have as good of like let's say they they they might even have better let's say servers than like modern warfare which probably isn't that hard because their tick rate is terrible but the difference is the input lag and stuff can make such a big difference in a fighting game when it's like that then versus a shooting game um like fighting games especially like combo oriented fighting games like if the game has input lag and doesn't read your combos when it should or you can't react especially in like a fighting game when it's all frame data you have like 15 frames to react to a move but if you have x amount of input lag by the time you see a move and you try to input to account for that like you can't even um it's like it's like a like uh probably the best comparison is like mouse acceleration like the reason you people turn off mass acceleration is because in shooters you people everyone does i turn off i don't know what you're doing everyone turns off acceleration because mass acceleration messes with you know if you move your mouse this many inches you if your mouse accessory exists so acceleration if your mouse acceleration is on uh every single time you move your mouse a certain amount of inches you can always like your mouse will always go a different distance on your screen whereas with mouse acceleration is off every single time you move your mouse pointing to point d you know that your mouse is going to be right at this specific spot on your monitor so with lag it's like you you're basically playing a game with mouse acceleration on where offline you know exactly what your input's going to do how it's going to do it and it's reliable whereas an online it's like if i press this button just to frame off online oh well now i [ __ ] up oh geez i can't well i can't press it down all the combos oh god that's why like the meta for fighting games especially like super smash brothers the tier list is different for like totally different like land versus online online it's that it's more punishing in the fact that like you don't have as much time to react or it's harder to react sometimes it's harder to pull off uh low percent combos like a squirtle for instance um on land can really consistently hit his like grab chain down air whatever like low percent which is combos which is like a three-frame perfect combo like you have to be on it to be able to land the squirtle grab chains but then you go online and it's like nothing's wait they're always getting out of the combo so that's why like heavies um and why so many people like at the beginning game like like k reels busted which he wasn't but it one people were getting used to him and two because of online like ike and um cloud and um sonic and some of these other people that can either put out heavy hits um fast enough that you can't react like ganondorf uh that can be so punishing on there just have like giant hitboxes for their moves in general yeah that helps too yeah giant hitbox just like ganondorf swings sword like yeah they'll probably fall into it or like i'll probably hit a mod czar and so it like literally like a game like smash it is night and day between online and offline yeah just because like dvd is like near bottom tier like on lan but like he's like tippity top tier on wi-fi like there is clearly discrepancy between lan and online so long story short is i'll still watch it whatever they have i always enjoy watching fighting game tournaments but certainly won't be the same and of all the things i want to come back and quarantine it would one probably be like there's probably smallest gym movie theater sports and with that i'd say esports and that's it like i want my smash attorneys back i need to be doing oak i mean it just seems to be the fighting game they're suffering the most yeah yeah because everybody seems to be adapting i mean league is doing their thing you know what else is adapting this this dad oh he did it he did that was cool and welcome back to gg over easy we didn't even know what episode it was episode 37 at 37 yeah we're on cnn i can't ever watch cnn so i wasn't too sure about that one i mean yeah at that age i got it was just like this is the new set oh yeah cnn and then when i got to like 45 that no 44 was spike and then 45 was the weather channel don't ask me how i remember this and then like 41 was tnt i watched a lot of television as a kid so i feel like we can fighting a lot i feel like we can safely go into how we feel about ps5 and xbox one stuff this week oh ex is that what it's called the xbox one x well xbox one series that or xbox series is one x x something like that yeah seriously it looks like your uh xfinity router looks like an intensity router like if you look up the one like they give you when you get boost that's what it looks like oh yeah did we because i don't think we talked about it in the last episode because i don't know if like the xbox show that was like after we recorded right yeah it was like but absolute bots it i don't know why they like it's they were so excited about it and they were like they're like witnessed the future of gaming and then it was like no first parties oh yeah like i think they're saving it all probably for june or july but then why not just save the whole thing until june yeah why even do a big reveal of like oh look at the games coming to xbox one like this is like our first look at games and i was like oh he gave us like like the worst year ever so like can you give us something like don't be wrong tight games but like why would you reveal these when you could just wait for like a big reveal because their big reveal has to be infinite it's going to be infinite their big reveal is that it can handle 30 frames per second oh did you ah dude did you see the volcano we were like yo so like what could we expect from valhalla on xbox 30 frames and they're like oh yeah like i saw 30 frames yeah look at it they tried to they they tried to like play it off too where they were like straight up like oh yeah a stable 30 frames it's like oh it's like oh stable is that that okay that's not 120 no that the fact that we're we're going in the next gen and we're it that sounds like console players still aren't going to have 60 on games they can have 16. i'm fighting for you console players for you with the specs of ps5 and xbox one there's no reason why you shouldn't have 60 it's just for some reason game devs have like games i think it's i think it's more the console manufacturers like sony and microsoft really want to push this whole 4k thing oh my oh bro here's the thing too like console players i'm not here to make fun of you because listen most of you have never actually played 60. and i know for a lot of you it's like dude i don't i don't like it's just my heart will forever be with consoles you know yeah it's just a couple of frames like it's not that big of a deal but trust me once you play 60 plus you know and then you go back to 30 anytime you're like oh i understand now and that's why like even if these new games have to take a little graphical fidelity loss it's so much more worth it for 60 frames sorry there's no reason your game should be playing at 30 fps and unless you're like okay though i need 24k i like my dad unless i'm seeing like [ __ ] like cyberpunk level [ __ ] yeah that's awesome okay 30 is fine i don't know if my pc will get it better not be 30 frames on pc i'll tell you that locked at 30 fps on pc i well the other thing that disappointed me about the xbox was i was watching for the valhalla because they're like watch for the gameplay reveal yeah oh there was okay and it was pretty much just like it might as well just been like screenshots in engine or whatever and like okay well waste of my time all right going back to editing i used to get like so excited for like that all stuff is rendered in engine and it's like and then like you're like so just show me the gameplay please like yeah the engine engine was cool for a while but now it's like no different than like cut scene if i see if anthem has ruined it for me you know like anthem was supposed to be the sickest thing ever and it was the biggest piece of garbage ever given to us so it's just like an anthem looked so sick it's still such a pretty game but man games lie to you all the time that's why like unless it's explicitly like this is in this is gameplay and engine never trust what you see because most of the time if i watch something now and it's like a cut scene or like it's like a cinematic uh trailer i'm like nope i mean cool story like for valhalla i was like okay cool vikings cool sure now what's the game like now do you say the same thing for unreal engine 5 then well see that but that wasn't a cinematic that was literally a demo made like that's a playable demo it's a tech demo made in engine can we play it probably not i'm probably not but i mean you would need at least a ps5 they really think about those unreal tech demos is they're designed to show you like what's probably like a couple years ahead of time yeah and it's more like games that are like 20 20 like six ish like yeah i mean probably maybe even more like unreal engine demos are there specifically to show off how capable the engine can be and usually to get like those results they don't have like our usual like consumer computer sitting on our desks they have like that's true they have a lean as tech tips once yeah the difference so for those unaware so aside from xbox one series x whatever doing like a reveal of some titles coming most of them not i don't think any of them were first party actually um sports oh yeah like dirt or something uh so i i mean maybe there are some games that are that really interesting so and please don't hit me with the xbox it's not about the games it's about the user experience what the hell does that even mean it's all about the games everything's about the games the user experience what does that even mean get out of here kyle yeah we know it isn't user experience the games to now to be fair because i don't want like in the comments being like you know they're just a bunch of like ps5 fanboys we don't have anything on the ps5 to judge i'm also the keyblade holder true sony hasn't revealed anything but i'm just saying if it's gonna be better yeah i think let's see my main problem with microsoft is how they always handle something they do xbox 360 they marketed the [ __ ] out of that so couldn't find one incredible marketing and ever since xbox one and then to xbox one x the marketing has just been like well dude the xbox 360 just like it just steadily got worse like the dashboard got worse and like everything's like slowly got worse and then when the xbox one came out everything and still it blows my mind when i played on an xbox one that like when you open up your friends it has to open up like an entirely new like app and then like load your friends list and then you have to close your friends list app and then it is so dumb i hate that dashboard still to this day more than anything well they're like we're bringing windows 10 like uh block ui or whatever that was like no one ever please god no like no no one didn't work on your phones it's not going to work on your computer like please bro oh they want to put what like android had no because windows has a phone windows phone oh they even even worse i don't know if how that's doing anymore but yeah they had that do you have a windows phone or was that a name no all right um it's good to have you on the iphone gang now hey so xbox one had their little display nothing was super crazy and then recently like yesterday i believe playstation 5 or more so i guess epic games showed a tech demo of unreal engine 5 running on ps5 supposedly showing what next gen is capable of as well as their new engine and it's pretty impressive stuff and for people watching it though that don't understand game design or game engine or game programming like a lot of it will be like i don't understand essentially though it means that game fidelity wise like um it can handle so much more especially when it comes to polygons now the thing though is kind of like what we briefly mentioned like this was all made specifically for this literally the creators of the engine made this they wanted to show it off as best they can so there was like a tweet for instance from like the art director of god of war i was like yeah that's cool but like good luck making the game fidelity like that for 30 plus hours of gameplay or something like that so even though it might be capable of that being able to create the resources and stuff if you handle that for like a third needed yeah to like fill 30 plus hours of gameplay like god of war would just be an insane undertaking one way or the other but the promise is like with the new engine as with all other stuff like games are getting better slowly and slowly like um a lot of the lighting systems uh environment sound all that kind of stuff unreal engine 5 is going to improve upon but most importantly dude fortnight is moving to it next year that's the big takeaway let's go dude what do you think it says about destiny the game if destiny 2 is going to be on next-gen consoles we're not getting d3 we're not going to d3 for like another three years is my guess yeah if not more because i i don't think d2 needs to i think d2s are great he doesn't need to be on next-gen consoles we don't need d3 though at all honestly i think this is probably better for d3 because imagine if bungie made d3 for next gen like 72 all over the beginning of the year like they would have had they would have had to keep behind they would have made d3 for last gen consoles too so 100 would have so this is probably better for yeah they'll do what they did before and eventually sunset it because the sun said it went like rise of iron yeah the sunset means it just like rides off into the sunset well yeah they kind of they leave it like they didn't tend to like shut the servers down but let's take it out back and shot it essentially and but in nature okay those are those servers aren't shut down i do that every day dude it's like i go back in 40 days remember this is what i'm thinking about that i've been thinking about going back and like starting like a new character and just playing the okay i'm sorry but i'm just saying i was thinking about it okay okay please still play final fantasy i'd rather have you i just know i would go back though and someone who cares about you i'd go back though and the quality of life changes and stuff like even though d2 isn't perfect they're like just small quality life changes that have 100 better game now yeah but like i just imagine going into patrol and immediately trying to find a map and going oh right oh that's right or i can't see my friend i can't fast travel as like oof um so even just small things like that but i mean it's just from the topic of d2 hey we might as well be drama well guess what today boys and girls we've got steaming piping hot tea because this was a little bit in destiny 2. let's start with a negative sandwich because there's two bad things and one good thing okay let's start with the bad thing there's this new quest for fell winter's live oh monkey cool shotgun this is supposed to be an iron banner weapon and you would think huh if we're gonna do that this is the cool community event let's do let's do like based on how many kills people get like in our like collectively we have to get all these kills in iron banner before everyone gets the fellow winters lie no they instead decide to put progress bar for the entire community on how many public events we complete on each planet and it's not like a small amount of public events it's like a lot an ungodly amount to make things worse it got so bad because after the first day they didn't even get to 10 on one this is this quest supposed to be done in a week after one day they didn't even get past i don't even think they got like to like eight percent after 24 hours on the first day [ __ ] them and like and like nessus and uh the other two plants were still at one percent so it got so bad bungie was like a so like we're like lowering the requirements and like increasing the percent per public events and also we're making the public events easier it's like no it's not that it's nobody wants to do that right nobody wants to farm for this pvp shotgun by doing pve events not only i mean the kicker for me is that they're throwing this in towards the end of the season after everyone's already had to play the only new activity that there was anyway that was a public event so now you're going to throw it in after all this like like after the guardian games grind public events since the beginning of the season i'm not going to do it for another week and a lot in a week a lot in a week so i don't understand they're thinking i don't like there has to be a underlying reason they did that or not people like do they want to boost their public event numbers or something more than it's like it's slightly tone-deaf because there's so much like divide in like who plays pve and who plays pvp especially after this season now because bungie has been like oh which glutes better play trials but i'm just like but bungie i don't want trials and bungie's like no you love trial you love it okay so they do this whole pvp oriented season but then they're like hey so we know you guys like cool pvp shotguns what if you farmed a pve public event which is like that's definitely going to get the pvp dudes to play pve 100 oh yeah i don't know man well anyways so that sounds bad now let's talk about the good this week so bungie had a really good this week of bungie this week actually one of their best this week's bungees rob you're actually going to like this a lot i know but like dude it's like how many good at this week that bungees have we had but this is one of you but this this week a bunch of actually addresses when you're some of your most biggest of all complaints um admittedly i think a lot of people like over blue this twab as like the second coming of jesus yes i saw a lot of like d2 youtubers like this is going to change everything it's going to change a lot i've heard this but this also isn't going to suddenly make d2 like the premier mmo uh like wow these this game is the most rewarding moment of all time i'd rather fish in final fantasy fishing in final fantasy is tight but i've been doing it for the past 10 hours i bankrupted myself a million gill to get myself the optimal fish okay anyways destiny 2 so uh destiny is finally gonna have like true transmog uh they we don't know when it might be this fall they said they don't have like a timetable but they said this is what they're working on uh they said they're having transmog that's good you have the option to turn any of your armor pieces into an ornament which is super tight should have been there since a thing yeah but they made armor 3.0 instead of making like ornaments from everest i should just be like oh i'll dismantle this armor and turn it into an ornament should have been there from the start but it's super tight that's coming uh and i'm super excited for it uh they also have added new uh aspirational pursuits for armor for like raids or like uh uh trials or what does that mean i'm assuming strikes period so rob this means there's going to be ornaments exotic ornaments uh exotic sparrows uh exotic ships uh all not necessarily just exotic but like different stuff like that they're gonna be part of activities and raids now freedom good so like hypothetically speaking what should happen you know how like they put all the trials ornaments and stuff in eververse i thought that was so [ __ ] up that they didn't yeah so now that i mean that's stupid but hypothetically the system we're talking about now it should be that now yes you get that stuff from trials oh you're not going to get some random sparrow that has nothing to do with the season at all that hasn't like looks nothing like it at all so yeah so it's super tight because they said none of those things no ships no ghost shells sparrows or arm ornaments uh none of those are going to be that's good uh in every verse so well not necessarily that none of them but like none of them are like clearly like clearly visually based like the trials [ __ ] in everest they said there's not going to be anything like that anymore so i don't hate eververse i just hate how currently how predatory it is in this sense yeah 100 just how they have the trials of osiris ornament like i have to pay 600 for this like this is what i should get from trials like as a random drop maybe people play it more yeah super tight uh they said they're going to be adding a new weapon pursuit each season which is cool but is that like recluse and stuff yeah but we we're not getting pinnacles back no we're definitely not getting so we're going we went from three pinnacles to or yeah three pinnacles to some rituals to no rituals back to one ritual basically one ritual season which is okay this is this is like kind of like a really weird flex for me personally because i mean this is still a downgrade from what we had before yeah um but they the cool part is they made it to where you can get it from playing whatever playlist you want so you can play strikes crucible gambit if you want and you can get the pursuit everything you choose and so that's cool being able to choose what you want to do pretty tight and then the legendary skin specifically for it will be tied to actually playing the game not adverse anymore still pretty sick um uh they said that they're also kind of a weird thing uh they said each year they're gonna be adding a new armor set to crucible gambit and strikes um okay tight but this isn't like great because every other mmo that you guys are aspiring to be does that like every couple months like times eight bro yeah i mean they usually do vendor resets all the time yeah i mean but there's no really unfortunately there's no point to do vendor resets with arbor being like super vanity based now that's tight because that gives them something to give us like new arbor sick like something to make my garden look tighter dope it's cool that they want fashion to be more of an end game so that's cool but like one new playlist armor set a year is kind of whack interesting i wasn't gonna say whack but interesting because will it's because this is a lot less than we usually got um other type thing they said they were adding easier ways for you to get bright dust uh so it's not gonna be as difficult as it is to like could you guys honestly say right now like a reliable way for you guys to get bright dust like as just a casual player i don't know how my wall no clue right exactly other than getting something that's from the eververse store no clue exactly right i just gave them my credit card the three digits on the back you actually can't get brightness from dismantling stuff from everest now so yeah but see you don't need bright dust if you just buy with silver smart man youtube honey we out here um so going forward they're going to make it easier for you to get bright dust um they're making bright ingrams more relevant so instead of being like a whole year old you pride ingrams will start like getting stuff from like seasons prior uh it's pretty tight for the most part this is all sick but the sickest thing is that every verse is gonna have less of a role that's good uh they wanted more ever stuff to be like actually in the loophole which is how it should have been because that's exactly how i was in d1 yeah uh so it's super tight i think that's super sick i like all of this uh i i'm trying to temper my expectations because they didn't say this is coming out with the expansion they said this is coming out kind of whenever it's ready yep cool tight guardian games best event of all time we loved it bro the statue can we i saw a picture of that so you killed all in the corner oh that was sick oh i thought i was talking about pg's picture oh no like so titans won they're like they're like whichever class wins for the next year whatever will have like a statue to like immortalize them in the tower or whatever oh yeah where is it it's right next to zavala and it's on like a two foot table like a little little like you would think it's like a nightstand and the statue itself is not even like a foot high you think they'd like at least put it like next to the postmaster or eververse no and like at least be relatively large you know something like i don't care that it's a titan that one because obviously i didn't care who won in anyway whoever won that's what they get is some like rinky dinky little that's like there it's amazing just how many ways they messed up guardians look at the discord like look at this picture i'm posting in there it's yeah and and the majority of what you're seeing right there is just the table like the white table like it's it's bizarre it hurts well that's one good positive now let's get into the bad this got really big in the community this uh i'm lying this thing get big in the community this guy big in like the five people who play pvp community in destiny 2 uh i don't know why this got like such a big deal so uh dmg made this tweet about how uh toxicity kind of prevents people from really participating in pvp activities uh which is not wrong right because jesus christ like d2 community they take pvp like really seriously which is like kind of a weird champ yeah i do chill with it but all at the same time it's like it's kind of um yeah so so i agree d2 community has gotten pretty weird over the years especially with like how seriously things get taken uh the argument was that tea bagging is super hurtful to people's feelings now i'm not gonna lie that's a weird channel i like dropping a couple nuts on people every once in a while too i do enjoy dropping my fat nuts on someone who hits me with like just oh go ahead something something disgusting like someone's playing striker titan i'm going to teabag you because you're playing striker biden it's trigger titan all right like that's stupid i'm probably going to drop my nuts on you but that's like that's like you're a terrible person because you do that you're the spy you're a gatekeeper you're awful this this brought out a lot of very hot takes from people which i don't even need to go over because i i have my say in this and i i i had a whole thing right now i swear to you like i just to somebody's tweet i had a whole thing written out and i just deleted it all and i just heard i disagree like i had a whole thing written out oh that's all you need to say and it had like one slash question mark but then i was just like no way like like i can't be bothered but like all right like i am a known tea bagger and it's not because i'm a terrible person or i [ __ ] spite people and i just like making people angry it's just that i'm better than you okay sorry that all right get good at teabag me back and guess what when you t bag me back you're gonna get me mad and guess what you want to do make me mad so guess what get better and teabag me there you go you want to make that person make if you want to make how the person who tea bagged you make you feel how you do go do it to them like that that i don't that's just how i feel about it the thing i understand is teabagging has been around like forever this isn't some brand new thing yeah and if someone's like i don't play pvp because i get tea bagged well then you shouldn't be playing pvp you shouldn't play pvp in any game i don't play pvp because i shouldn't be playing video games like it's you shouldn't read other things that don't agree with your opinion you shouldn't go outside you shouldn't like you should just like like you should just it's just tea bagging it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things it's t-bag you got your feelings hurt if it somehow gave an edge like emo peeking does i'd say t-bag a problem but today it's harmless it would just be a bigger issue than tea bagging it tea bagging most of the time the only thing it does is actually just get you killed because you're you're just sitting out in the open tea bagging like i am i don't know and i'm sorry you getting tea bag and then going out and complaining you got tea bagged in a public space literally is doing exactly what that guy wants you to do i'm sorry that's exactly you're playing literally into their hand it's literally a tea bag and you go oh okay i'm moving on if you get upset by the tea bag that's what we want we want you to get mad by the tea bag that's what i want when i t-bag somebody i want them to get tilted i want them to go tweet about what just happened i want them to tweet about their experience if they don't do that then it's like oh then i didn't get what i wanted so don't give them what they want just go play the game if they t bag you i don't know crank 90 and fortnite real quick on your other monitor i don't know so i i mean i don't disagree with any of that um and i've been i mean i simultaneously i agree with the sentiment like don't be a dick on the internet but i don't think teabag is like the primary reason you should be like oh dude i think if you take it again if you take it a step further and message somebody on their account and like you're pushing yeah that's taking it too far but like that that's being a piece of [ __ ] and being toxic now a tea bag i wouldn't put that in the same realm as that i mean what's the difference between tea bagging if you kill someone like emoting after you emoting exactly that's all the same i think this more came from a place of being a community manager is really [ __ ] hard right absolutely you're never making anybody you will never like you can never be perfect people will always flame you for something so uh i could definitely see and you're the face of the company unfortunately even though you don't have your hands and said part of game i can see the point of view because ultimately i think the moral of the story was don't be a dick on d2 because it's d2 um it turned into the whole tea bagging argument people had some really hot takes anywhere from if you tea bag your toxic [ __ ] head who and your parents never loved you uh two i mean you're right like something like two to anywhere from uh if i teabag you or if you t beg me i'm gonna ddos you because you deserve it because tea bagging is tight or some [ __ ] or oh honestly all of this the fact that this turned into a long drawn out conversation about tea bagging and its effects on the psych just kind of showed me man one i need to stop looking at destiny 2 pvp twitter because it's the worst and two this is why i log on like once or twice a week and like do a couple raids and then i get off and then i live my life happily without playing pvp because bro like why why does this turn into like such a big thing over nothing and honestly the answer is because there's nothing else going on in d2 and people need something to talk about has nothing to do take it out on something it's kind of like that um go jerk off go play final fantasy 14. that's just tight right now like i hope people don't think like for the people that like hate tea i hope you don't think i'm a bad person because i tea bag i'm not tea bagging somebody because i think like i'm better person than they are and i want to make them mad or i'm a piece of [ __ ] person who hates people and hates happiness i'm just doing it because i killed them and i and i feel superior in that moment just kill me back and tea bag me back okay you want to there it is you want to piss off a tea bagger go tea bag them and 100 i guarantee you 100 times out of a hundred if you if you tea bag the tea bagger you will get a message back saying you're a pc you suck at this game and guess what they're mad now and now they're mad and they're like you're not even good and then you just did exactly what they did to you and now you feel better so just do that that would be my recommendation because i used to be that tea bagger but now i just do it just to do it yeah so my overall take is it's it's destiny 2 pvp it's nobody cares that much um i've been bagging for 11 years dude i'm not gonna stop now because my feelings are hurt i think it's all a bit bizarre and you shouldn't take that seriously it's like a black mirror episode it's just like uh it's just a weird take to say like that's the reason people don't play pvp or like it's a weird take to like for i mean it's kind of a weird take yeah for sure but then it's also even weirder that this got blown out into a whole argument of pro tea baggers versus anti-tea baggers and it's like what am i what am i reading okay wait can you guys state state your position right now i am pro tea bagging it's okay to tea bag if you're doing it if you don't take it to the messaging like it don't don't be that's but that's different that's not tea bagging that that's not tea bagging like i don't want i don't want that line to get confused this is what i think i don't care tea bags don't d-bag there you go i'm tea bagging neutral yeah like you're teabagging neutral it's part it's part of it's part of it but like it's just tea bagging yeah because 100 of the time the person who's teabagging gets tilted by people who teabag them so just t bag them back and then they'll be tilted too that's i mean yeah the only the only time i usually bag someone is if they bag me like i'll teabag someone like if they're crouch shotting you know like oh look i can craft a whole bunch too like that's really the only time i do it but that's the exact same thing just to get back if somebody otherwise might wear and like um same thing with like i equate it to to like just don't let it bother you like um when i'm on the road like driving and stuff and you know somebody will do something stupid or honk or do something whatever like claire will get so angry and she'll think about it and sit on it for a while i know a lot of people do and i can't believe like like let's say i was like we're driving and some guy honks behind us i'm stupid right i know a lot of people get like upset about that or like yeah like sit on it for a while and she'll mention it like 10 minutes later it's like wait what i like i don't even like that happen and then i and then i just get right past it that's how like i take tea bagging myself and if it upsets you that much that's what the right you need to take it's like it happened okay and it's gone i already forgot about it there's no point in like what rob said like dwelling on it like the only thing you're doing is doing exactly what they want you to do yeah just don't don't worry about it and if it does upset you that much you just just don't play a game where you can get tea bagged yeah you shouldn't be playing it then listen i have a confession to make there's something i really do dwell on and that's this ad this next ad review and welcome back gg over easy um after our usual talks of recent events and drama and whatnot there always seems to be some destiny drama we uh we head into some patreon questions for this episode um and then ideally we hop into some food because your boys hungry and i feel like a lot of our listeners are too you know you know what i'm hungry for these patreon questions hit him with us this content we have uh juau pedro barth what do you say to me uh has a question says did one of you guys ever get so mad while recording that you ever just had to stop for example when arios killed fruit uh and everyone in pub g and fruit almost lost it i remember when rob did and i still have i don't know if i have the clip anymore i think i deleted the clip because it's like impressive one no not that was one of gtt they would just drop innocent traitor weapons and then the innocent they were like uh i was the traitor but then i dropped the rocket launcher for ab and then ab was an innocent and then he became a traitor it was like this whole new wild wild west see that was that was probably being dork's fault because well it was not your fault but we but we gave people the idea we did it like once and then suddenly it was fair game for every lawyer no but that's okay that's how you guys play ttt like i can expect the wacky things from door but when everybody's doing it then it's like there's no there's no structure there's no rules and um so i remember i was a trainer i was like i was a traitor and i was like [ __ ] yeah like i just got traitor like finally like i haven't been it's one of those like ctt nights where you don't it's innocent innocent innocent innocent innocent and it's just like oh so it was one of those nights i wasn't there for that episode and i just remember seeing the dream team dms and and i think i think bless was just like hey yo amigo sorry uh i hope that was so sweet i hope i didn't make you guys better from that session and rob just responds with it's fine bless smiley face yeah so like what happened was it's when you know it was probably like two and a half three hours into this ttc slice we had been grinding like back in the day like when we did a tt session we just didn't do an hour we used to do like three hours and then get like five or six episodes like in those like three hours normally and so we're like super far into it everyone's tired and or at least i am and i'm traitor and ab is the traitor so at one point i'm like walking next to a traitor and i just blow up and it says i was killed by an innocent but i i was killed by a rocket launcher because i saw it fly through so i'm like why the [ __ ] did i die so like i'm typing in the chat i'm like rocket launcher to me like oh no bless it was me and blessed and i was like great because he gave abs yeah i was like great uh bless just rocket launcher me i was like why so like bless like wins the round and bless goes yeah versus like my dude as i'm his traitor and i'm like i'm like bless why are you saying like yeah like ad he goes yeah firstly he's like i gave ab a rocket launcher and like they was like what and then you just you're like why are we like and then he's like and then like bless his like everyone's like explaining it and then like bless goes well oh dork and blue do it and i was like yeah but that was like you know what i was like i'm done i was like good night i was like and that's i think i think that's the only time i could really call remember off the top of my head me actually rage quitting in the middle of the thing alpha just raised induced i was pissed i was so mad i don't think we played ttt like three months i don't have that clip anymore it's somewhere yeah if you're all like where'd gtt go it was that clip is somewhere i'm so happy i'm so happy at least i'm not the person who like reminds rob of his angriest moment because like when i i remember being i remember seeing the dm's and i was like oh something happened the only time and then dork showed me it's recording and i was like oh oh so maybe door still has it i was like i remember the map too it was like over water yeah yeah yeah oil rigs or something yeah that's pretty bad like that's that's real anger like that's why i love like ttc is great when you have like one and one or two like blue west lone dorks like doing their thing but when the whole lobby is just eight blue west low and dorks running around you can't have a full lobby of chaotic neutrals you can't have it yeah yeah it goes through it yeah it's literally like those little babies that's that's what i can remember i don't know if you guys have ever um i don't think i've ever reached quinn i mean like probably the angriest ever was with the arios no you did rage you well you came pretty no you did rage quit that one i can't think of one no there was that one night we were trying to do uh the pub g zombies and i mean that was ariel's he kicked aries he didn't rage yeah that's what i'm thinking oh we stopped recording that day we came back the next day we might have oh i thought he just kicked aries out and then we'd like just i did kick harry i think he did kick i think we tried to do more content but we didn't like actually get kind of like the next day of zombies where we were literally recording zombies rounds for hours hours literally hours and like fruit was like that just was like like fruit would like die early on and he couldn't get around well the problem was it was like lobbies yeah i was like they like scuffed custom lobbies like they just pubg just added these hey you can try this out or whatever it's like okay dope like we can do like a zombies thing so getting everyone in 100 people into this thing was just so difficult took so much time and things kept crap blah blah so it would take like 30 minutes to set up a game then you got to get in and then try and you know survive and get content you got to not die and you have to not die you got super unlucky like yeah so then you have to wait the whole thing and then it completely closes the lobby it's not like oh like yep just start it up again no you have to read so this was like over and over and over hours i'm like oh my we just need one good game and that was the one good game we had when aries decides to just god blindside me with that car throw it all away it was such a good round because like all of us were alive and we were like all just vibing in cars like oh this is the round we're going to win this zombies game and fruit's going to be at the last circle and then tragedy i've never heard fruit more angry in my life than when ariel's killed him in that car i don't think i've ever been there i will never hear anger like that and this is like a mixture of like fruit who was tired and also who is not eaten and fruit who is now turned into the hulk because arios just heated him out of a car i was so i also i also would consider you uh dying in your hardcore uh maybe rage quit in a recording because like you tried after that and you're like i just can't do this anymore like true well that but like that's also the street five hours oh yeah okay well secretly so that one so the very first time i died like i sunk or whatever or i drowned it was like five hours of paper right that's all you were doing yeah i was just like getting some in the sunken ship i drowned it was like five hours six hours i was like okay screw this like i'll see you guys tomorrow whatever and then so i tried again we got like seven eight hours into this world died i was like oh my god in that world a creeper in a mine shaft oh didn't even hear i had to go back in the recording too and like like literally just know it like i was literally sitting there and then it's just you're dead and i'm like what um so i was pissed but then my friends and i we were gonna play that game for the king that night they were waiting for me so but everyone's like make a new world so i jumped in real quick i was like i want to just go play with my friends i was like screw this 360 over lava i failed it so i was like great okay we'll just do it in the new world the next day i was over it i just like your 360. i thought i could actually make it but yeah i'd say i guess that's kind of the closest but now the only ever times i can remember is like quitting things like we did a ttt sesh recently but it's because of a migraine that was a headache like yeah like i was gonna say if blue and christian have ever quit anything it's just because they don't feel good or they're tired like i was sitting in because we were playing that water map or the towers and the water didn't i was like looking at the screen my head's like [Music] i'm like like the whole last round i was saying i'm gonna go die yeah but yeah that's really did you ever rage quit blue ariel it's pretty impossible to get me angry i don't think i've ever been like genuine anger i don't think i know what it's like to be angry but because my anger comes out as disappointment maybe i think i'm disappointed like when

uh like hotel spas and stuff like this kind of like cool place to check out that japan just seems like a really cool place to visit in general it's true i want to go one day um our last question is from not blue wheat loaf oh um are you guys excited for any non-gaming product releases things like the hermit miller gaming chairs or new series of intel chips uh i can't i'm poor i was like i would love a new herman miller chair but i mean i don't keep up with the hermann miller conferences so that's uh this was supporting my back nice nice cover-up of that brand right behind you rob good job buddy hey hey i've had i've already had some talks i can say that i've i've had talks i've already i can say that legally now my oath is no longer with him i just like dude it's just different though when you sit in christian's chair man it's just it's weird it's like i'm i'm laying down like this well simultaneously sitting like this it's weird i don't i don't get it you know good for the posture it's perfect it feels like i'm laying down but i'm not laying down it feels like i'm still sitting straight up but i'm not sitting straight up i just have terrible posture and i feel like i heard that's what when i see your back i wish you could see me but when i go to some stream like like xqc or someone and i see them with like one knee up and like hunched over or like crisscrossed yeah or like just like curled up in a ball i'm like do you know what you're doing right now like how's that i mean i sit like that like i have one knee like up right now like i don't know how you do it you would hate to see my posture i'll do this thing where i'll put like my left arm like i'll shift my chair so my left arm is over the back of it and like i'm like laying like what so like okay so like imagine like rob imagine like you're laying instead laying on your butt i mean you're just laying on your butt so like you're laying on your chair but then like you shift to the left it seems like no no like turn your torso yeah turn your torso yeah and then but you're still well done like that i mean kind of hold up let me so like okay rob here you can illustrate this so stand up so sit up straight like solid like perfect posture okay now shift yourself like 30 degree angle to your left with your butt still like in position yay well that's perfect okay now put put your left arm yeah put your left arm like over the back of your chair and then right foot on green oh so you got to shift your body a little more buddy no over the backing here oh like that no like you're like you're i'm trying to you need to draw like a stick figure dude i would make this work okay okay back to perfect posture back to her posture all right uh now now lee like like you probably your ass is like hitting the back of your hair my butt is firmly like i'm perfect posture okay so move your butt like a little forward in your chair but still like be sitting up straight okay now move your entire ass like 30 degrees like your entire self is like little 30 degrees not not your chair but yourself yeah yeah exactly there you go now put your left arm over your chair now lay in it okay now attention or tree no my chest like two head i'm like too light like it's like me back up now shift toward your computer screen like you're going to type on your keyboard no no no other way buddy other way other way see that cut kind of like that but i don't have like a huge thing so it looks more like um it looks more like uh i feel like i'm being like held by my chair like my hero it looks nothing like this keep in mind but like i feel like i'm being like carried out by my chair like my hero it's like it's like when you're putting oh there's some ice on the ground it's like okay like it's it like say like you're sitting like remember in college where you have classes and you have those short chairs it's more like i hate you it's more like when like someone came from behind you and you like turn your back like you're and your arm goes over your chair you're like yeah what's up it's kind of like that it's pretty close it's pretty close i have to like i have i'm honestly gonna have to like demo this for you one day it's truly awful for my posture but like if i'm gremlin mode that's how i grab a rim wouldn't move if i'm 18 hours in the final fantasy fishing that's what it looks like rob rob do you remember that do you remember that cat with the glasses that's kind of like he looks like he's chilling over a balcony and he's like his arms over the balcony i'm trying to like shake my head like this is my head it's pretty close it's pretty close yeah coming oh oh he's just an athlete just while i'm able to do that sit upside down like that your head's a little red so kind of like what rob is doing is how i gremlin now uh yeah but that'll do for the patreon questions um but so what like i guess i used i'm trying to think like i guess i can do some weird posture where like sometimes i'll sit with like crisscross except instead of actually putting one foot under the other knee the other one stays above the knee like like this no so like okay like cross your arms around okay but now take your duh which one's your right arm okay now put that over your left that's what i do with my feet instead of instead doing crisscross so you sit like this no so crisscross your feet yeah yeah there you go i mean this isn't terrible but i feel like i'm a monk like floating as i'm like put your put your right foot all the way over the your left knee there you go [ __ ] yeah okay yeah this is weird for some reason that's comfortable for me that and then yeah that's really about the only weird thing i'll do from time to time yeah see i'll just do this that's me that's the one i use looks like you're ready like snuggle under a blanket under the like with a warm cup of uh hot chocolate yeah by the rain but and then like sometimes like i i adjust my arms like so like sometimes i'll have like my arm super forward but then sometimes i'll have it like way back here i realize how unaudio friendly this like last 10 minutes has been sorry audio listeners they shoot no more to the right ah okay so we put it like that okay uh for the audio listeners we were uh sitting correctly we were contorting our bodies and that's pretty much what we're doing and for the audio listeners blue
