this is me baby let's go he's not even dead how does that work there we go another killing spree and rise i loaded into the halo championship series oh come on hi eddie hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to halo infinite it's been a little while but season two is finally here delayed a little bit but it's here a couple months late and with it halo infinite battle royale mode or i guess i don't even know what to call it it's definitely taking some inspiration from metal rows but they're still just too stubborn to make a battle royale so you'll see the gamemodes called last spar man standing last spartan standing it's a pretty fun game mode but man i'd really like halo battle royale maybe uh maybe they're bringing i don't know get get somebody else to start making the game because you guys got your hands full with whatever you're doing with infinite which is fun the gameplay is still so good apparently it just still has a lot of problems but that's not what we're here to talk about we're here to talk about the game mode and um how it is fun i wish i could queue with friends and i wish it was a little deeper it it feels like a nice proof of concept but it's kind of shocking now enjoy the video all right well what do we have here play any match killing these parts with the sidekick pistol or incremental players score and last spartan standing that's what we're going to play the new vr mode when any pvp matches bold kill an enemy spartan from behind with a melee attacking last part in standing very specific all right well let's unlock level one okay let's go eliminate the enemy life pool free for all attrition i do like free-for-all you know halo 3 lone wolves how about that you know what i'm saying so this is like this this is me baby let's go

him dude i'm telling you if you just get a like you snowball because like most these people i'm fighting still have mauler and they're like what the fudge do i do and i'm like yeah yeah what do you do i don't know if i know i'll be the first to tell you okay gamer gamer alert gamer alert botch where did he go oh i eliminated him though let's go okay how much xp is this oh 300 oh my god let's go i'm getting this too screw it i got a br boom oh i'm already max level but i need power up okay so i can't get any better so i just got to kill people before they can level up and ideally find some power ups oh no we're in trouble oh fudge okay not good we got stuck no shot what there we go okay well it says two enemies so there's gotta be another one right come on that's the game we're playing huh okay gonna give him the backsmack you gotta be kidding no shot wow dude how did that not connect that's so sad that i'm gonna lose this because of that colossal choke like well played to him but then like what was i doing i'm not gonna and my camo goes out so sad should use the shotgun i thought i was gonna backsmack him and then okay so let's see four kills three kills five kills i had seventeen four two seven zero four six thirteen two even if this guy won i had four more kills it almost sucks that i maxed out because kills didn't help me anymore like i should have done what that did do and just i'd i guess i mean that was my game a lot i choked so hard it was all downhill after that that backsmack i'm gonna have nightmares about that i'm gonna immediately get this guy trying to get that guy don't take my you sassy okay okay really okay oh no he's behind me what am i getting naded by what what what you took my kill really you oh if i die here it's over i'm better the cleanup crew's coming oh what the ah suck shotgun oh i know no no i'm gonna give him the kill oh yes but i was just oh i just had a little too much shield damage five okay what is where the map goes all the way back where okay somebody got a power up here though like actually trolling her i think i'm dead here we can't hit anything i'm gonna grab it because if i don't i lose anyway okay we got bulldog i don't have nades he does he has eight million of them oh come on we were so close dude had four grenades i was like oh well he missed the the frag the fred that and then another another one all right early kill early kills what we're looking for really okay come back all right i should figure out spawn to make this easier okay there's a nice early he's gonna think i'm going to the left [Music] oh yeah that was nice [Music] that is an unfortunate oh he's over here what okay finna just you know what i'm saying yo okay never lucky maybe not oh come on ah come on i am in dire straits here did they trade uh ar and it's overshield why couldn't it be camo okay because i get five i don't wanna sit here and get my xp why bothering oh come on and then i'm gonna get picked off by the masses i'm sure so joke's on you i got another one you know what screw i i'm taking all of them oh god well satch sure oh yeah he got the power up and he was still there what i swear to god everyone melee mauler shoots faster than me you really went this far to find me huh i should everything i do is wrong we're playing a different game oh my god who is this dude coming in like this why are you coming to me the other guy was more weak yes screw you i'm gonna get the third cardio you okay the one time the third part stop it oh my and i don't have something to finish this dude off this you've got you gotta be kidding me and then uh all right well my halo days are over lines i'm washed someone spawns up here and he had to go the other way of course i want a third party that's so high and so i'm going to that's see that's what always happens to me but now i do it to them i'll come i didn't even assist oh my i didn't even mail it twice it's the early momentum you either keep it or you don't and in my case i didn't he had overshield of course he's holding on though i'm fine fine i'm not molding thank you thank you for pitying me and i'm sorry to the dude i killed i know what that's like man never ever over shield over obviously that's just he still had overshield from winning sure sure what [Music] [Music] whatever i'll take an assist very great work buddy and i'll just i was i that would have been it i don't know if i would have ever played halo again frankly oh no no i want to steal the kills you sassy vodka yellow i don't know why he's not shooting me is he a bot he has to be a bot right that's bizarre whatever that was this is my comeback no lives no mata this is this is where my comeback story ends dude go is no one else able to shoot this dude like he's just up in the middle of the map doing whatever he pleases i'm not gonna let you get away he he disappeared yellow how many people there's still five people where are you dudes i'm once again asking for diddly anybody to show themselves it what okay funny game real funny game guys okay oh there you are okay well i got somebody didn't eliminate him though sad where's this one i heard it but i didn't see ah fudge me pay no attention to me i'm so sorry there we go that was actually kind of cool and then it's it's it's over over here overshield oh i i hate to be the dude but i'm gonna ride it i'm gonna fight it out okay that didn't even eliminate him though jesus christ he's weak okay this is it 1v1 come on yeah let's go we did it yes we were numb for one that took an embarrassing long amount of time to get a win and the sad thing is i had to eat my pride and rat it out ugh see like i got third or what fourth place that one game when i went like 17 kills and now i get 11 and win but you know what i did what i had to do [Music] [Music] foreign
