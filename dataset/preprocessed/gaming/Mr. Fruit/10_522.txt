can combo in the air well this just opens up a whole bunch of possibilities hold the phone you know call me crazy but those guys don't look very nice all right so which one of you ugly sons of guns wants to get destroyed first apparently i have an attack that i can do if i approach an unsuspecting enemy would you leave that stealth attack yep it appears to have worked oh oh okay i'm running all
