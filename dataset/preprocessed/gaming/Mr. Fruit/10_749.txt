hi ato view on money mr. fruit and welcome back to Cobb duty modern warfare season 2 oh that's right it's an exciting time in the game because a whole bunch of cool update stuff we got new maps new operators new weapons and if I'm not mistaken Infinity Ward may or may not be teasing a battle royale it's a lot of fun stuff to jump into in today's video we're going to be hopping in to the rust remake and we're also going to be using the UMP the UMP it's back striker 45 a hard-hitting submachine gun chambered in 45 Auto that will shred at longer distances than other weapons in its class moderate rate of fire keeps the gonna control while fully automatic now it's important to note I also have the blueprint the undertaker this gives us the lightweight suppressor 5 mil watt laser PBX holo 7 sight ranger for grip and the F TAC 60 series rubber now for those curious the new weapons aren't free you get the striker 45 at level 30 in the battle pass and the ground 556 a level 15 so just like season 1 weapons are free to everybody geez they put me in a game in progress did they this is fine this is totally normal alright that took a couple more bolts than I thought it would yeah well it is a hello it is an SMG I'm not really sure what I expected plus some of the attachments that gave us does decrease its run that I can't even do anything about this skirt but I can what well let's just get ya a new game maybe that'd be great now they actually have rework the perks a little bit and move some around so now we can do kill chain hardline baby seems like a horrible idea but I'm gonna do it anyway especially because this will chew through ammo and there's no way to get more okay hello sir I didn't think I'd see a fellow Tunnel snake but here we are and there's a kill that's Oh God oh jeez oka lay down okay he would respond right there wait a minute oh I ran over my dead body so that's why I got more you and PM oh you're dead okay okay run fast run fast run faster oh my god I'm in the open whoa No all right this isn't nearly as bad as shipment I'm plenty used to spawning in front of people but this one appears to be no exception that you could what am I getting shot from oh the verticality that's right totally forgot about that let's get up on the high ground yeah oh wait a second or oh god I had to reload now this is embarrassing come back here okay got him it took a little bit of finagling but up what right downtown funky oh there's no body oh that's the enemy okay oh and that's the enemy all right all right all right all right all right I gotta be careful cuz they're probably spawning out round here oh my veto okay this man you already I see you up there you think you've double checked up or something oh my god [ __ ] the range the recoil it can't handle it somebody shoot the stupid yeah yeah yeah yeah I will kill this with my pistol what any second now any second almost there no no I worked so hard on that didn't even get the kill yeah screw me just kill me thank you I see your feet seize watch I'm gonna finish it off with the deagle in style nope nope I'm missing nevermind we got them I'm actually gonna run around with the deagle for a second and you'll find out why in a video coming to you very shortly and by shortly I mean probably tomorrow so look out for that's right god Judy's chugging along for the new update new season means plenty of god Jayne outside but don't worry the road to Damascus is it's still in full effect who the fudge be giving dis mine oh these killer streaks hey we got enough everybody focus fire [ __ ] out god yeah get out of here be God you thought oh there's a ladder here I didn't even realize how's it going up here really another VTOL okay so long story short he got another chopper gunner I blame my teammates I don't need to sit in there that if not my job this seems a little more up far alley because I immediately got a kill I have a excuse me me who's sure up on the upper deck they can you Jess away willy-nilly and me I am in so much pain oh my god that's a lot of enemies and none of them died ah we got one oh wait yeah we did okay and then I'm gonna reload and by that I mean stim get the kill right over out oh my god my friend spot die that's another friend I'm just anticipating the enemy to be right in front of my face at all times and they most certainly look okay okay running out in the middle is just no-man's land get me up here what don't really take your time dude no need to mantle no need to it's fine there's a fragmentation grenade added our white cheese ya know back in my day my generation had some backbone you know they used to put effort into things and they would get things done yeah alright you boomer a shotgun on this map I guess it's not the worst idea but good come on come man vote and there it is again time is of the essence and I need three deagle kills can I do it in time nope sweet Virgin Mary let me live please it's all I beg of you okay there's one there's two all right current objective get a game of shipment where we can play for more than a minute and I gotta say I love what they did with the map though I was a little hesitant on it and now it feels good it's like a nice in-between it's like somewhere in between shooting range and shipment it's still chaotic still small but with this middle structure and stuff it feels a little bit larger than shooting house but I can neither confirm nor deny that all you love to see that first first blood okay careful okay well there that's right it feels like it takes one or two more bullets than it should to kill you but I still you know I'm a mountain out oh wait you spawn there my friend oh well I do say good sir rude rude boy Bears must up the place wah-wah-wah-wah-wah bum just let me live 2-0 roof the roof the roof is on fire oh fudge nope didn't work I'm not getting any kills oh sweet Moses Lord above I got one kill I'm losing all my ammo but I got one kill oh don't is a sniper rifle on rust you brave soul although it clearly is working just fine for you does you manage to blame me perhaps you're just looking for the lame people like myself that are gonna sit on this incline structure that's 3k screw me speaking of three kills I need to use MIDI Grill quick one count him out with me everybody not not on the worst I'm the worst the count is still one still 1 hey check this out check this out check this out you Joe someone just you you up there with the face come here come here challenge me I dare you hey yeah okay fine I'll do it myself somebody somebody just somebody just needs to die what am i shooting at I'm a detriment I don't deserve to die I mean live but I also don't deserve a quick death make it painful alright I got three kill sup Oh what am i oh I'm seeing ghosts haha do don't get it cuz that the new operators called ghosts and well if I have to explain it to you then you're a lost ow what are you doing hide behind these flammable gas tanks Jeff pipes fix stuff pretty sure it says flammable somewhere on there but if not then yeah I'll just create a false sense of panic nothing really all civilians up like some mass panic s danger lurks around every corner you have to be I'm telling you it's like I I think it'll kill like one or two bullets earlier than it does and it never does and you want to know why it's probably because of a stupid suppressor but I'm using the blueprint and that's what it came with but I don't care I'm taking off yeah yeah that's definitely flammable there are a lot of baddies around here example one for exhibit a and rather okay I will not let you get away with this yeah look you're my friend up there he was the bat did you throw that man I look for the spawns look for the spawns they spawned it behind me that oat nut over here oh god what it'll flip arou ski I don't know where that this man he's mine and whose snow pop I hate it I heard I don't approve don't approve of the shenanigans and I'm currently taking a foot under asunder I don't know what I'm talking about anymore because I'm thrown for a loop and even have a hard line I can't even get a freakin kill streak there's two wow that was actually felt like they killed in a reasonable amount of time and you want to know why because I took off the suppressor that's right well smarty pants mr. Pruit over here alright well I did miss a few bullets so that one is understandable whoa again one off just poor timing you know my friend was there and so he goes to whatever you don't want to hear the whole story it's a long explanation and quite frankly I'm a little winded Oh jump after I reel up you put a little more gumption into that reload you know with your life on the line death right around the corner because that's where the enemy was but not much take your time over reload and why don't we yeah great idea this is the killstreak life you see see it I can feel it yes yes yes it is this is a terrible place to use my cruise missile screw it okay whatever whatever we don't care we don't care I'm gonna get 8 million kills for you ready for this ba ba ba ba ba ba ba okay actually two kills that's not bad God whatever dude killstreaks overrated anyway screw my own you know what I was gonna get my feet tall and pretty much guaranteed a fruit white phosphorous my favorite war crime screw it who needs it war crimes are bad anyway right kids yes yes the answer is yes that's glad to have the UMP back the UMP whatever excuse me oh thank you for saving me my friend oh you're a benevolent God you know that they're all dead you don't say all right I must anticipate their spawn are they gonna spawn there probably not my dudes sitting there gonna spawn over here 100 hundred bucks maybe not okay wait wait let's see how about he just I think it's gonna be that corner now which is unfortunate because I can't really see it I mean whatever I have to imagine it's gonna be I found it ah but my range sucks oh my god if I had any other weapon right there he's trying to snipe me I know he has I'm almost out of ammo stupid I think did I unlock it um hold up you guys doing on that flam how many times I have to tell you not to climb on the flammable pipes geez all right let me check here I'm pretty sure yes damage range and bullet velocity increased exactly what we needed however I'm I'm now I I'm out of a mop but I have a cruise missile okay okay okay this is we can we can work with this I need approximately three kills here because like I said I have no ammo go go go go go go dude I'll back out of that short okay okay so then we're just where are they all right let's throw our VTOL over there I'm gonna sit here because I'm afraid and I'm not above sitting here like this you know what time it is time for up a war crime go right over the head course all right I need to get out of the AR the AO is hot holy suck Dao is so hot the ALS okay that's a quad okay that's nice nice okay good news is to a gummy ammo back that's really all that matters I can't see for the we'll see now I can't cross the middle line because I'll kill myself maybe not oh that come on mr. free get better than this ah they can still see just fine and they they don't seem to be struggle that I'm struggling more than they are dining my white phosphorus already come on it's a war crime for a reason somebody's stemming up in my fudge and whatever hey we did it everybody we got dad I'm done my war crime doodle and thanks to kill chain and hardline all it took was four kills or kills and then the kill streaks did the rest granted we did get pretty lucky with our our kill streaks the crews still got three gills which we needed and then we only needed two granted with the cruise missile but still worked out in our favor yeah you like that got a new barrel uh-huh isn't it sexy let me use it on you or I'll just miss okay how about I use the the deke where did he go okay scrubbing Rilla Rilla two seconds hold the line soldier there's only one of them alive I wonder where I found it are they gonna spawn where they gonna spawn I need to figure that out not here over here yes over there they're all sitting on their flammable but you're gonna hurt yourself kid's gonna hurt yourself honey okay get down from there dear it'll explode burns on your body everywhere probably chemical burns do that doesn't sound like fun screw you ghost you're not invisible to me I'm not scared of you away says the snake fanatic gallery alright we need to capture this otherwise we lose so this is the current Jesus Jesus Jesus okay capture this it's our only hope if they can test it even 4.7 seconds it's over it's over and that ladies and gentlemen is our first look at Goddard a modern warfare season - plenty more to come so don't you change that dial as if this is some form of television we're in the digital age dial what is that thank you very much for watching have yourselves a fantastic day I'll talk to you and the next one farewell [Music]
