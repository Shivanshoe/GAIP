hidey-ho John my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny - you like my new look I'm still inside it's the new season pass armor sans the ornaments obviously we are gathered here today my friends for one chunky boy this chunky boy look at this thing what an absolute unit it's the whispering slab I don't know who designed this but I love you it's ridiculous it's over the top and it's everything I've ever needed for my beau it's absent one of the new weapons you can obtain from this season I'm gonna be a rock an elastic string you're straight fletching firmly planted perks sucks to do and unrelenting all in all not a great role to be real but none of that really matters when you walk around with this now I have to show you guys this okay look at this thing it's both hideous and beautiful at the same time okay now ridiculous I must become one with the way of they bow I want to get better at using the bows but maybe it's just me I physically cannot I can't help but press down violently on my mouse and hold it violently so like my hand cramps you might have been expecting something else but yeah it's what I just yeah I'm a lost cause reminds me of what my parents used to always tell me all right good start to the day oh it's happening the beavers have finally gone back another dam oh look at this thing oh and just with the with this color palette oh just fantastic and charge and oh we actually hit him Oh hold up oh here's a boat - oh wait does he have just like the fastest health recovery donate wow did we suck oh my god oh we we are actually the worst he must have had the worm husk or something though because I swear to God okay there me go on Newton did it it a doodoo what stuff we're oh don't remember them telling me Oh sniper versus arrow who wins will predict he's coming over here oh no okay oh and he got his health back wait that wasn't a hedge my aims he's tried to run away like help me dude oh nice headshot me oh go on then and look I'm triggering the health regeneration thanks to the the perk undone yield the oh that's where you are you little rascal are you had ammo yet dang yeah this thing it's drawn fast shooting fast screw you God get alive stead of living him in his mom's basement he's living in his mom's attic still the same principle brah okay you just got to move out alright skirt oh my oh fudge it is tough you can get that first shot you can turn him into a unicorn but then it's a matter of gonna get the second shot in especially when they're flinching me that hard guys remember that game you ever play that was a stupid game it wasn't really a game either just an excuse for people to punch you but it was like major flinch you know where like someone like pretends to punch you then if you flinch that gives them permission to punch you evidently made you flinch stupidest thing ever good kids are stupid oh fudge well I like stupid at what point is like half charging or you know what like gonna be enough to kill someone after I get a head shot like that Oh apparently that if it first yeah peg um in that head then the second shot you only have till you half charge that's gonna help because I'm so used to like nope gotta wait for the full charge gotta wait for the full charge I know it's gonna sound dumb but I actually think that was nice that's not nice attic dwelling son of a drawers I think actually have it better with the bow because you get some haptic feedback when it's fully charged with mouse and keyboard you have no idea if it's fully charged like there's no clear indication like the recoil you really you've really just did that more trying to piss me off I tell you would I gotta give up on him Oh what that didn't kill him either oh wow there's just too many of them Gavin here's another point I should probably just be oh my god okay nice super dude nice shots me was the real idiot here I should be headshotting them and then swapping my gun to tap them but I don't oh my I should just pop my super here I'm over this I'll tell you what skirt okay we're just gonna see like this Oh like that's what we should be doing he still has this he still has it started I figured that Nova warp would finish like a couple of years ago Oh see that's what I'm talking about oh and he's weak okay well that's just not plain but Larry wait where did he run off to is that no that's a different fella and I okay he's literally one I was gonna say like Brad just finish it and finish it up dude don't make it more ceremonious than the OMA okay you know what I'm just cat is Everdene over here holy hackers we do be hitting shots though yes okay you know what I think I've found our groove and I'm just stubborn and that it's like well I'm using the bow so I need to get kills with the bow well this still showcases it showcases the possibilities because they're endless could you use other bones yeah sure maybe but are they as thick as this bow I think not I hold on my super way too long I always wait for like a super good this is not advantageous to you to use the super like I gotta wait for a perfect no just like I said just hate it like that and then just get it like that and capture an objective all right I'll imagine that actually head can you imagine I can't cuz it never does maybe I am maybe I am a bow man after all which Smaug would talk to me like that though [Music] yeah we got one oh wait I'm on a 10 kill streak hey what do you know hey I'm almost dead what do you know oh you like this oh my god I'm dip dive dodge ducking and dying the five beans see dodgeball the Miller you have to tell you that that's the fifty you don't repeat one of them you just simply die I see you a fellow bow man this is respectable and I'm missing oh okay no we tagged and we take him he's put a wounded gazelle now we just follow the blow wait oh you're not friendly wait where'd you come from uluru school Here I am Oh Mike just just that tip it's just like a B stick away man they're hurt man they hurt they hurt my date but I thought you said it was just the tip hey wait what they spawn behind me that hey Who I am like in this combo plus the reason I was thinking about this too oh but wait a second my machine gun go bomb no it's over wait wait come here come here come here see I threw on the quick access sling to do exactly that as soon as I hit him with the bow swap to the not forgotten or any other gun doesn't remember because ladies and gentlemen it returns the one the only the patented test that's right what skill based matchmaking guide it might mean we can actually play Rumble although I don't actually know how many people play Rumble oh wow would you look at all this piece of candy Oh eggs it is blue a throwback map for a throwback test now remember scientists to grieve the rumble test is the most definitive test out there Leigha that see maybe you know a low lower rate of fire hand cannon would get the job done no doubt but this case you know even if you miss the first shot just swap to the Magnificent howl or the Magnificent hell not forgotten and the rate of fire is so high you don't really have to worry about it but I'm telling you what I'm telling you I'm telling you it's nice with it oh let me snipe that don't mind if I do oh and somehow I missed that okay he's gonna be right he's gonna he's gonna be rough he's good what's going on here what's going on here hold on oh that hold the phone you're okay now I run away I run away because I'm weak and I'm running away yeah nice grenade me yeah oh wait what oh wait what how did that grenade like not even to he like fudge I gave up on the bow which is why we lost but that guy is a trihard for sure kind of what I thought I imagine most people playing Rumble are um you know pretty try hearts but I mean he's like Icarus - and everywhere he's got his like God roll spare rations you know and you're just gonna find those people from time to time no don't lick come on bro respect the ones I mean I only say that when someone interrupts me but when I interrupt someone's ones you know hey I don't care all the same okay I stole that guy's kill see respect the wounds mr. fruit says as he doesn't respect the ones oh ma how did I not I could have stolen that kill I didn't realize Oh imagine if I could hit him through there oh oh I did aah we didn't get the kill though you can't always get what you want but i'ma try anywhere oh no I could have stolen that yeah off fudge it's all about the flick shots and I've been I've been struggling with those oh there we go that will give me that kill and he spun right over there okay someone must have assisted me there he shot him evidently at the perfect time for me okay sir had enough your shenanigan are-- oh yes I have yo shenanigan re ends today my friend oh he turned at the last second Oh what nope and just like that I'm back into it although they apparently treated low it's good to have you back Rumble test you know I lost my PhD ever since I wasn't able to continue with the experiments you know they said a man who doesn't do Rumble tests can't keep his degree and I said that's fair but it's not my fault I can't do the rumble test they made it difficult but now I'm back and the research papers are about to be flowing my friends there is that kill see with these guys you don't have time you either land that first shot headshot with the pistol or you're dead no I'm saying I'm not this ain't no Josh Mo's I'm liking this over shield though ah oh my god I didn't even get through his over shut up oh I just got my super sad to say I was like um I'm the most fragging us out here why aren't I well play guess my flight status just doo doo doo doo doo doo okay really that wasn't him hello appointed the stag man okay no no Kim respect the ones again I know I'm being hypocritical but at least I can recognize that I'm being hypocritical dah dah dah oh my I guess I haven't used it in a while does it only reset when you touch the ground I could have sworn that wasn't the case oh fudge Mina okay well what if I just met what if I just don't hit a shot god dude I should have just thrown my shield fine I was like oh I'll just go out there kill him come back yeah it's not gonna be a big deal spoilers it did not work like that oh my god this little car is saving this dude so you wool it really is the supreme kai that's an ark staff hikers all right well then I'm just gonna run over here to where the action is happening maybe clean up a kill that'd be fun I did on the Supreme Kai nonetheless limo you know at times I feel like like a loss now other times okay you know we'll just uh I'll just say yeah yeah totally happened and it totally deserved okay this guy with his little sniper huh you think you're so big huh I'm oh I thought actually I think I'm just a potato ma'am oh oh oh I didn't think he'd actually come back around that way but I was prepared come on come on Oh yikes oh my god we both suck buddy Wow we're both bad you know I'm about to beat these sweats though limo no thanks to my thick beau there's one okay one more one more between me and Gloria's sweet thick beau victory I just found the same guy why did that didn't even go through like his shields wait I have to I was gonna double melee and I could have won yes but the last kill has to be the bow otherwise it's it's not valid I mean that's how the rumble tests were I don't make up the rules you know I'm saying okay it wasn't a pretty last kill but it was a bow kill nonetheless yeah spare rations nope confirmed bows better than God will spare rations boom printed that's the rumble test that's my findings so spread the word let the good people know put the pistolas away and pull out your bow today with that said oh and thank you all very much for watching happy Tales of Phantasia I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] [Music]
