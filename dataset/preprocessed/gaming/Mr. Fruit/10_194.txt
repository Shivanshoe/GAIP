heidi hope everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome to inked thank you to inked for sponsoring this video inked has a lot going for it the story touching the art fantastic clever puzzles which best of all all kind of tie into the story not to mention combine that with the voice work and the soundtrack and it makes for a very peaceful and immersive experience this was my foray into the beginning of the game to give you guys an idea of what the game is like if you want to check it out then make sure to click the link down in the description in the description box below it's available on xbox steam playstation and switch enjoy the video at the beginning of every story we meet the hero that's me has no name oh he left it behind him that's not me the nameless hero focused on the final part of his training oh you want some of this dummy the land was peaceful now and the nameless hero has left the sword behind him that is unfortunate timing i was ready to slice and dice but okay oh look at i love the art die i really do and the juxtapositions with the colors you know the contrast they got going on here and we already got a puzzle although i wouldn't yeah yeah you know if i consider that a puzzle we're in trouble and i have a box and i can move said box can manipulate the world around me but of course whoops oh finally i haven't been able to traverse that ramp in ages the hero's deer aiko painted the spring of life a vibrant sight of plants and fish jumping around it was always a well of inspiration for her milady what a beautiful fish you've painted yes it looks like a fish why you give me the brush you know i'm no artist honey but i'll carry it for you fine i know your back isn't what it used to be you lead and i'll follow wherever you go my love second puzzle time am i able to solve this whoa my immersion god is telling me something i can put the box up there or there's two plates how can i be two places in one i can't but a box can help me and what do we have here some evil crows messing with the bamboo is it you foul demons get off of it what do we do what are you doing here wait whoa yeah uh oh so we're helping the birds we like the birds of course because who would immediately assume somebody they come across is bad or evil or have ill intent having helped the tiny bird the couple started making their way back home i see what's going on here yes introductory puzzles i you know despite popular belief i'm able to get through these i think i'm ready where we headed back i'm hungry and i'm hot and you know how i get when i'm hungry and hot wait a minute i'm breaking i break an rp that's actually that's the thing oh we're back home oh yes that fish painting will go perfectly with the bird pit you love to paint nature don't you it was a pretty day and they decided to stay outside a while longer a fine idea now paint me like one of your animals suddenly a bird with a broken wing appeared oh no who could have done this they wondered oh my god i think it's is it dead jesus whoa babe oh geez she never waits for i'm coming i'm coming urged the hero to open the portal they had to find out what evil befell their feathery friends i agree i won't stand for this through the portal we go the cool breeze of the sea made the hero shiver it reminded him that the world beyond their home is vast and decayed i'm not so oh oh shoot find more to unlock artwork in the garden i didn't actually think i clicked it ah another one my eyes are too keen aiko asked the hero to hurry because a long journey was ahead of them the nests were on top of a tower across the sea and the rivers beyond the forest uh what the what what do you want from me it will be a great challenge for the retired warrior what i thought i just finished my training now i'm already retired uh i see what's going on here but i i assume if i get off it yup okay so i'm gonna need this other one uh-huh and i'm gonna need to interact and push it all the way over there come on buddy but oh jesus wait uh i see i see uh wait a second i might be big enough brain to make some of this happen see cuz like you can't and you gotta do this and it all makes sense multitasking incredible oh wait wait i don't need that anymore perfect how'd she get over there you didn't want to keep the bridge open for me you're just making this harder for me like what something you're not telling me um while i rejoin oh i can rotate well this is a game changer [Music] all right honey on three three whoops my bad just got a little excited great stuff okay see why do you get to do that why why don't you give me your umbrella from time to time the pair worked well together they will need each other if they want to reach the bird nests drag and drop to redraw oh i see i can't put it there so i have to oh ho ho well what if i were to draw it that won't work will it ah ha i see now don't think i'll get stumped so easily my friends because i need a ramp for this to go into the other hole ah bob i don't need to have i you know i was thinking i gotta get up there but i'll just let the shapes do the hard work for me they marveled at the serene world the artist drew for them wait well this is like some third wall she just waved at me what i'm i'm scared like i think she was literally waving at me not the nameless hero i'm scared i'm shook okay we just gotta take this rotate uh-huh come on over go on the thing what oh there we go little fickle aren't we nameless hero okay everything has to be perfect for you oh well how perfect how divine a fine landmark to help us reach the other side okay what are you doing up there you know you could help me too but that's that's okay what does this do oh there comes there comes a ball so what am i i see i see i see i see okay and ball go oh wait oh oh i gotta like oh shoot okay so i'm gonna have to let this go down and then i gotta do one here or or maybe not nope we're good okay and then here bop let's go [Music] i got a big forehead for a reason okay it's gotta house this massive brain it's not just ad space you can rent out like a billboard okay against all the huts the pair succeeded and pushed onward the pair succeeded uh excuse me sir uh i don't remember her helping me at all okay in fact i don't even know why she's like she's taunting me again it looks like chapter 11 but it's chapter two roman numerals yes how may i have okay off again are we i'd say i'm surprised but then i'd be lying oh hey a little painting you thought i wouldn't notice okay let me see what happens if i maybe i should have just done that from the start huh wow yeah no wonder it should have cuz i had to make it oh whoa dude the artist was often clumsy and would have his hands slip i see now yeah this is like some like fourth wall break like this is this is crazy where'd you go honey honey are you okay watch out this art is kind of crazy bro but i love the music why did it get so somber all of a sudden kind of worrying i can re-put this anywhere so [Music] easy enough [Music] beautiful why did it need to do that don't ask me oh boy all right i already see it in my head or do i i probably can't place it like hmm okay so i probably gotta do this first i'm on it i'm on it nobody panic i know you guys are panicking even though the music is very calming all right and pull yeah see they don't call me mr big brain for nothing [Music] i'm coming how again how is she getting there oh geez i should have taken pilates with you and there she goes okay no it's fine i'll figure this one out too all right we gotta do something like this we gotta bridge our way like this uh huh come over here so now the question is why do i need this i don't even think i need this i i think i just kind of they didn't expect for me to beat it the way i did you know any paintings i've been looking shoot 100 missed some haven't i ah they're so well hidden i thought it was big brain but alas do you remember that time we danced on the dam paper holds many memories from the artist's life but he wouldn't want you to look at them oh it's like existential like the artist maybe lost his wife or something and this is all a big metaphor and this is how he's venting you know no i'm sad we're going down down down that one got him still six more definitely missed the majority of them yeah majority of them uh what do we have here place the bowl just like that and that does it however [Music] i need this what does this do ah it's only mo a momentary respite i see [Music] well then and then i guess i need to push this back and multitask or something yeah okay go here go go go go go go and then get you wrapped up and then go go go go go go that's how you do it and then put this back here and this right here and then put this back there oh my goodness i'm getting the hang of this pose no challenge for the nameless hero his hand was steady and his mind was sharp another puzzle another one to destroy i'm assuming this gives us a ball uh-huh oh that's not how i wanted that one to go we have to somehow get it uh i see i see i see i see no i don't no i don't we gotta go like that and then that let's just see what happens right now i don't even know if this will work oh oh oh my god yo that what the fudge i thought it would be like but that thing just yielded itself oh okay so then i understand now see that's why you just gotta you gotta test it sometimes because we're gonna put it right there boom splash that backboard all right what a rip let's see go oh now oh and it's good what the heck when'd you learn to do that ah they think they can defeat me let's see what this does oh wait i think i already see what i need to do all right great oh but it's momentary but whatever i don't even need that i don't think i just do that oh wait so i just gotta like eat this thing is that what they're saying or can i like i think i can stop this hold up they didn't think i would use the mechanic like that [Laughter] oh boy it's hard being so smart hello okay i don't know what the deal was there but we did it now i can move it aha okay it couldn't think this far now what um oh i could put it like this now she helps me oh why what why did i even you couldn't be like hey make it this far and i'll help you the other way that's right i forgive you i am a nameless hero after all i am forgiving chapter 3 or 111 for those that don't know roman numerals they'd be very confused ladies and gentlemen that's a little slice of ain't just the beginning and you i can already tell at least that the puzzles are starting to get a little more intricate teasing your brain a little bit more and they're only going to build on top of it which i like not a lot of hand holding you just go through and it's oddly peaceful the art style the sound everything it all just meshes together and i'm here for it that ladies and gentlemen is inked remember if you want to check it out for yourself and figure out where the story is going to go from here and do some of the puzzles yourself because you're like mr fruit you're taking way too long i'm freaking five head man i want to figure this out well guess what there's a link down in the description box below to check out the game for yourself and you can do just that because it's available on xbox steam playstation and switch thank you again to ink for
