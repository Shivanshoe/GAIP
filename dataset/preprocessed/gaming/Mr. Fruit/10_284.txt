hi eddie ho everyone my name is mr root and welcome back to you know what you love it the last spell and if you don't well i certainly do which is why we're continuing our let's play in today's episode we're gonna see how far we can get hopefully building ourselves a new inn to get additional heroes and conquer this town hopefully i'm like what five six hours in and i still haven't even beaten the first i haven't even gotten remotely close to beating the first map and you know what i love it does that make me a masochist i think so let's get into it i'll tell you what though these freaking oh these glasses man they're so tight and then i put these headphones on it and i just got indents brother it's getting my brain that's why i'm dumb that's my story i'm sticking to it we finished all of our preparations last time so let's go ahead and start it um well i guess i could fix my deployment a little bit um how far do i think they're gonna come i think they're gonna come that far probably not i'm trying to think how greedy could i get this seems a little greedy and i'm kind of here for it nah maybe i shouldn't yeah you know what let's do it let's throw some armor on you you're gonna be fine you're gonna be fine we'll do our we'll see problem is pistol weir kind of has to get in there right you can't you don't really have the luxury of sitting back at least it doesn't feel like that these trees can be used for advantage so maybe i'll just keep abigail around here perhaps sure whatever screw if we die we die but we die together holy sack yeah see while they did get absolutely pooped on they did exactly what i hoped they would which is eat all that up for me so thank you uh minus damage and accuracy is not bad here but i think i'm gonna come over here and i'm just going freaking whack we didn't kill that we were so close um i say screw you and then i'll shout it you know um we got two movement after this should i even bother she's able to like follow me to the ends of earth so we'll just run back here armor up even though i need to do that all okay pistol here friend let's get you more or less out of harm's way oh big crit big crit you'll have to see that how much damage does this do 40 to 50 that's not enough boats bows just barely out of range you fiends let's see what we can do here then so i could do a stunning entrance but i don't think i need to go that ham yet let's see here oh it's very similar to unkai the bloom shot or whatever the grape shot or whatever scorching wave targets a couple people not the biggest aoe or range actually it seems overall i don't have that huh kind of seems like and nobody my team has much range whoops yeah everything oh everything's like well this is two to eight but see that's to enter the battle and then i guess i do just kind of gotta jump in there that's a little scary well there now do what i must friggin scubas but these are squishy um and then do i do this costs three mana oh boy i think i'll wait on that pillar of light seems pretty good i think i'll just go on everybody that isn't stunned for now save some mana business um i mean now i'll save the mana so in that case oops hit you um grapple to you why not then i'm thinking about punching you but i probably shouldn't i should probably get you back let's arm you up you should probably run can't hit you there uh whatever i'll just finish you off script boy well and remember i can always change if i deem more range oh okay mr fruit bars i'm sorry we could reduce movement speed that's not a big deal could just um it's going to weaken you why not and then we skip sketch skadoodle on out of here next okay i'm hoping they don't come that's a lot of them chief what the [ __ ] where'd all these fans come from so we could do big aoe you know we could propagate we could reduce armor uh there's a couple with armor i mean it's not that big of a deal the bee sting isn't a terrible idea propagation yes stunning entrance though could be a real big it's just a lot of mana what what is your daily mana region four these are rookie numbers we're gonna have to bump that up um you obviously got your axe you crazy son of a gun i might have backed up a little too much because i can't do a lot given my current position uh grape shot might be the play here i kind of feel like i gotta go all the way over here though start taking care of you fellas i don't know that for sure though uh i'm thinking i just do this though the show i can't pick you off of course forgetting to screw you and i can't hit you okay kind of want to go for all the runners how many people can okay i can hit them all boom boom can't hit you but now i can all right you hold down that side buddy you're doing great i'm so proud of you i could stunning entrance and do big damage it is tempting but is it necessary [Music] always the conundrum isn't it i quite frankly i don't know this bee sting might just be what i have to do screw ye zzzzzzzzzzz propagate around yes the poison will prove fatal maybe i'm not sure that's two action points though could do a whole bunch of minus movement not the worst thing i've ever heard of um if i come over here and like forget oosh all right now change change it up or whoever's telling me the poison should do decent to you out of range of course i am i'm still out of range goodness that sucks penis doesn't it i'm still out of range incredible well screw me i guess i'm getting wrong don't do it we are not that tanky so great for me i think that means i might just have to walk on up here i kind of want to go over here though because these ladies could potentially pose a bit of an issue i'm gonna whack this dude freaking of course you didn't die but that's fine could do big aoe but then i'm just taking a fat dick in man big kaka look at all the people about to come in here whatever screaming that was sick but at what cost you gotta run back over here friend armor out glhf really need to figure out what i'm doing with this team because everybody's just on the front line on the front that could have been worse okay this little rascal over here i'm not a fan of that what is the big idea here screw you [Music] um could get a big grape shot going here like that uh i mean looks pretty good to me chief everybody's weakened of course boom you're dead boom yeah dad could just grapple right on over to you ooh baby okay it's time to use samana i'm going in chief but where probably like this yes oh wait maybe i should just get the people in front of me right right probably good idea uh yeah how about that oh god nobody died but that's okay i think even just getting in here and stunning could be nice get stunned stupid you're all stunned good good good good good uh so in this case i carve a path out of here for myself it's not quite going to work good damage though all right am i really going to waste all my freaking the answer appears to be yes dodge i'm not worried about it she's just going to hit the little whatever i'll get um who's going to call it abigail to work on that later get about there i says forget about it um now it's whack that's my last action point now come back here then you we just need to ah jesus all right crippled stupid okay we're gonna chill right here okay okay it's it's happening oh god all right we've taken a lot of damage i'm not gonna lie anymore what is your mana regen two oh boy well it's not great neither all right we need to send the freaking calvary over here to fudge can you what are you good for huh aside from seemingly never killing anything okay take them out what else do you want to do and we'll figure that out i need to just start bending this easier said than done i'm afraid i think i'm gonna have to use a grape shine i don't know wait what wait did you dodge you penis papa pop penis that's what you are we could be saying we could acid spray we could entangle i think we're probably going to be staying i had to guess how far can i reach that's good enough yes propagate my friends propagates um i'll whack you then i'll whack you ooh baby can't stop the music sounds better with you [Music] love mine all right punch the stupid dude and punch this dude uh well what else do we feel like we need to [ __ ] some more of these guys they're gonna start hitting our walls you got four movement and three action points huh oh i i see the play you can't move anymore but will army i don't think they're gonna come for you but just in case we're getting and let's move a little bit over here and get out of range get out he can't reach us okay minimum casualties this way i feel all right what's the worst that could happen i'll don't only one person okay dodge big i'm just not very good with these weapons apparently what the fudge this is night two and i'm just an absolute dingus man the pistol sounds cool but i suck with it i don't know what i'm doing and this like this is cool but yeah all my people are melee clearly i don't know how to handle myself whack you punch you whack all you punch you i just don't want to miss that's what i'm getting at here um it'll just watch out then that means i need to does this kill you of course it does not why would it now let's just do as much as we can noise out of range my anus requires perfect um okay just punch you dodged oh my god okay screw me all right i think we have enough to kill everyone i have yeah i have enough pop that was supposed to be me like blowing and then twirling the barrel you know what i mean oh that'd be yeah 98 health lost not my best not in fact i would dare i say it's probably one of the worst nights i've ever had and that was day night two what the fudge but the city is safe and sound yes good good yes yes yes and tainted essence very good yes 1091 to be precise and a that's not my best work but we'll take it the night draws near let's get working on that tainted essence i forget which one oh the ballista right oh the ballista uh whatever i don't care what you have to say where is the ballista we found more power staff more longbows more spears went out done all right ballista we need like three more nights to unlock you but then that means probably next run i'll unlock you however no we're winning this one because i'm telling you once we get the end which we can buy hold on i'm building it right now i'm building this right now there's nothing you can do to stop me although i might take out a building so we can build it a little bit closer although that's i think that's pretty good honestly boom oh shoot now let me check tonight we get a oh oh [Music] a two-handed crossbow dilly dilly what is this one i don't know but it looks different uh this one gives block this one gives poison this one has better damage do you even do poison damage is that even no i don't think so okay um we so you just target one high range okay heavy bolt a lot of damage two times but it's inaccurate okay so it's kind of like the long bow practically the same thing it seems like oh but it ignores block that's nice impaling bolt four targets okay or explosive bolt five targets decent range this is the exact same except again doesn't do quite as much damage but it gives block instead or we get the rusty axe oh oh fudge i forgot about the spear didn't i i could have tried to use that last turn or around whatever i forgot i bought it that's my bad um plus when multi hits that's the extra bonus you give i mean you do a little bit more damage but that's it and we don't have any multi hits so that's uh how you say garbagio so i might give this to our pistol ear might be better off for him to just whack somebody with this um i think we just go with the better base damage poison damage doesn't matter but whatever confirm or we might be able to buy a hero upgrade increases your hero capacity by one what's my current capacity [Music] oh what do we have here we have claire martius why is he so much more expensive is it maybe does it have to do with his with his um skills perks maybe or like dna equipment he comes with mage capacity three out of three right there is room around the magic circle recruiting image will restore a portion of the circle's health interesting huh well then who in the world do we want to choose uh this person has a long bow seemingly so not a way to see more well extra physical less extra okay i don't have any gold though and i can currently i have four hero capacity but that's i'm trying to forget is he holding an axe centipede oh no he is he has a druid stuff oh he has a druid staff interesting you have a crossbow you have i don't know magic wand i think i can't quite tell uh so then who do we need we technically have druid staff but it might not hurt to have another one um you have plus one trinket extra health regen and mana extra physical well that's useless i could give you something else though i'm trying to yeah why are you s so much more expensive oh he comes at a higher level oh that is nice okay well let's figure out if i currently have nine gold so figure that out in a second let's start leveling up here you're our melee fiend armor 32 armor might be a good idea yeah that's probably a pretty good idea yes i'm just yeah we're going with that uh extra experience gained [Music] not terrible i mean i don't really like anything else you have so um that gamba that was a mistake we're just getting damaged i guess okay we have a perk point available um i remember what what what do we like on our melee fiends i mean maybe extra arm like i don't know if any of this is really stellar i mean debuff might not be the worst but we're not gonna be really buffing people i mean maybe back protection isn't terrible it's very rare we find isolated enemies when using melee [Music] so maybe i go with back protection give me all the armor yes very good all right pleasure doing business with you chill chalanka who's next karil first off give you a secondary weapon set uh this will be your new primary um was ranged right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh i don't like any of this so let's hope there's something ow more move points isn't the worst why do we lose injuries oh because of the healthiest oh that's oh that's well let's give you another move point i guess that really worth it movement can never um fudge man still no range damage huh but we could reduce people's resistance i guess perks what do we want propagation and more multi-hits we have no propagation or multi-hit so i mean maybe making them less likely to dodge is the play a lot of the hair didn't move during this turn greater accuracy and skill range [Music] um yeah i like that and then abigail what you want girl okay i feel like we're gonna get boned my reroll has not been good so we're just gonna get flat man in here i was really hoping we get daily mana regen that's what happens when i gamble gamba little useless on her it's a good start um propagation bounces isn't bad but that only works on the druidic staff i believe depends on if we want a more offensive mage which we could turn them into if that's the case we want to go for like critical i know we ironically we kind of need to make them tankier that's kind of the play what's what's my health regen character details elf region [Music] why doesn't it i want to know i wish it would tell me like if i click this perk right now you know how much armor am i going to gain um i really don't fatality might not be bad plus 50 stun chance though maybe that's good because like what is this what's our stun chance here 76 we could make it 91 percent rightly guaranteeing a stun on error about it all right recruit new heroes i would love to i had the money so let's figure that out right now with four workers how much gold can i get it's not gonna be much 28 gold fudge that means 37 buys me literally nobody unfortunate we're gonna have to wait a turn so what should i do i'm also kind of like this boy is kind of weak but like i wouldn't i sp i wish i blew my goal i got nothing else okay so i think i'm just gonna grab what goal i can for now hold on to it for next turn i don't know i wanted to buy gear what could i buy this novice's scepter is interesting range melee oh wait it's a melee weapon what the [ __ ] nevermind i take it back take it all back take it all back take it over something blah blah blah blah i think that's it i guess we can build some defenses now i don't want to bloom a load go let's tentatively do that do [Music] that and then i think i'm going to do [Music] i kind of feel like i need two gates because of the heroes i have so here we go um crossbow fiend can go here he's this gives us the best line of sight and then does that mean i'm just gonna put both our melees on one side i feel like it's easier to hold this side with one person i could be wrong it also completely depends on how many people show up so i guess i'll have them here as a potential flex depending on what's shown at the beginning army you up you got 142 armor that's plenty and i'm just double checking on a range oh god practically everything is in the straight line i guess it's a good thing we went with movement then all right let's go i'm not the best with these weapons but by golly gee imma make do now i don't want to use manny yet dodge such good chances of dodging though so just but you oh we got big boys huh okay so you want to pull away booze oh my god you're tanky do i see any other runners i can hit hog um okay the only thing left i can do is pistol here and i literally can't reach anyone um whatever they're going to get in closer i'm just going to do that farm that movement am i right or am i right i'm just going to arm her up so the game's not like you have an unused skill point i mean suck me up i'm sorry it's rude oh the spear okay yeah before i forget yup up up boner okay we can hit three targets with this uh-huh like a skewer yes of course shish kebabs i might say rush how does this work um so we go yeah and then yeah and then we slice dudes same damage except i guess i'm you know whatever quite literally a skewer two multi hits pierce's armor it's pretty good i think we have to hit the the same person triple swipe whoa three mana holy suck okay we'll save that i guess um so what is this 115 damage axe is nowhere near as inaccurate okay so i think for now we vibe out with this yeah to see using my superior range look at okay go on oh but it takes like oh it takes more advance that makes sense there's the catch i'll get you what does this do damage and accuracy i'll have two movement after this [Music] um i i want to just say balls but that's a terrible idea instead i'll just do that then i can back myself up against this and gain eight bajillion armor and i forgot you can you also are here yes my bad do we go melee mode yet let me see if i can vaguely see what all we're dealing with here see a couple here i'm trying to decide something tells me this one's gonna get crazier uh i there's no backing for that it's just pure instinct i suppose boom boom boom and then that's all i can reach huh i couldn't tangle but see that's going to cost me mana and i don't wanna all right see i didn't wanna have to do this okay fine i don't think anyone can come get me but i'll just use the armor while i have it okay that's a lot of people my traps wait what oh they like barely moved at least it felt like that might actually be pretty even i don't know it's just that this side is like see how they're not coming but they could come in such a larger area this one feels a little more manageable and i think it's mainly because of this water i don't know it's game time though boom i could just start skewering dudes that was pretty fun um yeah i kind of just want to do that although i tend yeah why not pop bop yeah i see this double weapon thing's pretty neat oh friggin all right i must defend the gate from this nerdwell so he can whack me but to know of wait you are rather close sir so i do declare that you quit your shenanigan right this minute this is two shot at least if i high roll not actually we're guaranteed okay feel that the damage you and then it's got minus one movement minus 10 accuracy i'll just wound you tis but a flesh wound oh you chill right over here just so you can't get hit you're adamant okay now it's your turn friend maybe we start uh how does this work okay how's this work five how does it hit five one two three four oh it doesn't hits four that's why okay that makes sense um maybe we'll save that let's just go for omega nailed it okay i think i'm gonna go impaling here yep okay he's like useless at this point now what this guy will be able to hit my things and i don't like that well most these people are going to be able to do that let's just wound you wound oh we didn't even get through this whatever okay don't miss pog he's practically rendered useless the fool yeah all right [Music] it's a lot of people for just you to take off but look at our armor the gates are holding keep holding men that's a lot of them jesus could go for the impale here just line him up actually it seems pretty good to me right again out of range hold on here we go they didn't necessarily okay we actually didn't do neo as much okay i regret everything and i don't gain much mana back it's like i could do this but uh okay it's not ideal i don't really need to kill a runner all right yeah we could use some help but then again so could everybody what do you want to do here definitely want to switch i think me thinks that's a good idea oh but we didn't kill him so we don't fudge that's unfortunate well at least they're all stunned that sucks looks big fat wang when you do wait did you miss he's right next to you you boner okay let's check out like this like if i went here pretty good pretty good chief not gonna lie to you okay what if i do this oh that little one that's cool this is three mana though with everyone being stunned whatever i'll switch to meocks i don't want to hit my own fence though well i'll just do that um i don't really want to reduce your accuracy like get over there thanks all right let's see this girl's gonna try and hit my wall here so i'll take one for nah we'll actually take damage and she might still whack me and then that dude's gonna okay never mind you're on your own um yeah you chill there you're good well it's all relatively speaking but what are you barking about okay wow that's a lot of you guys but the walls have yet to fall and that's because of our wounding oh [ __ ] did you get hit you got hit didn't you oh no you're about to get minus 12 movement points well we can't have that now can we you know i might start resorting to that because i can't really continue to use man uh if i want at least if i want any mana next go around all right it's so hard to say like if we hyrule we kill everyone that's kind of a big if we need a high roll to kill oh we need to do a mega high roll okay there's no chance i kill you see this looks nice but the likelihood that i get that feels pretty slim instead i'm just gonna go right here and apparently bone myself kill you uh if i just surround myself by stunned people they can't get to me got a big brain so i'll just we can just hitting people where i can reduce accuracy love that um i need a high roll for that really 115 yeah uh-huh this is not ideal minus temperature actually is probably not going to be enough for that let's be honest well i can't use my centipedes here at least are you see here wow all right how do i do this oh by hyrule one health you've got to be kidding me that's incredible screw you i'm just gonna use me ox and use me axe again you are very wounded oh but i let one person in tech because of that whoops uh whatever i'll just kill you come back here for extra armor you're big chilling you have your work cut out for you but you are single-handedly holding this down fantastically friend so proud of you i just have to keep weakening people and just let these people sit in front because how much else uh actually what i should do is i should use my pistol for this close ring ignores the target's block armor and block are different right what is the difference the difference is that didn't work um kill the runner everyone else should have a hard time getting in at least what i'm banking on see i could kill him but i almost don't want to i'll just hit him all right we're gonna be taking a little bit of damage but one here didn't move okay well then do that and then come back and then back and then there you go buddy yeah see i'm crowding him i'm starting to learn a little bit you're not doing anywhere near enough to pierce that my walls aren't looking great but when have they you know still have to try and not use mana they're gonna definitely breach the walls here if something doesn't get done all right okay we'll we'll solve this side of the puzzle first we'll go back to the other one another time our axe here looks pretty tasty um what is she looking to do i don't think i want to do that that looks pretty good nobody dies but so then if i change to my spear and just high roll it's that simple um [Music] as you say as long as i hit this should kill we missed rip unfortunate okay grab some extra armor um could propagate some bees it's only one mana i was hoping it would propagate over there but you know whatever uh if i high-roll oh even crit uh how much damage are you doing 16-19 okay my armor covers that and no one else should be able to hit me all right so that size solved and it's practically done so i just need to get up somebody over here just as soon as possible um in fact i might just start sitting okay now this would be a lot easier if i could use mana but again we're not going to regen much and i'm not going to be buying a mana found probably because i'm going to be trying to grab a new hero so i need to save my mana because the next night's only going to be harder you know so if i just omega u easy and maybe i don't want to omega u well maybe i should though i guess i should start killing some things okay i didn't even break the armor fudge okay uh they're just gonna start coming from every which way last night i'm gonna break armor oh that was stupid of me watch okay all right we're probably gonna lose our walls here like literally every wooden wall right now yep mm-hmm i don't know there's no way i make it i'm really not worried about this side you just need to start getting over here girl just wish there's no way you could i don't even have a movement oh man aye aye i do this well i can almost well no i can't get in range for the rest of my stuff no target what do you mean oh there has to uh i thought i could just oh wait what oh my god uh pig i can't do that it's not my finest moment okay well can you at least help out here then because freaking pee pee poopoo all right you got it buddy maybe one more for the road yeah why not i roll no but not terrible uh we need to get over there and stop him you have done your part not well but you did your part oh god i wish i had man i think i just have to stick to crippling people right now because otherwise i'm getting i'm gonna get overwhelmed for sure that didn't even oh rip okay i definitely need to slow this dude's roll stop the runner no doubt omega u i got one pistol shot to rule em all what do i wanna hit um yeah why not all right i've avoided crippled like everybody i've done all that i can no city panic currently three action points i know but there's nothing i can do hey get off of my fences oh no me wolves um log i definitely think i'm gonna have to use spear here you have 85 health that's not going to do enough rip i can kill him but i won't be able to do anything about her yet you're lucky now can i come over here and wait i need to save one movement okay this is looking a little bit better too easy that's what i'm saying boom to health what a tease all right swap to this let's okay let's just kill everyone that's pretty much not stunned if i can oh matter pull up now the rest of these it says shitty panic but it's just because they're in here they shouldn't be able to do anything i can't move anymore no i'll just punch this dude screw you dodged you've got to be kidding me of course he dodged it all right um i think that's it okay no city damage it took pretty much all of our resources away and we took a good amount of health and mana but we're alive so not too much to complain about there dodge i swear to god thank you and then i'm just gonna shish kabob here we go baby day three another night survived wasn't my prettiest but we did it level four 36 hp well the hp loss wasn't as bad as last i really fluffed it up second time second night i'm gonna be honest um aside from that though solid we still get all of our bonuses here i don't know why it shows fire i mean some people got in but no one hit anything inside the city but where 130 gold yes please yes please yes please that's a lot of tainted essence to put towards the ballista yes yes oh and a prowess has been accomplished what prowess haven't i accomplished no i'm saying sh are you pregnant thou giveth hope i giveth birth dreams flow through me as sweet delights until i cannot bear anymore and whenever you shut your mouth survive oh i did it the seer building with the ability to force the glimpses of the enemy horde and repel the mist for a time interesting my problem is that's more gold it sounds good but like i need i need to strategize and figure out like what buildings i should be buying and when at what time like should i just be going for the production buildings asap early you know i don't know i just rushed the end because i'm a degenerate go to my ballista possibly one more night depending on how it goes and we might be able to uh figure that out uh before i do anything it's freaking hero time we can get raquel heck yeah level three comes with an axe on the shield i hate axes but whatever extra physical damage less experience gain though and dodge that sucks oh but six percent oh my and minus two block you're just all over the place aren't you what about you meg uh but minus twenty percent experience gained well that sucks too uh ranged critical minus one could get a mage though but i do not care shantala not the worst thing i've ever seen but you know what i'm thinking balls we go rock hell let's go [Music] uh my hero capacity is maxed sorry i need 260 if i want to increase it then i could get five but four is already real pog um why doesn't she have a little yellow bar right what does that mean i don't know okay jalenka what do we want to give you oh wait wait wait wait wait yeah let's check out the free weapon or well anything we could get extra critical damage extra healing received and plus 16 opportunistic or we go with the wooden hand crossbow extra multi-hit or extra stun chains this would be good on kirill we could do this instead of the wooden pistol not against it less damage but i mean technically these are multi-hits you know i think it's better plus like think about last night if i'd had that instead of a pistol we could be picking off people if we injure them all you know so i think i'm gonna go with that okay so what i want to give you decreases incoming damage is probably a good idea 20 experience gained but i think at this point we need combat or do we yolo yeah whatever okay we're gonna choose one more i guess fatality is nice let's do that because the axe definitely seems to put people pretty low next we have our archer to give you more health but some extra range damage is not bad daily mana regen that's what i'm talking about that's what i'm talking about yeah what do i want here oh if i haven't killed anyone an extra multi-hit at the start of return i could technically get plus three on some okay okay finn to make me act up what do you want magical damage what do we have for you not magical damage dodge is pretty good here because of how how much you you get into the thick of things daily health regen that's that's nice that's a lot of health we could up the stun chains and what do i make like but i mean we're showcasing it's really not that big difference uh i think health regen might be the play or reliability um i'm gonna go with reliability sue me uh if i haven't killed anyone it's propagation like i could just do bees not kill anyone and then swap it's not terrible um i don't need to buff other people extra armor might not be terrible too i'm gonna i'm gonna go with this we only got 10 armor it's not great it's not terrible but now we got raquel what you got hmm okay so we could really build you anyway but you're definitely all physical damage and we could just bump that up even more i like that i quite like that and then some more dodge yeah probably good idea we could go momentum which you do have what is it and i'll be all gambo reliability i like that healing received gamba daily mana regen or experience gain yo what we're going with the experience game two perk points if you're melee again kind of just do the same thing screw it experience and then huh could just slowly build up crit we go for a little we don't have much armor yikes we don't have much armor um just reduce people's dodge chance i might need back protection uh i'm gonna go with mark i'm gonna be a team player there because i can either do it for myself or set up my arch for something if i have to which while i'm thinking about it i wish i had an offhand we'll give you that and then i'm going to give rockell a pistol even though i don't think it'll ever come in handy she'll just have that to swap to if she needs a little bit of range to finish something off she doesn't want to get in there you know it doesn't have to be a perfect fit we still have 80 gold can't recruit new heroes we could buy new gear or structures what gear do we have better axe biggest plus 15 armor that's pretty good it's 29 gold though is it that good propagation bounces and extra stun chance that's like perfect for abigail oh but yeah you already have one right right right minus one move point no thanks could do short bow but i like what we got on our archer gives extra mana and move points well that's pretty good right i could give that to carol i'll buy it why not how much was that oh it does 27 something i don't know if it was that was though and then i'm just gonna buy the new axe uh let's give you wait what oh give me that then let's give you a better axe although you maybe we should give the x because you you can you at least have a spear to swapped which is a little bit better yeah so let's give you a better axe don't you let me down this does 62 to 82 let me just double check that that's not marginally better no it's the exact same okay build some structures i can't afford anything mistakes okay let's destroy this for gold and let's destroy this for gold i use this with 59 i can build one structure we could regenerate health we could give gold materials i think i'm going to go this game just can't i hope it pays off wait oh pig can i not undo that oh [ __ ] i meant to do a gold mine i wanted gold way more than i wanted materials what are you gonna do all right well we gotta build defenses pray for me it's gonna be a mess we have a decent amount though and this has practically been untouched so might be able to oh well both of these might be able to splurge a little bit uh we can go with the gate here and the gate here and then i'm still just going to go with basic wooden walls i'm going to try and save well i guess pretty much everything right underneath if i could save this much and go into like dave night five or whatever with this much it could be pretty big then we could really ramp that up so we head into night four with four heroes so now i have no excuse to do less hopefully i can at least beat night five honestly it sounds stupid but i'm totally fine progressing to at least where i at least win one more night every run you know hopefully i can make it at least two more with another hero i don't know i still might be asking a lot but i'm excited nonetheless there's so much to juggle though even though you're unlocking more like that's just it like between all these structures and stuff like it's tough trying to figure out you know what i should be prioritizing no feel free to give me some comments or tips or whatever or some ideas in the comment section down below but that'll do it for this episode tune in for the next one very soon and it will be very soon because i'm addicted with this i don't thank you all much for watching have results fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
