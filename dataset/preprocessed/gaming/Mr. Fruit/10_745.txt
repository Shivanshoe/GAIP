hi ad hos 1 Mon teams mr. fruit and welcome to bleeding edge the beta coming out in March 20th I believe this is a game I've had my eyes on for quite some time it's a multiplayer melee brawler of sorts but here's what we're dealing with this is kind of a poster boy Damon he's a graffiti ninja need i say more probably be checking him out in this video you've got gizmo the engineer she can make some turrets and whatnot then we have I have no idea how to say his name death metal dude we'll go with that he swings a giant electric axe Maeve focuses on a whole bunch of trickery cast and assassin very low health pool miko a melee support chicken stabby stab to live actually pretty cool idea it's essentially just this snake that's using this host body zero cool at zero zero cool a classic millennial he can't hear me with those headphones on and the best start off he gets shields by hitting things I like him buttercup she chains people sound familiar I love road hog so I'm probably gonna like Buttercup and maka to essentially robotic Moana so we're gonna go ahead and boot up our first game I've only done the tutorial so we'll see how this goes oh I'm nervous it's 4v4 as far as i'm aware there's no other bots nothing just a classic 4v4 duel there's a couple different objective game modes cool thing too is they all have their unique abilities but also two supers and before the game you declare which one you want to use I'm gonna go with shadow strike essentially I click it and then the big circle round go yeah ironically that's actually a pretty good depiction of it my passive also gives me a dub double jump near the wall everybody has passives everybody has abilities leave this I can do that i go visible i can put people to sleep I can throw sure Atkins I'm excited for the game can you tell and look at how pretty my my blade is everybody has combos oh man but we mounted up on my hoverboard hello team what do we have to have a support we do have a support great because it appears if you don't have a support it's just not gonna go well so I should probably stick with my team there's an objective over here that's gonna be unlock and soon this is essentially kind of like domination except throw in a little TDM you get a couple points for getting kills but most of it's gonna evidently come from obj at least that's what have been led to believe let's go ahead and capture see the enemy teams on the other side I think they're very confused I don't think they know what they're supposed man we're gonna wreck these kids I see him right there oh okay wait for it wait for it wait for it and what up girl coming okay god you're so fast I can't okay just just slow down excuse me there's a speed limit here apparently I can't unmount people or at least I just don't know how to work it but here I am yeah I'm here friend but I am an assassin and I'm getting blown up let me go invisible and I put her asleep we're gonna get the kill we're gonna get the kill where'd she go I think we got the kill oh my god okay now I'm weak so I'm gonna throw my silicon's and hope I don't die need to escape up here jump okay okay what do you do now I need to somehow heal but I don't know how to do that okay I'm gonna go invisible put him to sleep and then you like that you like that I know you do oh and then watch this and I'm gonna oh okay there's about to be a new capture point though and while I am healing this isn't a lot and my healer refuses did well heal me for whatever I'm right here but heal me heal me buddy yeah okay whatever you know what I didn't want help anyway well you got your own graffiti ninja he's not as cool as me I need to use my dodges let me put him to sleep okay wait I don't know what happened but it worked out go on the support yes Oh God I got stunned oh I didn't realize - you can change heroes on the fly cool like overwatch probably also means I could change my super during the game if I wanted to we need to grab be here people me mount up here I look good now where exactly is my team weight damage boost let me get this it only lasts temporarily but if I could get this oh yeah okay about the wreck shop oh you want to go oh wait what is he doing to me I can't move okay okay I'm gonna go invisible and then put him to sleep and then go over here and it's slow him and then double jump to victory oh I'm not letting you mount up no oh not today let's go great stuff but I am on fire and it it does hurt it does hurt mildly okay I'm just kidding I'm just smiling through the pain it actually hurts a lot I need to remember to play the objective because as much as I want to kill people there's more into this game I know I know it's like a whole new mr. fruit playing the objective in a game I don't believe it but I do have my super I need to get used to the targeting system area at all check it's alright I'm gonna super on top of this stun oh he's wait wait he was invulnerable he did the exact same thing as me and I am a hunt I'm I got destroyed kind of a dumb-dumb because I meant to alt but I click F instead which does nothing and so I stood there and then when i ulted there invulnerable yeah yeah obama you don't want to be a board by the semantics up at all oh it's so colourful though oh why who are it's dropping these bombs what the huh you are not cleared for bomb drop I repeat you are not cleared bomb drop let me get this damage buff real quick so I can destroy the enemy we slowed him and then oh you're so dead you showed it okay maybe not there is a parry button by the way but it's you have to stand still let me see if I can do it okay i dying trying to do it so maybe i should okay okay can i talk to this guy you are a Heuer if you press q you could fully heal me help me help me oh wait oh wait I guess you like gave me a thing where like I get an extra life that's pretty cool oh and the dash attack okay I kind of forgive you for not healing but literally it's just your Q ability you press Q and you heal everybody I mean that's what are we all there is to it I'm gonna lock on to this guy also forget that there's a lock-on button which as you can imagine it makes things a little bit easier I'm gonna put you to sleep but I missed so you know what maybe I won't you know I'm gonna do I'm gonna come back here you're not getting away from me let's go let's go you're gonna heal me now our unit still not gonna heal me oh okay well how about this huh you how about I slow you down oh you're not gonna help me all put you to sleep and go dude oh wait oh I got it I got it okay okay hello sir let's go oh my god oh my god I'm coming I'm a slow who's you know what oh what a sly seed I see - lets go home oh my god this guy behind me is trying to cause a whole bunch of trouble but he is a healer so I don't really know why he's alone and thinks that he can actually do anything I'm gonna land right on and put into sleep you oh my okay singled the healer out your welcome team I throw a shuriken and completely miss but try and chase her with my - okay I'm trying to catch up oh there we go good and then I'm gonna put you to sleep and then you know what the BM I molting you I could have saved that that was unnecessary but it's sent a message and right now I'm sitting out a broadcast loud and clear that says do not mess with me oh my god okay I'm a fish I'm a I've ascended I'm gonna put it asleep it helps me set up a combo now people can parry like that I just parried him might be hard to tell but I did Oh Mike the final kill let's go okay the final plate I got the kill that's debatable stats wise most kills most damage done hey I'm DPS what I do now interestingly enough everyone apparently has an individual level when you're playing them so I'm not sure what exactly that does there will be skins coming soon only this you can choose which hover board they'll use and probably more importantly you can have mods which act as a load app and I believe you can randomly get them dropped after matches or craft them yourself so in this case you can see I increase my basic attack damage by 7.5% angries my base health by hundred HP and I increase sure can range by 33% I do want to try out some of the other heroes but I'm thinking for the first match let's just focus on Damon see what you guys think and I'd be happy to do showcases on the other characters oh and we're playing the other game mode okay well I spoke too soon someone took Damon well then screw it will be el Bastardo oh we joined a game in progress oh so I guess some of the people quit I wonder why and I also wonder what my abilities do we'll figure it out as we go I'm sure it can't be that difficult oh okay that's cool oh let me just do a little turn it okay okay can you not stun me okay and I'm stuck I'm stuck in oh I'm stuck in a glass case of emotions oh my god I'm trying to parry this guy -
