hey do you hold everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to snake rx snk rx however you want to say it you guys really enjoyed it and now that we have new game plus one i want to try it out but before we get into the video my friends do you have the drip the drip well if you don't good news you can now get it the fruit lettuce summer apparel collection is available now for a limited time i'm not sure how long that limited time is this one won't be under a specific time constraint all i know is at the very least it'll go through the month of july possibly through august i'm not really sure but there's a link down below there's some sick apparel we got we got tank tops we got tie dye we got a shirt we got shorts and for you ladies yes that's right like two percent of my audience leggings can remember the name of them for some reason we got those too so if any and or all of those sound cool click the link down in the description box below appreciate it with that said enjoy the video we're back and better than ever i have yet to do new game plus one so this will be interesting because i like the fact that it gets harder but you get to enjoy yourself because now you get an ad onto your snake you get one more now you guys in the comments were supposed to give me builds i got a lot of different i got a lot of different replies so we're just going to try i think i might go with something crazy like nuker and that kind of sounds kind of kind of fun and we already have one but in the meantime i think i'll just do that and oh they completely reworked the healer so now healing class enemies drop healing orbs on death and the cleric creates one healing orb that's fine so that's gonna be our snake for now i don't know how much harder it's gonna be uh kind of terrifying and also a little insulted that they see me on new game plus one and still think uh do we not wow it took you that long to nuke wait wait i didn't you don't do damage do you well it looks like we're running into things i guess it's a good thing i had a healer all right that was not my best idea admittedly all right yeah i should really read the fine print next time huh but that's all right we can survive this okay well let's get a damage dealer next time yeah that sounds like a nice idea oh oh my how could i resist wait what is this cursor or sorcerer these are very interesting but i could get mercenary right now and just just start flooding this economy silencer does sound nice um like no one does damage oh wow what a what uh what a world i'm living in here what do you do curses near my enemies for a second preventing them from using special attacks that's cool you don't do damage either do you all right well then what the fudge whatever we don't need damage we uh we smork me go face to the face yeah just get this over with just using different people to ram we got we got healing we should be all right i think even though our our lead is almost dead didn't have a choice apologies friend finish them uh uh can i i don't yeah yeah i don't think there's any way we could possibly yeah how would you actually oh wait i thought that was the end of it i was gonna say how could you possibly lose i still don't think we could though like literally even if they did their best it kind of seems like all we'd have to do is this all right can i get a damage dealer please i am a merchant that's not going to help this gives us nothing a barbarian deals aoe damage i already love it and i have a merchant let's get an arcanist and in exchange get rid of my healer because that's a great idea right i bet okay let's put my damage dealers um all none of them in there so they don't immediately die and hopefully we slowly kill things we don't know what our build's going to be yet it might also entirely depend on the first or second item we get that might help determine what we want to eat wait what uh who the fudge did i sell i thought i sold i sold the nuker didn't i you gotta be kidding me i was gonna say wait why do we still have healing orbs did i miss click or like maybe when i changed the train ordering i didn't realize uh fudge me all right well not a good look for our new curse granted it was only one that's not that big of a deal but man we do no damage come on people and it's not like i haven't picked like i think i practically only picked up every damage dealer that i've been afforded like this isn't like my fault really all right whatever it's time to ram die die die die die die die die let's get this over oof oof oof okay thank god we need to start leveling some people when you start oh here we go all projectiles thrown by rogues chain extra time we can do rogues all aoe attacks should deal extra damage per unit hit or extra dot damage okay interesting if we go nuker this aoe thing might work we have a free reroll but i don't even know what we're going so let's go we've never really done aoe or anything so let's let's do that uh we got a sorcerer that's fun wait well we already have one of those a claret we already have one of these changed uh what do you do throws a piercing knife and it does um dot damage did not know that i'm gonna take you because again uh i just i just want damage that's really all i'm looking for here that's all i can do six gold not ideal all right here we go this isn't you know a banger ever run so far they can't all be and no i have not played new game plus yet literally like every round of snake rx you have seen in my videos which has been three i played one when i first got the game just to check it out the second one i recorded the third one i recorded and this is the fourth one so bear with me here if you're like oh my gosh freaking played me freaking second well guess what we all got to learn you're you mean to tell me your fourth run you were just a genius that's the annoying thing with doing videos too where people just people like uh your first game well i have a thousand hours and you suck yeah cause i bet you were just cracked your first game uh sorcerers repeat their attacks once every couple oh nice curses nearby enemies for second okay this is what i had i think and it got sold no what i don't know i could have sworn we had that oh but that gives a cursor bonus i'm not going to bother with any of that i'll get a scout for now just because i can fit him but he ain't going to stay on the team i'll tell you that much but we've unlocked yeah sorcerer's repeating attacks and max cursed targets which stuns enemies hit we don't really curse anyone do we i mean you do i guess okay yeah sure whatever we got a long train now an eight snake train only possible in new game plus one but think about new game plus two you get nine doing a plus three get ten you get plus four you get eleven new game plus five to get twelve the builds think of the possibilities i can't i'm too small brain for that and i don't know the units well enough so i kind of build and then like that's why i kind of asked for people like yo what bill do you want me to go but then friggin everybody and their mom was just no one seemed to give a specific build like hey go like six mercenaries with this and then grab this for like four um okay mercenaries are bad like cleric you know what i mean no one really did that so i was like all right screw we're doing it live we'll do something we haven't really done which would be like sorcerer or nuker or pretty much anything that's not just direct projectiles because all we've really done is like rogue and ranger um okay swallows up my merchant bog oh a witch or would you look at a switch it would also give us voider damage over time to allied voiders pog let's sell this bop uh now we got the voider let's go baby suddenly we're looking sick um getting plus one inches from every 10 gold i leveled you up but i don't think you did anything except for just it or health maybe i i don't actually know but whatever i'll take it oh kill oh with pleasure i don't have nearly as much damage as i did my last run with rangers so this one will be a slow but like what is it what is this thing i'm sending out is this person i don't know but it it must be one of the sorcerers because it seems like i'm doubling the ability every now and then oh aoe seems to be doing pretty well to me i don't know what those things are but that's kind of sick enchanted attack speed to a random unit if you have two or more enchanters uh i don't have any of those position seven blah blah attack speed and damage to one mage every round for that round like do we have mages we don't have mages is mages different than sorcerer i kind of feel like it is okay i'm gonna re-roll projectile damage taking damage also shares that across all enemies position what reroll position six takes tension of his health and damage as damage every three seconds what why would i want that huh position three has fifty percent attack speed gold coins and healing orbs are all right screw me dude i'm gonna waste my all my gold here extra attack re-roll curse is apply doom dealing damage every doom instance now we're talking oh creates an area that pulls enemies in for one second on sorcerer's spell repeat see now we're talking let's go uh sorcerer doom uh let's go gravity field let's try sorcerers we can still uh do some other stuff but uh arcanist is going to level up here doubles his damage merchant we have vagrant explorer oh yeah they reworked this uh so plus 15 attack speed and damage per active set to allied explorers and i think this is the vagrant is the only one with that and psyker create a piercing damaging orb around each cycle interesting is there anyone i don't want here you're you're voider you're i guess mercenaries are the healers but i don't need you so we'll keep vibing let's keep her going and hopefully we get uh some more sorcerers here soon but we're working on the economy with the merchants it's gonna come in huge trust let's see only one purple field but after enough tax when i do it any second now it should be now ready there there's that double pew pew pew and see if we had six imagine like literally the entire screen will just be aoe damage you cannot escape you can't escape my damage and curses you plebs new game plus one more like new game plus easy got them mr fruit it's like level five yeah yeah yeah i'm sure this is all gonna come to bite me back in the butt but let me enjoy my time for now look at all the aoe field things ram into that thought that was the last one that's arena i seem to recognize ooh cleric it's one healing norm still only creates one healing norm i don't know how that works uh oh mage okay it is a special thing well good it reduces enemy defense i don't have any of the other things so uh instead i could just do uh an upgrade on on me item sure keeper going level eight level ah see it's not wolf that was level seven we're freaking owning let's go send out the aoe fields i feel like the aoe fields uh are completely random the way they're thrown it looks like they're completely random i guess i have to kind of bait them into them like come this way come this way oh all my aoe fields are going the absolutely opposite way okay i can't tell if i can can i control them no i did really feels like i can't i don't know i mean if i can get them on them they're like freaking pooping on them man but these have minds of their own like see when i want it to go forward it goes backwards and then and then when i don't want it to go forwards it goes forwards it doesn't i don't understand i lack the critical information oh give me that coin stupid give me those healing norms i might as well right oh the coins we got racks on racks stacks on stacks i'm not even looking at what my train's doing i'm just looking at golden oh my god all the gold baby ah see we're here we're fine area clear let's go we are chugging right along another merchant that's useless dual gunner also useless okay well here's a nuker but we kind of nixed the nuker idea didn't we currently have sorcerers and voiders oh oh we have a lot of gold what the fudge um just fully upgrade that then fully upgraded aoe item why not we only have like one or two people that deals aoe because i really need to upgrade my shop all the next because we're just whatever level at we're apparently finding none of the sorcerers we need so well i won't rectify this situation soon enough i'm thinking maybe sorcerers and healers feels pretty good to me just stay alive while of our aoe swelling eats them away i don't know seems like a safe kind of play though we'll see what uh some of the duel types and our sorcerers are though it might give us a direction right now i'm aimless okay i know what i'm doing with me life oh jesus what the fudge get the gold oh there's gold down there too excuse me i want the cash give me all that cash go aoe a whole look at the see look at the aoe when it does start hitting them saucy saucy saucy oh my oh my get pooped on give me that healing oh give me that gold punky what wait what oh i thought i lost like three there i was like nanny all right oh here we go enemies take extra damage per second when cursed ranger no gold coins and healing orbs are attracted to the snake we want combat mages nope uh i should do nah pretty nah when enemies hit walls they create an area based on the knockback force us now it dies it explodes recent piercing and rig chain projectiles no projectiles that chain feel damaged with each chain do we do we even have that okay this is not going well ranger i'll proj position versus apply doom okay i'm wasting all my money let's just go curses apply doom and i guess we're going voider sorcerer because i don't know what else i would do another arcanist and then i should probably start leveling this thing let's reroll once oh that's a fourth sorcerer did you leave that uh might just get rid of the healer then cuz oh wait oh cur fudge wait maybe maybe just get rid of voider get rid of my merchandise nah all right we got four sorcerers repeat their attacks once every three attacks let's go we're looking good uh with just no healing but who needs that level 10 we're killing it look i got a little thing surrounding me dude what are you gonna do about that what are those look at the aoe damage actually kind of big actually kind of cracked okay it's coming together i still don't think that curse thing is really going to come into play at all i feel like that was just a wasted item i know i got really greedy i was just hoping to find another sorcerer item might come back to bite us i could have just gotten a more generic one like oh this one gets extra damage or um when you rotate like this you get this probably would have been the better play but so far we're chilling just having our aoe slowly trail behind us and absolutely poop on everything seems to be a pretty solid strategy so far does the solstice just throw out everything oh give me that gold oh give me that gold thank you very much all right hey so far not bad uh psychic yes yes please um let's level up the shop and then reroll it oh we got the plate see that's voider but i'm going for cursor now so okay silencer another one oh that's level two versus five nearby enemies for six seconds i don't know if that changed anything okay well here's another uh cursor there's a nearby issue six seconds they'll explode into four knives on death max cursed targets to allied curses okay so then who do we want to get rid of that's not we could get rid of merchants but i don't know if i'm ready for that yet you know i might need to get rid of the rogue voider yeah sorry friend it will be remembered nothing of value i'll buy one of these all right so let's see if we can get six sorcerer or that should be possible right six sorcerer four cursor because one of the source versus the cursor so that would be nine units so unless another one is a sorcerer cursor that should be our final build we're looking for who needs sustain or anything like that i'm not worried about it just throw out so many attacks it don't even matter just just rope a dope everybody look at the kiting on this snake oh my god look at the gold i'm gonna hold on to the merchants as long as possible but there we go thank you thank you thank you you can see them all exploding into knives it's wonderful look at the aoe as soon as they spawn get pooped on get cursed oh you guys don't stand a chance stupid maybe this cursor thing will become uh rather oh kamikaze we lost a good snake ahead to death body part the segment chief wow what are you would you uh okay this would get but we don't care about before we don't care about any of that let's level that up again then let's reroll another merchant doesn't really help us but a bar bit wait do we already have a barbarian yeah we do um oh that's a cursor what do you do and you're a mercenary oh this is great and you're avoider chris is three nearby enemies indefinitely with that dealing oh my god uh okay so screw you yo this is huge because that ended up giving us not only voider it kept mercenary and now we're at four cursors yeah could not have really planned that to go better that's incredible uh so you just sit in the back and who else should sit in the back aoes cursing it's gonna put you near the front all right we got to kill an elite here no problem i'll just curse him up the butt bring it on elite you don't stand a chance get cursed you're cursed aoe which doesn't reach you oh my god wait what did we already lose a guy oh my god we already lost again what the fudge retreat ah jesus i regret everything or do i never mind we're good ah it's all dead though we might lose a couple here wait why are you still spawning it's it's over dude like joke's over yeah we got it all right i don't know who got hit at the beginning but they weren't right for the middle and i don't know but they just pooped on that poor soul oh here we go heroes have four times a chance of mercenaries bonus to drop two gold on death oh that's sad i have to lose my own guys all warrior nope position no uh extra dot damage i think that's for voiders which we don't have we don't have mages first and last positions have extra damage now attack speed terrain and i don't have enchanters i don't have enchanters the fudge chance to create one two three secondary aoes on aoe hit oh extra aoe damage don't i already have that uh i'm gonna go echo garage that seems pretty simple to me uh we could level that up like all the way right now well let's do this that and then i can level it up again later but chance to like echo an echo ability almost because of the source your belly i think that's at least how that's working or it just means it could proc two damage instances any of those any of those outcomes are are perfectly fine with me i'll take them so let's see let's okay i think that was a double aoe hit he said i go and well they got pooped on oh yeah you see uh and it poops on them okay wow i don't know wow well whatever is going on right now i have to say i like it it's hard to tell when the curse doom thing really comes into effect but i know it's working i think right it's it's just less notice it's not as flashy that's all get pooped on oh dude we're freaking palpatine out here the synod will decide oh that's a lot of ah jesus ah christ i suck oh my god we're in trouble ah the senate help me help me send it anakin and i can do it do it okay we might win this but it didn't feel like we had any right okay that went downhill really fast what the fudge and i didn't pick up the gold suck okay we gotta level up our barbarian that is 22 aoe sick we could get a thief um i do not need more mercenaries but thanks well we could get rid of this one then he could actually do damage gaining extra interest has been nice don't get me wrong but this guy throws a knife that actually does things uh who else would i get rid of probably nobody here yeah i'll be here all right farewell merchant appreciate you let's level that up all the way all right i don't know where the rest of the sorcerers are hiding feel free to make yourselves known uh at any point but for now we're just gonna vibe it out i have to do it see it's a catch-22 as well you can get more units and a longer snake but that also means it's harder to avoid your snake running into things and you know controlling the tail with the head and getting it all to do what you want it's not always so simple that's why it requires height ah fudge i hate it when they do that little kamikaze rascals that's why it takes giant iq i got that fudge jesus is that even legal i don't even know we have to like be far enough away when that activates and we never are okay i think these guys will do it though so we kind of need to damage them yesterday here they come you little rascals all right well at least we beat it did not go without oh but i already have a jester because you're a curser of course you are uh might just yeah we're gonna level up this trap and then okay oh what another merchant and sorcerer all right well then grab you all right sure there's one away now uh reroll for six horsepower that was greedy yeah likelihood of that was was small but you know i had to take the chance one thing i need to get good at too is figuring out how i want to position my snakes i don't entirely know that i kind of just feel it out i feel like my current strategies just put like most aoe or like most damage goes in middle least important units go in front back you know i don't i don't know if that's how it was intended or what other people would be doing but that's what we're doing so sue me quit shooting out all these little knives things or those technically ours i can't remember i mean i know we curse them when they send out knives i just can't tell because they're red oh my god that's two people done uh and we got three waves to go chief uh uh chief yeah we gotta play this omega careful come on lads i really need this aoe to start stepping up come on aoe question mark there you go please okay stay as far away as we can but then they're also over here oh suck money we oh my god they got the turret dudes oh we're screwed we're so screwed what the fudge oh my god yo what to do damage ah suck oh my god can we survive uh it's not over i thought it was over shoot the lightning i think only one of us does damage if i kite correctly oh they have turrets no way i'm kitten correctly oh my god oh no level 15 that's atrocious we didn't have any tier threes we in fact we barely had tier twos uh yeah maybe i greeted a little too much okay so uh we ain't playing i see you feel free to actually give me a bill if you want to see it but maybe i can try sorcerers again i don't know it really feels like kind of just whatever the first decent item i get i built into that i don't know wow that well that was humbling really humbling a little too humbling well that's everything almost watching everybody i'll talk to you in the next [Music] one [Music] you
