in today's dream team those are words that this mouths have not muttered for a very long time because the dream team hasn't been in destiny I've done you guys remember the last time we played no well since then I have been grinding yeah leave that 54 he's not on Jimmer because his name is Robbie underscore yeah it's crazy to that I mean thanks for leaving house fruit yeah for real Rob what's wrong with you I can't I can't believe you liked it all I love and didn't like what have you been doing you probably like yeah it's fun to like sheriff powers rather than you do we're all back together because at least for the a okay we're back here this season has a little bit of content at least for the dream team that would be the prophecy dungeon why does it feel like we're headed down Jen spoiler I load it in so much faster than you guys thanks Rob that's crazy by the way for all the people to that were like upset about afk farmers you're ridiculous the power grind is so boring I don't have the time I wanted to get to the new content for you guys in anyway if you want to judge me for FK fun doing it check yourself if you're a farmer your scumbag and I hate Unitas yeah and I'd be alive but like also I did it so well I remember the first night oh I'm getting modes wait what i'v mode wait dark motes max couple seconds hopefully give it believe it go go boy go go boy go here we go why are they like company hi this mechanic into everything we do what do i what am i doing yeah what do I do left-click whoa I'm so big brain dude okay that was helping now you guys have to figure it out on your own what do you mean you helped i literally killed the light one and then fruit you killed you know what you guys are gonna be great you know see I was doing some on my own all right I see because you I mean yeah that's it's just very evident that they're like they're out of mechanics it's just like new game mode with bancos motes Guardian counters this entire the mechanic is actually really cool just already looked it up and it's cheating right now how did you know I'm cheating mr. foerter what rot wait let Rob figure it out okay sorry you doing great Rob Rob yes you have okay Rob so we have dark motes we have to put Dunc do you know what to do when you have the dark modes yeah now how do you watch that dark mode what do you have right now you have light modes what did you you're right I thought that was the pretty good dunk just you have to like get it it's all sick dude well you kind of missed it so I was like you missed it wow you managed to miss it but okay nice nice lighting nice light motes mister mister Robert now keep doing that and let's see what I see here comes the look if I see you need dark motes for that because that's a dark pillar and this was a light pillar so how do you get the dark I had to kill him in the dark yeah I mean you not a badge actually shadow I heard I heard something different but no not a bad guy I respected wait no don't know what don't hold on I think I know what I have to do I think I accidentally did it last time yeah he accidental wait so you didn't even look up the encounter you actually don't know no i straight up just randomly got dart you just missed your play gambit you actually thought this game was rubbish probably oh my god I need to stop hanging out with rich people okay yeah I don't know how I got dark motes in the last place but we need to figure out how to do it again I tried killing them with different I tried to finish them finishers didn't do it there has to be something to it look I believe in you mechanic yeah I was right I was right I had to being the shadows oh where I've actually figured it out oh wait Rob you're right no big brain dude Rob actually oh why would they lie to him no I didn't lie to him I think my rod no Rob said you have to kill them in the dark but the answer was he has to be in the dark when he kills them that makes more sense yeah I just randomly did that so you randomly get one at least that's why you're like oh wow like you looked up the encounters like yeah I know what I'm doing yeah yeah that's why you're like making fun of robbers like yeah dude like what are you doing I did understand the dark in the light but that's only because I accidentally out the door what is that it's the oh and it's gone well that's crazy you're welcome there oh yeah look for secrets you these balls what schools what are those are there like secret chest just like tell me that you're grainy look at me do smart oh my god oh my god time skipper time skip no way oh my god oh my god oh my god way no way go on no I mean something tells me we fall down here later on I almost had that one I'm pretty sure this is where we end up when we mess up so oh oh there's epics you know I'm shooting them Tenex he's gone oh right right 10x honey I know X they all in with external yo get out the way uh-oh I pissed him off responding restricted monk I'm activating this by

tractor cannon cuz I'm I'm a team player 5 G's it means oh it's good kill it kill it alright I'm here you doing that oh my god we actually did it feels good and I got a prime Engram it's good and there's a chest feels a better my god mark of judgment aka trials armor from a while ago so wait what do I do here blue oh it's a sink I've never done this encounter what do we do how do we sink crouch it's pretty simple if you smoke the marijuana you'll sink into your couch therefore it's time for you to get stoned as [ __ ] sinking your cash and only then will the Guardian become because we all had to stand on it or that or yeah or what he said oh you remember those marijuana commercials where it was like what's she doing is she okay and then it's like she was like something yeah she's like oh that's just Becky she's gonna sit through and do anything she used to be so she's to be so good don't you kind of just sits here now she's useless because of the marijuana yes stay with me is our I can't attach this to holes oh you mean blue what's four point one sparrows or on the same rigs I do like the aesthetic you know like and every strike there needs to be a sparrow attached to said strike that like drops like three percent so people would start grinding for like are you saying there should be mount farming in this game rod yeah that's pretty radical dude yeah you really a radical idea no it's yes I think it's super I mean no other game really does that you know to me like that's a lot the thing to is it they obviously know about it as a reason they aren't doing it I couldn't tell you why but there's a reason like you can't tell me it's that hard you make sparrows every season you can make ten sparrows for each strike yeah make it a five percent chance and give your [ __ ] people something to do I don't get why that he's like slowly respawn timer battery robbed like a law and I just don't think that's possible you're asking for too much I just think it's I think that'd be so cool and I just make the sparrows look good I don't know why it keeps killing me yeah but what about we do I'm not killing myself may come each cost ten dollars alright am i killing myself it's not about is whoever kills that like explodes because that's what apparently exam no I'm kidding it's only on my yes right that's never the answer go ahead go to the next red ring of death we're harkening back to the holidays well I was four I was a ps3 fanboy so I wish that on people really did have an Xbox but I never nice brave ring of day when there is an actual competition and they were like nice launch titles another I mean that's it crazy if you know it's like a complete 180 like ps3 xbox a series like blue mal and now my yeah okay let me test this okay Rob like finish its to sit inside and finish it did that hurt you know I got this I got this that's what you the AoE blast should not hit me that's all I'm saying you're you're being ridiculous the please bring mal farming into destiny you know I like your Sparrow room I mean German America I mean Rob nope it's the it's my it's the really fancy rez watch this he I'm not high enough on the season pass yet to get there why go go to the red lights from Jesus you would have thought you've never done like a rain or something before in your life well that could that's also a potential answer is it the right one no but I'm gonna let you believe that it is scre I'm gonna go do this red one we don't need to all do together that would not be quite that's not but you may blow yourself up over there so dick I'm just saying the AoE or whatever is sauce will suck it's literally a babe launcher it sounds like doesn't explode it's it's sauce I'm sticking with it your stuff you screw up and you kill it and literally it was you blowing yourself up I mean at this point I know you're right but I refuse to accept that I was wrong that's really acceptable honestly mr. fruit that shows that you have resolved it's all for the wrong thing but nonetheless preserve all the knives yeah I'm gonna stand by my beliefs even if I know they're wrong and I know I'm wrong and I don't care you doing great oh no that's the one over here huge tether outside you know II tell Meg a brain Oh smile okay oh there's a uh-huh let me guess his name um Osiris Poland's tolling that was a good guess you know tolling way is open this is
