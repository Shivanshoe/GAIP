oh sabbath [ __ ] good god i'm just about to have a discussion with my friends over here why are you guys so rude no shoot the light order hi the ho droid my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and in today's video the sun isn't really working with me here yet my bad side you know not the best lighting but that's okay because in today's video we're going to see both sides of the light ish kind of all right we're going to have we're going to have the kumbaya pow wow let's talk destiny to the state of it in the state of the community hopefully you stick through it all a little bit of rambling i have trouble staying on topic but just know i love you i support you most importantly i value you uh is my equipment good ah jeez i kind of just threw this fit together randomly yeah i mean it's it's just really the exotic that's different uh what do you guys think of the new season pass like ball ornaments anyway just like always i need to play some battlegrounds to get some risen umbrella energy so i can get a guaranteed deep sight weapon before the reset which is in about an hour because i have been procrastinating i've been doing a whole bunch that's not destiny yeah that's that's what we're here to talk about isn't that gonna be lovely gather around the campfire the proverbial metaphorical campfire i don't i don't have one for all of us sorry i do have one actually it's right over there it's behind freaking guys i look there what the [ __ ] how did there it is it's not on but it does function i never use it because i'm already hot i have an ac uh indoor unit literally right about just blowing on my face right now quick little post edit here didn't realize this until i started editing everything something happened so my gameplay was dropping a whole bunch of frames apologies ahead to that and normally i would just scrap the video however this video is more about the rambling commentary and while i ramble a whole bunch and you know i kind of have thoughts everywhere i think it's important for some people to hear whether you play destiny 2 or any game or frankly you're just a human unless you're a dog on the internet you know then click away that makes sense hopefully you still enjoy and if the frames dropping are too much for you you can just click into something else do something else while you just listen uh yeah i'm gonna be honest trying to talk and both play these battlegrounds without being absolute daddy for my friends here is gonna be a tall task yo check this out though freaking adding the invisible void thing but mwah chef's kissed it so before you all get your knickers in a twist okay your uh your doodads your twins uh all in the wrong positions because of the things i'm gonna talk about you know let's just hey let's have a civil discussion actually i am having discourse with myself and you are listening but i can read the comments after the fact to see what you guys are thinking it's just it's a one-way street right now so bear with me oh fudge i forgot we got a freaking i need to get the light order yo get out of my way jesus freaking oh fudge it's match game ah wait but this is why i have the r blast okay all right i need to kill the light boner for risen number energy but i [ __ ] everything hurts i want to go home god i'm about to have a discussion with my friends over here why are you guys so rude no shoot the light order get him get him jesus ah what is this dude made out of jesus christ okay oh raid boss raid boss down great stuff guys sony like i was saying right we're civil here we're civil we we can just have a discussion we can prove to people that those still exist you know and we we don't all rule ourselves by emotion destiny is in a state right now oh here it comes yes that's that's the take it is in a state now what state is it in well that's entirely up to you i think it's in a stale state which is not a bad thing in fact i've gotten a lot of gameplay out of destiny 2 in the recent you know two months or whatever but but here's a problem there's always discourse and people people are complaining one way or the other people are complaining that too many people are complaining people are complaining they don't like the game people are complaining about people complaining about people complaining about the game well they're not complaining they like the game but you understand what i'm saying lots of opinions and destiny among others there's always people saying i like this i don't like that especially when it comes to content creators you know if you go on destiny reddit uh you would think everybody just has has a personal experience and reason to hate every like destiny content creator it's like what did they ever do to you um nobody considers me a destiny cody creator anymore so i'm in the clear so maybe unban me from the subreddit see i i can't trying to do all this and actually like normally i'm talking nonsense so there's there's no real no real set discourse it's it's just kind of free form um why is this this dude's tanky so much again i can't it still feels like a glitch i'm dead all right this is my moment come on it's this doesn't make any sense there we go whack him give it to me i spawn ammo for us that's it anywho as is all the time destiny you'll start to see uh amount of creators start complaining that the game is stale or the game's in the bad place blah blah blah and i think there's merit to it all and everybody can have their own opinions but a lot of people let those opinions influence their opinions and i understand that i can fall on the same track normally like if i enjoy again this is gonna sound weird but nine times out of ten if i enjoy a game i don't go looking for subreddits communities videos discussing it because i will i will enter a subreddit for a game loving that game give me 20 minutes and i'll leave that subreddit hating the game that's just how it works even even myself when i'm like oh i shouldn't let people's opinion it's so easy specifically two to let negativity wear on you so i understand people where it's like you know i don't like listening to that stuff because it bums me out for me however destiny 2 is stale for me but here's the cr here's the crazy thing i'm not beholden to destiny hey new channel variety baby mr fruit place check it out having tons of fun with the content frankly making some of the best stuff i think i ever have including like a really recent video sorry you know old self promo but seriously go check it out if you like variety this channel is fps if you want to stick around for that but that's part of what i'm here to talk about um if for me if i'm not enjoying a game i stop playing it [Music] crazy i know but i guess you know after playing destiny for eight years or whatever that i've realized what the game is what the game is to me and how i most enjoy destiny and i enjoy destiny in short violent furious unhealthy bursts does that make sense to be fair that's how i enjoy most of my video games so i like to come in when there's tons of stuff to do knock it all out and then take a break but okay cool i'll see you guys soon i'll be back but i feel like so many people feel like they can't juggle different games and again if you're one of those people who doesn't that makes sense but so for me when destiny's in that state i'm like yeah well i just go play something else and i think the reason you see a lot of content creators complain about it is because for a lot of those content creators one they're in the same boat they love the game and they want to be able to play it more secondly it's because it's their job so when to them the game is more stale or there's not as much to do it's harder for them to make good content and so they complain and i totally get that and i think that's what some people fail to see but there's also there's also so many different varying viewpoints on this thing you know some people are bored of the game because there's nothing to do some people are bored of the game or think there's nothing to do some people bore the game because they have done everything some people are bored because they want to know life this game like an mmo but the reality is it's not quite an mmo one of one of my favorite things was i went to a bungee reveal for dlc back in i think early d2 when they were like cursive osiris or something and when deez was still working there as community manager this was noticeably after i stopped becoming like a destiny content creator and even at some point you know like i wasn't really uploading like any destiny at all frankly and i went there and i played it and then when i was about to leave the dish took me aside and said like hey man still love what you do and i appreciate how you go about making content because these always commented this to new players community all this kind of stuff and it was met with you know varying degrees of agreements and whatnot which is fair but to him it was always like destiny is a game meant to be something for everybody but it's also a game where it's totally fine for you to put it down for a set amount of time come back we understand and i think part of that problem is a lot of people have misinterpreted or frankly i don't know if there's much to misinterpret just never really got a clear indication of what bungie wants you your relationship with destin to be because at some points in its life it feels like they want you to log in every day and do things and at other points it's like i think they just want me to log on for a week and then log off and come back in a couple months but that was deja's approach always and so he said like hey man he's like just know that i respect it i appreciate it you know whenever you enjoy the game you come back and when you don't enjoy it or whatever you just you just leave it alone something to that effect and the point was like i like what you do i respect what you're doing and uh just because you know you start on destiny doesn't mean you're beholden to it essentially is what he was saying i was like thanks deej he's a very nice guy always had great interactions with him i know he's jesus christ working on the with the company for that new rumbleverse game but uh yeah i hope he's well so once i start talking i go on autopilot and there are some things that are okay to autopilot and this right here might not be one of them because i'm slowly running around killing acolytes when you know the aspect of sabathusi is trying to kill me not my best moment speaking of sabbath points that's how i approach the game and i had i had problems with that early on especially like destiny 1 because i was like i want to ground blah blah and i think i just had or wanted to have a different idea of what destiny would look like but the reality is either the relationship i have with it play here stop playing there play different games i am both lucky and cursed to enjoy practically all types of games um the problem with that is i can't stick to one game which is noticeably why when destiny first started popping off i immediately tried to transition slowly into variety and eventually got there i would say because i was like i'm having bone destiny right now i'm having fun with this content right now but i also know myself and i'm like hey this might be cool right now but i guarantee you three four six a year down the road uh i'm gonna be like jesus i wanna do something else and that's what it is it's it's a blessing and a curse i play everything but i can't stick to anything and uh you know speaking career-wise it'd probably be better if i could stick to one thing because that's the way channels and viewers and stuff is trending people like people who do one thing they like to know what to expect which is why i wanted to at least try and condense this channel down to fps only rather than the entirety of games and then even more once we have some main games uh you'll see a lot more of those specifically like d2 when i'm enjoying d2 overwatch to beta pvp beta here real soon you're gonna see tons of stuff on that uh like gundam evolution you saw some videos there it didn't do crazy uh the videos but like you know i'm enjoying it it's an fps so heck brother i'm gonna post some let me grab this stuff while i'm thinking about hold up now wow that's garbage fudged oh okay i got some more i was about to say okay how much oh my i need one more risen umbrella energy we go again i'm sure you're like mr fruit stop talking all right quit being reasonable all right i don't want to hear this right now so what i'm gonna say is if you enjoy death singing enjoy destiny don't let other people poop on your parade i know for a lot of you that's the case and if you disagree with those people and you think destiny is boring or not in a great place then that's fine you can also do that when people who really love something explain why they don't love something anymore those are opinions you should listen to whether or not you agree with them because nine times out of ten the vocal people letting bungie or the community know what they agree or don't agree with is coming from a place with good intentions because when you love something you want to see it succeed you want to see it be what you want to and for some people you know that's different if some people had their way people would be deleted from the game some people had their way you know casuals could never get so and so weapons blah blah blah that's what i'm saying there's players out there everywhere and bless bungie's heart i feel for him having to deal with all that different stuff listen to all those different opinions i don't know how they do it i'm a people pleaser so when i started like i won everybody liked my videos and everybody has to agree and i don't want to make nobody angry or offended or not enjoy my content then i realize that's literally impossible because nobody you there's nothing in this world nothing that everyone will agree on literally doesn't matter you know i don't just give me demonetized i don't know why i would it's just but it's like about hitler what's wrong i can already tell you there are people out in the world they'd be like nah you're gonna find something out there for everybody and so i think it's just a good reminder that i don't know i lost i said hitler and then i was worried i was gonna get demonetized and i totally lost trust because odds are a lot of the time too what ends up happening is somebody is a little snappy aggressive judgmental and then the other person becomes defensive so on so forth but let's breed some positivity all right fight negativity with positivity and you'll be surprised a lot of the time people will be reasonable they'll calm down about oh wait this person's being civil reasonable well-tempered and that's how we can continue these discussions because at the end of the day this whole point all these discussions coming out and this will always happen in destiny whether a new dlc just came out and people are saying it's good or bad it's in between seasons or dlcs and people like games boring games not so much to do nothing to do blah blah blah draw valid opinions some are right some are wrong mine are right you're wrong no that's the problem we run into i just but some people don't they're like yeah i hear you but you're wrong you know let me put this way even if like i'm enjoying a game right even as me and i go on twitch or something i'm like ooh i want to see who's streaming this and what they think and i turn on the stream it's you know the streamer all the comments are just like uh sucks oh this is so bad how blah blah dead game blah blah you know you know what i i think to myself that's fair they can have their opinion i disagree and i also don't have to hear it because in this case you know we're not at some political candidacy the point is we didn't sit down to discuss our opinions with each other i'm sitting there and i'm like hey i don't agree with these opinions and i hear them but i also don't want to listen to them i don't know what is my point like right now i'm not enjoying destiny or like even like overwatch one you know i feel bad for people watching who still play it because like i know i like dunk on all the time but like hey if you're still playing that and you're still enjoying it more power to you that's just how i feel about the game right now and so i understand some people might have the same opinion and reaction to me when i talk about certain stuff and i know that's how it was with like the dream team and like rob would just complain all the time it's kind of why we like dialed it back because you know nobody was really having fun i think but some people like hey i hear that i'm enjoying the game and i just don't really wanna like listen to you guys dunk on x or y so like respectfully i'm just not gonna watch that's fine i totally get that i wish you'd say come back was it me well everything yes it was baby come on i just realized i'm suppressor i'm supposed to be on vortex nate this entire time i just now realized that i'm talking up talking about my butt for too long so like you know getting more to the nitty-gritty about destiny 2 where are we looking what are we thinking i think which queen was fantastic and it was a really solid like three weeks and then we just kind of like we rubber banded back to where uh destiny had been where it's you know it's a little slow little quiet and that's fine i'm excited for season 17 from what i've heard sounds like you know bungie is really happy some they you know they're saying it's like the best work you've ever done and really impressed with everyone so i'm really excited to see what happens and that's it i'll hop back in when there's stuff to do but i have a little bit of leeway there but some of your content creators feel trapped you know they feel like an animal trapped in a corner they're gonna have a feral reaction and so when they're in this spot feeling like i do except for them they feel like they can't do anything else that's how they react and to be fair you know it's it's a hard viewpoint sometimes to understand a lot of people are still under the assumption you know what like 12 years later you know youtube content creation able to be like a full-time job where it's just like uh you just play video games dude your job's not hard uh and that's a whole other bucket of worms uh apples to apples but every job comes with pros and cons and that's that's just what it is you know my favorite thing was like i wouldn't make destiny videos for a while come back when there's stuff to do and i'd always get stuff like bro we don't want you dude you abandon us you don't you're not a desk you're not a destiny player you you've only played x with what are we gatekeeping right here man what but it's like unless i only play this game i can't be considered a destiny player or content crap i don't know man there's plenty of content on this channel and the variety channel as well that might introduce you some games you didn't know about but you want to check out another super great shameless plug seamless impeccable how does he do it you know i asked myself that every day oh sabbath [ __ ] uh next season do we get arc 3.0 when does that happen let me the subclass 3.0 i'm excited for those though because if they're anything like void 3.0 it's gonna be a lot of fun that's another thing uh as humans it's literally like bread deep evolutionary it's in our dna that negative things always stick out more than positive things for us so i think it's also good to remember and try and keep in mind to focus on positive things try and and point out things you think like destiny does well unless it's a honeymoon period you know every game destiny and all of them has a little honeymoon period where like it can't do any wrong everything's great and then you know like fast forward a week in the subreddit and it's like the dude watch it's that community thing like walks in with the pizza everything's on fire suddenly every post is like this is garbage there's i can't believe it's just like whoa what happened but that's unavoidable i fall prey to it too uh it's actually a pretty interesting display too of kind of like serotonin and stuff in the human brain and how we rubber band the same way we we we want that dopamine high those dopamine levels we get we get big hits like me brain like and then we don't quite start getting the same doping levels you know things hit not the same because literally they just can't our body gets used to it and what some people don't know is for every high your like dopamine level hits just know it has to rubber band physically you don't have an unlimited store dopamine you use some you got to get it back so that's kind of part of it too you honeymoon phase boom dopamine then you kind of start playing it kind of wears off you get a little jaded boom you hit that bottom you're like this game sucks man and part of that is a lot of games too it's hard to tell these days because it's like oh just wait until you get the end game 200 hours later like then you wait 200 hours or for me you know 400 hours new world one month then you get to the end game you're like wait a second crunk cusco there's uh there's no win game those are different stores there's always exceptions to everything i just want to sit down here tell you guys why you're not seeing as much destiny for me just because you know i i don't want to play it as much you know i i'm great master ready i've done a great master i'm like 200 plus from the season pass but i've never been i played more this season than i have most dlcs and seasons i have kind of checked all the boxes i've kind of done everything so i'm like all right yeah i'll uh i'll see you season 17. i think that's the next season i hope i'm saying the right season you know the like the occasional trials and stuff i will admit as a pvp player it's all disheartening because i like i know how much i've enjoyed destiny pvp and how much i just don't anymore sometimes or like trials i just somebody trials me and i just don't think i've ever really worked well with like respawn based okay we finally got enough though okay so i'll finally be able to craft the pulse rifle nice you know when i started this video i had a clearer idea in mind where i was going and i just got sidetracked i can't multitask that's that's not news to anybody that's ever watched me how about how about this maybe this is a takeaway try and put as much if not more positive energy in the world as you put negative energy and we all put more negative energy than positive nine times out of ten myself included i'm no exception i can always be better you can be better we can be better literally all humans can be so much better so love you guys see you next video [Music] [Music] you
