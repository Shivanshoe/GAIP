heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to phantom abyss this new competitive parkour indiana jones temple run looking i don't know it looks really cool though and we'll get right into it but essentially you go through these mazes and they're all procedurally generated and the idea is no one is the same so everyone's gonna be playing different temples and you can see ghosts of people who have tried this temple and either succeeded or not and you can kind of race against them and yeah that's really all i know i should also note uh me and parkour games like i tried to cs go surf once that went horribly so i think i'm ready welcome to phantom of s there was like a little tutorial you do this guy talks she's like then you come over here indiana jones with this freaking adventurer whip see you just come here okay i see you can grapple point being though we're just gonna literally hop right into it i'm not even giving you a chance to try and comprehend what's going on we're just going in the devouring rage protects this temple oh four explorers have died here i will not be one of them so if we wanted to i could actually watch them see these are the ghosts these are those who have come before me and either succeeded or not and i actually think i only count four people so i don't think holy jesus wow uh what do i do about this i'll tell you ready oh yeah get that roll it's good for the knees uh they missed this treasure you can actually see if they come and pick this up oh oh see he he just opened it okay so he ran right by this stupid i you are kind of racing against each other i guess i should be a little bit faster oh wait a second wait a second don't kill myself hi okay perfect somebody already opened this for me so grab the gems you need the money because this is uh very capitalistic um the the temple monkey things require you to pay them and they'll give you blessings i know it's not very fair i don't know what any of these symbols means oh jesus i'm sure it means something skirt don't die thank you you have three hearts and as you could imagine the temples are out to kill you like this you gotta time it i ain't worried about yeah okay i probably went about that in a way that made it more difficult i better stop drop and roll oh my god i'm nuts the g what the fudge huh open door i need a hundred what okay well that was a waste if i'm going for time not going very well what was that i'm just gonna keep going this way ah there's ghosts ahead of me somewhere oh there's one okay give me a second don't hit your head on the way out what did i pick up a key and there's oh oh trish wait what what was that uncommon key oh what's the difference i don't know but i got it and no one else did ah here's this rascal though oh wait pick up key don't already have a key huh i don't know how this work i don't know am i holding the uncommon key maybe i'll just stick with this okay insert key do i still have this uncommon key or something i don't i don't know i don't like this though but easy enough to time here we go oh somebody literally died right there well couldn't be me and see this guy would give me a blessing but you need 150. i got none of that man were you supposed to be able to get 150 in that single floor couldn't be me and now i awoke a guardian not that kind of guard in your rascal so you can see the pathing i don't really know what this means but it looks cool someone else has made it i still don't have enough money but blessings would probably be pretty pretty good okay open this up give it to me give me all the money yo get out of here like i don't know if i'm actually like competing against these guys i don't know if the ghost can take the coins from me um i don't think so but i have enough for a blessing but i'm not going back i am definitely not going back you have to time that by the way it's not as easy as it looks give me all this free stuff thank you very much you found some treasure for

handy once it's well worth it shame spill it spits poison gas bombs oh that's lovely okay as far as progression goes in the core game loop or whatever okay that guy died right there huh i'm going to want a lot of relics oh i would have just watched them die oh fudge i think i understand why because it like stopped that's embarrassing okay well i got one oh my god so it's already started oh that's

temple and i'm gonna be one of them i don't think i have enough for another one i probably would if i didn't buy that stupid door don't mind me just grabbing this but what does it mean only one person in the world will complete this like if they've already done it and completed does that do i have to beat them and time them what does that mean oh jesus great balls of our me and this person think
