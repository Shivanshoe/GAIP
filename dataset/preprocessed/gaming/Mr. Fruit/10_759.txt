hidey-ho jaune monning's mr. fruit and welcome act more call duty modern warfare that's right another gold assault rifle this time the scar now I am using the cerise blueprint which is really cool because it adds this like red effect to your guns and like when you shoot people and they die I think that's what this does now for attachments we got compensator because the scar can be a little unforgiving in the recoil Department we have the TAC laser for ATF speed glutes quarter stock for a DSP 25 rounds for a little extra magazine ammo capacity because it comes to 20 and it's sex duty and stipple grip tape for the 80s speed but more importantly sprint to fire speed pack those together and what do you get well again I'm going to use in this video on shipment at least for the first game wow yeah we can't I climactic what do you want from now not Wayne Brady my improvisational skills would get me approximately zero points from Drew Carey ooh I do love seeing the gold though on all the new weapons especially the scar I was most excited when I first played mana warfare for the scar and the bison the Bison didn't let me down too much the scar more show just isn't the same as its predecessor in previous games so it's in a pretty rough shape but it's still not terrible I mean it's an assault rifle so how bad could it be you know what I'm saying I'm trying to kill somebody so you can see this ammo effective alright I'm afraid I'm very back okay sometimes you just got a got a spawn and try and get out what you're trying to say as soon as possible okay you see that red smoke yeah that's from this blueprint you've also probably seen some people kill you and it'll have like blue effects I think that's a different gun and a different blueprint but same idea it's pretty cool that they added it though you know a little something extra some of the blueprints as to how to tell if the blueprint will have it no idea I didn't even know until I shot with it and I was like whoa that's pretty neato burrito I'm a fan and there's spawn in front or was that my friend all right I think a wasted most of my bullets on a friend so that's my bad but that's a quick double no it's not apparently I assisted and I got killed by a frag grenade but I didn't see any indicator sus I would say yes and again as I keep recording these videos I believe that was a Damascus riot shield mob boy probably just trying to flex with it and I respect it and support you my friend we got a/c UAV not on my okay it looks like somebody else shot it maybe well if they did they missed nice shot you pleb where they Joey got there move move I'm trying to stay alive please ah as I go through the assault rifles like I said it just gets wetter you're in sweaty ER because we we do pretty well during the game I mean it's a stark contrast from leveling up the riot shield the knife in the crossbow so understandably the games are a little sweaty I'm not one to complain I'm just trying to make excuses throw out some John's so you don't judge me too harshly for my completely mediocre gameplay but hey that's why you come to the channel right that's my it's my charm right guys being completely mediocre thanks parents I'll take it though what the fudge also I just played some Smash Brothers so like my thumbs they're all like chafed or whatever you know I'm saying if you play with a GameCube controller you don't talk about those sticks I mean the controller is good and then the Stahl [ __ ] but jeez Louise takes some getting used to yeah all right got him with my sheer pressure I just need to get better resolve god I don't think I got scavenger I only have 13 bullets I will make them count no I didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't super dried [ __ ] whoa whoa whoa what's going on here I love the red effects still though Bop your dad buy red when you see red that means you're dead Red Dead Redemption wait a second what I said red dad that my brain just kind of filled in the filled in the blanks like it was a mad lib or something I'm gonna die yeah I thought I don't have a yo Dee I'm gonna say why is this so much more difficult than usual that would explain it I prefer objective based modes on shipment the map just usually makes a little bit more sense cuz there's a little bit more flow to it now granted not much also shot first and stuff don't really know how I died but okay that's a tough first round but that's okay well this is domination I gotta go to the bathroom but I guess this means this video is just gonna be insanity nothing's gonna make sense tell me I'm coming team I'm not a deserter do not shoot which by the way watching the expanse right now we're like almost done with season 3 that show has no right being as good as it is oh my gosh it's fantastic I don't know why I never realized really recommended it or anything and I don't know why is who it is good ah yeah uh can we can we figure something out what would it what is this what I met no kills what what's with these assists okay there's a kill there's a kill that's a thermite I'm hip firing I'm praying I'm laying thrown friend you're dead okay that means they're probably coming oh no that's my friend in the shipping container okay not gonna help me I'm right over here crack I'm cracked I'm crazy-crazy barely got that with my last bullet which is bad news because now I'm out of ammo all right I wish I could record the games before I get the gold and pretend that that was the gold gameplay cuz I swear to God I have good games I you got you gotta bolt you gotta believe me oh sweet Jesus that's what it is I'm leaving the game mmm that's what it is I'll air half the game yeah let's do some more a deathmatch domination the game mode where you don't have to play the objective but you can feel like you are because getting kills gets points alright I've played literally two games of death domination 1 in this video and 1 in the last both times I've gotten shoot house it's just a coincidence I'm starting to think not is this always shoot house I have a hard time believing that but if so it's good to know because I still have some more assault rifles to to grind out and that means more long shots that need to be dealt with accordingly and you know it's really easy for long shots a shoot house shoot house should just be renamed - long shot the map and then shipment should just be renamed to almost every other challenge the map specifically kills - you need a lot of kills go on shipment nate'll I believe the trick Bob in fact as in normal fashion with the other assault rifles I've done the last challenge I needed to complete with the scar was actually just eight hundred kills I've gotten everything else done because I am efficient don't get me wrong I also wouldn't mind double Evan XP soon that would that be pretty rad if I'm being honest there's a kill his friends over there hmm I reload it because I thought he would die but he didn't this is embarrassing now he is dead with my red smoke but the theft after the theft at our table DITA Tata Tata I'm the scatman I wish I could scat actually Scooby dooby dooby dooby shy about pop it's an acquired scale though somebody gonna shoot that down I got it somebody else got it yeah budge hold up hold up hold up I just got killed by the FL I must repent for my sins really mr. fruit oh but if I jump I didn't kill ever girl used your teammate as bait did you well the worst part is it absolutely 100% worked oh he's right over here which side he's to give a show on what his reaction time is inhuman it has to be a bot there's no way I could lose to anything other than that really that Claymore didn't link he has to have another friend on this thing right maybe not uh-huh he's gonna come back but hey who shot me the semtex won't kill him and everything I said will be a lie which wouldn't be the first time but because of that handy-dandy little box I got my semtex back oh sorry sorry a little a little trigger-happy right now I'm on edge man I'm on edge oh my god mr. fro first the FAL not even killed by the EBR I must be sick I'm sick yeah screw you believe me clearing points shooting claymores in and just a team player leave that getting kills getting points and making sure they don't get flags to get points now you thought I couldn't do it all turns out I can and your friend just so happened to abandon you at the perfect time for me to be able to kill both of you I'm so sorry for your loss now they're Oh uh-huh I had to reload because even with 25 shots is still absolute garbage and I need a bigger mag no just fly all my gun around trying to break their noses and it didn't work nothing no whoa oh right there ha ha ha headshot Tater Tot got hopes that wouldn't be my last words in my life who was he thinking of who did he say he loved or wanted them to know something well well he just said um headshot Tater Tot do you have an ax to dodge you know I like what he said what I know there's a guy right here because of the spawn I still think that's kind of janky it's one of my complaints when you spawn in the over like that you only like zooms in but you can see where some enemies are close by you and it's always hard to tell that's how you died but I'm sure I died quite a bit because of that I mean I kill quite a few enemies because of that so it's got to work the other way around we're using nothing what is that no no Gold's trying to see who else Berlinda paying here and so far it looks like I'm just double cheeked up and nobody else is they can't keep up I need to lay down pray for a second but first use my Prezi to miss off all right let's see what we see when we can [ __ ] that's 1 & 2 not bad not bad good eki hey mr. fruit good eat guy yeah oh no that was freakin one out from a VTOL screw me I don't know how you reacted that fast that's a claymore God he just planted that to see I coming say did you kiss him thank you full of ng me mine friend you are mine friend with the German version of that sound like hey you gotta be looking this way yeah show me some respect give me the do's that up that's my friend sorry my friend shot me in and I shot my friend like I said we're all little on edge that's going to Charlie yep catch that suckers enjoy it it's on the house well it's on the house because it missed I wouldn't make you pay for it you break it you buy it and in my case I broke it so imma pay for it again I apologize with you trying to penetrate through these walls all that was a good idea mr. fruit good boy sir Claymore here dang it I thought it was in the clear man enemy UAV huh oh there it is well Lee the red tracer bullets that's so cool and I kill it I'm denying the enemy is there Intel fantastic stuff hey I could use this ammo thank you whoever placed it here you're a real pal you're a swell guy if I do say so myself what are you doing right there you little rascal I was sitting in the tree top to my bubble gum playing with my yo-yo what do what do what when along came Herman the worm and he was this big and I said Herman what happened and he said oh uh I got bored so I ate a crab it's not crap but I can't for the life of me remember what he actually ate it's been so long since I've heard that little nursery rhyme thing but my mom used to do it all the time for me did the best sound effects my crazy did anyone else remember that like I also haven't heard that in forever I don't know how I just started like reciting that pretty well if I do say so myself - there's a guy right here oh fudge he knows no he doesn't but his friend does I'll just wasn't destined to get anything aside from a predator missle Oh shucks a big fat wing that comes like my friends I am tired but the grind does not stop another assault rifle five more to go and then there are other stuff to finish but we're focused do it you stay eyes on the prize you know thank you very much for watching have yourselves a fantastic day I'll talk to you and the next one farewell [Music]
