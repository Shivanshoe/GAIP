[Music] michael we have 15 minutes pollute a loadout and then we won't be one we can only use what we lose what that's it so just play whatever and just hope for something good i don't know what's more optimal i don't know part of me thinks i could get two rumble games out i've made my decision you go do your thing i'm going to do my thing i'm not telling you what i'm doing fudge i didn't really think through what the plan was i don't know what to do we loaded into the exact same thing we're like oh hey just like the spiderman meme three two my strategy get the most amount of loot not the highest quality that's what i'm thinking too all right that was 45 seconds loading not optimal oh i'm already getting drops bro like i'm here brother oh my game is bad it doesn't really matter what my drops are if my aim is like this i already got a blue it's so freaking nothing it's so it might have been a titan mark but it's so free it's it's a bg michael it's i've gotten i've gotten two marks and boots well i don't even have anything um see i've i've made an error uh i've made an error because i thought that lost sectors would give me loot and they're giving me glimmer so i'm changing up mid strat i don't know how much time has passed although i'm now doing something else and this is going to be the loot i've been looking i have only got blue armor still not feeling weird about that or maybe i'm lying though maybe i've already gotten purple in each weapon slot you have not gotten nothing don't even don't even think about it oh i saw an orb of light and thought it was an engram it was not an engram it's a prime engram okay now you're just not we're popping off this is cheating i'm not feeling very confident right now i literally don't have anything yet i haven't gotten one i have got nothing yet no engram no drop blue baby oh there you go it's so free yeah it's over now wow the stat distribution no loot there dude it's it's just armor dude it's a bg like what i don't know maybe some of the white weapons would be good right that prime engram better be a weapon let me tell you it was probably already in your inventory you cheater they saw it drop on my screen i can't fake that okay it's i'm rusty in after effects okay i'm not that good i'm gonna i'm gonna edit in me pulling stuff from destiny item manager oh it's a blue weapon it's a blue weapon oh my god it's over it's over no comment i got a purple oh no what is it what is it what is it oh come on man i like the sound of that oh yeah whatever i thought something was going on here i'm throwing i'm throwing i'm throwing oh no no no no no i'm throwing i'm trying to think like what is a quick guaranteed way to get purples i would like to know like right now that would be great i got what i need to win i got what i need to win it's over bro it's so you're gonna the first time this is an advanced brain i knew there was another public event going on here even though it doesn't show on the map that's called timing yeah i thought i was near a public event and then i went out and wasted a minute it wasn't there yikes yeah and now i'm now i'm not getting loot now i'm kind of freaking out okay and it's a hero's public event already i just show up and it's heroic oh this is too free oh oh wait wait okay wait wait i'm finna pop off hold on the rng gods are going to shine upon me don't worry about it will this thing blow up dude i have time um what oh my god wait that's kind of good that's kind of mining come on come on i got a problem too that's a usable weapon this time that's a usable weapon i won't know if mine's usable until it's encrypted but i'm kind of freaking out right now if this was destiny one i would take the white weapon to get the calcutta and uh i'd win people don't know that reference then they weren't oh geez yeah we're gonna gatekeep uh you can't play yesterday yeah i used to run spirit oh you got wait you got a heavy yep when you when you see my loadout dude you're you're gonna do you're just gonna you're gonna be like gg you're gonna give up on the spot i'm telling you i'd be upset if i were you i'd be like how that's you're cheating i'm scared i'm not gonna lie i prepared my whole oh my that's juicy that's real juicy shut up oh it's so good it's so good it's so good i'm gonna try for one more public event and hope for the best here come on glimmer mining crew show me what you can do these guys didn't even make it heroic you idiots yeah i thought i was shorter on time i skipped a heroic i'm gonna be honest but i am going to continue to peacock until we're able to actually measure each other up i'm not feeling the most confidence so let's just say that the only thing is i don't know what your aim looks like so there is oh okay okay we gotta be so i gotta i gotta turbo this right now come on complete it's gonna be please open the chest no it's nothing wait wait you completed it maybe i can load in there no maybe somebody did it

okay baby i got one prime and one umbrella i need them to pop off for me there's no more there's no more peacocking it's looking rough for your point i'm ready i i think my last pickup it could be the tide changer it depends what we get from this prime though don't be stingy not now okay it's not fake you're not gonna like what you see i i mean you're not gonna like what you see okay see what you got okay okay no chance i did not the prime engram baby you also you you got every slot too i know i'm the king glhf my good man all right the ultimate 1v1 meta build 2 although ironically you still
