yo he's one get in there nice assess sorry about the spawn there ma okay and there he is i am free oh my god the flinch what is hitting me hi do you hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and the long-awaited return of a fallen king it's not me should i be offended if you think it's me well at one point you thought i was a king thanks king it's the one the only oh stringer you have to say like that some people think i say some things weird or enunciate something emphasize somewhere nope it's all it's all in the writing it's in the manual but hey menagerie weapons back baby and this one's a game changer not just because it's the osh stringer but because drumroll it's craftable that's right you're looking at the first craftable hand cannon which tons of people been feeding for now why is that a big deal well hand cannons have always been good ostringa has always been good as well so now it means let's say somebody wants a competitive hand cannon for pvp trials something like that instead of having to grind a whole bunch it'll be a lot easier to just craft the role you get not to mention now have handkin with enhanced perks and i gotta say i kind of popped off with my first ostringa roll so yeah i mean look at this hammer forged rifling we love range high caliber rounds because we like range outlaw for that quick reload time rampage for extra damage to excess it's just the origin tree reload speed i mean what do you do an icarus grip to help with the new airborne effectiveness deal but i mean that's like part of the course for every hand kitten ever so let's take it into the crucible and become the very thing we hate what what do we hate i don't know have had a lot of you um really making sure that i know how to play the game down in the comment section appreciate you pointing out some stuff some great stuff that you know i didn't realize you know like you're not in range of the gun you're using get closer oh my god you know it's like jesus how did i not think of that okay still haven't gotten a new crucible map though and i still haven't okay all right let's do this baby i'm loud and i'm proud and i'm not in the front it's me back there hey hi how are you guys folks lock in today we've got a great game for you we've got 11 guardians and mr fruit i have my hud disabled a classic mr fruit handicapping himself from the get-go and we're going to see if he can do anything and just how much the comment section's gonna backseat on how they think they could have played this differently because every time they play a game they never make mistakes or do anything incorrectly just like that they probably would have lived right there incredible it is back i'm alive and my australia is ready to to be honest though i kind of appreciate rigor mortis and all that you know like i'm glad that when i go out the last thing i'll be doing that was a that was a nade and a half my friend i am so okay it's good to know that i'm gonna exit the world i came in pooping maybe i didn't enter the world like that but yeah you know if i got to go out taking taken one last dump so be it oh there we go the classic three taparone and then the outlaw rampage proc and then the oh my god buddy we are both so bad i guess i'm a little just a little less bad not better do not mistake that for scale no that was a battle of oof-ness and not to say you're not skilled it's just you know we're both gamers it just so happens that during that gunfight was not our best can't always hit friend well clearly they would have made every fight engagement perfectly close quarters and did that trip mine just one-shot me folks looks like mr fruit's a little extra salty today guess you could say that fruit's spoiled all right did that like come on that was some low-hanging fruit nice one that's how it's done is so good it's insane just wait till i craft it just gotta get five deep side so i'm never going to craft it there ain't a star and hearing something i don't want high school musical it's just it went red nice one get out of my way uh okay yo ricochet it actually worked i bumped him off the wall i don't know if i've ever done that before i didn't even realize i could yo he's one get in there dude oh he's trying to run he and you're letting him you're letting him get away with this you god wasn't i'm sorry see that's my problem i always hold w you didn't want to you wanted to oh oh oh okay what am i what what are you friendly yeah what what is going on i'm panicking oh god why am i so bad okay let's throw this jesus i where are they coming from it's got like eight things on my radar i can't make l am i could go there oh my god get pooped on am i going crazy because it feels like i'm going crazy jeez i don't know if we were just playing ring around the rosie for just a little while there like i don't know how there's like three dudes on the radar and it took me that long to fight i'm like my radar gaslighting me hello interesting addition to the radar there bunji that we can both agree that those were apparently not yellow yellow yellow you know what a guardian does a guardian makes use of whatever tools he has you never give up do you defeated gaul pee pee poo poo ah thomas was lost to a permitted lens finally just crafted the father sends that's right i finally got all the wellspring patterns i am free oh my god the flinch people have always said it's a good pvp sniper and i got to agree i really like the scope but i never really had i just didn't every time i got on and had time and i was like okay finally i'll grind for the sniper rifle what it was never the sniper rifle it was always out of rotation so this morning buckled down i did what a guardian does like winded ooh that was close i think nice assessed sorry about the spawn there ma my grandma grandma what you doing not the flick of a finger okay oh no thank you that's death alley death row the alley of death the rule of death wow i just incredibly missed all those shots at the end there it was more impressive that i was able to so narrowly avoid his cafes guess i'm sorry ostringa i make you know i let you down and that was user error um still my super i've done anything with it but that's because again with the excess origin prey yeah anyway i get extra strength and discipline if i get a kill with this thing although i don't as long as my super exactly but don't actually does it add like 10 strength and and what do we have numbers cold hard where where where the carfax where's it oh okay um to excess i don't know how to how much oh i'm sorry that dude was like vibin i'm sorry that one's my bad buddy yeah we could we could have had something beautiful he's like ah that's got to be run out by now oh oh come on oh that is a titan wha what oh it's because what is this i wouldn't be caught dead wearing that so props to you we won baby how'd we do middle of the pack because it went by efficiency it's time for the patented rumble test test oh folks we're in for a treat looks like mr fruits going back to his patented rumble test he's avoided it for some times we're not sure why we've asked for comment but he's dodged us just like so many of his friends dodge him with so many games he wants to play if you lick if you listen you can faintly hear him sobbing [Music] that's that's so sad like comment favorite and subscriber whatever the fudge do um [Applause] no okay okay the inner accuracy how did i miss the headshot what is that what is that what is the the flip oh that's what we got we got three dinks throw that hail marinade what is hitting me who is hitting me okay i'm still rocking the grand overture because reasons i guess okay what in this hey yo get away okay level 99 magikarp oh my god level one magikarp that was like a level two magikarp it's so sad that yeah this is just battle of the papers over here oh but she you get that okay i'd reload you'll fight now i have rampage okay puppy oh okay i'm sorry i thought i won't find them fine your enemy is pushing for victory this rumble game's a wash i guess my dog's having a heart attack so um i don't even know twizzy's just kind of ran away with this one huh you hate this folks okay and there he is [Music] okay i said we got a mexican stand up the the guy that needs the last kill is going to clean you up there buddy all right well i didn't get top three which ruins my crucible thing okay that rumble test was not a patented rumble test that was an unpatented that was a scuffed unofficial unlicensed rumble test this one's official i got the paperwork i reset the tracker you know okay if i lose now it's because i was rushed picking the um colored thing that's wow that killed me quick well played i got fanged by the drain excuse me i'm blinded by that i can't see nothing i okay what is happening right now jesus my eyes didn't adjust i still didn't oh i can pick up my hand oh nice okay i i hate i hate having to look outside like that man can't see freaking nothing with my austrian car they're gonna get the heavy oh that little rascal or maybe they won't um wait i can't why is it so bright my eyes dude oh nice nice clean up there buddy oh nice yelling you sassy little baca uh grand over chuff missed sick and that's oh i had more bullets oops holy oh couldn't get away what what is his pound drum roll pretty good quick final range fire adapters yeah literally yeah the dream i was not strong enough i didn't grind it i couldn't i just couldn't bring myself to do it so you know what you deserve okay well you you don't get any settings too hot you're just burning everything anyway this bagel sucks man it's all charred i don't have my throwing hammer where the casuals at out here i can't i can't look at this look at this my eyes and apparently and i'm out there you know when at a crime scene when they have to outline where the victim's body was i'm that dude i don't know what job that is but apparently i was born for it and i am that's exactly what i'm doing right now i'm just preparing for the job yeah this dude's what i'm not even playing the same game i didn't okay and it's just now i'm flinched and he's chasing me and i'm just getting yeah that okay we traded sure yeah nothing will humble you like q and rumble with all the other 20 people playing rumble in destiny do i certainly wouldn't any time and okay i was really hoping that he was the one that died or the guy that would radiance yeah okay well this time i didn't have any my dogs weren't doing anything i got can we is can we get like an average average time for how quickly i've died on every single death because it's either been a one shot or like perfect hand cannon ttk it there's been like nothing in between essentially actually nothing in between because it's just one it's actually been very oh my are you kidding me oh thanks for the laugh and now i'm oh my god dude okay it's not even like really he's only running around with the outing the other only run around the story the other dude doesn't mess with his palindrome i get killed by super can a dude get a break and there it is and there it is yeah i hate to say this but we might need to retire the patented rumble test test i know that i know how could i how could i say such a such a thing what is wrong with you what is a stupid role it doesn't matter it's just a story high impact firmly planted with icarus it doesn't make sense he doesn't even need firmware freaking god well you know of all the new guns and after you know my smg and sidearm performance i was like okay well i'll i'll prove them wrong i'll perform decently with the ostringa and um yeah you know maybe it's just been copium maybe it's always my problem i am always the problem but even still the ostringa still carried me to how many kills did i get well that many more kills than i would have gotten before cause i would have never killed anyone without it it's a crutch and if you're good then think of a healthy person with a crutch well that'd actually kind of slow you down if you had to walk around the crotch okay but my prop it would prop you i give this a rumble patented test might be getting retired out of 10.
