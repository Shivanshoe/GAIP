hi ad hope you one my name's mr. fruit and welcome to dauntless I say that because I never really thought I would be here making a video on my own but here I am because I don't really know why I doubted it but it did it's come a very long way since I last played it and I've actually been grinding for a couple of hours it's it's oddly addicting oh my god finally a fellow PC user Oh another one I've been playing and the only people I've matched up against sir Nintendo switch Xbox one and ps4 so it's nice to see their other fellow PC players hey how are ya today I'm gonna be using the chains I freaking love these things and we're just gonna be using this fiery armor for now because it's the highest I got again I'm not like super far so I and I don't have like anything like super crazy but I'm gonna try my first Patrol so this is a neutral Patrol and I've actually never played a level it seems like there are three behemoths hmm we found a match oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute new I guess so it was just gonna be a random behemoth and we ended up getting the Shrike already up you pleb I swear to God and just so we're clear no this isn't an ad I seriously I just started playing I'm having a lot of fun with it so here we are they've added a lot to the game since I last played oh it gets me there's also a whole store ooh boy huh I'm about to mess around and buy something because they got dope looking trans bags let me tell you that but obviously here on the level one these little wispy things are kind of like tracks letting us know we're in the right direction of where the behemoth is but you can go around collecting items on the islands which you can use to you know make tonics or elixirs and whatnot so they're always good to go ahead and get I'm sure the Shrike isn't too far nobody has flared yet you typically flare once you've found it oh that's because I found it it's over here I'll use my flare friends it's over here haha what up now let me show you the chains dude it is so anime and I love everything about it they're just so much fun to use so we're just gonna start by going in oh oh so you really gonna start like that I like to focus the tail I'm a tail kind of guy you know I'm saying Wow alright just run straight and straight through me that's totally fine there are combos and whatnot you can do so if I spam the light attacks I just do some nice fast damage here or my heavy attack I got some big ol arranged I just let these ciders let's leave that range is that range well ah leave me alone okay says the snake yeah its range boy and then with my cue kind of like a special little ability I can use it to pull myself in or if I'm close back in wow you know saying like avoid danger just kidding I want to go back in but he didn't let me I'm not gonna let you hit me with that who do you think I are my favorite combo is pretty much it's like light light light heavy and repeat that one's a fun one Yoho nice invincible dodge there mister fruit and gravely so if you haven't played this game this is I did this it's it's kind of like Monster Hunter very similar to Monster Hunter and then all the different behemoths as they call them have different strategies Dino moves and when you're fighting them if you focus certain parts of their body and you do enough damage you like we knock them off in the fight and then you'll get that consumable to use this crafting later and whatnot it'll also do a bigger chunk of damage blah blah blah I'm sure you understand hey I don't like that bro come on try and hit me nope okay try it again ready skirt skirt no I don't know what he's doing he was just kind of oh oh dodged that one like a pro we're going for the tail we're going for that juicy tail come on give it to me girl no no no no you're not gonna hit me with that come on now give me a little more credit we're out and we're in we're at it we're in because if you do enough damage or you take off parts you'll stagger them we got to be taking off the tail here eventually oh but it's getting enraged oh it's pissed now it's like nah oh wait now is only momentarily enraged interested oh no now it is it is a hundred percent and raged come on come at me oleh now what the heck you're supposed to do what is that oh my god you're supposed to fly at me but whatever we'll make it work this is one beefy boy my fiancee came in here watching this like so like what do you do in this game I mean you wouldn't understand yet you lost she also I was like yeah that's kind of like Monster Hunter that guy stuff he's like yeah that doesn't interest me I'm like well I guess it's a guess it's a good thing you're not the one playing I also never really thought it would interest me but there's something there's something about hunting getting the resources fighting the bosses getting good grades playing with people using different weapon art types cuz they all play differently especially finding these chains these changes so much fun to me but doing that and then crafting all the stuff everything looks cool but not to mention it's free to play by the way we are gonna get this tail Jesus Christ I can't be the only one focusing this thing am i it kind of feels like it I'll be honest but hey alright alright he's had enough for now he's taking a break you couldn't run but you can know I'd I'm gonna flare even though we're all here up we did at the same time twinsies oh okay well watch out for that we have yet to destroy a single heart on this dude he's in raging again God can we get a body part before no more here it comes ready yeah just dodged right through that Oh a skirt come on one more time Oh a skirt alright everybody together now Oh see we knocked him out ere there that was good yeah yeah okay get behind him though okay I was gonna say that uh guarantees where you're not gonna get hit by it as much get him out of there or just take a fat lickin sweet Jesus I gotta use that yeah I gotta use a pot here hold on but I'm back in and I got hurt again and will you come over you know I'm activating this yeah the fact that we have not taken out a body part because as far as I'm aware we haven't it's incredible really by this point you definitely should have broken something it's maybe we're just not focusing the same thing at all Brenda Lee yeah we just want we're freeing you from the captivity of this archipelago yeah that's what we're doing you're welcome a little thanks would be an order oh we broke off something Shrike down I don't I don't know what that was but we did it so oh I think it's someone is back or perhaps part of his beak I am shocked we have not destroyed his tail I swear it I've been what I've been light now oh we got another part of him uh-huh he's feeling it now now if we just get this tail that would be great we get final huh I could finally rest easy I will not go silently through the noise until we take the tail we take the tail or if we lives it's like snowpiercer we take the engine or it's all for naught it feels good though learning the boss's movement patterns I see I was out of stamina okay that's why I couldn't - please it's gonna be so unsatisfying if we don't take out these this stupid tail I'm trying I'm not using my my chains that actually do extra damage to the tail could have done that that might have been the best bet but it just I don't have an upgrade as much so the DPS just isn't quite as potent oh it oh it's electrified hit the tail come on come on we might just kill it before we hit the tail off wow we are going in on this poor thing Oh we didn't get the tail thank you dude Oh what is this oh my god I don't know what that was but it looks like I found a new a new behemoth to hunt hey s plus and yet for most people take wait so like that yeah yeah I don't know it's like Monster Hunter you have to be into that kind of thing but I enjoy one at this point I'm still discovering so many new monsters like I think I just found a new one yeah the storm claw but there's so many behemoths there's like ten or eleven so far or something that I can play I need to go fight some ice behemoths though because I need more materials to craft some ice weapons to be better against fire people but I'm going to swap though to the ostian repeaters they're freaking guns did ya you thought it was all melee I mean for the majority yes yes it is but I've been having fun with these two so let's let's take these guys out on a little stroll huh alright opted to go for a frost Patrol so hopefully we can beat this and I can get some frost components to start crafting with I actually haven't fought either these guys so this is gonna be new to me wait a darn-tootin second it only gave us three players rather than four that's right they just want to give us hard no that's fine are we got this we do look good though I actually had to do like a level 5 fight which for me is pretty hard and it was only me and one other guy and the other guy just like died immediately I had to sell the entire fight there's like 20 minutes it was it was not easy oh my god alright I don't know what this guy does but I immediately don't like it so take this oh oh he's got a weak spot oh that's so cool I haven't used this ability yet on him but if we reload closer to him you're gonna see I kind of like sec the life force out of him it's kisses means I'm gonna do some extra damage speaking of which I can throw them a bomb right here he ever lands on that it's gonna give him a lickin huh you need to come a little bit closer oh but the weak spot on this first brought on his face oh yeah let me a reload here and then dodge at the last second though yeah what is he doing up there hey get down from there I'm gonna empower this I did not like that alright my mines are kind of useless here because it just keeps flying away from him didn't really think this through and I can't past all these trees ah he knows my weakness jumping oh oh that's my mind right there oh my god that was a you get see how much damage there's a lot I was crispy what was that oh wow God I tried to avoid it and it didn't oh okay I just hit him in the foss with my mind that worked I got a reload close to get the Empowered abilities I'm gonna shoot his tail bone that's his leg mr. fruit but whatever I tried the very best that I could and it just wasn't enough then put up a little Joey's shield while I'm near him though I'm taking a bit of a look and so let's take a potion no hole why dodge just in time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay we destroyed something nicely done guys I don't know what we destroyed but he does not seem too happy about it he is enraged so empowered abilities though there we go I'm gonna hit his tail here no wait maybe I can't for some reason that didn't target his like weak spot his tail or maybe it's just not showing I seem to be doing 137 though which is definitely more oh oh we knocked up one of his feathers brutal I love it drop a mine oh oh you just hear that crackle and then I'm gonna go for the tail yeah it doesn't seem to be applying a weak spot on the tail but whatever I'm just gonna keep shooting it he's running we got a runner I'm coming friend help his own do way ah hit him right in the knee right in the kisser that's a lot of damage oh my god oh my god he does not like that understandably so that's a lot of damage you're taking there yeah I can't believe I thought Stan okay and oh he's hurting we did something and by week it appeared to be my friends but ah budge I'm up I'm up - pop hits you right in the forehead I'm frozen again help me I'm trying ah God I'm frozen again he's way too far you can see the range fell off on this though is real oh my god I can't believe I voted that right in the knee finish him off boys let me put my mind here go ahead and step on that yeah ah oh hey we yeah we did it nice work guys I was frozen when we did solo anti-climactic but let's go this grave has been slain I will say too since I played before the onboarding experience way better as a new player they go through everything way better than they did before well now I can make the winter ice sword so I think I shall hope you guys enjoyed that video thank you much for watching every lesson fantastic I'll talk to you and the next one farewell [Music]
