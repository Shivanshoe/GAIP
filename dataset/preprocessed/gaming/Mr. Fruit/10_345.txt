cinnamon's ready oppa uh they're the cutest [Music] no the city is vibing everyone's feel great child labor uh what message do you carry owl friend it looks like we've got a rampage on our hands oh no what does that mean a huge pack of monsters in a giant stampede they attack the village in a frenzied rage nobody knows why this happens but it came close to wiping out our village last time that was through ram vision all of a sudden i've got news for you got a message from the guild this morning says that you are now a certified hunter congratulations by the way mister never heard the good news you're finally official hunter wow congratulations now where should we start ah of course the market of mystery kegera the merchant exit the tutorial no or i mean wait yes that's fun i got some new dicks i'm looking good and i'm going on my very first hunt oh i'm nervous oh i don't think i'm ready but i'm gonna do it anyway hey hi how are ya they've got some wonderful training quests for me back to basics already that i'm a master learning to ride and the basics of capturing monsters probably important i should probably do those but instead i'm going to hunt some espions i feel pity for these peons they stand no chance against the legendary monster hunter mr fruit it's time to begin our quest now most importantly as we can see here bottom left it appears that um that's where i am we go oh it appears i found some already check this out yeah so that sucked up get them boys look at that my little cat and dog are helping well cinnamon's being a little useless here he's oh never mind he's throwing some boomerangs there we go jagras has been slain yet another oh what do we have here i'm gonna enter my demon phase [Music] okay wow that was easy oh wait a second it's just merely wounded nope okay oppa's kind of a natural at this i'm just swinging at nothing but you meanwhile are killing it i went with dual blades why because freaking shoe blades is better than one duh let me carve up this bull fangirl it's a trophy to carry home to show my alphaness sorry yeah sorry about this but you're dead in fact i think it'd be worse if i just put your carps carps corpses to waste don't mind me don't mind me just taking me some digress hide all right just need to kill six more jagras oh wait wait a second i'm gonna catch this cloth fly there's all these insects around here that i can grab for temporary buffs speaking of buffs what do we have here a flashbug flushes brightly on impact i could oh oh my god there's so much how about i get a little latchberry what is that dung my favorite it is we've got ourselves some herbs to craft some wonderful things i believe if i'm not oh yeah that's gonna give us some stamina a flash fly on my eyes a bone pile yeah i got so much stuff to do here let me grab some of this wait a second battle is upon us my friends go oh look at that i'm teaming up with my friend here now granted it's important to note not quite as effective as my dual blades but effective nonetheless all right check this out ready set up hazard i'm not doing anything i'm just making noises but i'm really good at that it stood no chance so according to this i'm on top of several things just not sure what things what do we have over here stamina use down that's very helpful you gotta love that come forth yeah wait a second a little squirrel a stink mink excrete a type of pheromone capable of attracting monsters oh i could use that to attract others to my location uh i don't think i'm gonna have a problem with that though so i'm probably just going to hop off and go about my own way here and strike yeah oh no match i might be a fledgling monster hunter but i'm soon to be the best around finish your mother down and there we go they're wait no they're just merely stunned flashed there i see come on now finish them up you're letting them suffer come on that's just not humane always saying these are izuchi's i'll take it but i don't need them oh what are these things yellow got myself some extra weapons some other things how about you don't yell at me oh it appears i found my play unsheathed this and always saying you know what you know what you know what i haven't done yet check this out yeah get me right into the heat of things because i welcome death activate demon mode you stand no chance they did not like that and for what are you sir the heck a snow beetle you seem far from home how about this yeah that's what i thought buddy am i swinging at the air a little bit yeah but like i said you know i'm new to this takes a little while my character is just a little too gung-ho the adrenaline gets flowing you know what are you gonna do oh they didn't think i could reach this but check this out i can't cuz i can climb vines [Music] i collected endemic life just in time for it to not be useful because i'm leaving yeah just another day here and [Music] whatever this village is quest complete yeah i'll go ahead and take all the spoils of war thank you very much yeah level increased oh with uh open cinnamon or level three they're nuts an optional subquest has been completed heck yes it has we go i'll take that which quest would you like all right i'm gonna go slay some azuchi oh it's nighttime we have the beauty oh wait a second they didn't think i'd check over here did they they didn't think i'd check over here but there's a great wire bug where's this tank whoa and a bitter bug to top it all off wow it wasn't that convenient skirt skirt okay wow i'm good at my job oh what are you're so cute what are you yeah i'll figure that out later after i've slain you then i'll identify your bodies wow okay we'll get open cinnamon really just getting in there oh wait a second they were feigning death kill them slay thy beasts small monsters it's updated oh i think it's working you know they are kind of cute and i feel a little bad but then again oh wait what what is this thing hello can i fight you oh ow ow it's like it's uh what the it's a roman calico or something i don't want to have to do this to you but you've left me with no choice you have engaged upon me is it oh oh wow that animation was so sick oh wait it's fine for now oh oh what did i get feline material look at that check this out skirt that's right you can drift what more could you want i mean that's honestly what sold me i can ride my dog out yes please i'm gonna hit with them pop hop off skirt enter demon mode and then that's what i thought i am inhuman you're dead oh you're down how about another one skirt okay or i'll just miss hey where are you running to where you running to get back here you coward adding sound effects does increase your damage that's totally built into the game and i didn't make that up was this thing a shoot patch it's a unique item i appeared to whoa i found something rare i guess not that i'm surprised of course i'll collect you and you and literally anything that i'm able to collect here's how these games work if it tells me i can collect something i'm gonna collect it even if i have no idea what it does or if i'll ever use it but you know i'm gonna collect it is it swat in the field you come across shrubs and plants called sending sprigs attack these brush to cut them down well then what do we have here anyone hiding in here huh oh there was i'm sorry to disrupt your natural habitat in your home but the game told me to so blame them thanks we're here for these beasts these diamonds yeah i just realized that the people we fought for were not a zucchinis whoops i'll be oh be gone demon mode activated that's what i thought and stay out of my way ah look at me flailing that's what i'm saying man i'm crazy i'm crazy for every for every hit you miss the next one does more damage at least that's what i tell myself makes me feel better nailed it sheath my weapon and collect my prize they're trying to tell me my people are down here well i certainly hope so oh my gosh that can't be good on the knees well hello friends wait we're attracting others what are those things i'll find out later i don't know but they're approaching us and i don't like it i don't like the way they're looking at me quite frankly they give me the heebie-jeebies oh we got some friends over here one more oh okay i definitely didn't miss that sir here we go she's thigh weapon can we get up here oh i'm thinking so you are so agile my friend okay it appears that those we are looking for oh wait a second is this some little hidden cave what do we have here the you you know what i am genuinely impressed at your ability what is this restores stamina when picked up and can be stored wow look at this shortcut can we get through here but or do i need to okay i should probably dismount oh hello oh spiderweb ooh oh those we are searching for lie above us again whoops my band oh you know what i can probably climb this the whole way huh why didn't i think of that it's a good question i really hope these vines could hold me i did just eat a two couple too many rolls for lunch so don't look below by the way i'm looking below i'm even more look at these guys all right well if they can do it i can do it no excuses it's time for basil for the price of one it's a sunday special but i think their friend fast approaches yes he does can i help you another customer perhaps sorry but we're closed oh main objective complete an interesting while you're out adventuring your weapon can dull and you'll need to use a wet stone now thankfully for me i just finished my mission so it doesn't matter but moving forward that's good to know take me home to paradise city with the guilds of plenty and the quest i'll defeat e one last scenic view enjoy while we can friends [Music] back to the village two
