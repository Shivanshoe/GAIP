happy holidays today i will be reading the little match girl by hans christian anderson which is available in the public domain it was dreadfully cold it was snowing fast and was almost dark as evening came on the last evening of the year in the cold and the darkness there went along the street a poor little girl bare-headed and with naked feet when she left home she had slippers on it is true but they worked much too large for her feet slippers that her mother had used until then and the poor little girl lost them in running across the street when two carriages were passing terribly fast when she looked for them one was not to be found and the boy seized the other and ran away with it saying he would use it for his cradle someday when he had children of his own so on the little girl went with her bare feet that were red and blue with cold in an old apron that she wore were bundles of matches and she carried a bundle also in her hand no one had bought so much as a bunch all the long day and no one had given her even a penny or little girl shivering with cold and hunger she crept along a perfect picture of misery the snowflakes fell on her lung flaxing hair which hung in pretty girls about her throat but she thought not of her beauty nor of the cold lights gleamed in every window and there came to her the savory smell of roast goose for it was new year's eve and it was of this which she thought in a corner formed by two houses one of which projected beyond the other she sat cowering down she had drawn under her little feet but still she grew colder and colder yet she dared not go home for she had sold no matches and could not bring a penny of money her father would certainly beat her and besides it was cold enough at home for they had only the house roof above them and though the largest holes had been stopped with straw and rags there were left many through which the cold wind whistled and now her little hands were nearly frozen with cold alas a single match might do her good if she might only draw it from the bundle rub it against the wall and warm her fingers by it so at last she drew one out how it blazed and burned it gave out a warm bright flame like a little candle as she held her hands over a wonderful little light it was it really seemed to the little girl as if she'd sat before a great iron stove with polished brass feet and brass shovel and tongs so blessedly it turned that the little maiden stretched out her feet to warm them also how comfortable she was but lo the flame went out the stove vanished and nothing remained but the little burn match in her hand she rubbed another match against the wall it burned brightly and where the light fell upon the wall became transparent like a veil so that she could threw it into the room a snow white cloth would spread upon the table on which was a beautiful china dinner service while a roast goose stuffed with apples and prunes steamed famously and sent forth a most savory smell and what was more delightful still and wonderful the goose jumped from the dish with knife and forks still in its breast and waddled along the floor straight the little girl but the match went out then and nothing was left to her but the thick damp wall she lighted another match and now she was under a most beautiful christmas tree larger and far more prettily trimmed than the one she had seen through the glass doors at the rich merchants hundreds of wax tapers were burning on the green branches and gay figures such as she had seen in the shop windows looked down upon her the child stretched out her hands to them then the match went out still the lights of the christmas tree rose higher and higher she saw them as stars in heaven and one of them fell forming a long trail of fire now someone is dying murmured the child softly for her grandmother the only person who had loved her and who was now dead and told her that whenever a star falls a soul mounts up to god she struck yet another match against the wall and again it was light and in the brightness there appeared before her the dear old grandmother bright and radiant yet sweet and mild and happy as she had never looked on earth oh grandmother cried the child take me with you i know you will go away when the match burns out you too will vanish like the warm stove the splendid new year's feast the beautiful christmas tree and lest her grandmother should disappear she rubbed a whole bundle of matches against the wall and the matches burned with such a brilliant life that it became brighter than noon day her grandmother had never looked so grand and beautiful she took the little girl in her arms and both flew together joyously and gloriously mounting higher and higher far above the earth and for them there was neither hunger nor cold nor care they were with god but in the corner at the dawn of day sat the poor girl leaning against the wall with red cheeks and smiling mouth frozen to death on the last evening of the old year stiff and cold she sat with the matches one bundle of which was burned she wanted to warm herself poor little thing people said no one imagined what sweet visions she had had or how gloriously she had gone with her grandmother to enter upon the joy of a new year [Music] [Music] so [Music] you
