alrighty everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the channel in today's video we're playing some more smite it's been a little while but i've got the smite bug again we recently played when the whole avatar thing was going on and i just want to play again and today is a very special video because we're gonna be doing something i've never done before in the game what am i talking about let's get to it so in today's video i am gonna be trying something new something scary i don't know if i'm ready for it i will be using uh nemesis because she looks pretty sweet because i'm gonna try jungle for the first time in smite now i'm a jungle maine in league of legends but obviously jungle work a lot differently i get the premise obviously a lot of kind of stuff but like pathing and all that kind of stuff i don't really know how many that's going to work so we're going to use nemesis apparently i have a skin too so i could use a skin and god speed and i will say i do have a recent pro build pulled up so that i kind of have a basic idea of what to build or what abilities they like to use and then aside from that i'm just gonna do what i do and poop on kids unless i don't get jungle in which case ignore everything i've said because we're gonna have to improvise and while we wait to find a match don't forget to hydrate got a new water bottle still a gallon though you know me rehydrating drinking about a gallon and a half recently and uh you know what i feel great i feel great this one has a straw too it's very fun hey we got it okay so i'm gonna choose nemesis i lock that in bada bing bada boom everybody's activating boosters oh jesus thanks i guess okay so we have here uh tanooki looking teemo son of a gun we got amir a sport persephone mid and amaterasu as solo uh the only amaterasu i know is an unquenchable black flame narutophians out there you you know what i'm you know what i'm saying anyway let's just get into it recently since coming back it's just kind of been like you know what i'm going to record what i want to play right now let me you know i just want to make sure we're having fun with it i can't please everybody but hopefully you guys still enjoy the content for me and for all that it is regardless so let's go ahead and hop in here uh i'm gonna be honest i don't really know where i start i feel like i'm supposed to go for movement buff i feel like that's what i'm supposed to start with i'm not sure and then other people get the other things i don't know but moving fast seems good and i need to get an ability slice and dice so if you're curious what my abilities do hey so am i i believe this one i do damage in front of me we're gonna find out together i know one does damage another one lets me uh dash twice another one shields me a lot of cool stuff going on that's all i know but i got this giant old sword like this whack whack i'd say i'm doing pretty good in fact you know oh this guy's helping with the buff oh thank you sir well are you just the best it's actually kind of telling me where to go this is nice and for whatever reason i decided to not buy any potions because i'm a big dum-dum so we're gonna go over to okay i guess are we is this normal to just kind of like double up like this i'm not really complaining but and then i know i'm supposed to give you blue buff i know solo laners like the blue buff so i can't even pick up another buff anyway so you take that and then let me hit this totem oh wait oh you know what oh i'm i'm kind of ready to go all in it's not nearly pushed up enough though oh he definitely just warded it okay all right well played well played let me finish this totem got it we're good we're good great stuff buddy so i'm gonna come in slice this guy whack whacking with my sword he's slowed oh he's so close to dying but he's not gonna die where'd the other guy go well i got close to killing somebody so that's what matters oh wait is he coming back well i'm coming back for him that's all i know ready for this go my minions whack whack let's go give me that easy kill and then i'm i'm double uh slice diced uh blink i can't dash is that the word i'm looking for something like that okay i'm gonna take one of those thank you very much i'm gonna get this ability all right things are going well things are going well i got i already got a kill honestly feeling pretty good about myself i'm gonna shield myself i'm running out of mana how much money we got okay i don't know when is a good time to back do i buy boots first so many questions so many questions but we'll figure that out you know what let's just go ahead and back what um so what am i buying blood forge and we'll just we'll just buy this and then i don't know what's coming health potion let's buy two of these okay i'm still an incredible noob at this game so bear with me but i'm doing my best and then oh i'm coming buddy i'm coming oh this guy's so done this guy's so done stupid what are you doing bob oh you're so done for aries there we go and i'm back what up what up yes okay it's a party now what the fudge everybody and their mom up in here okay i don't know who's their jungler but i'm just kind of whacking it whoever shows up oh this guy's getting greedy oh but maybe because he's gonna get the kill uh oh i'm almost here buddy hold on i slowed him oh my god we're the best we're the best we're the best you survived right wait don't tell me dad wait did you oh fudge i think you might have died whatever that was a noble cause right i'm gonna take all this xp don't mind me i'm just gonna omega push here i'm oom so i gotta be a little careful but [Music] oh we're leveling okay great level this up i got my ultimate two and i know what this does i target somebody and it shreds their defenses and stuff is that tsukiyomi i think that must be their jungler i wanna help midland but i feel like i'm just gonna die oh but this guy's getting way too thirsty okay okay yep i used my ult on this guy so he's running out of defenses oh he's so weak come on come on come on come on come on no the winions no oh i'm the worst jungle can you gank please oh i want to i'm doing it [Music] there we go okay nailed it all right now get this guy oh he's done for oh aries you poor soul you poor soul boosh let's go okay that was big that was big two quick kills i almost messed up the tower die but then i was like nah i'm not going to and in fact i think i'm going to go kill left lane if he decides to stick around because it will 100 be to his detriment then again though don zabarro or whatever could easily kill you hello let me get this kill thank you i just say you already have like eight million come on now good good very good oh wait oh come on they agreed to surrender your boy starts popping off and then they're like you know what no thanks really really 5-1-1 we go again here we go please give me jungle so i think i kind of got it i go speed buff and then xp camp or something then maybe we already start looking for ganks maybe solo laner joins me i don't know and yeah we're good also artemis or nemesis looks sick of the little purple flare on their shoulders i'm a sucker for purple so all right let me get this and then i'll just follow you i think he knows my pathing more than me yeah yeah right here we go yeah just keep whacking things i think you're doing great all right damage is already taken okay i see him already crossing the jungle so maybe write a task or whatever wait oh my god he's right on me yeah what up bud what up i think i win this one oh never mind you got your ability back if i wasn't already weak i i can't buy anything i'm a daddy an ally has been slain oh he's fighting somebody in the jungle i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming i see this i got my eyes on this keep fighting keep fighting don't be screwed don't be scared he's weak but he might not be weak enough [Music] dang it if i had already been four maybe i could have gotten him dang it he's so weak the sad thing is i missed my my sweeping ability at the very beginning i think that would have been enough damage to finish him off so all my fault didn't have to be like this okay i'm just gonna i think those expire after a certain amount of time oh wait what what's going on here oh oh oh oh go go go i'm blinking oh no you don't just barely took my blink and both my dashes he probably didn't think i was gonna make it but we did now i'm counter-jungling baby give me all your xp camps wait a second hello sir oh i'm um i'm um i'm um brother i move i guess i'll board right here for now a little late feels like right lane is still primed now if i want to try and maybe head over there oh all right i tickled him i tickled him he knows what's up he knows what's up that's right what you gonna do what are you gonna do i'm coming to help i think it's too late but i'm coming oh could we tower dive that i might be able to and i'm thinking about it oh am i thinking about it i think i'm gonna do it i'm gonna act up let's go here we go get that xp boy careful let's go okay he's in my jungle i just saw him in my jungle okay apparently he didn't want me to take that thing i don't know what he's talking about or why it's a bad thing but he seems to be a little upset at me there we go another kill let's go now we're talking is my buff almost up kind of so he's probably counter ganking all my stuff or jungling so i'll get what i can hear i'm almost um need to remember that apparently scorpion can heal you i didn't know that was a thing i just went full ham i didn't need to do that but i did it and i'm alive to tell the tale so let's go it's looking like they're gonna fight to the death but i think our friend wins well maybe not oh wait they've had a cease fire he's still going in okay this is it this appears to be it somebody's gonna oh no oh no oh no no no i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming there we go and i i stopped my dash i canceled my dash so i could do it again i'm so proud of myself i'm learning we got the kill oh what a day what a lovely day and now i'm gonna try and come in for this other gank i might not have needed to use my alter but i did anyway and this guy is no blink rune so i am very enticed to uh poop on this guy oh yeah i i don't even think he realizes there we go canceling the dash yeah he he dashed right through my main damage ability so that was unlucky timing but we managed anyway we couldn't blink or anything either easy peasy let me take this xp camp oh jesus okay it's going down oh here we go we're fighting we're fighting we're fighting oh and it's going well it's going very well aries is almost dead aries is almost there we go there we go keep going keep going oh yeah yeah he's going in he's going in i'm coming i'm coming coming oh yeah what's up what's up i'm gonna hold you so oh oh it's gonna hold you so hard you got a lucky kid this is going well i like nemesis nemesis is fun and greater scorpion down oh i see him over here i see him come here you son of a gun oh i'm i'm way too deep what the fudge am i doing uh yeah i'm a daddy but you got the kill [Music] okay whoops yeah i gave him a shutdown ah i got i got really young i don't know i just used my abilities so i just it was like a sunk cost balance he was like well wait no even though i did not need to do that so mobby but yeah they are destroying right side well done yeah what now what now i'm trying yep rada toscar whatever's running out no he's not okay i gotta kill i'm sorry but i have to run from the others i'm sorry i only just got my ult if i'd had that earlier oh i don't think you need me though i feel like this will just be a kill steal and he'll be very unhappy with me but you got friends now i'm here oh he's altered he's slowed all of his defenses are being removed come on don't run for me why are you so tanky i can't kill him i don't think fudge man it's lame i don't know what my items do i just know they help me so i don't know if i'm supposed to find a way to like capitalize like hey i know i have this item so that allows me to do this so i can be a little greedy here or x and y i don't know that i just know me stronger so rely on yourself oh no left lane i'll go get music kill don't worry oh okay it's my bad maybe that's my bad maybe that's my bad what'd you say your friend is so weak oh you got to be kidding me i got him yo can i 1v2 this yo try and take me oh okay okay yeah now there's too many ah [Music] i'm trying we shouldn't even like touch this turret though what's going on here i'll help you with this guy though yeah i think we should just take this turret honestly somebody wants to help i don't think we can fight fire giant nobody's dead pyromancer's good though i'm down with that get on down with your bad self i should not shoot good kill good kill easy now kill this person you showed up at the wrong time my friend i altered i don't know what's happening oh we're pooping on that's what's happening let's go attack fire well this is embarrassing because there's nothing to attack oh now i'm pooping on this guy there we go just keep going feeling real good now attack what we can they're all they're all going to respond soon but we might be able to get phoenix okay i don't know if he's tanky but he wants to take it first so i'm not gonna say no i'll help with the phoenix we got this we got this we got this easy easy easy now let's run yeah we're just pooping on kids now i don't even need the buff but i guess i'll just do it for xp i don't know if that's like a bad thing to do all right we got the numbers though i think now we just kind of i guess i could have pushed right links their minions are pretty pushed up we might just win down mid right now though all right my team doesn't even need me let's go boys all right that's a better surrender let's go okay i'm getting the hang of this jungle thing great great teamwork everybody did a lot of player damage feels good eleven three and five most kills tied for least amount of deaths come on not bad huh not bad for a pleb like myself but barely has any idea what he's doing let me know if you guys want to see more of this there's a specific god you want to see or if you just want to follow along as i try to not suck at the game with that said i want to thank all much for watching happiest fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] you
