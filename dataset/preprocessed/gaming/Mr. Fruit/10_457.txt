hi everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to among us let's go here's something i never get imposter because like let's go i'm feeling a lack of energy can i get a party around the middle everyone gather in a circle i am in a circle that's hard all right put your hands in the middle this is the worst circle i'm in the middle where are you pulling all right we're gonna have a good that's funny i'm impossible oh my god yo that's how we start these things off baby that's how we get it i called it bro you do the chant and it works ideally i like to you know get the first few games in while i'm an innocent to um kind of feel out the lobby you know but uh is what it is i guess this is a ballsy maneuver for sure i'm a snipe vent for lights wait for it wait for it got him nice nice nice nice nice nice noise let's get it started good day good good day no not donkey i trust how do you do so i i would like to do an audit of your records who did like [Music] i did just you fruit yeah that's true shady saw me coming out like a scaredy cat to specimen shady so you're coming up coming up from where lights like wait um the office with me to light some why didn't you come with me because i wasn't playing with that and i didn't see you but i i guess you must have been hugging my booty or something but all right so check this out fruit i need to know you were coming up from where it was coming up from uh the download and near uh weapons okay did anybody else come up there i mean i passed mr fruit but he was going into med bay yeah that was the afternoon crafty shopkin that'd be a good thing to share the body is in the left side above tree and the the little thing where you vent out all the leaves on the way to the light on on vitals he did not die until after lights were out bryce was that you that was saw me in the room doing the files we were chilling we were the [ __ ] guys okay yeah i ran i ran by your little suggesting that this kill is relatively fresh i saw a shark and shady in med bag well here's what i know i didn't i'm not liking home right now yeah all i know is i haven't heard from like three people so i'm skipping and i was like i haven't heard from shark this whole thing true then i was like wait you're the only man that's putting yourself in the area of the crime yeah i did like all the way to specimen it's not even that close christian i thought he killed me yeah it is it's a leading up to lights mr fruit yes i wish i didn't even come that way i would recently went the opposite way of the body god dude i do lights and they're like you know what that's kind of success i even waited a while what is love baby don't hurt me they always trust me him alive i don't know how i'm gonna do this all right all right bridge going in dubs though well dangerous lit tool dangerous or it's not or it's not call reactor call reactor lock [Music] don't stay near the door they can see your name don't do it bridge go go go we gotta sabotage the thing we're going i'm helping [Music] easy clap [Laughter] do it do it bridge i think we would have won right there wouldn't we we would have just won if i'm not mistaken that'll assess me i'm not gonna lie not a good look for me not a good luck we got going on over here skirt oh holy what's up crafty all right um so green and yellow are both dead in specimen specimen specimen who was last in specimen sneaky i would suggest probably the imposters but again okay i don't know i couldn't be wrong but it's very if this was before or after the reactor dude all i know is me and crafty were on the right side for a long time and then i come to the left side and then like five of you come pouring out of there what the hell took i would say it's probably reactor it took so long because they're probably trying to keep people away from it i was in weapons and then i went up to go do reactor because you guys were taking so goddamn long why did you come from the right side of weapons then if you were in weapons did you double back and then go up no because i checked the door because it was closed it closed like as soon as i went over there and then i double backed yeah to go back up to reactor i thought it closed after i might be wrong i don't want a third imposter mr fruit rob crafty do you guys know anything i i i all i know is i was in med bay doing the temperature thing and then crafty popped out of nowhere where did you come from rob how did you get to the temperature thing from like mid-back yeah no no where did you come over how did you get to that point though what did you do because i tacked at the beginning i went towards the drop ship that went towards the entrance of like the med bay area i'm gonna be really honest i think bridge is lying to me i i don't have time and you're really gonna third and foster yeah i understand that but i gotta vote somebody wow only two we didn't know yeah two people didn't vote wow i didn't use your vote show up i may have thought i wasn't i have no clue oh oh hell yeah all right yo yo i swear i voted didn't i vote did i skip my vote i swear i voted did did bridge not vote bro i swear i voted right i voted among us but my second imposter is a crewmate like i clicked the button i clicked the button didn't i i swear i clicked the button what the fudge was all kind of sauce bro i have no idea where to go someone's in office some of these snap lots all right let's see if they uh come over here hopefully they uh i don't want to kind of close the doors on oh hi there okay yep it's fruit sorry it's fruit why is it fruit yeah what um i just i feel like who else would it be i don't think it's i don't think it too bryce unless i'm third impostering so who do you think it is fruit i got nothing for you hundred percent voted for breakfast oh no i didn't end up voting i'll be honest because i think bridge ended up voting bryce i think he did too i panicked both didn't vote [Music] i panicked bryce was saying thing is like 10 seconds left and i didn't want that to be in my hands um okay tell me a story as to why i should believe both of you because i think at this point i got the deciding vote yeah well wait yeah it can't be bryce right because he voted he voted rob off unless this is omega brain so definitely voted definitely um i mean but i got nothing on i literally have nothing on crafty either i've had enough in this whole game mr fruit you have to suss him it's the only way that i do not vote you in this situation i mean i have to it's 50 50. and unless you're all mega brainy me then it's crafty but i don't have anything i didn't even see quit after this round granted i didn't see you either so i don't know i want to believe you so badly but you wouldn't it's awesome and it's crafty i'm saying i didn't even vote well it has to be crafty but i just don't have any argument i'm gonna vote you fruit if i'm wrong i'm really sorry but i feel like it has to be you because why wouldn't you just suss him immediately if you knew i was good and i got bridge i didn't know you would go right i voted bridge okay bryce man like he was like everybody is stoned oh okay i'm fine being crewmate you know it's been a lot of imposter it's been a good bit of imposter you know and i think it's time we take a break i don my hat because it's detective fruit time okay i'm not going all the way into med bay because ohm's just excuse me looking to kill me he keeps checking back on me i don't really like it what do we got here we got bridge and home okay blue and um bridge i think that's bridge bridge and home bridging oh bridge no i didn't oh bridge left where's oh if ohm's dead oh i made it out that makes me sad dang it someone murdered shark in the bottom of the o2 area i'm guessing it's either whoever went up to do lights or it's just someone who's gone wait who is that o2 tell me wait guys guys who was that o2 elementary who was that o2 i wasn't specimen i can clear i can clear the gnome on this one i uh i fixed the lights which could be confirmed oh did he yeah i thought no i stopped in the middle and did the maze which i think don saw me do and then i went right to fix lights right after did he come from the inside or the outside that's the big question he was already there when uh fruit night came from i was i was on it why would i fix my own lights and there was no body in there right so how why would i do that wait wait wait wait wait bridge there was someone else we spotlights was there i thought there was who was it no it was like i saw us there's kevin where were you you and me and i thought so much i can't see more than three people at a time it's not crafty and why is that because i just checked him and he's he verified he was that guest with what with what is that temperature [Music] we're forgetting we're forgetting the dark horse here shady you haven't said anything where you've been yes i'm on the right side of the map i was just walking into med baby when the body got called i checked vitals and saw that i was spamming vitals while lights were out and then i saw shark die like as they was two seconds after lights were out and then i was like i'm gonna go look for the body it's probably in med bay but it wasn't in med bay i'm skipping that's just disgusting that's all right you were on vitals first second not first second for when lights went out when lights went out i did both my admin i did my swipe oh please i did my swipe and i did my uh okay shady's actually not even case nine is the only sus one in my mind i am innocent light song i just think it's brit not bridging him for that kill a soft clear not a hard clear soft clear i'm a little sus on dawn we never really got much out of her um and then maybe wow maybe crafting home or wait a second who's that gas what you can vent from o2 to ass can't you wait a second wait a second oh i'll just spy spy spot whoever comes in for a drive-by hopefully unless it is bryce in which case well played no one's making a move i thought there was supposed to be a way to see heartbeats to like suss out imposters but i never bothered to figure out i think i'd do something like what's oh my god life's got no no ah glorious i saw it on camera oh so tonight for you don killed him on camera let's go kevin wait a minute wait a minute i have something to contribute cause you saw me check him right right after you right you were following after but the kill was already reported never mind never mind reported but i thought if fruit didn't report i was gonna say he was guilty i'm dumb let's go kevin yeah fruit was standing at the vitals with somebody else i literally saw a god kill yeah bryce what are you just left that route don what's your defense that's all i could say that i was on the rocket ship doing like the little squarey thing i believe her let's vote fruit i'm down it's dawn i voted for the love of god oh my god for the love of god every time i vote saying it's vicky uh casey i was on cameras sorry kill him with my own two eyeballs uh rob what were you doing before the body was called i did not vote you fruit i was beaming because i mean i must have showed up to that body like like i probably was like watching it literally fall over i just seen rice and i couldn't i couldn't get vision of who was around there unfortunately they must have ended or i don't know but our boy kevin he said no oh i got you and i said kevin thank you now unfortunately bryce is the only one that could clear me there but i feel like kevin could clear me and if kevin did that kevin cleared me and i got to think kevin's good why would he just rat at his dude like that unless he thought i saw who killed him but i don't think so in which case he just could have teamed up on me red blue went right red went up blue is shady went okay holy jesus we got okay so there's a dead body it's either bridge oh where's shady coming from where's wait wait no one's dead uh what's rob doing though don't kill me rob shitty good wife somebody come with me especially i'm just so what they're trying to get me away from a kill where'd they kill where'd they kill i'm gonna see who shows up last bridge showed up last to my knowledge but he could have just gone right and then left it's gotta be that body they they would have called us away from the dead body yep yep on the right tower so bridge case night crafty on the right that means it's mr fruit no if it's right tower that's bridge i never went up to the right tower i ran out from med bay because i i thought what happened was a kill was placed somewhere at the bottom of the map and so the killed reactor so what i was going to do is i was going to see who comes last to the reactor i didn't see anyone coming up but when i was running left the last person to run from right reactor was bridge so it could be bridge unless bridge you can tell us who where bridge you were the last one to show up who else i was looking at vitals while reacting was happening and that's why it took so long i just thought then i ca i did come up from the right side like i went to the right and then went left i didn't go up to the right reactor i didn't look at what the right that's all i needed i saw on the right side though and crafty were there as well and left yeah if i killed the guy on the right side why would i go to the left side crafty where'd you come from before when you went right side who else was there i came up from i didn't go wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on bridge showed up right as the button was pushed the killer pushed the button yes rich could not have pushed the button with the ramp when you guys were there push the button yeah because the reactor was going off i left shady behind and so when i up when we were on the button push i'm like why isn't shady doing it wait so then the last person the last person i saw going right tower was rob what wait wasn't the last person you saw me yeah well no no i thought you really wanted me a second ago well no i thought i thought you came down right go for it okay he was just following me it was weird shoot dude i have to because bridge could the killer push the button okay vote rob thanks to you boys i skipped oh shoot i try and play detective and this is what happens okay i swear from my vision it looked like bridge was coming down like this so i was like okay he must have been there now granted i did see rob coming behind me but i don't know where he went and i just don't know how um wouldn't have missed him but i guess he killed him maybe vented or maybe he killed and did the sonic strap just went behind the tower and nobody bothered to check the tower i don't know but i'm pretty sure it's rob pretty sure i got a little two gung-ho and then i thought i was honest i'm in bridge said something but yeah i should have voted right plus it could have been like why would i vote immediately if i was the imposter you know like why would i do that i'm so scared dude robbie and case and i were running after me see i was running i was trying to follow rob because he was going up to kill you i thought i don't know i don't know who's the imposter legacy and vote rob as he asked yes what yes oh my god in his memory robbie [Music] k-pop are we honoring fruit i'll honor fruit are you we're really doing this honoring system wait wait wait wait wait wait i don't know wait i don't like the fact that case nine said he's gonna because case9 but if we get rid of robbie we get rid of somebody else that was not accounted for during the last reactor not this reason crafty crafty products not even unmuted just in case we got it wrong just because we're honoring honoring the dead let's go i don't know you weren't accounted for when the reactor went off that time oh that's my bad it is where were you at bro were you murdering mike who was murdered did he kill him back to shady dude oh my case not case night is taking so long face night is next i voted robbie i'm sorry rob yo i can't put the k-pop you know what i mean i respect that i was like he wouldn't he wouldn't that was like i had to put myself in the box new spin room bro i was like stop the couch wait wait you were not no i was gone did you forget that they caught him red-handed because of my camera play yeah chris i don't know why he thought it was bridge right at the beginning that's why oh yeah well because it just looked like for my vision what i saw it looked like he was just coming down and i knew you were behind me and for some reason i was just like yeah it's bridge but then he explained it i was like i'd already vote and i go man it's not [Music] bridge [Music] you
