heidi ho everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to the tournament turn on the chairman of of of power power power that's right it's been a while but golf it's back with the tournament of power the rules are confusing uh because datto made them and he's like omega brain so it's simple and it's confusing there's four versus four if that makes sense obviously there's eight of us so it's one team versus another but then there's also imagine like a side pot tournament of 2b2b2b2 where we pit one person on one team with another person on the other team so they're rivals in the 4v4 but their partners in the 2v2 so you want them to do well just not too well and then after two or three games whichever team of four wins will have one final free-for-all game winner takes all and then there will be like a consolation prize for whoever wins the two versus two versus two versus two tournament that's right it's a terminal power inside a tournament of power so i hope you guys enjoy team one so ab daddo blue and me versus shark rob sonic and danielle all right let's actually i read us office too bud welcome to maxky's world how do i get stuck back here what oh i gave somebody a boost oh

can't see where i'm going oh wait that was my last stroke yeah you like start to go the route on your last truck there you go [Applause] yes are we doing total strokes or are we just doing placement i vote total strokes now i'll just do total strokes and i'll also do placement uh let me just raise yeah watch rival score system why don't we do yeah all of it we'll have placements we should do we should i mean if we do total strokes then like that just gives you an advantage going into the next area i think your placement yeah because if we have another map that doesn't have this level of strokes yeah it's going to be really interesting besides it yeah but yeah i'll do placements here at the end of round one for the 2v2 v2 v2 we have a two-way tie for first datto and sonic with 11 fruit and shark with 11. let's go shark we can come let's go blue and rob with nine ab and danielle with five got a bit of a a ways to go and then uh we have our uh our 4v4 v4 v4 as well team one's looking good the g one's looking very good so fruit gives us eight blue gives us seven gang is six let's go four at a boy not good five plus three plus two plus one for team two so what are the totals team wise though uh totals team wise uh team one has 25 team two has eleven cool okay so we got a ways to go okay so let's just keep it up team team one first round just keep it up [Music] you
