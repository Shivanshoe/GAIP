hi there everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the last spell i'm hopelessly addicted and hopefully you are too too watching the content hope you guys enjoy this video i was debating possibly doing a run or two off video and then coming back to get a little more progression i don't know what you want from me or it only knows when i'm gonna finally beat it so yeah i don't know uh let's just get in all right lakeberg four prepare to meet your maker lakeberg one through three had it easy but the fourth oh i'm not giving you any quarter now let's just what the [ __ ] what is wrong with this dude his name's tanek look he's got like freaking he's like two-faced sorry anyway let's see what we're working with here we got to nick he's literally called long bowman so seems we're going to give him archery stuff extra range damaging critical minus one movement speed forget about it heavy sleeper extra health regen and mana that's great slow poke minus one move he's just all kinds of slow right now isn't he okay and then he's got the weird thing on his face sorry about that buddy that can't be great short bow i know it i love it okay what do we have next we have friggin kalanth kalanth i don't know the blood mage that's cannon you do have a wand extra magic damage but less health and daily health regen what the fudge you literally don't regen health that's great comes at a steep price unadorned one minus one trinket slot okay you would have no trinket slots that's terrible okay and ferocious extra physical damage i already hate clamp what actual butts then we have joanna joanna with barbarian that makes sense order plus two bag slot holy jesus i like never even give people that but you could have four things so less armor and dodge but better resistance and physical damage minus two lake berg number five whoa let's see what we get come on now they were literally trying to aside from our archer everyone else was say with me but so let's see what we got this time we got studs who's a dancer extra bag slot extra move extra dodge but less physical damage and resistance which is fine i guess we just won't give you physical damage stuff dragon blood extra resistance data health regen but less physical damage and health okay this is great so all your penalties are physical so we just won't give you physical things and so far it seems to be going pretty well we have keon the hangman extra physical damage critical power and reliability wow that's just solid minus 10 experience gain he's an idiot what i feel personally attacked plus three man about minus 10 health honestly decent we like that we have the jeweler extra trinket slot but at the cost of 10 armor and resistance the heck physical damage and dodge and magic damage and dodge the dodgers cancel themselves out we won't give you man the heck do i swap no okay you just don't have any extra ranged bonuses but it is what it is that's fine with me i guess is it though see i wish imagine if the mist just stayed this far out all the time wouldn't life be great it would be it'd be fantastic okay i don't think i need to change around any of the stuff though i don't think i unlocked new armor right i think they all have like the same armor all right let's get to um wait i thought that was going to put me into the deployment phase but i am papaga this is a good start okay lakeberg number six i know you're probably confused like what the fudge is going on okay look lake brig number four we had trash people so i was like hey let's let's reroll you know i've never done this and then the fifth one um i'm papeka and thought the phase we're in right now was not deployment phase i'm like okay time to deploy and instead um we were literally like over here in the city and they were coming so i was like okay i'm not even all right i ain't doing this so let's see what we got which is unfortunate because i actually really like the character's weight last time but we have maeve who has a little bit of everything oh plus six range damage actually if we total that up okay we might be swapping now minus physical and health that's fine hello maeve who do we have here we have supriya oh we have a s um we got a sword you know me i love my wait what you you can only use one armed no left hand but dodge that quite possibly has to be the worst perk in the history of perks what they give you one less hand to use i can't use two-handed weapons i can't use what and then to supplement that like hey here's five percent dodge whatever we're rolling with the punches um so we don't want to give you magic damage whatever and you have good resistance god why is that even a thing all right well keeping on the sword jesus screw me with jester okay minus 10 armor and resistance unlucky extra poison less health plus mana regen okay yeah that kind of seems kind of seems legit take take take the weapon take the other one all right maeve give me that you take that over here you take this jelly jelly no one had any other equipment or anything right no okay all right let's do this then um they can just balls to the walls armor you up right here we're gonna get a couple hits in and then i'm dipping with you because of how far the mist is we're gonna be fine so forget about it i says forget it oh i saw someone comment this and i didn't even bother to think about it because it just made sense to me look at my ability radius you see the dark orange below the wall that's showing me what sorry the autofocus that's showing me what i can and cannot hit with line of sight i didn't even realize that so i could move hover c like if the line of sight works that's cool okay yeah i'm ready i think let me just armor up here just i mean there's no one's making it this far but yeah might as well just just check okay in the face let's freaking do this my way yeah i would i'm pretty sure i can't see but i don't even think yeah the model has a left arm i literally have one arm i mean it makes sense but kind of brutal when you look at it that way okay i kind of have to remember how this all works okay i remember now i kind of want the spear back though the only problem is it took so much action points but that was sick okay can we we have to high roll to kill those things screw that i'm just gonna take care of business on the runners real quick don't even want to deal with that heavy ball to the fast but which foss i don't want to use manny yet absolutely no point in doing that so what if i were to go you're not gonna kill anyone the fudge because it's a one-handed sword so the damage is butts i i'm so tempted to just restart but i'm not going to even though by all accounts god knows i should too easy yeah right shut your mouth we'll stop six movement after this oh wait can i not target that guy guess i can't target that guy i feel like i should be able to target that guy oh it's because i'm out of the use okay i see now yeah there we go all right then scurry back home there pal and then we'll just weaken whoever we can here if i come over here it looks like that's going to kill boots looks like that's going to kill bruce good to go then we'll just weaken these failures just maim all of them they can't attack anybody so we are good to go um i'll give you some extra movement um you go around her wherever i heard i could have given you an extra point done and you could have actually done something with it but whatever oh god this holy this one handed just speedy freaking poo poo brother i hate it whatever where there's a well there's a way or something right all right we could propagate no we only multi hits we have no propagation no propagation at all yes i see the problem that's quite a few of them jeez uh this is only two men why not yeah what's your uh mana region looking like three okay keep that in mind one year's loneliest number okay so if somebody could kill this it's not quite gonna kill can you reach there no not quite and i could do it again then i'm opening myself up to plenty of danger and i'm here for it sure and then i'll nice the sound effects do help but i'm sure you're all well aware of that now screw the runners screw the runners screw the runners um you're in a bit of a pickle over there it appears probably going to assist you in a second just gravely wound gravely wound give you a bonus action point we're gonna run over here we're gonna run over here and you're gonna run back here and you're gonna arm around and i will say a prayer for you i can probably run right here all right we better not i don't want to take any damage oh my god wait you're getting what was that still does too much damage and he wasn't gravely wounded like i thought he was good start to the day how much health loss was that fifty only has one arm dude give her a break okay there's a there's a lot going on here what the fudge um couldn't palin shot for one mana it would probably okay they're all mortally wounded i like that but what do we want to do here have you had to use any man with him i think i'll impale here so why don't we just well hopefully high roll there we did pog gosh two mana for that that seems like a scam come over here impaling shot at a range what you've got to be kidding me impaling shot plebs nice everybody's looking weak um so who do i want to kill um i don't know i want to skewer in but then i'm just going to have the exact same problem because i'm going to like practically get myself killed again so um i'll just clean up the front here kill kill well wound wound wound whatever so clean up clean up i want to use this just so i get my movement back oh big brain okay i'm gonna come over here oh no i need three mana for that never mind very small brain very small brain the smallest of brains whack and then we're going to hide away like the cowards we are you have nothing left to do so you come coward back here too and great one action point remaining oh i totally knew that um is anyone threatening our walls this guy is screw you all right someone might also oh yeah there's a couple people okay i guess i'm just blind blind is a bat that's why i got these things all right now i have to try i don't want to use any more mana ideally what's your main region five okay we can use one here and not have to worry about anything because literally we're gonna get it all back uh bop bop kill the runner nope okay we're gonna do one more so that way i'm only missing one mana perfectly fine with me um all right just severely wound everybody and then just start picking everything up i guess this guy's a little annoying because i'm not gonna be able to get to him i have no line of sight so maybe pick you up trying to figure out who i want like how i want to skewer or i could do like that yeah i'll do it like that come over here skewer skewer skewer skewer and run back you count oh wait a second i should jump in the wall here's probably better i do oh you're out of stuff so then um just still get rid of the runner i don't want to use any more mana i don't want to and you can't make me just going to pick everything off that i can all right i'll have to do farm that movement oh wait i did not realize wait a second wait i didn't realize i had not injured this guy that is rather dumb of me i just don't want anybody getting hit here that doesn't work sure whatever don't hit my walls oh i feel like this is not going that well am i crazy i mean we're not taking that much damage i guess but still they're hurting our wolves how much mana do you reach in four okay so i can use one more skewer just fine scoot it then and pop yeah uh just start picking off some people would have liked if we actually kill something but whatever i might give you another energy yes i think i will fricken wait what you just miss how do you miss that i'm going for the people not gravely wounded i don't know if that was the best idea but then honestly i need to get over here because i need to kill this guy next turn and you just keep looking pretty buddy oh we should oh you have no armor well of course you don't so that's just damage straight to the foss why wouldn't it be see this boner over here has probably destroyed our wall man what's wrong with you it's a nice wall oh my god you're the best too bad you only have one arm think of the possibilities otherwise all right yeah i took s stupid damage to that turn you hate to see it everyone leveled up the whoo 81 damage last first night what the fudge am i doing ah no city panic though i would certainly hope so i wouldn't really say that's anything to celebrate give me that that's no that's something to celebrate celebrate tainted essence come on let's celebrate they're coming the same way isn't that nice it doesn't really change anything but appreciate it let's get our nightly reward ooh we could go with an iron shield which would be great if our swordswoman had another arm i could give it to the spellcaster though just six extra mana this kind of seems but that's that's not we do have a tome of secrets yes now we're talking some extra reliability freaking stuff you know or medium armor extra momentum extra health one last movement point though unfortunate because who's the boner yeah you're the boner with the yeah because your armor currently actually gives you an extra so we'd be losing two movement points that's not great but armor is nice in fact you have like next to no armor as is and you do use momentum but we could also just go with better wizardry and it is very fun we have lots of propagation [Music] we got debuffs we got things that requires a lot of spells her mana um like the extra temperature momentum is not going to do anything for us could be wrong but the health and armor is nice but this is too hard um now maybe having access to the skill book could be way better um but yolo we're we're taking the armor screw it here you go my friend eight movement points what if i just gave you six instead i think i'm just going to give you xp i i don't know if that's the play to be fair i don't know if it's the play because we we've yet to i feel like we've yet to get to a point in the nights where that extra xp seems to get us a level we wouldn't have otherwise it could be completely wrong and i wouldn't really know because i i've never not really chosen something else um okay movement points you know what i'm extra armor i'm just going to give you another movement point there you go now you're you're big chilling again what happened to all the uncommons and stuff whatever we're just going to give you extra now you got 18 extra momentum girl you're smooving out there oh see this why why didn't we find this stuff earlier um you know i'm just going to give you armor you would have none so that seems like a nice idea greater accuracy lord knows we're probably going to need that but screw it we're going to go with super omega early experience game this man's getting 31 extra experience we're not 41 percent extra experience off the bat yeah 141 percent boom where's the range damage well it's there but whatever well i guess i'll take it i don't really have choice next up screw it should i man i don't know if i should or i could just balls okay better skill range which is pretty cool for daily mana regen the skill range is pretty nice oh heavens 11 reigns with that crossbow kind of nutty but then most of our other ones are all straight lines so it really doesn't matter that much i feel like we let's go daily mana region for now so i can actually use some of that stuff a little more liberally okay you boners are good let's start building some structures how many workers we got i'm just going to start demolishing things to make houses give me all of the houses yes all of them yes yes all right never say no to too many workers that's as much gold as that but now i have four more workers hi oh so i could destroy this or i could destroy this the houses are just gonna be so close to everything though all right let me think 21 gold just give me 28 gold that's not enough to make another house quick maths what about gear look at those cool elven boots extra propagation damage but minus one skill range that's unfortunate but you do get an extra move what is this a rusty dagger well this is all new isn't it i've yet to see a dagger does a lot of isolated damage armor piercing and throwing daggers cool novices ceptia it is interesting because you could technically go melee or magic damage and melee at the same time that'd be a cool build we have a silk tunic it gives you just a lot of it six mana move points and propagation damage what the fudge it's just me does that seem crazy i'm gonna hold on to the gold now but that does seem pretty crazy um i guess i'll just get rid of it like this i won't be able to build anything anyway oh wait oh yeah no houses are 55. okay i could do a gold mine though i'll do that start passively building up some uh some goodies i'm going full econ here we're going to see how this goes this is new for me let's build some defenses um a ballista is champion but it's probably a little too early for that i'm just gonna put a gate and a barricade literally just enough to buy us some time i don't want to i don't want to heavily invest here how much health does this have 27 so they're practically the same all right friend you're going to sit right in front of the gate line of sight here kind of sucks bunch doesn't it i'll put you over here then well i don't need to i can put you like right here that's that's it right yeah all right i think i'm pretty happy with that that's great let's do this uh-huh i figured they might be coming that way those are rascals let's see we can do melee wise first um i want to make sure i can get back safely and that's exactly what i'll do just come back here for now i guess how much movement nah nah don't take extra damage mr fruit it ain't worth it now die um he's threatening our barricade i don't like that to be fair all these can hit something of mine not cool so let's just [Music] dodged okay unlucky just may mule you're five percent dodge why am i missing i mean i guess that gives you yeah nine percent dodge but still nine percent really budge whatever nobody likes you anyway let's hurt you you can't hit our things anymore either can you or you and while i'm at it screw you and you know i'll give you an extra action can you do anything with it no what the fudge am i doing i literally can't shoot another shot that was stupid could have at least gotten wait no one can touch her never mind we're fine i'm gonna arm up anyway though let's see one action point remaining can't do anything with chief you know what fine i'll throw dodge on it are you a happy video game oh my god i feel that way too buddy that's quite a few of them isn't it geez louise um i just start chucking out some should we call it impaling shots honestly do i do that or don't do that i feel like i'm going to kill this runner anyway so yep screw you hit these guys with an impaling shot didn't even break the armor are you oh and then i don't have any more mana or action points okay uh yeah they came so fast i don't know where it feels like okay let me do some math here two three this should be fine god i do love the sword haven't i liked like a two-handed sword imagine that that'd be sick okay i'm gonna put you over here because then you're gonna attack from over there uh i'm gonna give you an extra ability just so we can take care of the runner so it doesn't go crazy i could technically stop them all from um yeah let's do that and we high rolled uh huge what's your regen plus five pog then but wait wait wait wait wait you know what i should do i want to come over here so i can finish off these dudes because it's not going to do me any good if i don't finish them off he's going to get hit almost by anyone anyway so let's figure this out that bop bop bop do you have line of sight no but also you shouldn't be getting hit by anybody all right one here didn't move who you let me fix that holy smokes that's quite a few of them in it in it proof but aside from like three or four dudes we see back here that's practically it so oh boy here comes the fun if one could call it such a thing dodged nine percent change to dodge of course all right let's point blank can i take care of you plebs okay the wall's been breached here unfortunately how far are you going to travel bar but not far enough to hit me good load we're gonna be losing some walls here friends jesus what do i do about this can't take care of most of these things trying to figure out how to do like hopscotch because skewer kill skewer leaves me with one action point skewer come back but that's not that much good lord um he's gonna hit the barricade honestly like whatever you do you um how do i do this uh let's see like that i reckon you have five movement speed after this problem is i don't know how i'm gonna get you out of there i can give you another bonus whatever action point uh we got to use some more mana to screw me and run back here we can you you you you're out of range yes not you let me give you another action point and then run back here no thank you did you dodge pretty sure you dodged a little boner i roll no it's fine out of range of course all right it's not great but we're vibing for now yes let's just hope we don't need to repair these walls anytime soon yeah they're all going down and i'm yelling timber oh there's so many of them cotton how much we restore four so i can skewer two more times for free essentially calm down puppy i might do see i could do impaling bolt but it won't even break any of their armor i mean it'll weaken him but this ignores block what's the difference between block and armor i think these guys have zero block so i'm assuming that comes in later rounds um god if i have great alien i guess that's where that tome thing would have come in handy huh good lord okay please hyrule you're nuts all right i need to kill that okay pog so you can slicey dicey um then you'll be able to do it again oh wait you only have two action points or one action point just keep uh whatever yell off now i have to somehow make it back i have to clear away all right i got to use some more mana screw me but i don't really have a choice it doesn't feel like it at least that could hold it by uh kill you you're adam action points but now we gotta safely get the cover and then this this what are we doing uh it's most bang for dodge are you kidding me my luck is just atrocious all right finish that all right we're gonna hide behind our walls a little bit longer as i shuffle around them that'll have to do pig okay i honestly didn't think anyone would make it past that but that's fine uh i didn't even break her arm enough so we're chilling all right now we just gotta wash down here you know what i'm saying so i figure out how the best way is gonna be to do that because i'm trying to think i could impale him like that but i need more than this to impale hold on um let's do like that dodged sick all right and this guy's pretty much useless so i want to kill here in order to impale let's just do that real quick impale or sorry that's blade rush technically i don't know it sounds cool though you're dead um you're dead and you're dead we give them another action point but let's just see what all we can do we'd have to high roll for that sex let's just we can these failures first i can't really do anything about that um give you another action point and then oh i totally forgot about the people about to hit our city uh what the fudge peppery and i can't get to him [ __ ] what am i doing i'm gonna take panic damage here for no reason all right you might have to be hero and tank some of this bloody old pal they're not gonna do that much though but it could still be enough how much armor do you have 30 how much are they going to do 23 to 28 all right let's see how many people could hit you i went like this max people are okay so i think we will actually block all the damage this way big omega brain that's me don't forget about it locked wait what wait did he crit or something how the fudge do you do so much damage it says right there 23 to 28 i have 30 armor i'd like to think i could do math but apparently i can't undo that kill there what that doesn't even you're useless you're unforgivable out of range oh you're not my what the melee fiend was not pretty but i think we lost less health to the first night yeah 11 hp that's not bad that's ns if i've ever seen one level threes and i'm hoping with because of this xp i'll eventually get somebody a little level seven this run okay a little bit of panic they technically didn't even hit anything in the village it's just they got in to the village so people are like i'm a i'm a little boner just like that and the fog rolls in yet again i don't like this but we get extra gold that stacks yo we have enough to finish some tainted essence thing i don't is it the uh extra armor on things yeah more starting items sure now what do i want next i'm not manufacturing many buildings or items currently i mean it could be good but i do love me some crossbows i tell you what oh here's generate with here's general with another action how did i not see this what well that's next up on the docket i tell you what catapult large projectiles oh my yes i want a catapult i want a catapult when i grow up hey what's our reward whoa epic body armor steel pauldron holy jesus 28 health five critical six accuracy eight dodge move point twenty percent healing ironically the move points cancel out so it's literally just 42 armor eight dodge 20 healing six percent accuracy five percent critical 28 health what i don't have to think about this bob give me that holy jesus i've never seen this before it's incredible perks do you want my friend actually okay who should be getting that armor uh let me look at his stat skin extra oh so the move points cancel out so just a lot of armor [Music] and some dodge i feel like we throw this on our one-handed gal the accuracy is nice but that's really the only thing that will see use most of the time on anyone else so uh freaking yeah yeah kind of sucks so cuz that 10 momentum was nice but 21 dodge yes please and we technically gain a movement point tons of armor uh yeah i'll just give this somebody else for more armor and hell the momentum won't do anything but who needs the least amount of movement points probably you what's your armor yeah there you go buddy okay now focus up me what are we doing here give me some extra magic damage probably where's all the rares on comments man gamba fudge okay at least we got magic damage daily mana regen okay that's better it's more like it now here didn't kill anyone this turn extra propagation in multi-hits we do like that but extra accusate skill range we also like that i think we're just gonna go with propagation bounces and multi-hits right sure i'm probably gonna do the exact same thing with you well you don't have any multi hits yet though because i don't have another crossbow for you extra armor might not be bad because you would have none yeah and then we could give you more experience but no but no bodge i'm not gonna gamble again so whatever experience game we're gonna give you accuracy in skill range for show the show for show and then you my friend you baby can't stop the music sounds better with you could have 16 or no 21 crit pretty good pretty good crit chance chief i'm doing it at 21 crit chance better accuracy i'd like to think that that shouldn't matter um but i'm not even going to give it a chance why not right just make sure we're hitting what we want to hit and then with that in mind could get extra armor standing next to things could jump over enemies that's not i haven't used it yet but it in certain circumstances i think it could be really good we could even increase our crit chance passively but i think we might want to unlock fatality here seems too good all right now we want to build new structures but first get rid of all this stuff get as much gold as we can give me the gold i want gold give me that gold i want gold give me that gold i want those give me that gold i want go okay um when did this six oh we're almost there let's go house there and obviously that's not a good not a great spot to put it there all right now we have all of the houses so now ideally we could then start upgrading them but perhaps that's for another time let's destroy that destroy that i'm just going all in on gold baby okay so i want to buy an n obviously but i think i'm gonna wait until after night three i think i can manage until then without taking much of anything i really want to see your two later on but we'll get there so for now i think we just go gold mines i think that is the best play and then i can start using workers to increase that as well as start upgrading things we're gonna see how the all gold worker economy idea goes who knows it seems like it might go well but who really knows okay where are they coming from thankfully not this way okay so probably put one here because again smallest choke so but who do we put there can a melee really hold it down themselves i don't know let's build some defenses um i'm feeling crazy i'm gonna go with the ballista and i think i'll do the same over here my problem is these walls kind of cut off a lot of the uh lines of sight i'd be hoping for i think that's all right is it yeah this could do double duty if i put it over here technically on later rounds right yes script all right so we got some ballistas oh wait oh stupid meat it doesn't need line of sight because i made the one that is elevated oh stupid me whatever the paga sometimes i really wonder what's going on that old noggin of mine um we're building cheap things [Music] and i'm just gonna save for gates okay i think that's it now how do i do this um but you're here you have eight movement speed so i'm going to actually put you a little bit closer in case we decide to flex then yeah i think you got to hold this down by yourself friend what is this vicious oh extra critical for two turns whoa i did not realize that hold up is that from the armor it must be right it is 10 critical so i think it just gives us another 10 critical change so we'll be hit we have 31 crit chance that's pretty good and by that i mean that's kind of like really good yeah let me just go ahead and buffer ourselves up there does it show up it does reflect on the character sheet that's very fun 31 percent crit don't mind if i do uh we're gonna keep you right there keep you around there just wondering if i should put him a little closer i don't think anyone's gonna be able to hit me from there and i hope i'm not but at least this way i can hopefully get a few and get out without having them all clump up at the beginning mazel tov or chili chef that's not very many oh or nothing remotely close i'm only i'll only have huh well i might be all right hold on crit let's get it i can't hit oh oh all right check this out aha big brain i won't be able to buff myself though i'm lucky i still think we're chilling though okay boner mcboner right behind that rock of course um should i even bother helping you no i think we come over here famous last words i can't really reach that much i don't know if i want to bother hitting him those guys are practically made useless right now anyway i'm hoping i can just finish him off with me magic just about give you a little more movement though okay that's good i think i can line it up now out of range are you kidding me no rip just increase dodge chance i guess whatever all right yeah ballista how far out do you shoot i don't know apparently pretty f oh there we go i was gonna say nice hit the runner let's go ballistas okay as long as i can protect them they're always going to be helping that's some value unfortunately they're all making it difficult on me why is no one coming i don't know maybe that's a blessing i don't know i'm not gonna say anything i'm just gonna leave it there he's already wounded l o freaking l couldn't be me back to the side oh see this guy is 10 block okay so he just inherently negates 10 damage trying to decide if i want to use any mana stuff i don't think i do oh a crit uh yes please stupid stupid stupid stupid now what do we want to do wish i could hit the runner how far is he gonna he's gonna be able to make it to the gate that's ridiculous whatever okay i get five multi hits big pog all right we'll save mana now kill you kill you wish i could kill that pleb but i'm gonna leave that one because the our ballistic can finish that one off uh i'll just hit you cause range or you know what you'll dodge fair enough now how do i want to do this that's a kill that's a kill that's not gonna kill interesting oh but i can just do that run back to my little hidey hole how far are you gonna run i think right there is perfect or actually right here last movement i gotta do i don't think anything will be able to reach me and my ballista oh hit the runner oh that's actually big with that kill i love these ballistas with all of my being dodged although i think you just nerfed my movement speed didn't you boner that really does matter as long as i can keep him in this chokehold though it's pretty good let's figure this out first let's solve this puzzle first why don't we yo i screw you screw you eleven percent man it feels like pokemon you know when it moves like eighty percent chance of hitting that means like five percent eleven percent of dodging or whatever happens at least every other time yeah right it's like 50 70 100 i don't know but i hate it maybe i'll high roll that that'd be nice just hurt everything i can okay no hyrule for me not words case uh all right let's just pick up people who are gonna be able okay there's too many people i gotta kill you for show no i don't ah screaming hole that's five percent back to back what did oh my god i hate it i hate it here now i just gotta try and kill something okay nice crit can you reach the walls of course you can maybe i'll use sheep no no i can't use any man anyway nevermind uh all right i'll kill one of you you don't have as many debuffs all right now let's figure this out we got to kill the runner that's for sure um you're not going to die that sex oh but that's nice the only problem though is six health off that i can't um oh yeah using the fatality it's cool it just means i have to use one movement speed though um do i even weaken this guy is how much i'll have four movement speed that should be enough because that should kill me we go okay i think i'm fine now i'm just worried about all i don't know how many archers are going to try and hit me that's nothing i'm worried about kill the rudder kill that guy please pog actually the archer's okay though three of them oh okay didn't even get through my armor though pog that's that epic armor the epic armor this guy is welcome to go that way that would be great kind of gives me a little respite all right you boner now they're all clumped up which would be great for me to use my abilities but there's just this nice wall right in front of where i would like to do all of that so instead i'll just skewer here explosive shot here then can i finish if i come back here i can finish you up all right friend uh he's gonna hit our walls what the [ __ ] that's a five percent chance let me let me just three five percent chances in a row we just missed we had 95 odds three times in a row missed that's my life just wound these stupid oh my god i can't even do you have okay you hit him do what i could not oh no don't do that all right they're all going to be a little annoying but not much i can do about it all right they're all weak i can't execute him too let's go here execute kill kill i'm just far enough that i won't be able to skewer which sucks if i high roll this guy's dead but i only have two movement after this well that's not great that's not very good at all now is it yolo i'm running this way can they hit me yeah but i don't think they're going to come after me they always go forward so i should be fine famous last words oh we're chilling oh nice work ballista they've yet to even touch the walls over here you're killing it holy horn brother that's a lot of them okay but that's about it for the enemies more or less so that's the good news once we get through the bulk of this i didn't have to move out that far okay i'm just yeah i'm not able to skew or anything which sucks blade rush whatever if i can kill this this then i will be able to but i have to do this in three well when we crit that helps and crit again oh okay um hyrule wait if that's the case i'm gonna get a little greedy bop okay damage you hyrule both you not quite but i can just execute you and i'll execute you next turn no one can touch me over here perfect let me just farm some movement what's your main region nine oh well then i can do at least one more multi-head and you regen seven oh yeah we can we can have some fun with that then can't we hit like that and then do it again what did three of those five just dodge oh my oh it's fine oh i don't know that guy released but i'll hit you oh that sucks [ __ ] i don't want to kill some of these guys but i don't really have any uh option because they're kind of body blocking it's a three percent dodge three percent no it doesn't make any sense there has to be some hidden thing aside from just their dodge that calculates this or something because what the fudge okay you're pee pee poo poo you're not so i have to do that again feels bad now you're pee pee poo poo all right walls are gonna be taking a little bit that's okay i'm more impressed by the fact that we the the site we're not struggling with is the solo side because you're killing it buddy and you only have one arm by the way one arm one person you're crazy you're nuts brother um i can't execute you you think you're slick but you're not you're dead get executed oh we got some biggens though gonna have to do something about that aren't we oh yeah this guy's just going to hit our gate granted our gate should survive but so if i just do that and then run away i'll get hit by an archer but that's about it um you're gonna regen just enough so maybe we'll use one more oh it's not crazy about any of these maybe i'll do this love it all right point blank i swear to god 20 that's actually pretty high what the fudge his name is dodger so it makes sense i see what you're telling me i lost both those 20 like statistically this is and the craziest outliers if i've missed all these percentage chance this many times why what have i done to deserve this and i've been a very naughty boy oh you're not doing much damage you can't move that much but still too much you can't move anywhere you want to only got one more shot me yellow uh all right let's give you another thing wound that dude oh he wasn't too healthy you kidding me it's fine i don't care whatever i'm just heartbroken it's fine all right one here didn't move was that you little radical all right great stuff there ballista get the runner that's right there goes that entire wall jesus good golly mrs molly uh if i could just freaking line up boy you'd have another thing coming all right let's figure this part out first this side rather uh that's pretty good execute you get 50 help that's not enough to execute unlucky that's enough to execute you she's worried he'll do too much damage to me i think i should survive this i hope uh this though like what what just just what i just get so out of hand i mean most of them are weak but just don't dodge for the love of god i need to hit these okay i need to hit you right next to me thank you that's big out of range what okay that's nice does punching this kill him no wha what am i trying to do here i guess just i'm worried let's see you're gonna do a lot of damage to be fair they're all gonna do a lot of damage all right i'm just going to take a little bit damage from that dude not a lot i can do about it it's fine it's fine just start finishing some dudes am i out of i am all right up to you now you can weaken a little bit there you go minus one movement okay so he can't get to us well he can't no he can't um i think you just gotta kind of stay over here all right go on ballista pog he didn't get hit the gate that side has seen better days we didn't break through the armor you freaky you one armed legend oh my god we shall forever remember the name of sapria it's a weird name but we'll remember it hyrule nope execute yes execute i'm gonna boost my own crit screw you didn't matter you know i'm gonna punch you the disrespect then i'll come help over here because you boners can't do anything but she don't whatever i'm not mad about it as you can tell i'm also saving man like technically i could just but trying to save mana for the later nights right point blank thank you just out of range who should i be going for who can you can you high roll no can don't have the option okay okay but they all they are all wounded that's gotta count for something we'll even name that filler a little bit this guy yeah let's just get rid of the city panic dodged maybe we won't all right fine i'll just punch the freaking poopoo you don't even do enough to what all right you could take his hit but two hits um no so i have to let him hit the building right no i don't because we're gonna punch you again get pooped on okay it'll be over here movie over here and then back and then over there and then back and then okay i'm crazy all right minimal city panic still too much but as long as i get rid of them it'll be clear so let's do our part i'm helping word that range my anus point blank screw you yes oh clean how much i don't think we watched any age i'm joking no for some reason when it was 80 hp it's freaking go that was the cleanest night i've ever had we lost all of our walls but no damage no city panic there should be like an s plus for a moment like this one s plus plus freaking let's get it [Music] i do like all of this yes and a new knife reward oh give me that essence give me that essence girl there should be a i don't know there might be there should be an essence thing that's like how did you miss that many probabilities that's incredible but guess not oh they're coming back from this great but it means our ballista gets a little more use could even put up another one now all right but let's use our tainted essence yes yes where was it where was it there we go after the next night i should be able to unlock that which means next run everybody has six ap yes please see we got we got gold we got gold we got gold and another epic no the odds of that were probably just astronomical this gives us an extra movement extra healing and extra physical damage and we can even use an effect on us that gives us plus three move points wild lane armor this gives us dodge armor physical damage resistance reduction and mana that's only good on supriya whoever the fudge said i wouldn't forget her name but it's an odd one but she already has that crazy chest armor this isn't bad it just the physical damage is wasted whereas this gives resistance dodge and health oh what is yeah see we're not birdie already has yeah i guess i could give it to maeve [Music] for some extra mana and [Music] armor i mean an extra move that doesn't really work on many people dodge health resistance isn't bad but kind of like this we're gonna go with the armor we're going to give to maeve yes let's go ahead and level you up friend show me that ranged damage we'll have to take it give me a blue accuracy okay or not we'll take a green one sure god know how's well how's well how well that's been going i really wish i could get you a little hand crossed right now because those multi hits would be sick [Music] um i might even see if there's one in the shop let me do that there's not satch [Music] could go melee mode but that doesn't seem ooh what do we have here rare boots propagation damage minus one skill range but extra accuracy and mana with extra movement that's great except no one has propagation so we just lose a skill range for nothing um i think baron cape extreme liability and damage yo that's kind of cracked what the magic hat extra multi-hits and mana less damage but that's not bad because what it birdie doesn't have anything right and act up i don't want to use my gold quite yet though we'll wait so for you my one armed fiend reliability of isolate isn't terrible stacking crit isn't terrible extra armor isn't terrible debuff an enemy with minus dodge i don't think i need that soul reaper is good but it doesn't help us survive i mean it might be a good idea just because all we're trying to do is unlock things for later runs but i want to try and pop off i almost i might want to try this this leapfrog ability i kind of want to go yeah yeah you know what let's try sure leap frog away my friend then you ooh extra armor or another movement point i think i'm gonna go move it um extra momentum seems good that's a 12 damage increase to our skill one so i'd say it's worth we don't want any of this just give you some more man i guess and better daily mana regen so then we can just start casting the multi hits more what else do you want i never use potions should i do that more i'm just always so strapped for gold as is better accuracy in skill range brother i'm doing that because this dude couldn't hit the broad side of a barn if it was two feet in front of them it feels very x-com where like you have a gun at their heads like 95 chance miss all right i did what now you won't mind okay we don't have any materials oh and i only have so many more buildings to to bust down well we're sticking to the gold plane for now yellow no remorse okay that's a lot of gold what could i do improves production effect better gold increases uses see i can just trying to think how should we do this could also just upgrade my workers but right now i think i'll get to the point where i have too many workers here soon because after pretty much well this round i mean i only need what four more workers to destroy buildings around me then after that all they can be used is on buildings and i haven't even upgraded them enough to be able to really make a difference that way i don't think can i build another gold mine no i'm at max so i think i'm gonna upgrade the gold received from these oh i can upgrade them again oh shoot so then i think that makes it so that every day it does it twice right which means we'd get 50 gold but see like i'm thinking of like at the cost per upgrade at what point i don't know i don't know um i upgraded them all though still have a decent amount yes your production effect is 25. i think i should build no whoops debating going for materials because god knows we're going to need them but i know i'm trying to get really greedy with the the math here [Music] i'm going to upgrade one of the houses in a production here production here pro production here okay we're back to 60 not bad i could upgrade for another worker or what i think i'll do now is get one scavengers camp we're gonna need a lot more but better than nothing for now all right then we got our little village chilling vibin oh i didn't even grab all this cold oh yeah shoot look at that go for another one freaking boom oh and another one oh my god talk about value i i think i'm maxed out on scavengers games perfect now i can start looking to upgrade those later but hopefully after this night i'm going to try and buy an n and a new hero have a fourth hero moving from then and then hopefully our economy starts to stabilize that's the idea here we're going to see if it pans out but i'm feeling pretty good about it and we still have i know we have quite a few don't we one two three we have five more worker upgrades i don't need to do those until probably a couple rounds because i think i'm going to get to the point where i'll have too many workers kind of like i didn't i think in the last round where there's like six workers i'm gonna had nothing to do with them i don't need to be too gung-ho about that look at our little village chilling well then we're gonna take on night three or night four whatever the fudge isn't it i think night for i don't know it doesn't really matter what matters is that we're going to poop on some kids hopefully it's going to be tough not having four for another wave of two but hopefully we can chill and kind of do the same thing i'm gonna i should yeah hold on let me build defenses real quick um i can't really afford another ballista well i could i can just do it so it doesn't need vision or elevated select that and maybe another one never see now this one needs line of sight that was my bed and i feel like i should probably help this side more because there's only going to be one whatever instead i'll just go with [Music] one believe that almost nothing got touched over here to be fair um i don't have enough for reinforced walls everywhere so put a gate there just in case i can't repair you guys [Music] yay it's gonna suck i'm gonna put extras right there gonna put him in front of the the weakest points right now perfect okay then tomorrow we'll or tonight in in game i don't know why i'm rping so hard we'll see what uh what all we can handle but with that that concludes another episode of the last spell i hope you guys continue to enjoy this because it's not evident i am having a blast i haven't had this much fun playing a game in a long time i'm actively always looking forward to this so this is just uh even better for me um being able to do this and having you guys watch long even if it's not our most popular thing all you out there watching near the homies so what i said i don't think i'll ever much watch and have yourself a fantastic day i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] so you
