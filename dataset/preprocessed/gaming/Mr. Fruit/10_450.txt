of beauty double xp double weapon xp honestly well i don't care about that double xp whatever double weapon xp because now the guns level at an at a normal pace it's not even accelera it's just a normal pace so it's my duty currently to level up as many weapons as i can to at least get all the cameras unlocked if i do plan on doing the master camo grind which again i'm seriously debating whether or not i want to put myself through that because like look at it i mean yeah it's like animated but it is but is it even that cool but then again you know there's a lot of stuff in the world that isn't really cool it's just a flex i know maybe maybe i'm gonna flex on them haters did you know what i mean so i'm headed into nuketown 24 7 to play what i can only imagine is going to be a
