heidi hope everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to more among us okay i don't i i guess everyone's cool with the vision i guess but hey detective fruit back on the case i sussed out the other imposter even though technically i put pig in my way to the first one this is the one instance where your smooth brain actually paid off 100 and the only reason i suspected was the other one was because i was what the what okay well then bryce i have a question for you what's up when you started the round what'd you do um i went to o2 threw some leaves and then i started to go to the lights and i saw dork at the table and i decided i would protect him with my life to see if i could get the little uh strat where someone kills him or protect him by saving him with my body uh and then the insert report wait so you went so you went down to o2 and then back through weapons in the cafeteria yeah okay rob where are you i'm in fan cams because i was gonna try and catch somebody trying to like go through the vent into fan cams from electric don i was an electrical i was actually the first one to turn the lights on crafty uh i'm in shields right now i'm under the impression oh he's in cafeteria t uh i'm in nav and gunny i'm in nav as well with t-rex all right so i have it narrowed down to gunny t craft your bryce the body is right on me at weapons so bryce's most suspect is because if you went 0-2 and then back to weapons he would have seen the body i did see bryce go up from o2 did you i must have missed him then now the other thing is t or gunny could have killed it and went into nav i haven't seen anybody on the near the reactor or anything i was the first one in nav and t came in behind me a little bit later i did leaps and then i went straight to naps okay so i got my sauce on tear bryce honestly i'm gonna say it's bryce first because there's no way that kill could have happened and he wouldn't have seen it i've been on torque for my voice 40 seconds at this point this be a soft report i don't know it could be but he doesn't really roll like that normally i don't i forgot to vote for myself oh i've never asked start to vote themselves okay bryce looking pretty sus granted the only reason i don't think it's like he wouldn't have incriminated himself like that would he although maybe he didn't realize i don't know that's why the only thing i think it might be crafty is crafty vented and then vented in the shields but if they were both nabbed they would have seen that so i think crafty's off my suspicious for that kill granted we don't know where shark was rob could have very well killed shark over near fan cams he was also trying like this and then like i was trying to catch somebody yeah whatever because i knew it wasn't him at least for that kill could have very well killed shrek though i'm trying to pull on or put on the old detective oh my okay i know i know why this is going to look bad bryce because i i ran in there snipe lights i saw vicky run in and also like do her tasks up there i snipe lights boom like two seconds that's why lights went off finished like two seconds i go up there vicki's dead and then that i'm sitting there going how the hell did she die i was just like here just and i sniped light so this body is fresh where's everybody at right now i know it can't be bryce and why is that because bryce just ran up on me standing on the body contemplating how the [ __ ] this is a wet floor and it's slippery because there's blood everywhere last round did anyone see shark the shark also died last round not that iron man no true where were you at this round i am currently an admin swiping my card here's what i'm thinking uh i think it's rob i think he panicked when he saw bryce no no no no it's because that's no one saw a shark you are the farthest away and left you're like i'm on fan cam's looking for a vent imposter i might be in dark because i left admin i went down i saw bryce leaving comms i went to check and steve was only dead in comps he was in comms alive doing a download i started my download in the body i was trying to show tv real quick bryce what were you doing in comms because you were literally on the chair okay here's what i'm gonna say all right explain to me rob how you were ready to snipe the lights you didn't know anyone else was in the room you sniped because i ran right to the lights right in front of them i sat in front of lights going i'm going to snipe these i i think it's robbie i think he's going to want to go please because he was doing nothing in comms literally was doing nothing in congress but i'm just here for the little likely story my guy rob you've got unlucky if that's the case just bad time i was at torque with them oh guys uh if you're curious oh boy okay somebody locked doors now why is that who's trying to get a kill everyone's practically still in here i saw rob and other people bryce dork went down here and got through the doors so dork and bryce were right next to each other there's still two imposters out there so i need to have dope dork and bryce are buying me i don't like that bryce is kind of chasing me you do be chasing me though i'm gonna start a little thing here tea and craft you're over here i'm gonna start that i'm gonna start scanning i didn't get to start skinning in time to see if it was legit or not i hope someone fixes the lights or i'm about to get stabbed i don't know but there was crafty and honey i believe gun your tea or yeah craft your fudge i don't know okay t just came up but from where any bodies any bodies bodies and communications i found it even before the lights were sniped or like even before they were done so i let the body sit there and ran to see who was fixing lights who do i see fixing lights bryce and crafty so one of them had to at least run past his body in communications wait why wouldn't we run to communications to do lights wait because somebody was on the right side of the map with me here's what i know when i started someone ran to the right i was an admin at the beginning after the cafeteria doors closed and then i was running out of admin and the people locked at the storage door that were heading in were bryce and dork so it could be either of them that went down because then i went into med bay i saw crafty and who was doing the scan i was about to say if you don't remember me i'm yeah so i saw crafty and tea in med bay i know dork and bryce went down there so you're either self-reporting or it's bryson dork or one of them after the lights turned off because i i dipped and went to go turn the lights back on t up yeah i so the light started going off after i met scan i started the other like the little like choose five of the vials thing for a minute then it went over and i did the wires it bits right in front of security and then i was gonna go back up when lights got fixed to see if you killed fruit but fruit's alive i ran past him again yeah i did see tea coming up so that makes sense so all i'm saying is it's real sense between bryce and dork could very well be dorky he's been under the radar but i had bryce cess from the very beginning i'm down to vote i think it's rob because rob is now reporting two bodies so much yelling why would you do that to me bro i can only rob's found two bodies man i've been with him the whole game it's weird i hope we don't lose i feel like we're gonna lose and be honest uh that was a rough call again it's like it could have been bryce see they're gonna lock the doors immediately just get a kill or something if there's two of them but there's t to the left where all the other people go there's dork he should be going back for his vial oh my god i'm hiding i'm hiding them hiding in mine i'm hiding over here they keep like they're trying to kill me bro they're locking the doors on me or bryce is the imposter and he's helping out his dude by trying to lock me in everywhere could be one of those okay t just came out any dead bodies no okay and i assume he's coming from the vial so that makes sense you would have realized that there was in fact no dead body near me okay i knew it's the two people that voted for him i was right on price ah yo t yeah yeah go on son no no get out oh thank god okay so it was price this is good dork where's the body top engine room um who are you voting for me because this is potentially a self-report i don't know what to do it seems so easy what i should do here right and what we should do here right i swear to god i saw i saw dork are you self-reporting no bro i don't even ask it's not i don't think it's worth it but i'm afraid it's dude that's the biggest [ __ ] brain play ever i just i just you just never know a dork like you don't know if he's wait i just answered your question rob i said no but i know but you said you voted for yourself because it could potentially be a self yes because you guys are gonna think that no i'm i was just gonna ask you where the body was i was gonna say i saw crafty running past me i saw crafty running past me electrical running like towards that direction but i don't know where he went from there where'd you go from the electrical crafting when we crossed yeah right and then security i'm very i saw t there i went from in the i kind of want to vote crafty only because crafty did not want to vote bryce i swear i what i i can't vote anybody here and i have somebody telling me it might be a self report and who reported the body dude i'm just crappy what do you wait what do you mean dee i just that's because he was the guy who was the person and then you voted for somebody robert i just i don't know i thought t would know exactly he saw me at reactor and then he oh but it do be like that you know i'm so sad you couldn't let that first round go i just wanted to cuddle dork rob's on top of three bodies but no it's still gotta be bryce it was just well like when i was like let's go down the list where everybody is and you're the first one you literally tell me exactly was like that's that's like that's so sucks no the reason the reason i try to tell that's what i was thinking oh hitting the button because i was like someone's got to be dead but nobody's dead and that's bad i thought someone would be dead here and i was like i was in electrical oh i'm definitely dead yeah [Music] someone is dead oh my god i just hit the button as soon as the person died dork where are you simon says crafty where are you i'm an admin oh my god the dude i really feel like yeah i really feel like it's work i think it's dork and i'm going to tell you oh my god because i ran out of electricity and from electrical i ran straight to button and you went to admin i didn't run past t-rex at any of those points so it has to be dork i'm voting door imagine calling me a third impostor dude [ __ ] dude on top of you and i thought you were wrong i was like yes yes ravi yes you didn't think it was weird how me the one guy died immediately oh my god dude i saw him going i wasn't going to catch him you are there and i just thought i just killed his ass um anyone tell me why shady shark and dawn are all up there shady shark dawn i'm gonna keep that list in my head because they all just faked it shady shark dawn ssd ssd that's it's easy to remember the the uh the names like that make it a little bring in words uh ssd i'm not sticking with shading i'm going to lights yeah screw that shady shark dawn that's an acronym that's what what the oh that's unfortunate boogie what okay body is right outside of electrical i come up from the o2 area and i see boogie coming right down that hallway would have seen the body for sure all right dork tell you something or sorry bryce tell you something real quick uh remember lasting around i absolutely [ __ ] decimated dude well it's new round new life so i don't know what happened last year i'm telling a joke about how you can make a tissue dance stop murdering somebody listen listen listen if i would have murdered i know what you're talking about i'm a no too so the body's probably closed somewhere on light i'm guessing right right if i would have murdered electrical i would have vented out immediately that's how i play right don't see me around that's when you sussed me did you actually see boogie coming down that hallway i was no i'm confirming i did go down instead of actually going along it could have been a very unfortunate time to kill where someone else did it so why didn't you do lights though why would i do lights because no i'm talking about he's asking me if someone pulls lights this early and i'm not on light i usually pre-camp lights but if i'm not on lights then i'm not going to be going that direction you must have been in the corner who was with you when the lights went out then i wasn't in that corner i was with nobody that's why i ran away you were i started running down the road from the lights area where you came from the camera area there is no other way look it's okay if you hard suss me i do not mind watch me next time i do tasks no problem at all i'm just telling you i would pre-camp lights if i don't pre-camp lights i don't go on them because that's gonna be a kill and i don't want to be the first guy out i don't know man i i don't like any of this i have to remember that i'm much much more down south than you imagine because i'm actually playing from europe and i'm uh i got really high pings i just want to know what the hell is that oh no no i missed voting oh i didn't realize okay all right i kind of like that i kind of like that okay i wasn't even gonna bother saying that i was walking in because that was just gonna make that even more weird be like wait a second but that's what i'm saying they had the person who did it had to be had the vent if it's not boogie or bryce because i didn't see anyone like as far as i'm aware you know lights were off and i i can't see a bee stick in front of me but pretty sure i didn't run past somebody which means they had to either be hiding in lights which is possible but so we don't know who it was and we didn't fudge me we didn't bother asking everybody their locations or like we didn't figure it all out like i saw shady but there's no way he could have gotten that killing someone not noticed it at least i don't think so so not really sure but that's what i'm thinking like i don't i don't want to suss myself because i'm pretty sure i didn't see someone else so my my prime suspects are whoever's about to kill me don't do it everybody's about to kill me um bryce and boogie right now however none of them are in the ssd um triad that i've got my eyes out on it doesn't make sense why any of them would even go there in the first place i i don't know because i mean we're at the point in the game where i think everybo like everyone should know better so that's almost why it's like i don't even know if i can run off of that like would all three people make that mistake or would one of them make that mistake and then all the others are just like yeah sure okay wait oh i bet shady is locking me out so i don't find the body okay wait no no body ah i see interesting i thought shady was gonna kill bryce it did sort of seem like that but uh he didn't and the doors did lock around us and he still didn't do the kill i think we're the only two in o2 so it seems weird that he wouldn't because i'm i'm i mean a crewmate doesn't have a knife on them i still think it's boogie and he's too scared to kill now that called him out why did we yeah i am being framed as [ __ ] my dude i've been i think people are doing it alone for the better part of this round uh if i could would have i haven't i haven't you haven't been alone because you've been looking for a convenient kill did that happen yeah i saw he was top right contamination going in the specimen room i think we need a blood sacrifice they're not killing the specimen the among us gods need a sacrifice and i think we need to vote no i think i'm good i mean i don't have thanks though i mean bryce did put out a good case on boogie no hold on hold on hold on hold on here the argument of being too scared to kill is not a good argument at all if we will it is if we want to run back to the to the devices i'm just saying that argument hey let me throw my hat into this previous conversation i was about to click report when bryce clicked that button because i was running into electric and here's the thing i didn't see someone else coming out and honestly i think whoever did it would have had to vented or it's them to or they're hiding in electric because i didn't see anyone running out to the right that's true i also didn't get too into electric so tell me that's been in there who was near you guys think about this who was near you when the lights went out also boogie it's super weird because i picked the lights instantly all the blacks that's what that it's the black skin in the monk it's because it's it's an honest voting and you guys got a bully wait what did that just get immediately locked and then unlocked um what are you trying to do here are you trying to kill me home huh just say it just do it i still we still didn't figure out why he even called a meeting in the first place i don't know if he was stopping a cool kill down because like obviously he could detract vitals and realized hey nope nobody's okay uh key dick [Laughter] who is who is down on specimen right now or on their way to specimen i think i saw boogie going that way you tell me yeah you saw me go down down down down i'm a liar no you just said that you saw me you saw me ever did you guys hear that no why would you go to admin table at the start to scan a card no no he's saying advent table where you see where people are uh that does seem like a weird area to go that's a weird area to go at the start of the game you know where everybody is weird because everyone you're starting with everyone why do you need to know where they are that makes no sense very european okay he put himself down in that direction yeah there's been two sus events with you i don't know if it's enough to vote for him right now but well for whatever reason would would you ever go to admin table at the start of the round that's what i always do i don't know dude i don't know the european method you know dork and i had a staring contest that's the american meta we don't we don't have a meta we just uh you know i mean he's like this is a very different conversation i was expecting to happen when i found a dead body and no one cares about who did that kill [Music] there's still seven people well i figured because anonymous voting i was just gonna you know stir the pot and i'll vote for boogie i really don't know though honestly i think he was just trying to although we're pretty far in task i don't know i'm starting to think it really wasn't him but i was like ah you know we got a lot of people that the whoever the traitors are imposters they're they're not kill happy so i was like ah screw it but it's quite a different game we can't see task bars we can't see people voting we have dork and tea what the fudge why is crafty hiding over there i don't like that they're gonna stab me in the corner of this bathroom aren't they it's crafty trying to catch somebody or was he trying to do the catching shady came out from that well there's crafty we're all checking each other for bodies but hey where'd you kill him no would you kill him no where'd you kill him okay shady came away from crap crap he's [Laughter] no do where'd you kill him no which which where'd you put the body no i put the body i i have all my tasks done anyway so i can just mess around all right i guess i'll go be a detective and by that i mean i'm going to go watch who's on fan games let me check who's on cams dork what he just vent i don't know maybe he followed me uh okay so whoever was t came out from there was tea on i'm sorry okay it's gotta be dork because the why are the doors he's just he's toying with me he's got to be the imposter yeah no please i'm so young don't do it please it has to be him right there's no way that they keep coincidentally closing the doors everywhere dork and i are [Music] [Laughter] there's a point where i'm like it has to be dork because i'm not kidding you every room we were in the doors would only close in our room ever and it's only us around yeah it was like every single time and i was like all right this is weird [Music] you
