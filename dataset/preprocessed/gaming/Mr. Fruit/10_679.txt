hi ad hold on my name's mr. rout and welcome back to destiny - and believe it or not the deed is done my friends about a week ago I set myself upon a perilous journey a journey to get to not forgotten and by God George he's done it that's right I now have the not forgotten in my own possession I have heard that the not forgotten is arguably probably the greatest gun in destiny to PvP so I am so happy I got it you see the joke is it's not true at all in fact it's just it just takes up vault space so what did I really just grind for clout I don't know maybe I guess but we are headed into some crucible my friends to at least use this a couple times before I put it into my vault for the rest of eternity but again at least I can say I did it speaking of Pinnacle weapons though you'll see I do have the are blessed equipped I still haven't finished the comodo quest so why not you know I'm in grind City right now let's just get another pinnacle PvP gun I'm not kidding you 15 minutes later and queue for a game oh my god it just took me 20 minutes to find a game once I thought I got that not forgotten I thought my sanity would be restored but clearly I was wrong but that was curious what did it cost to get not forgotten absolutely everything I said I would solo grind to 5,500 and that was mostly true I got to 4900 and then after just an absolute Fiesta of several games being reset over and over and over again I realized what in the world am I trying to prove I don't really care I'm ooh I am literally losing my mind so I grouped up and hey 5500 playing with randoms was just it was too much I couldn't do it look at this thing in my hands never did I ever think that I would be the owner of an AI forgotten and never did I ever think that I would be the owner bro what is going on with this connection never did I ever think I'd either get Damascus but look at me one day Damascus the next not forgotten the sky is the limit here with me I hate you what what the good news - thanks to my comp journey as EMM is only getting cranked up oh what's that mr. fruit you wanted to use off meta stuff but we'll get punished why didn't that nade go around the boxes I'm a hundred percent dad it's like I'm no longer playing comp to still just play competitive people it's great oh my heavy ammo or not heavy ammo special ammo okay are the less time notes supposed to use not forgotten but like I said I am trying to get Komodo here so I got the shots I might as well use them about come on let me Adam who's next huh you're next you're next holy hackers oh you're weak no don't you take my kill but yeah that's okay okay we are here multitasking baby I'm supposed to show off the most pinnacle pinnacle crucible weapon that there is and I'm grinding for another one you just can't stop this grind oh not forgotten whoo sorry okay and back because that was unaware Lunas Al and I forgotten got nerfed pretty severely at one point they were a 180 hand King and I believe but thanks to magnificent how they get three tap and then if you had the proc onto the next kill you could sometimes two tap which made them pretty insane and definitely worth the grind then they got nerfed to 150 s so the extra damage buff actually doesn't do anything you have two three tap regardless they're just a hand cannon now there's really nothing special about them apart from the fact that not as many people have them I wish I had gotten the not forgotten earlier though because when I did try it on someone's account on the video I made previously oh my don't my Jesus mr. fruit listen I'm not warm I haven't played in a little while I definitely like to not forgotten I like the range on this way more than the Lunas al but yeah everyone was like why why are you granting for this like these are garbage and to that I say again I don't know just let me have my fun okay I never said it was a smart idea I just said that I did it and just like the Damascus grind I told myself I would do it and so is more about principle than anything else nice grenade you can I'd me but all a brought back I only got now get on in there ooh trials today though the last weekend I need to go flawless in order to Jesus Christ I mean I don't know if Jesus is gone flawless yet I don't know if he concerns himself with trials of Osiris there's a kill and there's not a kill there's there's a kill and it already ran out okay that seemed a little bit faster than usual but whatever finalist you and me buddy you and me okay low-key though what would you guys say to me slap in my class I'm thinking about possibly spicing up the rest of the season by swapping to a different class maybe hunter or warlock I'm tempted to do warlock dude because the ac-130 class that just looks like so much fun I want to fly around everywhere and just become a killstreak where do I apply just don't be a just don't be a Titan all right well I'm on it oh ah yeah this Komodo grind is gonna be so much nicer than the not forgotten oh oh let me tell you that I've already done the glory grind so really what I'm gonna do is just get the not forgotten to 69 crucible kills and then we're good what do we had three sick reminds me of trying to get the Luna Hal final blows and competitive and I love when they made the video there's like some comment like well idiot if you try to shoot more than like one or two people a match with it you get more kills well thank you kind commenter for your incredibly instructive feedback god I fell off the map query didn't pay attention to anything I was saying in that video because the whole point was if I use it I'm at a clear disadvantage cuz everyone's using special and stuff or has something that's better at range that can kill me way quicker this wasn't just like oh just use it for head because if that was the case well then yeah I'd have tons of kills but couple that with the fact that you know it's elimination and so you don't get that many kills in a game regardless and it's just a recipe for disaster I'm a hundred percent a day yet but I'm gonna I'm gonna embarrass this kid but he didn't challenge see like right now I could just be like floating around you don't say my problem is my exotics and light level on all my other classes are lacking to say the least I'm coming I'm coming Bob I got you buddy I'll look it's an ac-130 yeah I regret it cuz now more than ever the rest of this season just gonna be sweating in PvP I didn't think he could get worse but I was so wrong challenge me oh god didn't account for the charge time properly a silly me oh my god yeah just kill me yeah I'm just gonna fall them out and the good news is though now that I'm off my comp grind I can finally it might really spawn it back into the stumbling I can finally go back to the auto-rifle meta I've been able to enjoy it as much because been sweating it away and I would have used bringing auto rifles in competitive but I had to get the one I'll final blows it wasn't really a choice a conscious decision on my part but William hype I'm out here doing my my darndest oh my god I'm just embarrassing kids left and right bro come here oh I'm doing my part team but we're still losing quite considerably where are they you little ac-130 setup they never expected they never expected dude and that's what makes it so great ah I didn't want that kill anyway alright cross map you ready for it wait someone just went wait a second NoHo oh my god we lost by a point team come on we're better than that most ranks in the game actually well I think it's only fair though that they not forgetting gets the classic rumble test so I made a comment on my Damascus video six months of grinding for a 16 minute video really dude be like that in this case it was well you have to thank all the way back to first getting the Lunas howl which was an ordeal in itself and in the past week of my sanity so what's the price of that priceless so I don't know you guys tell me was it worth it please like the video and subscribe if you have it a comment down below give me the last we digits on the back if your mother's credit card and subscribe to my only thing alright it's rubber bro Rumble jime let me quickly just getting our blessed kill here because oh I'm a slave to that grind fog it didn't work take two it still didn't work I've heard these guns are better on console so I guess if that's some good news but aside from that I've heard they're they're pretty useless so and having used them for quite a bit recently I can say that I'm not a fan if I had to choose a hand cannon to use I would definitely just go like my dire promise I definitely definitely like that one a lot more it's the scent of the our Blessed baby bodge eye that's the sound of me dying stick to the okay nice spawn bungu god oh now I'm just gonna just sweat in every single game I play oh okay new idea don't go for a legend until the end of the season when I don't need to make any more videos fudge you didn't get that killer idea was help that guy come on come on I know you see me yeah holy lag Batman I know I know I know I forgot enough around but I'm just trying to multitask here I'm just in that grind mode dude it's like oh I can do two things at once well then I'm all-in it's okay it's just god what is with this I hit that guy like three times and then it all just happened so these guys you're bullying me and I think the thing that will help me stay sane is changing to a different what bro honors question here I'm not trying to mean do hunters have the fastest melee cuz I swear to god hunters can double melee me faster like it's almost never a tie with a double hunter with a hunter I feel like especially if I hit first like I swear I'll punch spill punch and then they'll punch me again before I punch them I know maybe it's just sort of some sort of registration or I miss it I don't really know but it is what it is so I think a new class is gonna be just what I need to spice it up like I said I really want to be an ac-130 dad dodge oh my god oh my god oh my god I thought my room was hot but then I'm playing in this Lobby and I've realized what a true sweat looks like also can we talk about how garbage heavy linear fusion rifles are not even one shots to the body wait that what's the point of that why the árboles can do that what are we like anything you'd do that I guess the one thing you got going for is if you get a precision headshot on supers but I think the art less might even be able to do that - I I guess I I don't know I I don't know okay so the rumble test might be indefinitely suspended for the rest of this season in fact all crucible testing may be delayed for the rest of this season I'm gonna embarrass this kid ring come here try me try me try me what the heck bro I said try me not run away ha ha we got him let's go team wait a second I'm the only one on this team though okay well the answer to the can the are blasts one shot yes it can't and if a spawn is this bungo take my grenade he's gonna he's gonna ac-130 me he's gonna ac-130 me he's okay he's going to run away actually so what's on the menu here lads for the rest of this season what do we have we've got a wall some auto rifles I want to try fish show I have to get the Komodo obviously I actually never finished brandy scout so I have to do that as well and then two more weeks of flawless probably to complete my trials on it she adds like a pretty stacked season a gun dent content I'm practically making that myself and there wasn't much to do this season which is why I'm I'm here with my not forgotten you know oh sweet summer child I did not what oh my god I can't even swore rah skadoosh boo Boop nice Goldie watts you were the nail that was the hammer and I whacked you fudge be a good nail and get hammered oh ho ho we need to dad another our blood skill right back to the non-for yard in here folks as I'm supposed to be doing oh my brow I don't know I could have sworn like one of those hit but now I have to warm up for every PvP game that I have to play cuz I'm just playing cracked Joe Schmoe yeah we got peacekeepers well my friends the bread has been acquired at the cost of my sanity and turns out also my skill based matchmaking to say farewell to mr. fruit in the crucible and say hello to mr. vegetable because I'll be a potato moving forward and some people said I inspired them to go get the knife or you're on that was not my intention stop get some help see [Music] [Music]
