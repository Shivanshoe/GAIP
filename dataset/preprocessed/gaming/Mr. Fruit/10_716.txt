okay what the Dickens is that thing oh my god hi ad hope you and mr. fruit and welcome to shadow arena I know I know immediately I missed your froat McNair whoa where's my waifu what you mean this is a new battle royale currently and closed beta it was I believe a game mode in black desert online the MMO but they took it away and now they're making a separate standalone game with it yeah obviously it's not dubbed in English yet I played one game I had absolutely no idea what I was doing but I had fun and I killed some people you can choose from pretty boy yeah well I'd bunch of other people but it's kind of like a for the most part male a brawler hero did battle royale I know if that makes any sense but she has a samurai sword and then she has a whole bunch of abilities that will get through in the game probably you'll you'll learn fast Oh check her out watch it it's not really quick before we get into the heat of things I wanted to let you guys know I'm giving away an alienware 25 240 Hertz gaming monitor sponsored by her friends over at advanced GG there's a link in the description below to enter for free so what do you have to lose and if you haven't already check out advance GG we have our own flavor mr. drew cherry limeade and if I say so myself it is delicious so let's go over this real quick obviously like I said for the most part melee based combat so I have my primary attack with my sword I'm an alternate way suit I do a nice strike I have a bow and arrow I pull out and if I hit a full shot they'll get knocked over I have a counter-attack Suzu then I have an attack where I create some distance skirt or I just go and vulnerable and I see I can kick some people and that's pretty much it now the confusing part comes from this inventory so there is PvE in the battle royale you like level up and that kind of stuff it's kind of MOBA ask in that sense currently just because it's pre game I have all my abilities but you have to level up during the game to get abilities then you can level up those abilities you get gear get stronger gear so on so forth it does kind of remind me of Paragon so sorry blue oh you want a duel let's go oh shoot are you ready duel in progress ready fully charge this oh wait he can just deflect that that's insane I'm gonna create some distance and what you want counter-attack you like that knocked him down hmm try and kick him okay all right this is a nice warm-up I'm invulnerable oh my god you can't do anything about this I'm gonna create some distance wait hold on he's hurting me a lot yeah oh it's on cooldown that would be why I'm just gonna kick him okay now check this out use my bone air pop ah ah ah he's hurting we're almost dead we beat him away he's back for some more okay whoosh go ahead and hit him with that bone it has a lot more damage I talk boom go and vulnerable ah come on come on come on attack me counter-attack Bob not gonna happen kick him and then I'm gonna use this stone him I'm gonna get the combat down for the most part Bob go over here yeah myths to me he's trying to run away I won't let ya what you want what you want what you want check this out give him a kick and that's sushi and run in and counter-attack oh he's dead again you want some more of this huh oh I'll give you some more Oh like that damage I know you do you would dirty boy kick him were you going off to where you running off to huh ah you like the oh he just to flex that that's pretty cool I didn't realize he could do that that's a pretty cool character kick I missed oh that's pretty cool what you do there huh get for the counter-attack though and then I'm just gonna go and roll nerville and destroy his life another kill that was a nice boy let's see I'm fairly confident in my spawning abilities wimmer uneven playing fields but once you get into the game and then you throw gear in there and I don't know what abilities to upgrade a blah blah blah it gets well I get on you do get one free rez though so you get one free death so there's that at least Oh finally I don't know if I can control this but I just turned into a wisp thing and then they shoot okay well it looks like I can kind of control I don't I don't know where to go yeah so I just kind of land I guess there's like landmarks oh my god there's a question mark over here let's see Fatty's eat okay tonight what is going on right now let me let me play defeat the Shadow Lord to activate the altar the fudge okay whatever so here you're gonna see some PvE we got some plebs here every time you kill somebody they'll give you some good old loop we like Luke don't we so pick that up it says I got something better so I'm just gonna clip it I'm just gonna grab that and I'm gonna grab that I got a stun trap I don't actually know how to use that but I got it we'll pick you up a helmet that's important obviously we need all the gear for defensive bonuses if we get enough stuff to like this we can get forgetting combine things for better gear there's a random little chest here give me that give me them shoes boy thank you my feet we're getting all tired oh wait a minute oh maybe you don't always get a res but in the first three minutes yeah there's a grace period so if you die in the grace period you're good to go it's fine so maybe incentivizes you to fight a little earlier but I don't see anybody so imma just loot up I'm gonna do it a can and yeah I don't really know what I'm doing it's just never says you got something better I go okay I trust you and I let the game equip it for me seems to be the easiest way to go about things but I'm just trying to get XP really to unlock some skills here which I have to so I'm gonna go ahead and get my arrow and my knock back my little blade dodge back thing I just like that it's a little safe ah okay so I was able to fuse an item for a better blade okay Shadow Lord will appear in 30 seconds I should slay that apparently give me give me your stuff thank you soon enough I'll be able to combine that into something useful where is the Shadow Lord not even remotely close to me good to know but I got me a sammich that we're just farming PvE okay what do you want from me I got another skill though so let's go for my invulnerability thing I like that um I don't really know what I'm supposed to be looking for around here hmm well how about that that seems fancy oh yeah look at green helmet yeah I assume these landmarks gotta have something decent right you know there's another treasure chest you don't mind if I do I just got a bonus 100 for a minute I guess I don't know how that works but oh my oh yeah that extra damage so in one minute the circle is gonna start closing Oh closing in here that didn't sound normal oh my god went four days and ba-bop the Shadow Lord has been slain hmm alright well I don't know where that leaves me honestly but there's something in the water I guess I'll claim this oh that arm is better than what I have I did not mean to do that but whatever Shadow Lord will appear in 30 seconds oh shoot okay is this one closer to me not really there's still 26 people left though yeah that seems like quite a few people and I imagine everybody's gonna be going for this Demon Lord fella because why wouldn't you you know am I on fire alright well I don't think I'm gonna get to the Demon Lord in time so I'll just pick up goodies where I see him also last game when I played people just found their way to me they made it really easy yeah they just kept coming and I kept killing them it also helped that I spawn like right next to the Demon Lord that was brow a part of it the Demon Lord has been killed again of course somebody has three kills that's terrifying you do good a lot it seems from killing people too so it's unfortunate I have not gotten to do that all right this guy's a big guy aren't you big fella we got here but that's not gonna stop me no it won't ya what are these small dudes that are hurting me I don't I don't appreciate you guys I'm gonna shoot my bow and arrow aah wait what are you doing here I'm gonna kick you yeah get away from me do you hear you scream let me pick up all my goodies here real quick before somebody else just comes along and takes them off oh I got Dragon Slayer armor hold up that seemed like gold yeah okay you can kind of see the icon there okay that seems really good now it'd be a good time to engage I suppose although there is an alarming amount of people still here so no one's really dying the circle is getting pretty small and I'm in it so I'm just curious where everybody else is yeah yeah yeah counter-attack wow that's a wait am I getting hit by actual people no there's just a buttload of AI oh no I'm you just grabbed all this fusible item fusible item fusible item okay well I got a way better sword somehow so that's good news these guys are slowly wilting away at my oh I got better arm I don't know what's going on here but I I feel like I got good gear see this is the part I don't really understand I enjoy slicing these NPC's don't don't get me wrong but this part of my character I'm out doing it you like that oh that's a lot of people dead fusible item sure just go ahead and grab all those I can upgrade an ability let's upgrade my a kickback little shorter cooldown on that come out come out wherever you are you cowards I'll take you all on I actually have some damage buffs so if you could find me like sooner rather than later that'd be pretty rad oh where did you come from I'm gonna knock you down boom didn't even see it coming oh my god my damage oh my god my damage what I'm gonna kick you back you're us we got a kill we got a kill okay a lot of stuff here just grab everything grab everything before someone else comes because surely they will I don't know just grab grab grab grab grab grab grab grab okay upgrade everything okay I sit I imagine we got some better stuff I don't know I got obliterate it though in a skill book okay I can upgrade something oh I'm gonna do my knock back for the third ability thing which means does law have a cool-down as possible this is a dangerous area they say oh and I see why bah full

darn thing oh my god yeah the person who first had 11 gills they knew what they were doing alright I have no doubt that was a lot to take in so hopefully you understood what was going on and

yourselves a fantastic I'll talk to you and the next one very well [Music]
