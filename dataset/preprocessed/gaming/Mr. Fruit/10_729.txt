hi everyone my name's mr. Furth and welcome back to Calgary modern warfare and and today's video we're gonna be using the M 91 more specifically the warhead blueprint that I believe you got for it in 155 during the last season but you can clearly see here mine has platinum here it isn't gold pretty cool again if you've seen my other LMG videos what I'm going for here is trying to turn the LMG into as little of an LMG as possible yeah we've got the compensator for Rico jump a m91 infantry for the aim-down-sight speed a movement speed 5mw laser specifically for the sprint of fire speed no stock stock for the movement speed a downside span and you know it step up with 80s speed spreader five-speed literally all the ADF speed and sprint to fire speed and movement speed as possible and wouldn't you know it moving is still sluggish area that sides still sluggish and you guessed it spread to fire speed still sluggish but it's better than what it is to boot and that's what matters so we're gonna hop on into our dirty old houseboat now let me just go ahead and address it I am still sick I've been waiting around trying to get better specifically not so congested so that I could record and not bother people because I know like myself they're probably some people out there that just don't really want to listen to some congested dude so if you're not into that this is your fair warning you are free to click off did they leave oh man I miss them it was retort I didn't really want them to click away what does that pink smoke anyway it does kind of cool I think this is a care package though a mom give me the good stuff Oh what do we got aha all right fine you deserve it I guess Oh cluster strike yeah you go ahead and have that one buddy old pal famously the m9 one has a giant freaking magazine which is to say hundred shots I can just sit here holding down the left click button whatever and it's just it's gonna go for days unfortunately because it has so much in the mag and everything and bullets aren't as lethal as you would expect them to be I mean they're still gonna get the job done but in a couple more shots than you would think it's necessary I think he's above you oh my god mr. fruit hip-firing with an LMG yeah crazy son of a gun to watch this ready oh yeah ah that is gonna jump on somebody ninja style ha ha high just fit so congested man especially since my last video I made with God I was like ah but this is the worst of it nope today was even worse would you believe it you probably would yeah you probably would scuse me see hmm and I don't I don't believe you I don't believe you game well he can just run around with these akimbo pistols and kick ya right to me while I can shoot a point-blank in the friend with a couple shots of it like machines and he's just blocking it off like it's a little jaunt through the the part during the night a little brisk rod night I don't know he's just trying to finish the steps on his SmartWatch gotta hit those daily limits got to fill those rings brow I know that grind I know that great let me reload this didn't even notice the Platinum by the way but it does look pretty cool it should also mention I didn't really know how to bring this up it's nothing short of an absolute tragedy so I would appreciate your thoughts and prayers in these hard times like I said my congestion has been rough it's it's been pretty bad unfortunately I've gotten to that part where you're so congested you can no longer taste things well I thought you know what maybe if I make something with enough of us you scared the living daylights haven't oh he was hiding in the corner I saved you oh my god now you owe me the right of surprise what ever since you owe me your life wait I gotta be talking gasping go dark damaged fruit you got chef bring Beto you could have gotten yourself gunship but you just moving around swinging your wiener around I don't know like I was saying enough about wieners the absolute tragedy you guys know I made some green tea in the last episode out with my throat bad sickness well I went to go make some more except this time I thought oh wait I have some chai tea I can make and chai tea is delicious and you're like wait a minute mr. foo you said you couldn't even make green tea how do you make chai tea listen it's just it comes in a free all you do is combine half milk and half of the chai tea mix okay I'll take your applause but I certainly don't you know I certainly don't deserve it it's really simple didn't realize that was the end of the game either didn't either call my feet tell him but that's not the point you already just you take both you blow him at a cup and you put in the microwave 16 and for SPMS go suck so back to my story I made some chai tea because the flavor is amazing and it's usually pretty potent it's not like super strong but like you know it's a hard to miss flavor so I was like oh yes I'm gonna make the chai tea I've got to taste it well I made it and I thought it was a bad batch or something I was like hmm no it's probably just the chai mix or something but like ah well I'll just yeah surely I'll make another batch for just a double check I'll ask my fiance you know they're the test it and see what she says well she said it tastes exactly like normal chai which is to say I still couldn't taste a darn thing I made it your chai tea and I couldn't judge Diddy of it uh so I don't have anything to drink well why don't you just go ahead and drink it anyway well because it's like what 200 something guy I mean it's got the milk and then the chai tea mix and the carbs and that sugar and the calories I mean no point in in drinking any of it if I can't enjoy it like I had a small piece of cheesecake left over in the fridge and I was like oh I'm gonna eat wait a second I like why would I treat myself to cheesecake if I can't enjoy it because at what point at that point I'm not I've not treat myself to anything in fact all I'm doing is myself is a disservice is because I'm cheating eating cheesecake and getting nothing for it that just doesn't sound like fun it just sounds like a mistake didn't need any my cheesecake but a sad day it's been a rough sad hello hello darkness ok God inspired me in front of him one more time I'm gonna get my revenge yep just hold that trigger down sooner or later it's gonna work and I'm gonna use this cruise vessel not because I want to get kills as we all know more kills means worse skill based matchmaking or better skill based management yeah I mean depends on how you're looking at better opponents so I bother with that if they're not gonna bow oh by the way I swapped to the gold leave that that's certainly go that's a lot of gold you gotta like it you gotta like it I like it I love it I want some more I try so hard but I can't get enough of rigor well I couldn't record today though I took some time to grind out some stuff and call duty Jesus Christ this ride shields gonna be the death of me I am at 13 out of 25 3 kill sprees I believe which is like hey yeah yeah that's over a lot of games I didn't get that just today that would have been the mirror that would be great but the problem is I get like a three kills pretty maybe like once every game or every other game which doesn't sound bad but when all I'm doing is we're running around with a riot shield trying to get a three kill spree and failing over and over again most dozens of times and around to hopefully get one and then every time you get two and die before you get three you die inside and it's so frustrating it feels like it's been eternity it feels like it's not worth it and it's just slow slow progress so in other words to get the next 12 or however many I need could be anywhere from 12 to 24 games even more which maybe that doesn't sound bad but at like three to four games an hour because you got it you got to do like the right game mode to have a good chance it that's that's a lot of hours of just pulling my hair apart and so I'm gonna have to do it eventually but I'm just taking a bit by bit piece by piece excuse me sir I'm preparing my tea I took the teabag out of my green tea this time because my fiancee pitied me after my Tryon Siddhant and decided to make me some green tea with some honey and I appreciate her ooh and it is scalding Oh oh heavens to Betsy that's hot yeah I went in for another sip thinking I wasn't that bad it was even worse a first time I've burned my friggin tongue or whatever suck I'm gonna be feeling that for a couple of days it's like the first bite of a pizza you know when you get it there's this local place and the best bite is that first bite on the end of that pizza slice but it's fresh out of the oven and it is hot hot hot hot hot hot ah but you got to do it because of the payoff is so worth it but every time you burn the top of your mouth but you do it every time knowing the consequences knowing that for the next few days that top palate of your mouth wouldn't be suffering that perhaps the the top now that my mouth has something else to say about it it's like bro it ain't worth it but the rest of my body my stomach especially says no it is are you kidding me I was trying to get a sip of my Chi and rila and sit in the corner cuz it does it you got to prepare you got to prepare for the real ugh it's like going on a trip going on the camping trip you got it you got to double-check everything wallet keys phone check do that a couple hundred times they leave the kids home hold on let me head count the way the map we have an agenda do we have all the supplies it's it's it's insane you go half way only to realize that you forgot your your your park pass that's great yeah there go back but we got to pay extra money I actually have no idea I've never really been camping so I'm making things up but I do know that you need some park passes depending on the parks that you busy in fact in order to camp I imagine most parks would the great outdoors you know what I'm saying I can't want to play Firewatch never played that but I've always heard good things said something I want to do bill Dibble dabble in perhaps perhaps it is we're doing I'm gonna be honest we're doing pretty well with this thing with all things considered not as again the PKM still best boy if if you had to ask me am I not okay but I mean it's it's like the peepee LMG so the hitmarker machine gotta love it god I need my tea right now but it's too hot doing joy it's just flavorless flavorless hot water everything's flavorless thought about it though maybe that would be easier way to live life because then I wouldn't be so helplessly addicted to food in cravings and then I could eat healthy because it doesn't matter what it tastes like all it matters in nutrition about imagine if I didn't have a sweet tooth oh yeah that would be great yeah what that would be fantastic but then I also thought about it how would I know if food is bad you know if you have to go according to taste kind of like that phenomenon where people are born without like without nerve endings or whatever that how that works straight up they could have like just this giant gash on the side of their head or something and they wouldn't know they'd just be going about their day until they passed out or whatever ever died because they what do I can't feel it so like that's it's like pain sucks but pain is also very important because it lets your body know it and you know that like yo let's escalate this this ain't great but if you don't have those you know you're done for it's kind of terrifying to think about like in some ways that would be great like a blessing you know like let's say you had a sunburn you wouldn't have to feel the pain all the time but at the same time you might also be damaging yourself you're hurting yourself you're doing even further damage because you can't feel that pain you can't feel if you're pushing your body too far if something's happened scary stuff man scary stuff but believe me I can feel pain I feel it was so much of it I think about it when my back was seasoned up I didn't feel pain I probably would just kept going and done some some irreparable damage to my back without even without even knowing because I couldn't feel that pain couldn't feel my back being like breath this Sh ain't right I just brought ya whatever I've got about my day they're the normal way though I just fall over helplessly without any support in my spine and my legs is awkward yeah that wasn't bad apologies on going all over the place as I tend to do but I've just been zambian out on so much so much Cod today that edges didn't even I was just I was on the groove and also my voice hurts and I very much need this tea but I also need this tea - simmer down a little bit I'm gonna need you to cool down literally so with that said I want to thank all very much for watching we got one more LMG to showcase then we got riot shield snipers and for more assault rifles and then dump mass gets booth with us I think very much for watching everyone fantastic Jack yeah you in the next one while I'm hopefully feeling better farewell [Music]
