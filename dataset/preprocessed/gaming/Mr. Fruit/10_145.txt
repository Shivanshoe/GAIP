were you freaking stupid this is a 10 win i feel it ah yeah a little turtle that could okay we're going to get peacock maybe maybe hi everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to super auto pets paul geez if you or anyone you know has become addicted because of these videos i'm not liable for any damages mental and or physical enjoy the video okay i could get a hat but i'm going for a background call me crazy i think we're going snowy mountain i like snowy mountain honestly out of all these i think snowman's my favorite except maybe lava mountain we're going this sure okay take it from the top great start for the greedy gamba oh my stunks are up we are the suave swimmers all right and we lose okay yep that one loss definitely won't come in handy later to be fair it's the greedy gamba you know it's it's just will you freaking fella oh my i don't want to level these guys until we have tier two so i can get a tier three early on and hopefully it's massive we're getting a level three pick actually that's completely troll if we do because there's no point in holding onto it it does nothing for us the only bonus we get would be for selling it which we're not gonna do wait oh my god we're just still gonna lose oh my god all right ah that is not what i was hoping for wow it all hurts it hurts all over every everything okay you know what i'm gonna kamikaze with the duck because he's useless anyway i don't know no let me be honest probably just restart stupid he really got i said four mosquitoes okay well thankfully it matters we lost with a okay so we're restarting new fresh game yup incredible about the horse first that was a mechanical misplay love to see that though so anyway moist mushrooms ah we could have been them okay we still tied this oh my god yeah okay but it's not now love me some ducks should probably just stabilize a little bit i need some kind of combat value oh well what do we have here you know this isn't the perfect greedy gamba but you lose what you gotta do sir there's another figure just try not to lose that's the name of the game all right you might be like what's this strat here you know i don't really know anyone without the greedy gamble i think greedy gamble is just my play stuff you know it's it's not so much a strategy it's my reckless abandonment and terrible shot calls i think that's what the greedy game does oh my god we won [Music] really really telling me more yeah i mean that's not terrible the duck is of no value anymore i'm afraid also the greedy gamba are swans but i'm not getting swan see this is a man of culture level two duck that's what you like to see but also get pooped on not even close oh my god you're bad okay two ends we need these early dubs okay i spoke it into existence [Music] ah we might have a little synergy going on here i'd go elephant into camel which goes into peacock maybe maybe this is a 10 win i feel it this one feels good uh i don't feel that good about it anymore really oh my what oh but wait a second it don't matter stupid stupid uh do we who's that sweet hi that is so unfortunate gonna use that really bad but well now this is interesting i'm getting rid of this i'm just gonna let's just be honest into the peacock but we're just selling it yolo and i'm buying it now the ox i could keep i could but i'm not going to yes good but the level 3 cricket is even better now the greedy gamba is almost online now all we're missing buffalo monkey and if you ask me how i'm feeling i'mma let you understand and we're gonna give you up i'm never gonna let you down never gonna run around and desert you never gonna make you cry never gonna say goodbye give me the stub real quick get pooped on you're not strangers to else you hold this one and so many more you wonder why you keep losing it's cause you don't gamble with your stress and if you ask me what i'm doing i'm gonna make something up i don't know what to do we are gonna witness i thought it for attack suck yes what do what do it do well yolo [Music] buffalo is not here and we're missing the level 2 swan that really helps with the the greedy gamba all right that is a pretty good play not going to lie he oh okay we're going to get peacock you know the more i say the worse it sounds but it's true that are we okay i don't think so no no no okay getting a little if i've got if we have one buffalo at this point oh my god the monkey we're just missing the buffalo man you know what screw this it ain't happening no more get out of here you know what maybe we're just going 50 50 hippo whatever it's the new strat oh oh my okay yup yup yup yup don't mind if i do all right my boy's about to start eating never mind i forgot swallowed that up okay now we eating we eating again boom wait a second oh ah fudge if we just i mean we still win but okay okay we're turning on we got the monkeys ready wait i'm trolling why didn't i use the canned food before actual trolley um whatever i mean it's not like i was hoping the monkey would carry me we could try and make an absolute monster of a scorpion might be why because he one shots everything this is an interesting idea i'm kind of i i'm kind of liking it yeah i'll just get rid of it we'll keep the hippo but we're gonna try and buff up this scorpion but watch boom poison attack stupid uh doesn't matter i'm dead stupid oh that is oh okay oh we eating oh we eating wait a second no not that worse we were so close though okay all right all right two health left though and a chocolate wow this is does not upgrade when leveling [Music] well scorpion it was fun man i really wanted to make them work but let's be honest it happened save that okay now this is looking real good sorry about the little boy hippo but we're back but he got a bison unlike me my bicycle would be like 40 40 right now ah but we win let's go okay and then okay if we find a tiger put that behind our snake hold up one more monkey one more ah we could have had something incredible now do i do the seal because no we're gonna do that will chocolate next turn unless we find something ooh now the penguin can replace the swan the greedy swan hasn't it's helped some sorry scorpion but not that much and we're just trying to make a beefy hippo okay yes eat up my hippo yes yes good you'll die to this guy anyway but not important yeah we waiting okay well this is looking pretty good i'm not going to lie to you all yes food with health and attack effects are doubled ooh these are all tempting hey how's that i don't know i'm gonna try it out uh the camel at this point isn't doing much so we could get a penguin to just get another plus one plus one but that's not really that's not that big you know what i'm saying so let's do that [Music] wish that was the tiger let's do this plus two plus two to everybody love that and nothing perfect kind of feels like i'm trolling since i only have four on the board this late but trust in the process my friends it'll all get better in time [Music] and just like that uh we're dead okay what the fudge the freaking okay that's pretty bad okay maybe we go skunk right now ah let's try for one re-roll that sucks oh give all friends i mean mamathon paper looks cool is it going to help us i don't think it can hurt us but who would i want to give an extra life to that might just be the play and it's still looking good don't give up hope melon armor coming in huge wait fudge we were too off are you kidding me did we lose come on it's so close [Music] hey if my snake sniped anyone better i'm peeing angrily okay take it from top it's a trap mr fruit don't do it so i buy them all we gotta win early man and sometimes this is what it takes okay i'm an unwashed bagels i'm a winner yes i am not yes we okay we do tied and then that and then give me a qriket what come on move aside thank you looks like a winning comp to me guys are they trolling me the fact that i almost lost it is sad um yeah i mean uh okay spider here is nice a whale actually wait a second actually pretty good all right this is a strong board all right we're vibing this should carry us for like two three rounds maybe probably should i think nah that almost trolled us but thankfully we're gucci sheesh look at that good start good start okay another scooter cause it ain't nothing like [Music] okay so instead what we're going to do is all about this we're going to need nom nom and then you know what i'm saying another easy job i'm calling it all right i know it's a little preliminary but we are strong and i'd like to think i'm good no to waste uh and i will one shot the camel and i one shot the dog that oh my this wasn't even close oh my yikes couldn't be us oh that's good moan everybody i'm going to try it two spooners and we're off to the races okay we're fine with the lame snipe good damage yes not chubby good all right everyone yeah a little turtle that could all right i was that five four that's only four i could have sworn that was five ones we don't need the horse but on the off chance it gets us to a level three easier sheep here's real good chief all right we're just we're getting the horse well that sucks maybe [Music] seems good you raise me up so i can stand on mount dios holy that's a pretty big peacock already ah [Music] it's not looking great chief it's looking miserable we might we barely lost that is so tragic okay that's our first owl though you know so [Music] just pretty much take your stupid food come on i'm gonna have to ditch the bison aiden probably next turn you know for the level three ouch ah okay well that might be all she oh my god that is definitely all she wrote holy jesus oh my okay yeah yeah i'm dead i'm dead i get it good oh boy okay see we just stopped getting lucky quite frankly um no watch all right bison that's it you lost your privilege i'm not losing again so i don't need this name right that looks good i don't like summoner belts but here i am with a summoner belt i wanted to buy shin kick not my fault the game's fault blame the game uh do we lose we might it's close we win all right forgot what the dub screen looked like i don't know what the doughy okay oh my buffing sure we need a turkey if we want any chance of winning him good news is he's dead wait ah but he spawns okay uh this is actually okay uh yeah okay no oh that almost okay that almost threw it for us but we're fine okay all right we gotta keep getting wins because longer would you look at that you gotta think we get rid of uh the horse now right [Music] real good oh so i might get rid of this spooner gets me the least amount of faints i guess uh wow ah it's not looking good here chief it's gonna be close no we lost that one dang that was close but we're just turning on man [Music] oh maybe no time for shark friends we tiger the turkey and i think it's better than the shark sorry shark i wanted to see you succeed i did but we don't have that luxury today a level two turkey if we stay alive might just be what sets us apart and ultimately leads us to victory lots of melon armor though don't like that okay maren but uh we're good okay okay wait a second am i gonna win with the degenerate meta build maybe i think we what are we rolling for just turkey pretty much right or tiger or chocolate bars all right that's pretty good oh god all right now you just come on now don't tip to me with a good time oh my god here we go plus 12 plus 12 on every summon right now it's pretty good it's pretty good all right this team looks we got this oh we got this 100 right guys oh my god it's not even it's not even close look at this oh my bop don't mind if i do hey it's not even my final four okay hold up two more wins oh come now come now okay this is ooh this is close cuz a level two tiger makes this double so it would be plus 12 plus 12 no it'll be plus s plus 18 plus 18 anyway oh my god okay so we're going here and then i just go on the whale sure okay this is plus 18. we surely wait tiger billy does not upgrade when leveling i thought it did no okay this is fine badge i could have sworn it i thought i remember it's fine everybody uh oh it's fine a level three turkey wouldn't better granted we wouldn't have got it this round anyway but this is looking a little scary oh this is we're fine uh okay we took away the melon armor that's big i think we went we a hundred percent yes okay how many how many is that one more oh come on come on sure give me a level three here 10 wins and it feels so good yeah okay i was going to say there might be a build holy stats 50 31 swan you gotta respect it holy do they just have too many raw stats chief they might what hold on no we're fine we're fine [Applause] let's go [Music] i played the degenerate meta build and we won because it's the degenerate metabold the tiger turkey buy an animal for three gold are all animals always three gold uh mosquitoes start a battle do one damage to a random enemy yeah oh look at the little piggy what is this it only gives me fish and pigs [Applause] champions my failure see the good news is now i gotta dub on camera so you saw it happen even though the other ones were without meta builds but that's irrelevant [Music] [Music] you
