36 inch waist seam and get out of my face okay so i gotta eat by a mountain lion apparent like we're asking the same question oh you get in trouble if you ask the same one twice he just said uh anyone that asked the same question was eaten by mountain lion oh oops i got eaten but i really need to know the answer this is my rng round all right this is round without fruit and it was this one great rich person yeah why not wait i don't remember the majority of you i'm just voting for like what's british food you know i know what sounds disgusting uh it's actually one of my favorite snacks joey so outdoor oh i'm gonna shove some salmon mayonnaise up your butt and see how you like them right it's salmon oh yeah ironically i don't think we're flaming any of the dishes and it's salmon mayonnaise oh my god oh my god oh my god i should have never remembered that wine jelly it's good i wasn't here which before these veggies clearly oh this is to the fruit round one but which ones are fruits yeah this is so easy i think i should if i don't do well here fruit that's a lot of pressure i feel pretty good i was wondering let's go i thought radish or turnip seeds [Laughter] oh i'm not that fast at typing though wait what oh and no george clooney's character promotions wait i'm not wait wait i used to be fast uh i forgot try to type them all in before time runs out um oh my god oh god i don't know i i got like three all for getting one i think so i oh no we are all forgetting the same ones yeah um i don't remember the last one uh that's not count yo i saw that is it not like way i don't remember what that was everyone's just voting bryce come on i got the indian ocean i honestly have no idea what the southern ocean is i don't know i've never heard of him get ratio why do you get the power slice he has more followers you got racist yeah dude damn make another overwatch tweet so i can ratio again just wait until overwatch 2 comes out okay that's fine wait who it shows the same slices as me all right here we go here we go that one that you share with me hit me up hit me up that is not just you appreciate that what you got rob also were you a mermaid thank you rob is definitely he is a mermaid he is absolutely a mermaid power slice power slice pow oh that's right that's right baby we take those what's the point i got you joey i'm just looking at that give me these power slices and they never won't oh my god all right let's go you guys [Applause] let's go honestly i'm just trying to figure out what the size i get myself twice my spin you get to spend there this is why i choose to just answer incorrectly because when i don't answer correctly i do better yeah the game is trying to just sort of give you the win joey needs all the helping i go there all the time did someone say mcdonald's i don't know i don't know this i only know one and it's no well i know i'm loving it and i'm assuming they just chose the same slogan since 1943 and happened baby yeah 12. i definitely guessed on a couple wow oh my god i've got the least [Laughter] yeah how long is the olympic 100 meter dash in feet on your device wait oh i thought i would get to do it again oh i should have guessed a little more yeah i yeah i thought it was just like rapid fire but did you guess a nice round number because i did yeah me too i think i messed it up i think i'm going for this it's gonna be like 336 or something correct come on come on come on that was 20 feet aka six meters so i just did quick maps i'm so stoked i would have gotten close to the question yeah and i both typed in 300 immediately whose ghost do i sometimes see on my mountain top oh what what he'll give him hints for this one [Music] i don't get it it's a reference to something we're just not getting it what oh my god to be fair fruit you still haven't figured out the actual person i was distracted when i saw beethoven so joey the question though is are you talking about beethoven the piano player or beethoven the dog this man don't worry it doesn't do anything it's a bait hey i got the power slice game one it did help i did i got and bryce well joey's gonna win he's going to get so many points wait what the oh my god oh that was a horrible spin that was actually pretty bad for me oh let's go okay i love this this game is awesome yeah this game's cool now i remember how much i hate this oh we get the last one last one pick mine i might not by myself jump it's going to me baby split i put three winning shirts i don't think it takes the multipliers in if it splits okay all right now give me i think i'm just honestly between the people in those areas light green light green light green light [Applause] come on like green light green you win the punt again we have i think i got this oh come on oh nope oh oh no come on he still doesn't oh why don't i win now you can die oh i guess so wait but then shark's gonna make it finally shark might win no not yet like 20k luckily i think we all get until the next time the wheel comes up to catch up as well i know so it might not just be showing wait oh i have to get 20 oh yeah because you have to get to 20k he didn't make it please you guys got to let me win bro he needs to answer my question no he needs to answer i hope you didn't come here to make friends please be ravioli again you're gonna match so good oh i don't know any of these people i don't what the fudge oh dang it that was okay i know some of these okay i don't oh no no no no no please bro no i keep getting them wrong how is derpy winning i watch i literally didn't get one wrong i'm gonna be honest i don't know half of these i only knew two of them [Music] and i sort of figured out root ball was probably rupaul yeah i guess that's a good one okay nice i need more slices good which of these are done okay i'm a nerd i like this some of these i don't know i feel pretty good last time i did that though i got last so i have no idea oh my god completely i'm not sure about the last one i picked but i just play overwatch i know nothing about dungeons and dragons okay maybe i didn't know all of you i need to divert your fighters diversifying overwatch question we'll get you a rule 34 overwatch i feel great about my choices on this one okay so here's what we were looking for uh match the overwatch ultimate oh damn it i got the load so close too many i did not pick the cube name is many overflows yeah i bought a gelatinous cube oh i did and that's only lord of the rings yeah i need like i need like a tiny bit more points what was the seating capacity of the american dream aka the world's longest so stupid the longest limousine choose a number that makes you feel easy oh derpy did we pick the same number probably i think i remember there being one that was really really really long and they basically had to i think they did a new limo two turns they couldn't do turns but the correct answer is i'm hoping it's lower 70s 69 oh my god i was going to go with 80. and i was like no too low how also why is it an odd number i'm very confused the driver the driver makes it up you know i'm not a drinker but that's gonna change tonight i'm considering pick a slot that speaks to you i need this guys he needs it there's some notes man i'm so close i've never been this close how do you turn i literally need to win three no one picked please don't worry i got it i need this please what does that mean i got a cloud that means we have to answer the thing oh my gosh if he wins this twice in a row i'm gonna rage why are you guys doing it because yes yes i had an important question the game is live you still have your points come on come on i need this i need this come on come on give me oh okay well derby is the only one saying don't give it come on oh oh yes that's right that's right baby you better have a good question i hate this game dude come on baby let's go somebody kick him out of the call let's go yes let's get it yes joey my question let's get it yes the wheel of proportions i'm live i lied i am not [Applause] [Applause] oh rob's question should have been answered we could have gotten robbed we could have found out if max is okay but instead christian you lost 250 dollars [Laughter] i think max is smiling about it that's too funny somewhere max is like hell yeah he's laughing honestly that is perfect that was a good end to that one i was surprised that it had all three of our names on the end there that was crazy that's because you were all over the point total yeah if you guys had just given me the pot nope no definitely not fruit if you had just gave me the pot you wouldn't have lost money it's on you this is my new favorite that was a that was a hype that was a hype moment reminds me of like the portal ending no way i know for [Music] give me 50. i hate this game [Music] [Music] you
