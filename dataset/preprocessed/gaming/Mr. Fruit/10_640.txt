hi ad hope you won money mr. fruit and welcome back to halo the Master Chief collection why does it feel I feel like the music so loud right off my friends take a look at this halo 2 anniversary has officially been added to the PC Edition and those familiar with the channel know that I never played halo 2 and its prime I still did play some halo 2 though just not a whole bunch and I still remember playing on the last day before they shut the server's down that was a sad time but hey look at us now oh forgot just how cake dubbed the announcer is holy cow this feels weird Oh Mike I need to raise my sensitivity so much wow would you look at this map though I don't think I ever actually got a chance to play halo 2 anniversary multiplayer or campaign actually yeah I don't think I ever played it and evidently I oh there they are I was gonna say I can't find the enemy Oh Mike oh my mr. fruit Oh what they already planted it rip I can't tell you the last time I did this but we are holding an Xbox controller and using it to play Halo oh my god yeah like a sin you could go hell for you I don't know if gold will forgive me for this turned my back on the mask and keyboard ways but I think so is everybody else in this lobby master keyboard sucks on this oh wait no I'm trying to grab a shot here you shouted I forgot just how much you owe but the dinosaurs I miss those bomb drop bomb dropped okay I did we get it calm down now I know what this map is I can't get out of here it's just hard work it's by its bob-bob display Jeff plant blown up any army enemy has the bomb enemy army nation is there like an fov setting I don't know what it is but it feels like I'm like two feet from my monitor it's just the old the old halo waves I suppose but goodness gracious we're in struggle to add my friends anybody want to join me currently only population me so it's a little lonely ha ha I know there's like bxb or BRB or double cheeked up kind of thing but I don't know how to do that like I guess sad I never never played halo 2 so I didn't I don't really have that muscle memory + trying to do that on a keyboard what in the world would that be like let click you re out of control right judge I'll say for you know Misano it's so weird coming from so many years of experience and just straight halo and to think that now I am but such a lowly pleb when it comes to all of this it's the team shouting and stuff man like either I'm trying to 800 thought I killed my friend it's Negro time baby wait a second wait a second wait a second Oh would you look at this oh we're do wheel now baby I'm not looking at my radar either totally forgot about that man wait that that's already 105 field of view you kiddin I changed it again I honestly can't really tell the difference maybe I'm just crazy maybe it's my huge jacked forearms either way I'm sick of your excuses mr. fruit it is time the Senate will do sir oh come back he'll that's so sad that's depressing I got a shouter bomb um Wow it is like impossible to tell that I'm shooting this thing Lia's okay unless I didn't get a hit marker Lia the gun barely moves that is the easiest to control shot gun I've ever seen in my entire life don't cut me captain I'm gonna get on this can you not grenade me sir ah turret kill Revenge project you're how do I get off this thing let me get a we get off this wild ride oddly enough the announcers so right now and we're not playing Bob he's like yeah I got nothing to announce but when we're playing I said yes Bob play Bob this farm that Butterfinger pata Puma give me this thing whoa raucous pawns baby God has been so long para weapons learning Oh Mike just the mini nukes the many new oh my god okay copy and far we don't know where they are all your dead Oh almost a rotate him I think oh my god finally I have found in skill intensive weapon that I was born to use I was gonna say how did I not kill him we're gonna play this guy so hard okay or he's dead so it's hard to I'll play a dead man I will say though the map is beautiful love the updated map a--they they worked with here know all that Wow I really forgot just how good hey lil Nate's are and how much more I have to use them that's where all my my my grenade throwing skills have come from because before you know you need like a good a good throat like pop you gotta get like the right recoil around a corner boom then you can like yeah just one shot at dude practically anyway bxb BRB double XP whatever the fudge is called it's essentially this glitch more latley I mean yeah that's pretty much a glitch its next boy but it was kept in the game and steps up people are you kidding me come back here boy come back you had a shotgun and of course this grenade did half a million damage you shoot and then you go to like real of but you but you may like cancel a reload animation which then lets you shoot again so you get a double shots instead like got it be like good lot then I explained that perfectly if you're confused I don't what to tell you I mean it's simple did blah blah what's what's confusing about bottle top so hard to see people I'm just not used to halos radar you remember that like moving puts you on the radar look at the radar best way to find people I'm trying to visually find people but I'm gonna be honest the visual noise and stuff they don't stand out nearly as much as one would think perhaps on older halo maps but it's really not this one I asked the patented is seventeen shot Oh whatever you pick whatever halo pilot player dreams of Jesus Christ mr. fruit you're terrible you're garbage I'm gonna I'm about to disown myself now that one was a little fine late we get oh I don't wait through that nade we got a grenade kill we got it we got a killing spree boys and girls mr. fruit is back in business oh my god I can make that jump this wolf crouch-jump oh oh oh she a strong side okay wait wait a second my hallo tendencies are coming back go Gandhi jump action you can't tell what I'm crouching in the air yeah I'm spamming at some little up then on top of that oh oh so for those unaware I believe it was a pro player that made this infamous but you you run with your head away like that and then make sure your head hit box a lot smaller so people trying to chase you or finish you off can't kill you as easily ah ha ah ah the grenade I'm feeling it again though I'm feeling it you know I think I'm finally back I'm about to get a killing frenzy you heard is that give me a sniper that's not a sniper ah the sniper spawns around here doesn't it oh no this is the sniper rifle okay now your boy is back in business almost killing frenzy there we go headshot ah fudge oh oh that didn't kill him ah just get a kill mr. fruit use your BR then Jesus I can't get hit a snipe for the life of me man yeah I did it's killing frenzy we rented it with you guys like two bodies whatever there we go headshot Raider child from a hip fire and an MVP ok mr. roat welcome to Zenith I love this man I will not let you destroy my spirit because I swear to God I used to be good yeah hail infinite please for the love of God optimize PC more cuz if hail infinite comes out and it sucks and you have to play the controller imma be honest I'm not gonna play much I'm just a change to gamer and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with people oh what that always right above me again great art mr. fruit first strike god I love I love his enthusiasm we need a little dinosaurs what are you guys doing what oh well yeah I said why are they not dying no he isn't over show that's what somebody hoping somebody help me are you I get that's fine I got it mr. scary cats Jesus isn't there uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh and we're going through the TP baby Oh No Bo's wait what you didn't die Oh oh my god I think he had sniper rocket so he jumped off son of a gun I dude oh yeah well the boys got a shotgun oh oh killing spree to start the game I'm the only person with kills on my team holy jesus oh well hello there mr. dinosaur new plan I'm gonna wait for them to TP through here wait a second oh okay like I said wait a second we're gonna wait for them to TP through this oh wait a second they got a big machine you woke my got a couple chango's in my area how copy leave us dinosaur yep he sees me okay we're taking the Banshee down I repeat taking the bench fudge okay apparently it seemed to show wait let me pick up a battle rifle oh Jesus wait I was picking up weapons did you got everything hurts apparently there's a way to lock down with a rocket launcher does that hail it to thing or did they add that cuz I don't remember that sir I wasn't in Halo 3 on a bank like a lost puppy I don't know where I am and I don't know where I belong you're dead son yeah we're just gonna start the game with another killing friends why don't we go for a perfection although if we really want a perfection I'm gonna have to watch out oh oh oh killing frenzy I'm gonna have to watch out for snipers nice nade me good team shot I will most definitely steal that kill and I'm most definitely in a world of her they're gonna come through this teepee eventually I should I don't think they'd I don't think they realize that part of the map exists so oh we're getting aided and there's someone around us but I don't think he knows that I'm here I'm going above-ground this will probably kill me oh it will if I fall off the map okay lot of tangos near us buddy a lot of tangos holy Jesus don't don't go there I can't see if I can't kick hands oh we got a kill we got it oh we're three kills away and then all we had to do is not dime we get a perfection oh is this over shield huh I don't remember him announcing it but I like that oh is that a perfect VR shot double kill thanks to my over shield renews the Covenant rifle it's been a little out the carbine rather I don't remember he's going in for the melee not today Satan not today I'm feeling fresh I'm feeling frisky do all super bounce no okay but we are back on mouse and keyboard if you didn't pick that up well I would assume you did from the key bindings that you would see but point is for that is a nice grenade that's my point that's another nice grenade triple kill where's he over where's she over give me the over where's my over give me the know in it oh did I stick him aren't you oh wait oh I killed him first a little bit was rough just a learning curve but like riding a bike baby I'm back screw this guy in the Banshee in particular imma leave that up to my friend okay well he's dead that's all he's dead that's a nice name me okay he not that but it should be an assist you what check this out let's go who needs this thing in AHA now I can transfer safely oh you wanna lose a PR battle ok as it would turn out we are both probably the worst players to ever exist in video games ever so well played sir I think it's down here I really hope so it is someone took the rocket launcher though oh it's the sound of a man cannon if you were curious oh gee some nice Nate's there me yeah just keep peppering him and assist well we'll talk about that later but I'm just gonna keep weighing in with nades they've got they've got a pretty good cross fire on me here captain Oh Oh give me that give me that okay here we go oh that was short-lived yeah I get destroyed dude see the way I just tracked on his body with that melee I'm insane secret agent me was we heard they know I'm here they just keep throw we nerds the double melee oh that's a nice man that's a nice grenade bounced not a melee bounce I can't see through the smoke and the firing and the sad decided to deafness he normally just grab the sniper though and you come right here in these poke a pop oh nice an assist I'll take it but unfortunately ah ah ah wow I just I was a clay target and and they were the buckshot Oh match lost how 23 in five and that ladies and gentlemen is some halo 2 anniversary multiplayer
