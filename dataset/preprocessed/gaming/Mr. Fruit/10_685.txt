hi everyone my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to the GG ovaries a podcast episode 31 that is in if that's actually true and 28 was Nickelodeon yep and 29 was Disney Channel and then 33 was no 33

hey anyway and then g4tv was like hundreds once 136 wasn't 136 because I remember I got to get there for a ninja warrior and attack of the show anyway this is the podcast in today's episode we talked about the craves taken over the world Animal Crossing talked about season of the real season of the off with destiny and where that's at right now sorry and then we talked about war zone a little bit we touched a little bit on that and some of that good stuff we answered some questions talked about skill based matchmaking it's everybody's favorite thing on this channel dude literally like I'm playing cod they're like oh my God he's complains about skill bush bad so stay tuned for this episode we love you Ciena saying hello in today's episode episode 31 in our quarantine life coming at you live from all of our separate bedroom spaces you guys don't get to pick up my gym that's still there Mike oh wow you uh you don't have it on like a bed frame or a box my bed yeah nah dude I live my parents basement of 26 minutes or 25 I can't remember how old I am like like I wasn't having anybody over but me so like like I don't give a [ __ ] sleeping on the floor okay well that's all that matters and staying hydrated we like to see that yeah in my parents and Disney cups oh yeah they're cute you know what weird take here I always get ostracized for this I've only been to Disney once and I was like six and I don't have great memories okay see you then I've been to Disneyland my like my whole life probably over a hundred times where is the time yeah I know it's weird I know and like I'm like the kid that's like I didn't let it go to Disney because that go so much and people are like shut the [ __ ] up kid like nobody likes that guy but I was like I didn't want I didn't go to Disneyland for like 12 to 16 because I was like I'm sick of it but like I can't do this anymore no I I like it again I only went when I was young and the only thing I remember was I went on Space Mountain or whatever and I just remember almost dying because apparently I was with my dad and then the will see they didn't have like actual seatbelts she's had a little bar yeah I think yeah but I was so small and young but the bar didn't even like because I was with my dad so it didn't even like come down like it was like literally like neck height for me where it stopped so I straight I was straight like like gripping this thing and I remember one time we'd go up this hill and go down and I like start to like like are you I was like six I think you're like your six-year-old mind is telling you it was way crazier than maybe it was I'm just terrified but I just remember like you know like when you like go up and down you kind of like go out of the seat yeah Americans you can't see either like you can't like kind of no no you get like just thrown and I just like started to like lift up cuz I I couldn't like and my dad just had to like he like would like held me down it like grabbed me like midair like take me down and just hold me there I just remembered all I remember is just gripping on a dead death grip like this is it this is how it ends and that and a giant turkey leg I mean oh yeah and we got a turkey leg and I was like this is it was bigger than me when I was I feel like her yeah yeah this okay I'm better now I have you fans when I was a kid when I got older I was like this place kind of [ __ ] sucks another hot take I don't know which is which so Disneyworld so this is I remember Disneyworld is in Florida and Florida's closer to the world than California is wait what but they're all a part of the world no in the in the sense of the world is like other countries oh ok so like Florida's closer to the world than California's you know it's crazy enough I'll remember at Disney World for the Disneyland California it wasn't Disneyland first yes Disneyland is the og okay so like Disney World I'd know so much about this cuz I go all the time so Disney World has like like five different parks and they have like Epcot there's only Magic Kingdom and and then California Adventure is like on the other side and it's like fun I probably may be after a hundred times yeah I don't know if I would just and then I used to be the kid like when I saw like people and like the mascot like costumes and stuff like that that you'd like though like though like why would you make the Queen from Alice in Wonderland like that pitch is just terrifying like haha like I don't like that like I don't like and then like my parents one time so I guess this is Inc called like the Mickey cafe or something like that and there's like there's always like characters walking around and it was like me and my little brothers he'll like honestly wanna hug their beauty was terrifying like I hated those things it's like just go away from me I'm just trying to eat my scrambled eggs okay well yeah that's the Disney picture I'm just not big on I'm kind of over amusement parks it just for me there's nothing worth standing two hours for in line and then getting like a minute ride and there being like let's do it again I like if it's a big roller coaster like what coasters are good but like like like I want to go to galaxy's edge or whatever but hearing about just one how small it is to how crowded it is and then three how little there actually is to do I guess really all they have is the Millennium Falcon ride or whatever see the only reason I want to go to galaxies and because of savvis workshop is that way you make the like city yeah yeah that's the only reason I want to go backs blue that's a fact I really want to go really bad for but everyone for a while yeah like that's the only reason why I would go and you want to know the thing I hate most about Disneyland the [ __ ] parents pushing their kids in a stroller man and just walk it just at the space of molasses man and you're just trying to like go and like get to the rides and people are just like slowly stroll as so triggering did I hate that the most that's my biggest pet peeve about Disneyland are the strollers just don't bring a kid who's like 2 years old they're not gonna remember anything I know I don't understand that the tree memories Rob know they don't have meant like was your okay well thing about this way to the parents have to make memories during the early kids here too it's not like okay well the first five years I'm gonna stay in the house just like with Grandma well maybe you as a two-year-old I was a much more sophisticated do road okay and we poop who pee-peed once a day alright so yeah but your parents told you yes looking back it no actually I was a terrible kid at the edge of town exactly you [ __ ] your pants every single day you shoot your pants and as an adult there's no doubt you shoot yeah I mean if I poop my pants now god only knows was a kid no doubt it was worse hey we're back it always finds his way back but instead of finding a way back to poop let's find our way back to Animal Crossing Oh first on the list wait what do you really know oh you will yeah I think we all well Rob's probably played the least he's passively played at the most yeah the first three days Sydney and I were grinding like we got up and it was the first thing we did and then like I'm kind of just like sparsely played like I go and I go and keep the street going that the little ATM I keep the streak alive of course and and then I just kind of do what Tom Nook says so like he said like I need to furnace these houses so crime currently looking for a hay bed so if you guys usually wings just make the hay bed yeah it's like 20 weeds oh really yeah yeah it's in there and then I'm also looking for a bench porch thing a bench swing so if you could know where any I could find those let me know copy that I just got to that part where I have enough furniture other houses well I I haven't had as much time to play as I'd like Claire practically has a mausoleum going you know I'm saying she's like cyberpunk City but I'm over here still like look I gotta chop the trees for the day she's like why you why do you even do that as like what do you mean it's like it's all I have to do and you chop my trees like so I just got the ladder very exciting oh yeah dudes kill me all those weed so much so I cleaned all the weeds and I I'm waiting for a good day though to sell my turnips I've had some doo doo prices yeah I've had to the highest I've had is like 62 oh well I bought I bought mine at 107 so like they're pretty cheap they're like 40 or something like that yeah I don't believe you a lot of bells I googled it and I think if she sells minimum for a hundred anywhere from 100 to 150 cuz we didn't like it we did spend more than 4,000 and we bought 40 so they must have been in the hundreds then but all I know is I'm even checking players turn oppressors for years like 63 oh yeah I'm not saying that big of a loss although in a couple days I guess in a day and a half whatever I'm just gonna have to bite it anyway because they're gonna expire sour [ __ ] god prices are going yeah yeah see if there's a turn stops around that's what I'm here for hates it so I guess instead of just vaguely mentioning things from the game that people who don't play it be like let it turn up stocks I don't really get it here's the thing too is like people are still cuz obviously since the whole quarantine life Animal Crossing came out at a perfect time and it actually broke blue might know it more specifically but I know it broke all the records sword and shield broke for the switch but I believe Animal Crossing sold even more units oh man so according to commit sue the game sold 1.88 million physical copies in the first three days the physical physical copies oh my and that's oh and one point out million now here's the kicker this was just in Japan wait what oh my here's another here's another kicker from it suit doesn't track digital sales so it sold even more than that well that's why I was gonna say it's like I bought Mayan digital I meant by the physical gaming so long oh I can't remember the last game so if that's just physical my god maybe destiny - and then um for the hardware sales Nintendo is rolling in big right now like Dave Leary had the perfect console for lid my right now he's Tom Nook at the beginning of the day yeah so last week alone Japan sold 390 mm consoles and which is a really big milestone cuz now the switch is sold more than the Wii in Japan which is a pretty big deal yeah thank you was ps2 no honestly this would be the console to catch it it'll take a long time but this is like once Nintendo cuz Nintendo is gonna do the same thing like how there's a Nintendo 2ds 3ds yeah just keep rid of it like like they have a switch there's just gonna be variations of the switch or like sweet Plus which will have battery battery life and grab for really kind of colors like yeah as long as they keep on like building on the switch because there's no reason not to build on the switch like this is this is probably gonna be their console for the next 15 20 years realistically it's like just like the DS right we had the DS the D s was like the first it was like to thousands of mm mm months okay for yes or maybe maybe mm got one and I was jelly I want to say 2005 because emerald came out in O four I think on advance so Nintendo tsk mout in 2004 and I was switch launched on 2016 which was basically 12 years end of the D s so it's about 12 year but what has always been handheld so even if the switch doesn't stay as the switch Nintendo is gonna keep on Nintendo is done with with having a different hand held in a different console like yeah Nintendo's from now on is going to be the console is the handheld all they have to do is as technology advances and gets cheaper just keep making the switch better in just better battery life better capability memory graphic wise I was gonna say compact but I mean it's already I mean do you guys find you have to make the screen smaller but your switch more handheld or on the TV honestly pretty good mix of both approach that I'm more so on TV like we're never boasting most of the time it's on my monitor but like if I'm like if I don't want to talk to anybody and it's like 1:00 in the morning I'll bring my switch into bed and yeah play is so super nice about it I mean I bring my switch whenever I travel I always bring my switch everywhere anyway dude free entertainment well that was like this game it's so much fun dude and I never really thought I would like Animal Crossing this much dude and it's just like I was like what's so fun about picking weeds in the night 20 minutes into the game I'm like oh my god baby missing wheat right there like right what do you do it it's right behind the tree you got to move the camera just a little bit and then like I thought I would get sick of the music dude but it's like oh it's so relaxing oh you're playing gardening simulator like the place you're trying to plant the whole plant your little garden in front of your house you're trying to make sure your house is nice and tidy man I really need table for my house what if people come to visit me I need to get like a table for outside oh Jesus Christ it's not even God to that for me I've started like decorating like divas and bucks house I'm like ooh diva needs like these flowers like these would look really cute in front of her house and then Sydney but who get the table and like the coffee mug we could put that in front of Debus place so it looks like she's like coffee in the morning I'm like what am i doing like I'm are paying for these little characters that I love the only thing I wish I had was like animals and pets which I guess you're there already animals so it would be weird like not know but like being able to I have like livestock or actual pets yeah like little dog falls you ran oh I see like like a litter box I thought at some point Sydney and I would get a cat there's nuts not a thing no well the I mean I guess it gets weird too because like I'd have to enslave my neighbor you know be like you're my pet cat now they should have made like little human pets yeah because I guess that buck is a horse and I don't want to have like you know that's kind of mean I personally have a green koala and a yellow peacock Oh what do you have blue oh I have the robot bird Oh a robot bird yeah is that a rare drop what I got diva buck diva so it's a it's the ostrich what's his name uh total does it have like yellow feathers in the back no uh I need his naming I need to look this up he's a robobird he's tight and then I have like a cool little like a little like koala yo sprocket sprocket rocket yeah he's a robot bird Oh what the fudge yeah actually guys he's super tight what that's happy um but that's why I love him there's gotta be a rare drop I don't know about that I don't want him I want him as my nails sick he's tight all blue did you not see this little penguin villager trust me buddy I saw it it looks almost literally just like ya tell me buddy I saw it I'm hoping to get him in sin I'm hoping to get him I hope and have a move in but I mean that's how far you guys a lot are you in like I'm really not far at all I I just started playing like two days ago okay so we're probably all like it the same kind of spot right now uh you guys are probably ahead of me well I do know that um Claire is trying to literally sabotage two of her villagers because they don't like her she wants him to leave so she can get new bit life yeah like the two ones she got she doesn't like so she's trying to annoy them enough that they'll leave looking at new ones enough like what do you need you to annoy them like whacking with a net or push him or just like ignore one of them's like ignore them if you don't talk to them yeah but Claire's just a different person dude I just don't have a freakin robot bird oh that's yeah dude now that I know that's the drop dude I'm gonna keep reroll on my neighbor's just keep why get out of here whack whack you're not welcome in a little Bop okay okay okay Island names what do we have oh no okay mines kind of simpie so cuz I was playing with Syd so why is his squid vil because she goes by squid squid though okay blue you don't wanna know mine's probably worse what is yours you go first okay I panicked and don't ask me why this is the only thing I could think of it felt like it now I don't know where Tom looks like we need an island name and I'm around all these people and they're like everyone make an idea so I thought like oh I'll just see what they make they'll probably make a better one I can't think of something don't I don't know dude the only thing I can think it was alig my land so my island [Music] you name the island with the people that you share with the cute little animals and they live in league my land I hope your cat literally this is all you I had fruit island that's stupidly come on that's better than leave the land but it's like free but I was like that's too basically as I don't know leave mine so I don't know if I can rename it hope I doubt I can but it would be nice gotta pick this well then the problem is he takes all the contributions and the first one he goes okay so uh fruit has licked my land who's in favor never just I'm like oh no like it's League Malia I thought it would literally be like oh here their options which one do you want but no my opinion yeah so anyway blue you can't get out of wizard I didn't mine Paragon to like the land but it's still depressing so I'm living in a sanctuary that could have existed IRL but I di show I should have named mine battle born to I'm living in a better place a place where battle born thrived see at least minded population that's just no one would live there I would like to put my Animal Crossing opinion out there because this is like a hot topic amongst animal crossers I didn't know this know your animal crush you know if you tie the science kipper you're the problem I don't know I don't think I don't know oh I'm not a time skipper no I mean takes away from the game okay but here's the thing what they do doesn't impact you literally at all if someone has more fun time skipping let them not to mention not to mention you can't like be mad time skipper's cuz most people that are mad at times capers are the people who like reroll to give villagers they wanted or fruit they wanted oh yeah I was so upset and I go whatever it's what I got ya I got peaches I literally I looked at the list of fruit and I go I hope I get anything but Apple iboot it out Apple and Claire got apples dating such a basis yeah everybody landed was like you have peaches yeah I got cherries everyone Oh everyone got oranges in my group like I haven't even some reason everyone got oranges I haven't even seen an orange orange from somebody visiting ours i I haven't ever I've never opened up my port or whatever though I'm scared oh it's kind of sketch okay actual friends on your switch you guys have bound rules or ground rules but like come a straight up come in and just like they can't they can't like mine or anything like that unless you make them your best friend okay yes people are gonna come in I come out of my house and it's like just a barren wasteland like what the fudge happened just tree trunks left everywhere like oh my god no they can't do any of that unless you physically give them permission so they can drop you stuff though right oh that's drops I guess it could get scary though they could like it what if you have a time see if they drop you uh I don't know like a golden throne like I don't put it away you have to use it like I mean here's the thing where I draw the line right like one eye like friends and there's like this duplication glitch I guess going around which I guess I just patched it but apparently like if you and someone else were sitting in a room and you had a box and you put an item on the box one person would rotate the box and while they're rotating that the other person would grab the item off of it but it was rotating it would stay there and oh just duplicate it and give that person the item so you would do it with a really expensive item just over and over and making tons of money see for me like I wouldn't even want to do that's not fun like you break you're not even playing again like I wouldn't want to do that because suddenly nothing has value yeah but like I would argue people who time-skip are still playing the game they're just not waiting like literally being like okay I'm just gonna put this down and wait for tomorrow there's obviously people who just grind so they're like all right I'm gonna do this but as long as they're still playing it like I think duplication glitches and stuff that kind of ruins it but but I don't think time skipping as long as you're still playing the game that's whatever for me the early game I don't blame anyone for time skipping cuz the early part of the game goes very slow until you you know you get like like the museum and like the the new shop dude I had stock dogs right for that boy I'm like come on in gone in here boy dude all right I legit okay so you guys you guys go through these explanations every time don't you oh no I skip that [ __ ] what's the problem I go through the fossils but then I usually skip the other ones yeah well and then they like show him and then he's like do you want me to explain what this is I'm like I don't got time for you kidding me he gets so excited when you when he tells you about it I don't it's really sad skipper I guess why cuz he was like I love talking about the stuff and I was like oh do tell me about it and then he keeps going on like ah dammit you're just so so cute I can't just not let you explain it that's why I give him something I let him explain it because I feel bad except for the bugs cuz that I don't let me clean the blog because he's but then he actually is happy yeah if you skip the bugs he's like yay but if you skip that's why I listen the fossils if you skip the fossils he's like emo okay fine I'll listen to the fossils well go on because I feel otherwise blathers is gonna start to tell your neighbors and bucks gonna be like robbed like you're addicted blathers what the heck dude he just wants to tell you about this does it give really in that depth in depth like that like they're like drama yeah you come out they're all in a bottle like Claire does that like at some point they're like you know what [ __ ] you man Britain they get pissed they do that but there's not like intermingling like oh my god and you come I said oh oh bread bread spread out they all pull out their hash it's like what long story short animal Crossing's pretty great it's like it's my game of the year so far the funny thing is like like Rob explains I donno I didn't think I'd like it and you can't it's like someone's like what is Animal Crossing oh yeah I don't know like you know what it reminds me of like that grindy kind of like build stuff and make it look cool for all my friends kind of feeling it gives me mine is not really weird well that a little bit but farmville more so like the fact that like you grow crops I I grind I never played Facebook oh my god I grinded so hard I make like little haystack Civil eight-day art I grinded I love farmville but that's a good what it reminds me of it's just it's just so nice and innocent and low-key and it's like discovering new stuff or like you show up and someone news on the island or there's this limited thing or Tom looks like surprise I got an upgrade or something you're like whoa it's a surprise you owe me more money oh yeah well I'm forever in debt but I remember seeing there's like a youtube video out there I saw a couple days ago it's like what three weeks into Animal Crossing looks like or three month I don't remember what it was was it obviously oh oh yeah and I want to say it also gotten that copy early because it came out pretty soon around release but my god I looked at the thing I was like what the fudge like what because the one god the thing that I'm excited for and obviously heat it was terraform his island and he just made this is insane he had like little ecosystems everyone moved in he had his nice little thing like um this waterfall and there was like this exist how'd you do that what is that and then it just got me excited like I could well it was like somebody running down it was like a like a city like someone had like I made a city it was like streets and it was like wait really it was insane enough to link me if you can remember I favorited it I'll look for it I'll need to see it this is nuts grinded for it I like fishing - I haven't gotten like a really rare fish yet but I keep seeing all the videos the people and and Claire's gotten the oarfish thing which is like that giant serpent yeah and then she caught like a diamond like an old dinosaur one the I forget what it's called but the dinosaur Pokemon not dying from that dinosaur animal that was based off relicanth the Pokemon I remember what that fish is called but she caught that thing - the craziest thing I prize at the football fish that's the Finding Nemo fish yeah I got that one - that's the only one though and I've gotten a few spiders it took me a while to not just yeah completely die but now I'm able to catch them just good there's a lot of trial error and dine at some point no no I give Animal Crossing a nine out of ten okay I can't really give it a score right now but yeah I can't give it a score either I already know I'm loaded I mean I like it but we'll see like where exactly it falls you know I also like when I don't like play it for two days then I come back I'm like what is there waiting for me like there's something like that I'm gonna be doing you know what else I like the SAS and Reid hey welcome back to the GG overeasy podcast I am a clap Saint in there to let me know there's an ad break like hurt my hands I've like I literally have like bruised poems from setting up the half rack God so right now I'm like I got a couple things to put my garage to make like a temporary gym like a home gym because I don't know how long it's gonna be or when Jim's gonna reopen and while we're flattening the curve my gains are flattening and I can't have that so I got this half rack and setting that thing up is insane this industrial thing and all we had all of its like you need like a wrench the only thing we had was like pliers oh do you shoulda asked I would I came over like well so what happened was there's a platform that comes with it you put under it it's like bamboo wood so with the pliers I had to set that up but I was having to literally use pliers to screw these things into this wood fro like my hands were like like they wouldn't even like uncurl you know like they're just like me yeah yeah so I was like oh Jesus as I'll try them to rest in tomorrow so come back and it's literally impossible so I have to actually go out I got a socket wrench is a day like Utrecht you went out today and you tried it no it was the day before quarantine hat like official quarantine was mandated here in Colorado when I got socket wrench cuz I don't have any tools so I'm sure I'll use this in the future anyway but how to use a socket wrench but then the same problem was for so many of these you would have the screw on one side but then you have a nut on the other and the only way you could get them together was on one side your socket wrench and but the other one I'm having to have the pliers put all my force hold it down so it doesn't turn so I can use the socket wrench to get into the night bro like my hand like my forearm is you work out though I'm still sore like like it was the way miserable No so I'm waiting on as soon as the weights the waste themselves come in I'll finally be able to do something but uh do we expect some Jim vlogs maybe like some mr. fruit like workouts at home maybe it's a really it's a really tiny part of my garage so it'll be a little janky but like you can like do squats you could do like yeah well they yeah that's why I got a half rack I got that and some dumbbells and pretty much you can do almost anything really that in a bag what's the dumbbells own day you got like well like the only one that I could even get shipped right now was just like five to fifty with five pound increments or five to fifty five of five pound increments okay that's better than I thought yeah I mean you don't need like 95 I was like I need my hundred-plus Jeff so yeah those are going I'll be able to do that but speaking of grinding destiny Oh oh good form thank you always let me put it right back to ya that kind of hurt spit that's right keep those elbows in yeah uh-huh right to the old nipple on anyway destiny to season of the bounty I mean season of the worthy season of the bounties very much what this whole season passes bans everybody's been woke now well no it started with kind of shadow keep definitely start with undying and then ever since it's just a nice emulator this year's blue could you tell me why you hate it so much compared to like for say I guess all your tweeted with like Lisa Simpson and it was like just thinking about how we started from forsaken and our here so my main problem is that the loot has not changed at all isn't forsaken no resets for anything there's no vendor resets and there's no and the reason there has been a vendor ease has caused Bungie knows this all the guns are the same realistically every single gun is the same everyone goes a long ramp age everyone goes outlaw kill clip in PvP the only variety in weapons is in like hand cannons and that's not because people love you know like mid maxing you know perks it's because hand cannons are just always have always been most popular right so everyone always want to give this hand cannon but like there's no there's no loot variety everything is the same every single time a new season comes out it's like oh there's the scout rifle that is the same as the scout rifle we got forsaken oh there's a hand cannon oh just that is the same as another hand cannon a PvE loot is it's where they just I just need a 150 rpm with like 50 with some range and you're good and they're like rangefinder opening shot rangefinder kill clip rangefinder swashbuckler rapid hit did swashbuckler in pvp it's gotten I mean PvP is always super centralized a lot of people are saying this is like the best pvp minute they've had in a while to which I reply that's second even playing destiny it's bad far the phone I appreciate the otters are good now but I mean hard light stick so now there's three weapons that landscape tight like that the phantoon look really the only autos you see or suros hard light which I think some other six hundreds can be used but like really when people were time like o waters its Soroush hard lane and when it comes to PvE which is which should be the most interesting free lose you should have the most PV should be the place where you have the most interesting collection of bills and guns and we're gonna do [ __ ] this should be the this is the main part of the game by vast margin the loop should be super interesting in the biggest part of your game and it's the least interesting in PvE everything is the same there's no there's no interesting perks everything for the most part I think they tried to fix things a little bit with in this season by having like the warmind weapons with the cool warmind cells and that's cool but like how it's it's been so long and I don't see how these warm mine cells are going to like keep people interested and when you have when you still have like better guns essentially and what's up are the are the cells you're talking about the public heroic events that just looked rescanned exactly where our other public okay it's toxic but he's true but no mods on war mine sells these mods that you get for your guns where if you use a seraph weapon getting like a certain kill on an enemy will spawn like these cool war mine cells and like blow up so i'll have like different effects like if you're close to a war mine cell you get damage reduction it's it's really really cool it's a good idea it's cool it's fun that's really all there is it can be very situational for the most part which is nice you know i think this is the coolest they've made loot in a while but it's like kind of like a little bit like too little too late type thing because it's still looted still super boring i don't get excited for new guns if they look cool I'll get them but I'm not like super like type to get one and at that point like your game has kind of failed if you can't keep the main part of your game which is loot interesting so this season for me has been the worst not even close and really I think this is like cursing Osiris level bad season whoa for sure there's more to do in curse of Osiris there's the others probably I mean definitely if your PvP player I mean I'm happy for you because I mean I get trials is fun good luck going flawless and trials as the week goes on because good luck going because less and less people I think I saw that like only 8% of people or something went got less three wins no got to three wins all week what eight pre-shared tires compared to 23% of people who enjoy Charlotte most are asleep before oh my that number is gonna get smaller and smaller so good luck finding like not sweaty matches and trials as time goes on and that is a problem because it's a reward structure in trials and [ __ ] why do we have tokens and trials get that [ __ ] on why is it in there the reason what token what do you mean like that's what like you plug your coins in the chuck-e-cheese machine hope you get something cool out of a that's sad that's why I like game threes Rob were so hard is because everyone was farming up to game threes to get tokens whose fastest way and then because the here's the whole problem too so they would go to three wins cuz that was the shotgun after the horizon yeah they get the three wins that would unlock Astra horizon then they would token farm because the rest of the stuff if you don't go to five wins and seven ones it doesn't dilute the loop pull as much otherwise the auto-rifle be thrown in and the chess piece would be thrown in so if you don't do that you only have the shotgun and then the weeks before which makes it can we also talk about how you take away the tokens but then you don't reset the loop pool you just throw everything that you know reason yeah they take away the tokens for no reason so then they do that so that they get these tokens so they have the best chance to get in after horizon and then they just keep going over and over and over until they get the role they want and so that's why it was no one was at that's why he percent went to three wins I was all people who played trials went to three wins how many people raided last week guy that's what I'd be interested to see that how many people I like game content can be that many say married for seven months I'm sure I can look it up but raids in general I think only I think only I think like 30% of all people like play destiny have touched raids in general so I I don't know the exact number is on that it should also be since we haven't had anything you should be on a rotating pinnacle yeah why do you not even like a pinnacle rekey raid like like Oh last wishes this week's pinnacle raid and then throw us a lot of fires okay this is like you have all these raids and like no one plays them for like whatever reason but then like you have what cuz none of them give you anything good anymore or and yeah power forward like so have a raid where it's like the the one that that one day reset thing like they were like the challenge modifier yeah yeah and just have it be that hard how it was day one for that week and it has a separate looping limit that would be so sick and would make other [ __ ] replayable and I that's what I would love to see that would be so cool I'd like to go back and revisit that kind of thing and I really have a challenging kind of like yo we need to lock in instead of just kind of like dududu like going through a raid like how it is bro I don't know what you're complaining about dude we waited two years to get back the exact trials we've always had dude it's sick okay I don't know what they're like we want it back it's not even the exact same it's less that's worshiping yeah one wonders the tie games so get this Rob this is good lets you off this here is keyboarding i want him to come back so he can hear this he will he will hold on okay he's been robbed Rob you wanna hear something that really will piss you off what so check this out it's supposed to be whoever gets the kill first in the 50/50 No now that's supposed to be how it works that's usually how it works right in the previous week an anomaly apparently there is a bug that there's two sides there's a side that spawns in cave and the side apparently the bug for the week is if you have a tie game the ground will always go to cave because cave would be considered defense team so every single time for the deke it would always go to cave oh god that's so stupid it's so simple I also want to talk about how bad the game's quality lives god with bugs and [ __ ] connections are so bad I there's some reason to be proud of Eddie's another beaver beaver performance oh dude my game runs like [ __ ] now I hate it god what else my game crashes it's stupid things I've seen so many more invisible players than usual now and I don't mean visible players like Oh in this hunter no straight-up like invisible players who have like a little glow around them like they're still loading in yeah that's it I don't know man this isn't just like really testing my resolve with destiny because it's just like you guys find the fun in it so like I'm still trying to find I mean I still like the game I love destiny right but the season is God out of that there if if it's hard for me who cries the share this game I couldn't even imagine how hard it is for normal people an average Joe average dudes who are like oh new Seraph tower every two weeks tight I have one pointedness the past two years well here's the thing - okay so ironically this is the most destiny I played since shadow keep is that you've been grinding yeah and then before shadow keep most pretty much I played since like or shaken and you cry did a lot in opulence though yeah a good bit yeah well like or which was that the one right before I was talking about this I don't know if you're gonna touch on it but how fruit was talking about he was like yeah I'm back I get to grind a couple of pinnacles I haven't been oh yeah yeah this yeah I brought this up with him so what blue was mentioning like season of opulence which was the season right before shadow keep last year was yeah there's so much fun because I'd essentially skipped out on the two seasons before i season a drifter and she's in whatever doesn't matter but the point is I bought a season pass I waited a year and I had a year of stuff to do essentially but now the problem too is not only are we getting even shot of your seasons my opinion it all goes away at the end of the season so if you didn't play season of the undying you don't get to play any of that stuff like the the vex incursions whatever those are gone if you didn't play season of the dawn sundials gone who's the dog was at the end of it with all the Consular was he said I was pretty decent well I would have been amazing for you to play it but but that's the thing like last year friends and I could come back though and I'd be like oh I missed season of the dominoes happening but it's still there and I can still play it or like I can still do the sundial but all the content from the season unless you're playing that season you miss out on it like if you have a quest that it's like kill these vex infiltrators or whatever like you can't do that well you just wouldn't get them you just don't get that stuff anymore yeah like for instance like in season anodyne there was the little vex portal that like started appearing in a tower yeah and like I Korra gave you I think undying bounties and stuff like all that's gone are gone and that's just the frustrating thing too is like that's probably their way to to get you to play even knowing that there's less is because hey you either play now you don't and it's just and my other problem though anyway it's not even like blue mentioned like it's a big blow that we're missing out on these things is because essentially all these seasons are is how can we reschedule we we're we're not even asking for new constants but we're asking for Greece skin continent and they can't even give us that I love the dmg I love you buddy you're a great dude but dmg made that tweet about how people like you know we don't have any rituals this season like what are we supposed to grind like there's no weapons for us to really grind like the new weapons aren't really are boring like rituals are kind of the only thing people a lot of people look forward to because those are the only like really like oh these are weapons with unique pools or the unique perks I only played Ironman to get the stupid bow yeah and it's a bow that do you get a combination of perky like anywhere else these are the only places where you're like okay I know this is gonna be interesting well for the most part I mean not everybody yeah you know these are different these also gives you a clear thing to go for yeah clearquest dmg said in one of his tweets we know you guys want rituals but we have to it comes at the cost of we might not be able to put different weapons and trials and I'm just sitting here like money if we didn't even get you if it takes if it takes that much manpower to get re skinned weapons back in the game not even and and let alone your one weapons that are already in the game if we can't even get those back into year three it takes that much manpower there's some so there's something seriously going wrong with this game where you can't even get risk ins that already exists that are already set up into destiny too we're not even asking for a lot we've already had these things before so it it it worries me a lot so you're just asking for a gun that was out in year one what hasn't for comes you already have and then they're all waiting in the game but like our light level locked in like you couldn't possibly use like like dire promise at and another gonna call the dire promised we have an entire pool of YearOne guns that could come back and at least like give us a little you know maybe a spice spice it up a little bit of spice it's not like people are like it's a chance everyone knows most these guys are gonna suck balls because they're all gonna have the exact same perk ball but you know there might be like a gun or two in that in that list that is like oh this is interesting this is you know oh this one has like explosive payload and time paint you know something a little different so if we can't even get like Rhys kins of these weapons into the game like what like I don't know what's going on like that that worries me a lot I don't know man I I know a little bit of difficulty they're scared of asking people to do things but then they bring something like Charles no Cyrus out so it's just so confusing to me like the PvE side like why don't you give us raids with like guns that have busted [ __ ] percs and maro you make the raid like raids most people don't go into rants there's no reason why we can't have afraid's with cool legendary perks why do we keep making like exotic primaries totally [ __ ] useless you want people to use exotics but everyone's only gonna use like exotic heavies I mean we had last wish yeah we hadn't do you like if like even if someone wasn't a big raider they still had more incentive though because it's like dude this vision of confluence you gotta try and get it sorry yes I never finished the raids but they would at least try to get through the raids cuz there is incentive to do it because there's these unique guns you can get and we don't have that indeed - it's like I just [ __ ] make the raid weapons the same as normal world legend your job how is that [ __ ] fun like how does that incentivize me to do anything I don't know and they're just that they just have like a weird problem where like everything there's no incentive to do anything in the game we only do it because it's cool cuz it's destiny and there's a limited amount and it feels good to shoot stuff yeah but that only goes so far because eventually people like fruit who come to the game every couple months that tie that gaps gonna get farther and farther like I'll come back later I'll come back later like eventually it turns into I don't come back at all if it keeps going the way it is right now which sucks you know it also sucks because we don't have robbed many more Pippin hands I miss you man do I miss playing destiny but like what you just said there's no even especially for me there's no incentive in playing right now I'm not really spicing it up for myself I'm grinding for the not forgotten there's a terrible idea but it's given me this false like that game so it's something to do yeah but something to do in it but it's not like you're gonna use it no but it makes the comp grind at least I'm playing comp and banging my head against the wall trying to yeah get somewhere like that's why I like the ritual weapons something yeah like ritual weapons like mountaintop and stuff that was terrible but at least I'm playing comp in like okay Mort I can see a little progress I'm working towards this provoker okay I just need to that's what I really liked about ritual weapons especially the PvP ones I still don't know why they got rid of pinnacles and honestly it their excuse for it honestly came down to for clues was really overpowered and we don't want to have that again and it's like if you're gonna start retiring legendaries why the [ __ ] would you not put like busted recluses you can just rotate them out I don't even know if we're gonna get that well I don't even know if we're gonna get like busted weapons now that like Legendary's gonna be rotated I don't know I mean it doesn't even need that like you had a good point too it's just all they have to do is not necessarily make new busted perks but do something different or get to purchase together that you normally wouldn't be able to see together yeah like timed an explosive why don't like like what it was like for pool and firing like something interesting wardens law or whatever that strike one that has like a to hit burst whatever makes it completely reworking they couldn't even get that parked org which yeah but like at the very least I got that and I read that and I wanted to use it because of the world yes it didn't work but I was like oh that sounds cool just do something it doesn't have to be like revolution just but whatever anyway I've fully upgraded the bunkers don't ask me why it's literally just by daily bounties over and over and over yeah yes Rob so I saw a tweet and it was like all these emblems are gone and I'm pissed about it oh wait we didn't even touch on that yeah why why are the emblems gone so why are people pasted so the basic rundown is they introduced a new tracking system where you have like little mini banners on your emblems yeah oh that's cool I love that that's what is super cool yeah that's super tight see how hard like I grinded the for this score like I've worked so hard to get this one six nine six now you're probably thinking man all the cool stuff I've done over destiny I can now have on this cool little banner on my emblem well I say nay Robert has a significant amount of the tracking without a range say yeah why I don't know well apparently in order to put in that system they had to do something that did that for whatever reason and also and also didn't even bother being like hey if we did this for this would this be cool they just did like would you be willing Minnesota just got reset like I don't know if those nine full scores I haven't checked I've checked all of us know people are mad cuz it's a lot of some people got mad cuz a lot of people got there I think it was like there we Wallace done gentles and so flawless dungeons reset they got there people were donated shits in a fractal and last season like to get like you know I would've donate like a billion Franklin that got reset for everyone so it was people were just very mad because there's a lot of compliments that people have and have trackers on and put those emblems on to show that tracking they have a pride behind it because there's nothing to do besides show rate a Billy fractal and it's just straight deleted and this is like this is this isn't even like a typical of bungees this has become normal like every single season we know something's gonna get [ __ ] up for some odd reason tell people that like it was gonna like hey guys this next update when we push this out these are gonna get reset no didn't tell anyone give [ __ ] bad taste I'm still bad my favorite weapons Polaris Lance its exotic perkins been busted for two months now two months it doesn't work is that the scout rifle that's like yeah yeah that's sweet it's like the so the Pelorus lands exotic perk well has like three basically it has that a precision Hague is refunded in your mag has dragonfly and then it has the perfect fifth which is like the coolest part of the gun is every fifth shot loads like an explosive round that like sticks to sticks to walls and it explodes that doesn't work right now because if you shoot while that thing is detonating it just disappears still like so you have two months but I have a few months so you have to shoot your perfect fish shot wait don't shoot let it explode and then start shooting again it's basically useless working as intended it kind of kills the the entire point of the gun having like a higher DPS than other Legendary's so I hope I'm glad you're starting to see the light I still love destiny I just it's just when there's no evolution of your loot since forsaken at all maybe things got worse like it's got I think it's gotten worse it's like here the this room works I will say my favorite part by this season has been being able to wake up no grab my popcorn and read the subreddit like literally I just pulled it all over the top I just pulled it up though and I'm just gonna name just a few threads I see at the very front right okay yes this one Bungie this game now just feels like a mobile game a bounty simulator with minimum content but regular updates to keep a treadmill going to collect materials so Bungie said now that they are split from activision that they are in charge of our own destiny looking at the state of the game right now is this really what they wanted their game to be trials is only only going to get worse and that was a good thread that was pretty much talking about what blue is talking about how you're just ostracizing all the people from trials and it's just every week is gonna get fewer player base worse and worse and people because like that's a thing right like when we're when the dream teams like let's go flaws we should be able to go flaws yes like it shouldn't be out of the realm of possibility for us to go flawless but the fact that we have to try so hard or get lucky with matches it just speaks to how this trial system is working well and then the trials Armour is literally the exact same armor right yeah I hear one get the [ __ ] it's not even ornaments either let's talk about iron banner this year all 208 before you iron banner let's talk about the fact that trials of Osiris ornaments or an ever verse oh yeah what yeah the trials of Osiris like exotic ornaments all in ever versus the trials of Osiris ship sparrow ever verse emotes ever verse that's that's blatant that's shameless Bungie you should be ashamed of yourself that's shameless and that's what we're doing with shame just so they make it hard to love every season it gets worse with every verse and I understand that they need to make money and that's tight like absolutely like every verse is important for you guys to survive but what I'm saying like them saying we can't put knife all specific loot rewards and then the next season you put like a ship for the Scarlet keep you put a sparrow for the Scarlet keep you put a crown a tempest ornament that scarlet keep theme like I'm just like you could have but you put in a can dude they can it's so easy just make like on top of what you make forever verse just also put a ship in for this night fall or something this week you know like it's so easy fruit hit us with our banner yeah what's with iron banners and literally nothing has changed the armor is back from I think a year one or whatever it's not even the thing to is you're not even working for it to be an ornament just normal armor no new weapons same exact weapon pool we've always had literally the only thing new is the only ritual weapon we got this season which was supposed to come last season but didn't for some reason came forward this season and that's it that's what we have for this entire season yes a deceptively good yeah I mean the most cool but also it's also not forget that we were supposed to get a last season and then we didn't and so for whatever reason they decide to delay it and throw it in this season so we still have a ritual weapon what do you have to do to get the bow a quest it's like cap this many zones played as minigames get kills with these guns blah blah blah yeah they probably like knew they weren't gonna have a gun for this season they're like okay we'll just take this season's gonna put it next i'm een you're probably right yeah so all in all I mean ironically I've just been grinding it kind of to just because there's nothing else to play right now really or at least like been playing regularly to like grind and then also to make content for so I've just been doing that and it's rough it's probably give me an christian give me your season of worthy score geez from what you know now and what you know what's it gonna happen like for what like if there are leaks or data mines or whatever I would say this is the worst drop of content for destiny ever hell I would rank it I don't know so the bottom I got advert yeah I mean even once we hated like curse of Osiris still had more than this at least a week or two of things to really grind out this season is kind of I log on and I ask myself why I'm on and and my answer is usually uh I'll probably just do a couple bounty is to get my season pass because some of the season pass stuff looks cool that's really about it my bunkers were already all upgraded and it took me I didn't have to put any effort to upgrade them at all honestly the lead-up shadow keep was like seven had seven for me I really like shadow keep I like I think stuff they introduced yeah she keeps only real flaw was the loot pool yeah I have more loot they got really cool new guns that all ended up being useless because well the only really good one got nerve to the ground with his past update which by the way Bungie these reactionary nerfs are just really like killing me it's starting to feel like division to where the very whole reason I quit Division two is because everything got nerfed so as soon as you make some as soon as you get something cool it gets nerfed and it's not because it's over power just because it's get so used so often right like with snipers passes and Izanagi the sickest DPS meta we've had in like forever when it comes to like raid bosses shoot so slowly and and now it's useless and now we're back to whisper and grenade like on top and recluse like nuts we were cool as DPS Menace to go back to whisper and I mean we dig is that of age now which is type I don't know anyways so shadow keep was good season undying there's like a four out of ten season the dawn I really like season of dawn uh I know a lot of people weren't crazy about it but season Donald's like a I attend for me like by the end of the season it was a really tight season but this season let me put this way I hope Hyperion or whatever that stupid thing is crashes in the earth I forgot when I was doing the bunkers - I forgot there's even a story going on oh my is no story yeah like there's nothing going on the second bunker comes and I'm like okay there might be something new here nothing it's just what are the is this is I'm awesome with fruit I think this is I think this is probably the worst content drop Desi's ever gotten I think it's I don't even think that's debatable I think like what what what else is so bad that we isn't worse than any of the dusty one drops to quota crota was pretty bad blow is pretty shitty but I'm at least there was a raid at least loot was super interesting move into the raid were like oh look at these tight weapons that you can't get anywhere else but septa these raids what else is bad Christmas iris was probably the only other competition but yeah there's various geillis that's why I keep comparing it I would say cursive wasn't the worst before that but that's the thing too is even house of wolves which was the first steal so you didn't have a raid it introduced trials but else had prison of elders and it still had cool loot and stuff like yeah there's and they added new strikes in maps you know and then all we're getting right now to is just reprise stuff like oh here's a d1 exotic and another d1 map and a d1 game-mode and they're being repressed I like snail's pace yeah when they've already we've had some of these guns reintroduced to us more than once like come on I just a 2 out of 10 blue yeah from the cz tell me what the war might know else the war mine cells are really tight I love the war mine cells I think that those are like some of the coolest going forward if we can get more cool seasonal stuff like war mine cells I think that would be tight the cool perks on them like getting damaged distance like chaining arc web stuff like blowing up with like crazy solar energy that is super cool trials get some views on videos trials keep tight which only came back for reek of services yeah we cool that's what I wish we could look at those statistics we got like 8% made it the three wins I want to know of that 8% to how many just got carried there paid to get there like not even to get flawless to like okay paying for if you do pay for trials you're not doing our salute sucks there's yeah there's not really a reason to go flawless there's no a depth right like no auto-rifle you get while you're going for seven wins is the same if you possibly get from the chest yeah and not only mention you get you only get like a drop or two for going flawless and on top of that like armor isn't even guaranteed high rolls you could just get a garbage stat roll you get like a fifty two roll go and flawless you know that was literally worthless like it's I mean like I ironically I'm kind of having fun just because I'm played in a while it's what I do with destiny I don't play for a while I come back and I remember like dawn plays good yeah alright yeah yeah and then like okay yeah no I'm I'm born in this again and that's it's gonna come soon probably as soon as I get not forgotten after I've hit my head into the wall enough times after you get 50-100 let's get it yeah like that's just I'm what are we just doing that so I have a goal for this season cuz Bungie says it hasn't given me once I was the only thing I'll say is really good is that the weapons are really pretty they're really cool I don't know everything that's coming I mean obviously this isn't done I'm still really excited to see what Grandmaster nightfalls bring cuz I love the Met ordeal knife holes those are tight we don't know what the Guardian games are gonna be hopefully that's good too but like for the time being the content we've gotten so far is like it's solid to it and the best part of the season so far is the war mine cells and that's because they're cool and they do like cool new things that we haven't seen before but beyond that I mean I'm still like my the most time that's when I do this week like when I do garden of salvation range of dado like on Tuesdays doesn't that as much time I put into the game I'll log in like an hour to here and there and do some bounties but then I'm out some of the most fun I had was doing garden of salvation with blue and dado to get the divinity but that's technically shadow key yes that's just content I haven't done yet that I should have well and that's more simple is playing with the buds you know that yet I mean like that's like Blue has a good point too though like it's more fun when we're all enjoying the game and so like I want there to be a time again where we can come back and it's not just like well this I would love like I would love for the to be like the for the raids like there would be challenges and stuff like that and then like hey guys you want to do this on Tuesday like yeah that'd be sick and we just do the raids and a reason to do them yeah and then like yeah like the last wish lease we have like thousand voices that was a little bit of a carry on the snake and we had like cool guns like like there has it like ultimately Rob's not going to come back because Rob's gonna be like oh this gun looks [ __ ] sick I want to get a cool role on it because I can only get in the rain yeah it's mine [ __ ] like yeah I grinded for this and I worked extremely hard for this and then Bungie is like oh by the way that we're just rotating that out it's like when was the last time we all were like really it was forsaken was the last time we really were like all three of us were really invest in the game for more than first like a month or two you yeah I mean that was the problem it was like a there's like a debate cuz that was that was the taking King Of Destiny - its what definitely - needed and then somehow we're like oh it can only go off from here and somehow it's a whole econ down so I don't know what's your question for this season I know you said like the word it's just whatever is the worst you get put and so I have no idea it's the bottom I would put like this at the bottom and then cursor boof above it it wouldn't have been that bad if we got like an actual endgame activity to do in game is just scuffed Quidditch like they said what the next season is humping so no like season of the what it needs a raid its season of redacted I believe maybe that not even it needs a raid I said it needs a raid it doesn't it wouldn't need a raid it just needs a be nice ship a house of wolves House of wolves not exactly the greatest PvE expansion right trials but Lisa had prison elders we said something to grind something to get your weapons from yes yeah the seasons just and I know it's the tent I know it's technically a ten-dollar season but still like I'm paying $10 to go to law sectors and would really just be a year one stuff but they threw in an overload champion like yeah that's pretty much it or I'm running around the EDC still just to get some submachine gun kills just stupid stuff but you know it's not stupid I know this ad welcome back ladies and gents at the G G over easy we're before we get into some some IRL stuff since we've been talking about submitting games I want to end the video game discussion on a happier note well what else we'll sandwich in the destiny would happy right we had Animal Crossing and I want to touch on yeah well poop poop peepee poo-poo we had Christian at age 2 you know now we're gonna move on to war zone which has been on a channel and has almost been out now for I think like two weeks but I won dig that and to I'm not gonna lie I'm kind of a Fragger yeah you're good really it feels good to like just be like hey I don't suck at something yeah you belong that I'll say that you definitely belong amongst them they're really good and you are really you drop that that game with you Sammy and po+ dudes blue you need to watch that game I won't watch today insane literally bouncing it is dub and Korea had 6k damage that Sammy a blessed 700 yeah I did what I had to do but not only that not only just like fragging I had just some crazy moments oh yeah blast like ran around ran people over in a clown car there was a point in the game where we should have lost I was downed only person with a self res like it should have been over it was a crazy game but it's like moments in the war zone that that can happen and I'm just good at the game so that feels nice it's just like fun too it's not fun solo though I did play a couple solo games and it's see I have a terrible solo experience I haven't played it yet I will admit I like be ours but I don't like solos it gives me too much anxiety yes souls are bad I get very natural I'm blue you playing it it's I mean it's taken us away from apex I hope and you playing it at all or nah no he played it with us at the beginning yeah I mean not a fan I like it but we got that dub and I just went all downhill well there a skill based matchmaking yeah there's 100% skill based matchmaking Dave yeah they came out and said like are bigger like pop game modes like war zone and ground war they're like don't have skill based matchmaking that is the biggest live everything even there's this nadeshot tweet agreed with so much he's like because he was even like yeah I don't care what they say like they're lying there is skill based matchmaking there's no reason every game I play in I can look at kill feeds and be like oh that's there on the leaderboard yep they're right there that's like everyone you can recognize there's no reason if there's 30 million users yeah right that that's every single no way nope let's cuz there there's almost never a point in war zone where I go up against a team and I'm like these guys are potatoes they don't know what they're doing it's always like not Jesus guys we ought to be careful like claymores yeah like don't run in like in like apex point you should be running into them at like the last circle kind of thing yeah which I will say though war zones final circles are my favorite even if they're frustrating I love how frantic it gets because it goes from like first and second circle take while but then after that it's like boom boom boom boom and I only hate it cuz the circles all of God yeah never honest it's always the exact opposite it could be that's the only reason I don't like it but I love that it's it's like the game's kind of intense but then you get to the last circles and it's like 20 kills in like five minutes yeah and it's trash it's tragic I just like that and and how it can be pretty forgiving I know some people don't like all the respawning but I think that kind of makes a little bit more fun I that's one of the reasons I don't like war zone is they're just - it's just it's like it's a 150 person BR but really like for my first really the first the first 20 minutes is really just TDM until like you exhaust your lives and then it turns into like BR territory I can see that yeah I don't hate I don't like to go I'm being different I think it's okay like I mean I like the Gulag I still just think they need to nerf bind people back I think it should I think it should start like yeah I think it should start like $5,000 yeah for like first back right so maybe fail the Gulag fine let me get 5,000 bucks but then if I rez you and you die again now it's 10,000 and then if you die and again it's like 15,000 that might never happen and then ironically the plane warzone has made me want to play more apex though but unfortunately we gonna have to wait till next season because no content well the effects it's just I mean I don't like it what I mean is I do like both I'm it's just a skill based matchmaking every game in its really wearing on me dude but the ranks reset an apex we can like a couple free games no but see that you have to wait a while yeah cuz when you get reset that means like the problem is you start out playing up against like apex predators you have to give it like a week or two until the ranked people finally get back to where they need to be so that you're not facing people you shouldn't even be in it's it's kind of frustrating oh here is a crazy idea Ken here is ranked and competitive okay this right here this is skill based matchmaking this has it okay here is like a non-competitive like for fun kind of one it does not let's just do that this well the fat part is they're gonna keep putting it in because it works like it I mean yeah if we keep seeing it being implemented that means there's some statistic telling them it's worth it and when it's gonna just it's because the thing that it doesn't feel good for anyone who's on the higher end of the spectrum right like for the most part as much as people want to roast us generally we're always within top 10% we're always always every single game we're always gonna be top 10% of whatever stats were in right he dumped on you chat no when we most of you yeah and you know in some games that were really good at will be like top two the problem is the difference between like top point one one one one one is very different from like top 5% where you have like actual people who play this game and are pros and who like [ __ ] go on AIM trainer every day because it's their career oh God right there's a there's big difference between that cuz skill creep gets higher and higher exponentially right where people who've been playing since like oh this I've always been playing [ __ ] PC bros my life they skill based matchmaking puts the people who were in like playing for playing for [ __ ] 490 sports with 10% people who were just naturally good right and that sucks for everyone who is good at games the problem is good players are like maybe like half of the people who play these games and what's the other half people who are generally really bad just so it's not and it's not like this is wrong with being bad it's just you know obviously you're not like this is not I mean you saw sway I suck a lot too right and it's fine but they have to accommodate those players or else those players don't come back the problem is then you start getting skill creep which is kind of the issue with Destiny's travel Cyrus right now we're if you don't have that protection then people will just leave and it gets sweaty and sweaty and Twitter for the people who are hiring hire so I mean there's no like great solution unfortunately but skills matchmaking is what people think to keep putting it in because it works because it keeps casual players in they're like here's here's the best way I look at it because it's like a real-life example of when I first started playing first-person shooters cuz I was only like 12 when I first pretty much got my hands on the first birds here which was halo 3 and I was playing in my best friend's basement that's right playing him a bet my best friend's basement on Xbox 360 never played on an Xbox before because I did check this out I was garbage I get stomped on like if I got two kills in a match I feel like brawl I'm yes like I'm pop and not bro I'd like I'd camp corners with an energy sword just to try and get a cheap kill like yes I got a kill I do remember like the first time I got a killing spree I'm like oh my gosh this is crazy meanwhile my best friend over there he started out better than me slowly I started to catch up on his skill and then I pass him you want to know why because he's a casual he wasn't like I need to get better he's like yeah I'm just having fun like we're chilling this is well well the other thing too though is like I wanted to get better like me losing that I was like I want to be the guy who top the leaderboard yeah I've already lost twice but I was like I want to be at the top of the leaderboard like I want to get good at this I don't like losing so I'm gonna try and start winning and for my friend he's just like yeah I don't care I'm having fun we're playing so for him it wasn't like oh this isn't fury 18 like oh man yeah like I'm gonna quit because of this or the other way he was just pretty neutral which I feel like there's some gamers like that and they're gamers like me we're like losing motivates me if I if I like the game losing pisses me off cuz I'm like I I don't like to be bad as something I like to do so I'm like yeah exactly I want to be a scrub it's something I'm actually trying to enjoy or play so then I try and get better and eventually I did get better and in all those FPS skills have been translated every FPS game I played halos where it started Sheffield so for me that was back when that would be even like social playlist so then what would I do I'd go into their ranked playlist and start like lone wolf start at level one slowly get to I remember I was only like mid 20s and I would be having a problem yeah right but anyway I'd get into like these lower ranks which now I would probably stomp through but I was like this is where I am all right slowly I can get better and if I wanted to climb I go into ranked even in social try and do good I remember like my first killing frenzy Matt and I I got the killing frenzy and we just we got up we like like hug each other's a great amount like we're like celebrate and I died anyway but like I vividly remember that moment and see now the problem is now I've accrued all this skill right now me as this top percent gamer I no longer really see that like sometimes that's what's kind of why I like warzone even if I lose sometimes I ain't still be like kind of fragged the problem is now I play games with so many sweaty people that I can never have a lot of Popoff moments it might be like a Popoff kill here it really there because yeah you have to play completely differently not only just in VR is like destiny and stuff and I never had the same game where I'm like dude I'm stomping you can never see there's never a point where I'm like oh yeah clearly I've accrued this skill and when you put me against this guy you can see that skill I mean I have I think that sucks for you in be ours cuz you can't see it because when you will if have you if you guys have ever watched like pro games for any BR holy crap you can't be I've never seen camp your eSports but that's how you have to play because putting yourself out in the open and BR you're gonna get third party fourth party fifth party six party do you have to be as passed as possible and it just sucks and be ours SPM is the worst because games get slower and slower and slower and the next thing you know you're at the final circle and there's twenty there's like thirty people left so dumb and then like one step outside one desk pop that's all it takes I think SP a minute and B R is just the worst it kills games I think Noah four or five Jade tweeted like Co based matchmaking kills games but like I don't know but the problem is it doesn't kill games it only just games for people who are like in the top 20% because that 20% gets grouped with each other and that 20% is like a huge a huge varying degree of skill because you go from 20% of people who are just naturally talented at shooters who don't practice who have to go against people who do this every single day or a living this is their career like they go play pro games when you put those two together you just have a top 20% of people who just hate a game but then clearly they keep putting school based matchmaking in the rest of the game is a bunch of potatoes and here's my question playing each other if you want those people to play each other like that why can't we get like customs then like a custom 100 man lobby or something like that I know that's asking a lot well I think the problem there is the Joe schmo's who aren't as good or whatever they don't have as many friends or they no way they'd be able to set that up or well then make it only invite only for like the pros then it's like the pros want to do like an FPL kind of server like that Cisco does and like that's where the pros play and like that kind of thing and they have like better tick rates that [ __ ] like that then they put them on like a different kind of like thing and if that's like what they want to do then for the day like pro scrimps and like they can set that up with their [ __ ] discord I don't know just I don't want a hat I hate just for me that the point I was trying to draw was like now with skill based matchmaking for instance that friend I had who played halo him now playing similarly skilled people he's still gonna play the game as much as he was gonna before like for me I've never quite seen skill based matchmaking from the side of like this is great and it's gonna make me play the game more the one time it was was when I played Rob's PvP account where I did was like okay yeah people this low okay they should be paired against each other because like see what those are most people we don't understand I mean like I don't think they had opposable thumbs man yeah like I didn't realize people like that we're out there the reality is most people don't I mean maybe most people are like that but here that's to think I wouldn't know because I play every faze clan member and every single duel my plant will brag bro weird albrecht that's just so annoying the reality is most people don't play these games to be good they play them because they're fun and because just the general isn't being good fun I think people have different mindsets so hard for me too yeah different mindsets for sure I don't in apex I slowly got a little more competitive but ultimately I don't really care about being good right I don't care about being good in any game I just want to have fun which isn't always the optimal path right but I don't know it's just I think the assumption of oh why don't you just get better it's like well I don't really care how much better getting better well I get that I really care if I really care because we on the shame we initially speaking of an animal crossing its it someone just hacked my account from Jeremy what yeah it says right here my Nintendo account my nickname the device the date time right now location Germany how does someone get in my T factor buddy I can attend we can do that if so then no I have not said no you got me checking my now my animal crossing bro and my smash okay you guys keep going I have to feed ya figure well I think this is a good way to transition probably to the ad break well we have questions that we need to do yeah so I guess we'll do that let me find one again I [ __ ] up and I didn't put it on patreon I'm really sorry I will do that let me find what in here I think I think this one this is from Lauren Taylor do you guys have any do you hope anything stays from Korova from harambe or lima in terms of like habits like people like now you're gonna see a lot more people like washing their hands and stuff like that you'll see a lot more like cleaning like I think it's crazy that like you see people like hey just let you guys know we're cleaning the streets and we're like making sure everything is sanitized after you like go to a bar and like you've been already doing that like what why is it taking a pandemic and everything going down for that to happen now I just said that's what really frustrates me I just hope everybody's clean and then I stand you elbow coughers out there I have been an elbow coughs sneezer since the fourth grade so if you if this could stick around and people do this then great I'd say yeah people washing their hands having hand sanitizer around the ready I I've always been an elbow sneezer Kaufer that at least at least sneeze endeared to your shoulder or something like don't just let that out there yeah I mean that's probably the other thing I'd want to keep from and then in addition I would love to keep people's open-mindedness to uh a lot of the I'm not gonna give that political you know what let's just I like where your head's at though I like where your head is agree on that I think I should dish there's some more there's some more things that should be human rights that clearly people were like damn how's that gonna work and the answer was it could have always worked yeah I'm just gonna leave like that what I don't want is people to keep going to the store and stockpiling and that's and milk like best of luck eating that drinking that milk in the next two weeks buddy okay yeah listen this I've gotten hacked from Morocco Vietnam kersek Stan Russia Egypt Colombia Vietnam Albania Shesha is that even a real one I guess so Germany four times have I been like pwned in the past like day what the you gotten hacked from those places just in today yeah like they've gotten into your account yeah it says like I can go to my Nintendo account sign in history I can see all this what the Hank okay Monica anyway I'm struggling over here I hope you are you on your switch right now yeah I want to see that too you see what do you see but you have all your accounts under your business email don't you know this is a personal oh really yeah not I purposely try to not do my business one there's no connection to anything bro it's Tom Nook did he's he's holding out hates on me dude he's like hey I know I told you you had whenever to pay that but actually we're gonna need that now I need those bells right now hey this question is really good this is a quick one this is from five eight eight three he says which are better wings flats or drums flat to say I will die on the drumstick I got a drumsticks are too high when you were like only flats and all flat then he goes extra trip except you forgot but if he calls it extra its extra wet its extra extra and it's a thing it's a thing it's like going into extra sauce no it's a it's like it's like going into in and out saying animal style it's a thing there you say extra wet that's just what they have a sticker they put on this is extra wet okay just say extra sauce weddy but they need to know that I know that I know they'll I keep them accountable you know I'm saying like give me my extra wet cuz they but they never did know and they I feel like they they spite me in fact no you know actually just don't put any on them hey what do we just head where I'm a little flats dude listen it's because with drumsticks there's always some part where like there's like a hard part of the skin I like me like tendon you can't quite get through and it's every drumstick here's the thing I am a creature of habit and every drumsticks so variable but flats same thing every time same process your horn one side one side and then you you put your thumb in crack it in half get the meat in the middle bomb that's it next one and you don't miss any meat you miss nothing you get all the good stuff I hate having to go in between just go around now see what's there and if the flag you know if the flats right out to you can bust it open you see like the steam lips like it's still smoke hmm flats baby to the day I die retweet jokes it's drumsticks yeah okay well up to two step oh you are I didn't realize it that was even a thing but now I'm due for everything how do you check your sign in history see I've got another email someone justified a scam email no no I'm a hunter sure you go to accounts nintendo.com and then you sign in and then once you've signed in it'll show you you can click like a sign in history or some yeah uh anyway next question wrong oh wait we haven't read the thing what thing you told me to call the things you can't oh yeah it's only an hour and a half late but Ted Starr podcast baby from comrade Ishtar mister frou I have a roof you I've been watching the videos for a while now and loved your squad and personalities been loving Robbie D drunk apex Popoff's that was like one time and the podcast my favorite video was has to be the workout transformation because it has helped me personally continue with my workout transformation you guys art dope five stars very cool thank you Ishtar your gym dude has been really hard I will say that your your impression of mr. rude I have a challenge for you is a little lacking Oh mr. fruit I have a challenge for you I don't think that wasn't review for you that's really I was a review but that was better all right let me see one says plot twist give us questions and you read the best answers what that means I'm stopping right here all right from Xavier Ficino best and worst date ever had I really stopped on a random one best and worst date I'm gonna say the worst is the day my puppies went crazy I'll be right my best date was probably my first date with Sydney even though we did go see Batman vs Superman in like the second row of like the theater so we were basically watching it like this which kind of sucked but it was like a last second kind of date but we had fun worst date I've ever been on I don't know I'm gonna be honest when Rob takes you out on a date Rob kind of kills it every time I make sure cuz the last thing I wanted is for the person to have a bad time so normally when I go on dates I make sure that we have a good time the worst date I've ever been on was in high school uh we went out as like a to date couple and my boss pretended to fire me for whatever reason so like we were at a really nice Cheesecake Factory restaurant I was like how am I gonna pay for this how am I gonna keep this up but he was just pretending to fire me and I like literally was almost crying at the dinner table because my boss pretended to fire me because he thought it was funny piece of [ __ ] now I look back on it as a [ __ ] though right I'm cool dude yeah Reggie literally on a date I don't know if I to say a lot of good ones but I don't know if I like that's all I'm saying I had great dates but like okay mmm I'm not going to say that knows how to shallow but see okay well see like I don't okay see I can't really think like a horrible one but I will say there was this was just a weird experience cuz I just didn't know there was this girl I didn't know too well we went on the date and we went to dinner and movie you know super original classic the classic the classic right and I thought I didn't notice but so at the movie theaters I go to hold her hand while we're watching the movie I didn't realize is she has like a dwarf thumb so like on her left which one was it yeah I think her left hand I went to hold she has censures head like a little nub that for her thumb there I don't ask me I didn't know but so I go to hold and as I discussed it just something felt wrong and so like I say my grip because I was looking for like to analyze the awkward spot yeah I'm like where am I I feel like I'm doing it wrong wait how can I miss the hand like where do I interlock my thumb like well I don't and it took me a second oh and it just kinda was a lock word and yeah I remember that moment very disturbed cuz I just felt so embarrassed I wouldn't say it's a worst dance I got the most but that's it that's the word yeah this was the most awkward encounter in a day you've had yeah that's just the first I can't think of like overall I haven't really had like a bad date where I go like yeesh you know like yeah get me out of you yeah I guess so in college probably my worst date was when we went to go see Dark Knight Rises okay it was my friend from a just from just from our what do you call it floor like your door no no not a part man worms is just like just for my class okay well apparently said person was very sick and ended up throwing all over the floor in the middle of Dark Knight Rises oh so I go home I'm watching Batman like come on usually the worst date I've ever been on I haven't I don't really have like best dates I don't know it makes sense it's not truth every day is best day I'm very I'm very reserved when it comes to just going out I don't know I don't really I don't really going updates either I just want to have like it in stay at home with the homies I've told my Wanek that I don't really I'm not really like go out person which is hard cuz I'm trying to find someone else who is not a go out person so but you don't find those anymore mostly cuz no one looks because everyone's scared also cuz you know lik ma mainly League ma yeah so I'm never gonna forget Dark Knight Rises something that was that it was throw up although I think we talked about this before I vividly remember Dark Knight Rises but for it very different meaning you are totally a queer in Colorado I blown was my boy my phone was blowing up and I do I'd been there for the theater for 12 hours I've been in line I waited I got to see the trilogy I'm like this I love the band it was like no one is bothering me like let me watch this movie I had to turn my phone off cuz I don't what's going on and then that's when I came outside and realize like oh my god oh my god yeah I turned out people were calling me because they thought I was in the theater was a monk um let me see if I can will go run more random up I were to pick that one up have you guys this is from David W have you guys ever watched any abridged anime Dragon Ball Z is a bridge and is one of the best I've ever watched what the hell does that mean Dragonball abridged no yeah I don't know what a Bridget dren anime is uh you've never seen a Bridget enemy so they're basically like where people do read ups but it's like a do like like super super dumb takes on the show so like so like in Yugi alright the Pharaoh is like just this super like dick walk yeah yeah and in the abridged right he just turns into this huge meme who like mine crushes people just for fun just because he can and like Kaiba goes from like super rich [ __ ] to like super rich parody of an [ __ ] so he's like screw the rules I have money type [ __ ] like super stupid like takes on the show often the plot will completely change like they'll completely change what the show is about and just make it like a comedy based show so like Joey it's like a super big parody of himself in the yugioh bridges where he goes from like a Brooklyn dude you're like a super stereotypical brooklyn dude like brooklyn rage like you for brooklyn dude like type of dude but it's just like most the time abridged or like just like really like big exaggerations of the characters we use for comedy and i can't believe you've never watched it break I guess I've just seen memes of it like I've I've seen memes of like my hero bridged [ __ ] incredible right okay so raka she is gets turned into like this Christian like religious zealot or some [ __ ] and like in this one of the bridged episodes she has this line where they're like she's like Deku don't be a [ __ ] and he's like raka what's the problem she's like Deku Jesus does not look upon those who were [ __ ] like it's alright it's incredible and she and she and she's crew she's like super gsella because she has like she thinks like her quirk is like a gift from God so she's like when Sheila and she's like when she uses her quirk which is weightlessness she's like I relived you to the heavens type change it's super [ __ ] funny so brother her or abridge animes blue I had to pick that was the question I honestly totally forgot the question I got so dumb have you guys ever watched any abridged animes and I said I don't know what the [ __ ] that is I love abridged anime i watching ukyo bridge all the time when i was growing up i was i've never got that big in the dragonball bridged so yugioh bridge was it for me though is it um like YouTube like is it just like Dragon Ball okay I tried to watch Dragon Ball I'll be honest fell short for me Dragonball abridged was just is trying too hard but like and a lot of his just really lowbrow I know I wasn't big on it lost felt like a lot it was just like poop yeah like what it was like it felt like that kind of sounds like okay and a lot of people like this but managers not my thing sounds like our podcast yeah but what well okay yeah poop maybe that's why I didn't like it blue where can people find you on the internet everywhere out blue Oslo you can find me everywhere at my mister fruit you can find me everywhere at Robby V that's it there's an H in there and an a yeah bit of a weird one trying to it's like when I see people trying to spell Aereo's poor guy yeah I don't think anyone has ever actually spelt it right I really don't can you spot right now rum a a er iOS nope what yeah you got I was like that's right I was like hi cow eyes like I typed that countless times go on areas where you asked the problem is a lot of people don't do two ways some people a day you or some people start with an E like they don't even put a z' I mean to be fair I think when he said he made the name he would really just like put in like random the word generator or like letters or somebody a Greek god random Greek names and he like cut one in half I don't know it was strange right that's this podcast episode 31 hey everyone's face safe out there wash your hands keep 6 feet apart enough room for Jesus all right actually 6 feet between you and Jesus and then 6 feet between Jesus and the other person may be to Jesus legs we're at soon [Music]
