see the light at the end of the tunnel I started at 8% a couple days ago and I've just been pulling my hair out trying to get these final blows I really thought that I would hit legend before I finished Luna Hal final blows but boy was I wrong I was at like 4800 I was almost there but then as soon as you lose you lose two on your win streak you lose like more than you could at a five game win streak it's really frustrating and that's what I've been doing don't ask me why so let's hop into some survival it's frustrating and it really is season of the beaver can't tell you how many games I've played where someone on my team just gets kicked even I'm getting kicked or my games crashing match incomplete oops you left a competitive match before it was complete no I didn't leave a
