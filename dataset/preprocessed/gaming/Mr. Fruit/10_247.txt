lower reload quicker reload cowboy take that take this yeah come here you want this you want this you want some of this huh hey you want another one i'll give you something to eat [ __ ] right-clicking i'm [ __ ] blocking i am [ __ ] blocking see the pace whoa legit break it that's the easiest map for you they just went like everywhere six percent movement speed when moving towards opponent huge amount of hp bullet stun opponent damage or movement speed after the damage a bunch more life still that movement speed i'm coming for you boy off the map i'm chasing you boy you can't get away from me once again your bullets i can't get away from your ball it's the stupidest thing ever what the fudge are these bullets it can't touch the ground you don't even have to aim do fifty percent of your max hp enemies around you when you blog a huge amount of bullet speed more hp more bullet speed blocking triggers another delayed block bullets keep the huge amount of bullet speed right now screw you oh my god wow okay when they said a lot more amen oh god oh i'll see you where you at where you going ah fudge wait wait think about this think about this think ah [ __ ] no no

dude i don't get how blocking works i swear like i don't get it i've literally tried it every time and i've failed to time it still damage over five seconds let's keep trajectory more hp more bullets speak blocking critiquing field bullets lose half of their speed when they bounce i'm gonna go for parasite sounds cool that sounds terrifying go my parasites oh you're done what wait it seems to do as much i feel like that counteracted my extra bullet damage you coward i'm coming for you yeah fudge god get a stay away gotcha oh god parasites is so good but i swear it like it took away my extra

stop me jesus you don't even have to look at me and i'm over here trying to hit the shot of my life god you make me sick come here ow wow god this is so dumb this poison stacked i have no idea whatever i feel like my entire build just kind of intuitive meanwhile i'm playing against this boner over here why did i just take half damage what i can't why do i have two bullets in my thing now are you i can't are you having fun i hope you are ow god are you die to poison yes oh yes die gotcha oh let's go what the hell was that you like that it's like a mega gun oh my god oh wait what buckshot adds a shotgun vibe dazzles the stun steady shot more hp combined a bunch more damage minus two ammo 200 plus hp three seconds after dealing damage i'm gonna go with buckshot that does sound fun it's gonna mess me up so much that i'm blue a bunch more bullets slow uh poison bulls keep trajectory a bunch more hp spawn a bunch of small bombs i'll do bullets all right take a look at me i'm beautiful you're [ __ ] i'm an alien i'm a sassy alien i'll get slowed you don't stand a chance oh you got to get close to that shotgun boy ow maybe not yeah oh [ __ ] no yeah get away from me yeah yeah oh oh the saucy vodka has learned how to push look at this oh fudge too bad blocky dusty vodka help me i could slow even more i might do it for the memes bigger bullets slimes around you yeah i'm gonna do it for the memes let's see if it stacks whatever here comes this saucy vodka you gotta hit me first there you go oh my god i think i as long as i hit you i think it's it's game over [Laughter] oh my you're a frozen friend okay well burst with shotgun seems kind of good wait shoot it real quick to see if it like actually oh my god yeah it stacks okay i thought it might like interfere with each other but wow you weren't even that close uh saucy vodka's here oh oh oh what i'm the worst oh i'm so bad get me out of here i can't hit it ow oh there we go oh but i'm the worst why do you have eight million bullets in your thing all right shoulder peek is that that is peak stun the opponent huge amount of bullet speed a bunch more damage extra movement blocking pushes enemies away freeze free stun you know i just have to hit you easy stay away from me freeze free stun huh how about how'd you hit me by adis no no no i guess oh you can't beat this i can't you can't beat the sassy [ __ ] maybe i don't have to oh my god he's got to get the hit oh jesus oh oh no what oh you actually blocked it yeah i did it barrage fires many points okay sounds like we might have a double stack on our hands here we're all double stacking okay a triple stack look i got coco dot you got booboo come near me you're a coward you always were oh it works both ways my friend no we weren't expecting that stay awake one shot is all i need i just gotta get to you oh are you oh what the fudge yes gosh dang it blocky launches you four gives you a second automatic block lower reload or many bullets at the same time a bunch i could literally like stop i wouldn't even move block increases damage speed your next shot i like this well i'm hoping like now i just fired multiple cold bullets yup blocked it oh so much damage come here come here pretty just gotta reload no you've made a grave mistake stand still and some what what does that even mean i mean i'm getting my doubts no all right you know for the content i'll let it happen i have a feeling it's gonna be bad like i think it'll inch to kill me oh what the [ __ ] i'm here yeah oh okay [Music] oh [ __ ] i think yeah problem is it just goes no matter what [Music] oh it blocks bullets does it really yeah no way i need this i guess oh god i'm the glass cannon come here boy what ah yup i got the blocking timing down
