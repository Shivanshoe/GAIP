heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the last spell we're continuing our let's play and i figured today you know the look of the day is disheveled i don't know if i look that disheveled uh i just had my head and my hands rethinking my entire life um as per usual so that's why my hair is like this anyway let's hop into it don't judge me but feel free to sponsor me went to 7-eleven and got a icing was i went for coke and they had the dr pepper flavor and i was like huh that's interesting you know what absolute banger it just melts so fast it's the unfortunate part anyway welcome back to the greatest game on the face of the earth i'm perfectly fine with saying that um i'm lax on the defense because for the most part we're good to go so let's go ahead and boot this up with our additional hero uh freaking yeah yeah boom you're over there um i'll put one melee there and one melee over here that makes sense right i don't know if how much movement you have seven move points so do you okay but yet the gate you might still get hit i don't really know uh so then i feel like we can just kind of pair whoever we want who has uh we'll just put you like right there and we'll put you right up here and make sure they have like a decent line of sight i guess it all depends on where they come from minus side's kind of well that's not that bad ah that's fine i think okay that's the the play i reckon i swear to god if we immediately get hit screw us well we might we probably won't honestly because they have to hit these things right well in that case i'm going to get a little greedy i'm going to go ahead and arm her up though because i'm sure i'll regret something okay great let's do this it's time night 4 i will oh what the fudge they're already breaking oh my god they really did already hit the stupid runners dude uh like what is this we're already cheating what's the point of whatever screw me all right we're gonna oh you already got your pull out or your pull act whatever um we're just gonna do two for the price of one dodged are you are you kidding me how much do we have to high roll here honestly literally as long as we don't bottom bottom roll like literally as long as you don't hit 79 it's dead or it dodges hawk good to go all right friend what do i want you to do this is a good question you have like extra multi-hit thing right if i haven't killed something or propagation uh yeah i think it's the propagation so what do we want to do here this is 63 damage this is a lot more damage move you here oh good damage i think i did not give you the executability why did i not do that the world may never know all right well i'm just going to weaken you and one more time for good measure all right you're officially useless good news um i'm gonna punch because the likelihood that we miss is thank god well the likelihood we miss isn't thank god but you understand i'm going to move you right over here because i don't think you'll get hit but just in case we'll armor you up there is no way jose that we hit anything here so we're just gonna chill right here maybe a little bit over here i can't really see where the the hordes will be coming from i'm gonna have to move crossbow fell over here yeah you're absolutely useless over here look at that movement um what oh oh oh it's because i'm using the one handed crossbow right i was like wait a second yeah unfortunately um let's actually undo that i can go for him high chance we missed this though don't don't you have a yeah you have less dodge okay how about i do that okay less likely to dodge now boom get hooped on brother all right you're dead now move over here try and kill things perfect um i really don't like that you guys are just kind of going out and doing your own thing here if i do this can i hit you i can oh you beautiful son of a gun okay you're nuts cracked and we can hit here and here and here again oh this double loadout thing's really starting to pick up here okay we need to get you in but i also don't want you to die maybe this is a good chance to use the pistol mayhaps how much movement you have seven okay to be fair you got that would only leave us with two not great that's that's too dicey if i do there we can we can yeah we can get back okay so swing and swing perfect swap to the pistol dodged okay we'll take that you're like officially useless i don't how much armor do they have guys 119 armor good lord okay well then the claw doesn't have nearly as much so i'll do that to just weaken you and then we're going to run back here um i don't think they can make it to us because of these things so that's the good news everybody is good to go um more or less one action point yeah screw you nobody cares dodged oh my god we'll now get absolutely poop done okay we got some archers annoying but we're fine what i have a debuff minus one move point who did who did that to me i need a name was it the archers does he do that i don't really know who does that but it's not cool it's really not that big of a deal but i want him okay what what what is this you're supposed to be coming this way not clearly didn't get the memo it's okay i thought i paid him off but apparently not uh how's my impale looking uh juicy is the answer i can't hit him can i i guess he's out of the fog or something um okay i'm gonna i'm gonna keep you there for now we gotta figure out what we're doing here swap you to your axe um i think okay these guys like going ever like this this is not i don't like that really throwing me off here let's kill these things um yep dead dead dead you're nuts okay we could go with this oh that's nice oh that's very nice uh two but it's a lot of magic for not that much value so instead we're just gonna do that i'll omega bop you're dead now if i do this i'll have three movement left which means i'll just get absolutely pooped on i think i'm just gonna have to let him hit our wall for a little bit not really sure how else i can deal with that um but no matter what i do here i'm going to kind of be in the thick of it which i'm not crazy about less damage and accuracy might be a good player i mean i could hit here oh hold on anything i want to do this that will not kill um this 100 would okay so if i go here do this dodged of course have two movement after this which isn't great but it's something um two action oh i only need one x point for this is there a way to maximize this three debuffs or maybe i'll just kill this guy if i hit him dodged okay sick all right well we're just gonna go over here and hope we don't take it up up the butt which we probably will not perfect okay now we're back over here how do we want to use you are we are we looking to jump in yet with our staff i don't think we need to i could go for some propagation what's the best problem honestly i don't think we get much value there we could tangle that is an interesting prospect um you do have your spear i can't hit those guys now we're kind of vibing um whack dodged of course we'll have two movement left after this um i like this whack okay i mean i don't like being practically dead but you know how it is i'm gonna go over here and we're gonna armor up and we're gonna pray you're gonna do fine kid you're gonna do great forget about it um how much armor do you have 17 what if i swap over this can't reach oh but i will lower my accurate oh really well pp dodged eight percent chance what the fudge like what am okay you're you're like useless now screw you um do some nice damage here nice damage is being generous okay you're dead at least um then i'm just gonna do this to weaken the archer okay you can't move anymore you can't move anymore uh i can only see this going really well okay didn't break her armor did but didn't do a lot of damage okay didn't break her armor okay so far not bad not bad i can execute foe free i don't mind if i do and i can execute faux free okay before i do that though let's assess the situation let's start down here you know i like going bottom top for no apparent reason do i have line of sight on this guy i feel like i should do i waste my shots on him i mean he's not like that big of a threat okay now he's literally not a threat so i can ignore him for a while um i really want to omega him but there's no way i'm getting the right line of sight um okay let's see what you can do don't suck freaking hate the axe man okay um yeah this dude just refuses to die we still have yet to see all the people we're dealing with there's no bueno so i'm just gonna come back here whack swap to the pistol how much damage am i doing not even enough to pierce their armor okay so i might just want to kill this guy because otherwise he'll have a whole bunch of armor next turn boy effect come back here you're big chilling let me make sure you don't miss that guy um okay so we could poison and reduce movement armor piercing and blaze which is five propagation four multi hits that's pretty good this is four multi-hits oh my god it's like 200 damage right there wait a second oh shoot oh my god i didn't even realize too big it stacks every time so that guy's minus four movement speed that dude literally can't move next turn wait a second this hand crossbow okay i'm starting to realize its potential here what the fudge because i haven't killed anyone we still have four multi hits what the fudge that's kind of nuts i'm being honest with you all okay yeah suddenly i'm all about this um i hope i don't kill him because i don't want to ruin our nice little thing we got going on here so just go like this for now yeah swap to this heavy bolt u we add and actually this ignores armor which will kill you this is nuts this little combo we got here carry me carol carry me okay the rest is fine these guys are gonna be slowed and then the other baddies will be coming soon no doubt we gotta get rid of uh these runners i think we'll use you to take advantage or kill rather all these plebs um okay how about we weaken you first unfortunately we can't kill you i wha it's an eight percent free whatever okay you're dead one is stunned so then take no chances as long as it hits easy all right we'll save an action point to see what we might want to do duh this is big oh wait a second uh whatever i'll execute whatever lives which is you um hit you or not thank you execute you come over here don't miss perfect okay we get bonus armor sitting next to this which means we can take you get the safety it might not even go that far but whatever we'll arm out like right here and perfect one hero didn't move we didn't move this guy now i moved perfect we gotta farm those prowesses let's get it not even oh my god you tickle oh okay still haven't broken armor though we're big chilling it's like no damage okay we still haven't seen all the monsters yet so you can see here unlucky this guy would he still can't move i can literally i can ignore like all these that crossbow is nuts man and and the perk because that's what i gave him right yeah if i didn't kill anyone another multi-hit that is nuts if i can stack multi-hits with this little crossbow like what it's incredible absolutely incredible i tell you that's a lot of baddies jesus um make a grand entrance there oh how do i want to do this that's some value if i've ever seen it don't you do dodge hog that's real nice i'm a fan whack dodged of course uh so then just can i just keep you no so then whack again come back you know the drill uh let's just have a range oh still out of range of course kill that thank you weaken that finish that off don't be like this thank you uh armor up just in case you don't have any extra skill points all right things are getting interesting over here i think we start with ye old crossbow the young crossbow except i need to oh my god i can reach there nothing can escape carol jesus he's nuts i'm just gonna weaken literally like everyone i can um okay i can't quite reach him which is annoying but here here here oh no i already killed somebody oh no i'm supposed to do the multi-hits first stupid yeah that was propaganda me okay but these guys are like useless they're not moving anywhere should i even bother weakening over there i don't know let's go with the armor piercing how much are we looking at if we hiro we'll kill okay we didn't high roll but we don't need to um you know just come over here and if i come over here we can do lots of damage to you you're nuts he's not killing anyone but literally like look look at how far these guys are moving they don't do anything right now this is incredible i'm here for it um i could just punch instead of having to try something um is it worth using the mana you get back three in a day this will be the last one i use i guess well then maybe i want to save it i can probably get more value out of something later let's swipe and swipe um okay so it's just these guys right here are not going to be useless um i'm trying to figure out how we want to do that am i just i'm gonna wound you make you practically useless hurt you a little bit okay i'm out of things i can't armor myself so we're just gonna get back perfect all right this should be the last of them meaning we're looking pretty solid right now it's going well no city panic on the fourth night yet yes please don't mind if i do wait we still haven't seen them all i wonder if it's because they're all stuck because those guys aren't moving i feel like this side's pretty much done could be wrong but that's what it feels like um okay how do i do this let's start with you you my lord please don't miss somebody just always has to dodge of course we're gonna move here whack whack okay you're pretty useless now um just finish you off please perfect um just weaken you oh or kill you oh i like that i like that who do we not want to miss i can debuff somebody the question is who maybe this a runner i don't want to lose them okay well i don't kill anyone though we want to get our multi-hits out here first i still can't hit him no matter what i do though he's a little annoying isn't he i can't hit you either all right so you guys are free from my graphs oh now already used all your access points yep all right so let's just  who we can perfect there's no way we kill you or you unless we perfect um then let's go here here um and then let's start killing things if i can perfect all right now the runner needs to die kind of need to maim you oh perfect oh dodged fudge whatever that's fine um how far are you guys moving not far i think if i stay there i'll still be able to catch everybody where i need them to um everybody's movement is pretty impaired and inside this guy can get to me but honestly if he wants to hit me go for it i don't think he'll break my armor now the fun over here we're gonna use our spear for this i'm gonna refrain from using any mana some pretty good damage we only have one one shot whatever left though don't miss pog you're the best extra armor hit you big plug how much are you gonna get back man wise four okay so i'll just hold on all right let's just pick up where we came here and then hit you because uh oh i'm out of uses hold on hit you because oh if we high roll oh we did you say this guy's useless anyway um i'll just move though to intercept you let's go things are starting to click oh i didn't realize there's still going to be a couple more not breaking any armor easy wait what i'm surprised i think we actually took a little bit of damage oh she's freaking archers man yo quitting i could execute somebody don't mind if i do um all right well i think we now see everybody obviously it's like holy cow we got somebody over here but it's because we've just been maiming so many not killing um and we're gonna go back to that here just maim a couple people off the bat not looking for kills i'm gonna help you um yeah perfect all right garbage day let's forget what i wanna do uh i need to do physical to get through your stupid armor but i have to do this that's annoying okay we got him though save the mana we're doing he's practically dead anyway but why not okay this guy lived but not by a lot this man is still alive incredibly well i'm just gonna punch you stupid um and then where can this guy move i guess i'll vibe right here all right now you got your work cut out for your friend we're still gonna avoid using mana although like propagating one of these things [Music] that is or like but no nay we're just gonna pick some people off all right um i don't know if i should bother because of his armor we've already hurt you all right now i think i start killing dead dead dead dead okay you live with two health whatever you can't even move that's fine kill you and kill the runner pog now what do you guys want to do well i most certainly want to kill you tell you that much does that really it's not going to kill you either way huh i'll not do that so we get more range i'll take the twofer i guess i'll swap to this to get the which he calls it bonus or the accuracy debuff dodged sick yes screw you all right they have minus 30 accuracy so that's nice you have like all your action points so pop bop bop bop and bop all right we'll just move here maybe here it'll be there one here didn't move was it you it was a little radical back here all right it's really satisfying getting all of them so weak too and then just like cleaning up okay didn't break the arm it feels good literally just you guys left here easy okay switch here multi-hit as much as we can i think i practically kill everything here though well not necessarily i'm literally gonna set it up so it's just cherry-picking so let me hit the armor ones okay now um see okay now anything we do will kill practically i like that let's move and who do we want to finish off we already broke your armor so let's finish you screw the archer it's show time buddy bop bop okay swap to the pistol you're dead come over here i think we're big chilling you know the drill walk over here right over there walk over there and then you never walked there you go armor up i guess yeah yeah yeah oh my god i actually broke armor i didn't realize oh yeah i couldn't even hit you there's nothing i could really do about that unlockers all right we can you all yeah i'm all about the hand crossbow now i don't know what i was thinking what was i thinking before huh i'm like yeah we don't need it we need it we love it the xp coming in huge i don't know by how much hp lost 88 hold on lucky we only got an a however perfect city on night four that's pretty good that's a lot of materials and gold for that a lot of essence i think that puts us close to our ballista in fact i think we get our ballista i could be wrong but if we just had lost health that would have been an s on night for see the mist keeps coming closer and closer though i don't like that um but look at that we got a prowess and tainted essence thing or if there are people out there like yeah show us the exposition what is he saying you can just freeze frame it you know okay where's ballista oh my god we unlocked it anything new unlocked i don't think so so what do we want next where you're set starting armors see that that's interesting but more hand crossbows you do know how much i like my crosshand crossbows now items manufactured by production buildings have a chance being better than that okay offhand weapons though that kind of seems sick well i think we're gonna work towards that now let's unlock the prowess and talk to the pregnant archangel lady i don't know kill 50 archers we get steel armors out ever here reach level seven we're so close have a hero reach 400 and health lost oh what is this walk oh we've almost walked enough tiles every hero reached 12 and move points i think the best we only have is like eight right now every magic shop crap we're not there deal 500 range damage in a single hit we're not there yet have a hero kill nine enemies in a single blow we haven't done that yet i doubt we're going to moving forward unless we just crit a whole bunch because they're only getting healthier as we go but let's get our rewards from our scavenger thing which i didn't mean to build but whatever oh my tier wait plus four never seen that before what does it improve exactly i don't know let's see plus nine resistance minus one move point but extra skill range and extra poison damage does that really help anyone this is quite the body armor plus 44 armor plus 11 block plus 44 health we do lose a move point and accuracy though but greater stun chance and another 15 armor holy jesus like 69 nice no 59 armor that is the move point and accuracy is unlucky especially if i want to put on one of our axe wielders because we know how well that goes but man would they be tanky and then this let's see comparatively seven percent extra physical damage that would be nice to just have no doubt but this armor though is so tempting i think i go with this i'm doing it all right let's start leveling everybody up city stash you get this my friend should i give this to you or the other person yeah whatever only six movement but i think you'll be fine brick point we get one of these okay we could reduce the movements penalty we just got upon dying you could return extra critical power but less damage as we learned while that is cool our crit chance is abysmal it's not the best idea you don't use magic damage first mana consuming skill using the turn cost minus one that is interesting storing action points movement points is also really good it gets between movement although at that point i might just get patient or thrifty because then i could use axe boomerang so much so much indeed then i could also just i'm gonna go with this just seems so good i'm gonna i don't know i don't know i'm gonna go with patient screw i chose it uh that's a lot of extra armor that we will most definitely take look at that armor 166 every turn oh my gosh low key that's nuts um giving you this accuracy it could be really good but gamba daily health regen sure oh that's what i'm doing and i'm sticking to it you are arranged fella nothing of any great value so i'm just going to take the safe five percent range damage oh and six percent accuracy yes please we didn't get any uncommons i don't know how but what would you want first manage consuming skill during your this guy's turn that could be huge storing unused movement points could be big we're always going to be using your action points though you have an injury why do you have an injury let's go with thrifty i like that next abigail uh wizard 8 extra magic damage don't mind if i do um flat reduction applied to the resistance of targeted enemies seems pretty good we could just go for actually but whatever we'll go resistance reduction and 100 we're giving you thrifty don't even have to think about it and our new friend raquel 10 extra physical damage uh me thinks yes 100 and then gamba daily mana regen we'll take it perks what would you want it could give you fatality seems like a pretty good especially if we're pairing you up with our single-hand crossbow pal all right let's start building i think we just need to build as many workers as possible let's start by getting as much gold as i can get that out of here get that out of here uh yeah let's get worker and worker and worker and worker okay we're maxed out on those which is sick oh wait what if i haven't fully unlocked it they gave me like double wait because i only had four workers and i have eight why and or how is that i'm not gonna complain that's huge okay wow well then let's destroy that for gold destroy that for gold for that for gold and destroy that for gold don't mind if i do let's build us now a gold mine we just ran out of gold so getting some more passively i think is a good play i could have bought new gear but whatever i'm building up our economy here i guess i'm really banking on surviving this night didn't really think about that the fact that they're coming this way that was nice because i don't have to add too much here this one's well it's had better days but that's okay the gear wouldn't have even been that crazy let's be honest uh i can sell that i just sell that right okay so let's build some defenses oh we did it mounted ballista or regular targets the closest enemy it automatically fires elevated for improved vision what does that mean um this is so exciting um i'll do one here and watch this um these walls kind of make it tough don't they like um here oh that's sick what else do i want let's just go with some wooden walls don't do i'm gonna do reinforced in front of you you right there that seems to make sense and then just upgrade you repair you repair you okay i can't repair you not bad not bad feeling pretty good let's do this deployment phase time god the mystic they just they're going to hit i think the entire horde is gonna be hitting the wall immediately that's terrifying to fudge me because raquel's gotta be we're just gonna army you up girl um i think i'm going to go with arch over here because he has best line of sight options and then another melee with you armor you up armor you up and that means a wizard goes over here not perfect but i'm also worried they might be coming this way so we'll see all right pray for me if we could beat knight five that would be sick go ballista pog asset that's 317 real estate right there i'm saying die you stupid i'm gonna have to swap to this and kill the runner dodged okay maybe i won't it's weak but i am gonna take the time to fetch it off no rag rats there a lot of damage we reduced its accuracy probably not by enough i don't even know if i want to get in there in melee just because of how many people are probably about to get here and the gate is so far away it's mildly terrifying wait what perch i get i only gave you execution here um i guess we're just gonna use your pistol let's debuff that guy oh not even remotely close enough to hit you okay whatever armor you up that'll do we can't even see anything over here yet oh my god um balls farm that movement speed you know it okay perfect uh you farm that movement speed that's or whatever you know what i mean nine action points remaining trust me i would have used them if i could man my father can't see holy jesus they just it moves in so fast i don't have any time to react well there goes that wall wait what they've gotten all the way in there i don't remember agreeing to this what the did the ballista hit anything what are we doing over here okay screw me i guess i can't do anything with it um oh now we have crawlers great stun resistance 25 dodge armor double the health practically great you'll love to see that i'm just gonna stab him with my spear for you okay the movement is not ideal here can't wait to build myself but that's fine whack and armor up not my best yeah we gotta figure something out about that i can't even okay this will ignore armor though faux free since it's my first one of combat okay we haven't killed anything so now and come over here i'll be back okay that's actually massive no meme okay you are freaking carol is going to carry us man love that guy oh jesus but then i forgot what is going on with his right side me cabeza um yeah jesus uh not good things going on here all right crawler screw you dodged of course okay i'm gonna kill you stun them great i would do that but then i'm gonna destroy my wall and that practically i'm going to anyway but all these freaking i need to get them before they can run away from me it's going to take all my action points though i don't have a better choice i don't think okay i'm gonna try and hide myself within over here i feel like no one's gonna really be able to get to me i could jump over maybe i'll do that might be the best course of action okay friend i don't know what our plan is here but carry me please i'm begging you okay nobody dodged we didn't kill him though and i did not did i not give you execute 19 health wait a second for health off from being executed are you kidding me that's tragic all right we got just a horde and a half coming over here can i shoot you out of range not anymore more health from you too huh okay well i hate you all i'm just gonna try and wound these guys like i almost don't want to kill them so that they can't get to me we're going to we're going to take a couple hits yeah but is what it is left side's looking a lot better let me tell you that oh my god they're already in the city go crossbows okay that's helpful what the fudge just happened i thought because they're all stunned and stuff that well this just went from maybe doable to one no okay well i guess i just have to hope i get through the night uh because i doubt we're gonna oh jesus christ what the okay that sucks poo poo that sucks kaka gonna weaken you um i'm gonna hold off on that let me weaken everybody i can real quick what is this we'll thing he's so healthy what the fudge you can't really move though goodness okay uh we're just gonna i think i just explode this bloody split all right that's all i got um i did this wow that's really good well i'm all about that let me just kebab you walk up punch you and go back um and then what the fudge is going on over here huh panic that's what's going on holy suck i have to kill this thing don't dodge fudge okay oh suck suck suck i could do a big stun here and i have to don't feel like i have a choice um and then i want to go over here and stun out of range you've got to be kidding me he's one off huh i'm one away from phoenix fudge okay this i guess we're propagating right or i couldn't tangle uh i think we propagate pray it goes like this i don't know it only i thought it would go diagonally all right i have to protect our um ballista holy smokes all right i think we're gonna send holy sock is there a way i don't lose this do it there's so many of them it was going so well boy hey um minus armor minus dodge what is that i mean they all have armor maybe that's just the play screw it you gotta pop off my friend let me tell you that you stunned next to nobody you tried though you really did oh suck uh i don't know i don't know friend okay whatever we'll cross that bridge here in a second oh um can you okay hold on yeah we gotta pull you i think what uh how far can we [Music] only multi hit one of them i can do this though okay so then what i'll do is undo that i'll multi-hit some of these to help so i'm only gonna be able to use three of my action points over there looks like so let me do this one more time there you go my friend that is all i have to offer you good luck okay oh wait no whoops i can't see that i meant to do this are you kidding me 25 chance three times in a row it dodges screw me okay i'm going over here and i'm just freaking farting all over you guys screw you um geez that's all i got um good luck friend if you die we are in more than just dire straits let me tell you that i think i oh wait i can hit him on the backswing of this stuff all right now i have to run otherwise you're gonna get absolutely pooped on uh oh my god they already made it to the wizard okay we gotta kill there's so many runners and crawlers what the fudge just let me make it through night five man come on ah oh my god they're over here whatever at least they're not jesus okay what's this that that is some value i'm not gonna lie to you about that oh finna do it again but i think we die how do let's go back to this we just gotta use up all our man like we don't have a choice anymore just whack like this only one more mana oh okay i guess that's that wait did that guy dodge are you everybody and their mom is dodging okay hurt everything first and foremost we got rid of the runners that's your job buddy let's not kill anything yet though i don't know if you can kill them we need a high roll there i swear to god if i don't okay we did we did oh we high rolling all those perfect so good okay now how far are these guys moving not far enough to worry about it that much he'll be hitting me but what else can i do about it um okay i'm all out of stuff so i'm gonna move back uh right out of range and then you oh i can't even do it another time anyway maybe just do a big entangle yeah screw you guys uh and then let's propagate you that's big now we are all out of oh geez just don't die on me please all i'm asking for nobody die oh my god i thought they were going for my gold things not the oh no no no no no hold on dodged feels good good jesus christ okay didn't even break through the armor oh no okay not great not great but we're not dead yet we're not dead yet all right you boners we gotta take care of these guys are there any other runners i can tag yes yes there are screw you guys in particular um maybe i shouldn't kill him yet i'm unable to hit him gotta maim everybody i can ah fudge i killed him whoops okay kill you hopefully kill you can't hit you you're not moving very far let's stop you in the tracks okay is there anyone threatening the middle right now not that i can see you need to get the fudge out of dodge that's another thing all i know itself okay we have to i go here pretty good okay it's the best i got um how oh god i just have to do another entangle i have enough to do that um i think i just need to keep doing no maybe i'll do that and then let it propagate there because i think we get biggest value there run back kind of just shield it with my body you my friend have your work cut out for you but i believe in you because if you fail okay but it looks like we've practiced jesus christ we've practically seen everything it says 52 left that's a lot chief i'm gonna lie to you that's a whole heck of a lot i can't stop them all i don't have enough action points to like anything else i think i just die here i don't want to die we gotta jump over the wall screw it arm around the list is probably gonna fall two action points oh it's a good thing i checked that um was this this propagates you could do that here and that's probably our best bet there oh i can do it again too okay that's pretty good that was all we have left though now we're just gonna do a little tango perfect oh i'm begging you i just want to beat night five but it's getting so hard and me losing that hero was prepaid of me dodged stupid wait did he was he trying to go through the wall all right everybody's alive so that's the good news you really use mana the bad news i reckon need to stop the immediate threats here um go to my axe can't even oh i can't even move that much okay well never mind just just stab you stab like that move back armor up pray okay that's because that's gonna get we can propagate here decently i think although most of them already poison there's only so much i can do well no it the poison does stack never mind that's pretty good let's start wounding where we can any line of sight hold on you you you you hakashu uh he's a little annoying but like this poison 90 damage does that does that go through armor because if not it won't kill so i'm gonna do it just in case um this does armor pierce i'll just armor pierce that dude and i'll do it again why not i hate you and then for a one-off let's just finish him all i got left so i'm just gonna chill back here i don't know oh dodged are you kidding me okay let's see you guys are staying put almost all of you are so just hit you come back chill pray okay poisoned it a lot there we need to clean up this right side as fast as possible because the left is getting out of hand oh hey okay didn't even break the army though you're nuts oh i got our defenses my heart okay this guy isn't going for the circle yet yeah is the key word there though um i want to go help over here but i don't even think um maybe i'll have to hold the fort down with just this guy i have to decide who's doing what here i i might be able to just take this by myself i guess a lot of it depends on if people dodge um okay i was the best i got we are going to take a hit from him oh yeah uh shish kebab shish kebab and whack and run back okay um i feel like i just have to just arrange on this thing wait wait okay so i would have to do that and then i could probably hit a decent bit there okay so i'm gonna help you out the ballista you son of a ah fudge i was trying to avoid you killing somebody rip me okay well then that's out of the bag but just freaking kill who you can okay now you need to do whatever it is you can do we'll take anything let's get rid of the runner and then just massage please hyrule pog that's all you could do but it's plenty okay he's going for the magic circle but literally aside from that i think the ballista might even take care of the last guy so magic circle should be okay here right okay all right it's up to you you pleb kill this thing because i swear to god wait is this guy oh my so annoying there's no way you can reach him useless just start crippling some people all right now he has to come back here and save everybody i'm going this close because otherwise this guy was going to get through of course he would okay god save the queen without you buddy let me tell you we would be in some dire straits uh i might have to hit my own building here i guess i could punch okay punch punch uh let's do uh a debuff he can't do that of course i can't debuff you guys whatever i did what i could for my people now i run back like a coward um you can't do anything else all right 12 people left and we'll do it it's not pretty the city is in shambles in fact the city is no doubt dead if i could evacuate the last people i could but i don't think there's time however will survive night six they're like is it worth it yes yes it is or night five whatever and i don't care okay so the ballista killed them let's go you're nuts uh now i swear to god if you just miss freaking everything again that's fine that's fine sweet jesus dude like their dodgers are just insane no okay point blank wait that might kill him we don't want to do that yet we'll set up as many kills as possible um all right now we start killing kill kill kill for health whatever well i was gonna say i can execute that though so operusky you're dead you're dead we did it we oh it was a bloody night we lost a good hero too it might have gone a little bit better if they hadn't just gotten absolutely pooped on there but they did alas freaking let's go absolutely huge oh my god i'm still not gonna get anybody to level seven though why wait didn't i do this last time we survived night five right because that's how i got the blister i think okay well we didn't really do better this one but you can't always get what you want we did get essence so we like essence that's a lot of essence holy essence holy essence lucky night killed three crawlers without them dodging anything they must have been the only things they didn't dodge something that entire game night five we're screwed yeah we are yeah you know somehow they didn't kill any of my things though still of all my workers okay let's use my change in essence moses where what was i spending this on offhands that's right give me the offhand pog what next like defensive gear variations might be good why not i like anything that'll help me on a fresh run i think we only like the one for moving but we'll take it we did but we got elven armor baby let's level you guys up you're an xp bar how close are you level seven because i feel like i don't want to know the answer because it's going to break my heart i'm only going to break break break break your heart whatever just you guys are all dead let me tell you so we're just going to take whatever we want sure give me that accuracy would have been nice forever ago a little late but whatever i'm gonna miss you carol god you aren't the realest man absolutely nuts yellow oh my god 28 of course carol's freaking popping off now um what do we want to give you all at full health extra well that's not gonna do anything for us 50 reliability and isolate enemies that might come in handy towards the later part like at the end there where we're picking people off not so much earlier but uh gamba sure give me that health yeah um that all sucks i don't even think you have any let's just go to the rival perks uh magic increase by current mana that's seven percent or something we'll take it grab what little things it's fine it's fine i feel like there are some things though some prowesses for like buying things maybe uh increases workers by one yellow yolo we have 14 workers man i don't have like anything to demolish because oh i could have bought another hero i mean it's over anyway yeah there's like nothing else to use my workers for because they destroyed everything so instead um improves production give me that yeah i wish i could have done another another thing of that i guess oh wait a second oh now i can bop look at that that's what i call efficient uses per production another one love it well i could get a hero but whatever maybe there's an achievement for like buying a cert oh what could have bought him at level five holy jesus they cost more but dang son okay well i can't afford danielson never mind we're poor but then just upgrade that again give me those materials yeah i have nothing left to do with my workers new structures buy something again feels bad let's i don't have money for that okay whatever let's build some defenses i'm in so much trouble ballista ballista all this stuff that's right we're all in on the ballista one little wall there bob okay great several workers i can't do anything with whatever i can right what else could i be able to do with these bonus nothing okay yeah all right let's position our heroes we'll put one with all the ballistas and the rest is over here arm yourself arm yourself godspeed friends i'm throwing you into the fire what wait did all the ballistas just focus the exact same enemies what are these boomers oh attack of the boomers man first you're in the economy and now my my game what the heck um 120 damage is i assume they explode themselves 450 health is like this first level the only level you're supposed to because like it seems impossible sweet jesus man well screaming um god 10 movement pog you're going to die but for a good cause just mark them all you can we're gonna make sure they can't get to us pog immobilized requires line of sight your mom requires line of sight stupid unlimited power i agree um you know what i'm just gonna poison you and poison you stupids i'm gonna take some boomers with me no remorse all right i'm going to go to my spear stab and leave me with three stab oh nice and i'm out i'm a coward armor up for no good reason just trying to farm those prowess things screw you guys i was actually pretty decent not gonna lie okay what the fudge like now we're just popping off or something for no reason like where was this last night screw you guys all right let's just focus different enemies okay see that's much better a little late but better now i want to see if i kill these boomers does it hurt the people around them because that would be clutch and that's what we're about to find out right after i maim a whole bunch of people it does okay wait a second you can kind of use those to your advantage i unlocked offhand weapons too because like if i had a main one-hand crossbow and an offhand crossbow i don't know what that would look like but that would be sick yeah god carol rest in pepe my friend you deserve better you deserve to make it the whole way i tell you what screw you screw you uh get pooped on dude it's embarrassing i'm just gonna punch him stupid okay where you at girl you know i'm giving myself false sense of hope but i think we're just boned still but what's life without trying or something i don't know i'm not sure where i'm going with that but uh that looks to be pretty solid yeah i don't know what i did exactly i just saw dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge charger and i want to cry we're gonna run back there when here didn't move they don't need to what ballistas focus different you penises stupids a lot of boomers though if i could kill one of them well that'd be nice uh what what am i planning to do here am i really trying to do something or am i just i kind of i guess i kind of want to see how many people would be left if i actually tried i don't know ill all right let's just go back here you know the plan make sure nothing can move stop them all right in their dirty tracks you're so good um screw the archer scream again yeah now run and hide my friend run and tell that run and tell that give me that movement that's right okay what do we do about this chief what do we do about this out of range of course classic nothing died sick okay i think we die here now i think this is things just gonna explode on me but we had a good run i mean we're like two-thirds of the way through the three fifths of the way through the night i can't really tell you know if i'd actually like wait did the boomer survive that did he survive his own ex oh no he didn't i was gonna say what the that doesn't make any sense all right yeah we're dead so let's get as much out of it as we can that is so much damage you're still only rocking out default spear too spears are pretty little jet there's really no point doing any of this propagate that's pretty good uh let's see if we can't try and kill him that'd be fun so tanky really you're gonna live with that much huh screw you too all right i'm ready for the end ah okay well we didn't even see the final count on the amount of people for the day uh night six whatever so that's fun [Music] jesus i'll miss you most of all carol uh you homie love you at least you didn't have to die you were the best of us and you were the best of us i have nothing to spend there i don't think we unlocked anything here otherwise it'd be lit up shut your mouth blah blah blah blah now how how is someone not reach local freaking seven oh lake burke number four i guess that's what we'll do next time as we slowly slowly make progress i'm gonna have a new idea approaching buildings i think i'm going to invest all in houses first get as much workers then gold mines then resource camps then the end and then go from there i think that's the plan because i feel like that's how you get the most amount of resources for your your buck or something i'm not sure i i'm probably making a lot of this up but we do have plenty of unlocks ballista was cool need to figure out best ways to put it i guess i need to like separate them because yeah they if they're targeting the same thing then that kind of i mean in some instances i guess it could be good but i also mean to just put four right in a row so but i learned something from the meme so it wasn't a lost cause with that said i want to thank however much for watching have yourself a fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
