hi ad Holdren money mr. fruit and welcome back to call duty modern warfare god I hate you Infinity Ward well it's a love-hate relationship I was gonna take the weekend off because I've been grinding my nuts off for Damascus that's like hey let's watch some football let's grind some battlefront double weapon XP ah so I had to I mean I mentioned it recently Nvidia next time double weapon XP came was a time I was gonna try to start grinding assault rifles well that's exactly what I've been doing I got the FAL max level Jesus why do they go such high levels dude it's ridiculous the scar max level in the ak-47 max level on a higher now boom baby it I think it is it might be my favorite gun in the game might not be the best with it but you like when you're just on with it you're on and it feels so good we're gonna be using a FSS 20 edge factory barrel bead tack lays FSS mark to support dome stack you know me slide a hand and some strip of grip tape put those all together mix them in a pot and what do you get the Powerpuff Girls also I'm just so sad about this leveling system there's just no I'm passively leveling up because I'm trying to get cameras but I just don't care I'm leveling to just get more challenges and all these I've just done passively I haven't tried to do any challenges I know the prestige system wasn't perfect but I liked it more than this one Oh sounds like we're joined in a a cloud fiesta here ok looks like we got some headquarters now bear with me here because it has it has been a minute since I've used the elf carbine Oh like I said I've been using the so trifles so my aim isn't quite as pinpoint as it probably should be I think I've been using a sight on my carbine actually oh fudge fudge fudge yeah that's one thing about the carbine well I mean for the most part all DMR's really you missed that first shot you blow you're in for a bad time if you missed the second you're 99% of the time you're dead but I like the carbine because it consistently can get a chest up just above kill and I know what you're thinking you didn't get one there that was like mid well we're back I'll give it to him but it's but it's that increased rate of fire it's a nice in-between of the EBR and the car and I hate my life like I said ok I guess and I'll do my best to frag out but nope you suck a mom let me breathe okay I can breathe out cheese laughing are like eight million of them on Betty ah cheese can we stop with the nades very very immature very immature okay I I'm really not a stems here and by writing that stands I mean I'm out of stems I will say though thank you to whoever kept yelling at me to use them cuz it worked now I'm using them and I love them and I'm used to it and they're my crunch oh Jesus give me a good chance do I use the Chi here yeah the carbine it's so confusing to me carbine car and then I want to call it I just want to shorten the carbine the car but then that mistakes the car with the car you know that I mean as nice you know as it feels good oh Jesus that's an even feels better your ass there we go there we good here we go I've gotten some nice nice multi kills with yoke carbine here you wouldn't expect it but yeah very easy to do again if you're feeling it marksman rifles are pretty dependent except for the EBR I would say you see that's what I'm talking about that's what I'm talking about that feels real good mmm just like yeah I'm hard what's good I'm sorry I don't mean like my peepee I mean my skill okay all right hey but we don't have to use special so anymore which means I do have a chance at getting our favorite war crime and I gotta tell you it's been a while guys it's been a while I think I think I it's safe to say we all miss it all that's a VTOL we're almost there come on war crime war crime war up it's been so long oh heavens to Betsy wait did it okay I was gonna say if they capture the HQ this is gonna SEC okay excuse me sir I'm just trying to it let's lay some white phosphorus here I need to move though because that's right on top of me and then I'm gonna put the VTOL where the white phosphorus isn't covering uh-huh 800 IQ white phosphorus getting peppered and laid that's a double kill let's go war crimes yeah if you're new to the channel don't worry it's it's a joke okay haha another gal let's go excuse me oh I hear someone else trying to use a marksman rifle off five hours after worry cuz I could very well kill myself I'm stupid sir give me a second oh my god okay yeah sure freakin nailed that and by now that I mean my killstreaks dead god I haven't been able to use a kill streak in so long though this is nice this is nice let's ruin that SP mm let's go baby there goes my veto there goes my hero but you like that one life mmm nothing else quite compares for me in this game honestly because it feels skill oriented I mean you gotta hit your shots and then again sometimes you just come across bah one shot one shot it's like say being as efficient as possible it's like running the camo challenges you know gotta be as efficient as possible is doing that you gotta be as efficient as possible two bullets I'm not always I'm like the the was it the greatest man on earth or the coolest whatever the dose of keys dude you know I'm saying like I don't always use a gun and frag but when they do it's with my mooks Monroe also apologies on that accent I just can't do accents it's something I've just had to come to terms with I like to do them but I also have to realize that doesn't mean I'm good at them okay alright yeah maybe let's just aim down sights as a this hit fire will surely work it did not mmm I can't wait for I was gonna say can't wait for flat Marchman rifles but first off I have to get snipers plat two which is stupid and now on top of that plant sacks so it's really I can't wait to get Damascus which unfortunately is that a much bigger endeavor as we're all aware but I swear on me on me freaking mama that I'm doing it and I want to go to black ops for I haven't looked in a while to see the gun challenges they came with challenges for those because something tells me it's easier like I don't think getting max camo has ever been this difficult there's a dude right oh you got has ever been this difficult maybe it has but I think the biggest problem on a warfare has is just solely how long it takes you to max weapon levels I've played the game for nearly four days I don't even have the weapons maxed all of them like that and that's all I do I don't even use weapons really after I max them that's the biggest problem because then you can't do all the camos and tell you max through all the levels and blah blah blah blah blah mr. schat's mr. fruit maybe it is maybe it isn't if it is then who knows maybe next call duty I'll be ready I'll be rearing to go you know I'm saying about child's play I'm gonna hit fire you oh my god hello enemy team but I love with all the marksman rifles without double weapon XP and honestly not terrible because they didn't have that many levels it meant that you got to max well then a reasonable amount of time or at the very least the amount of time it took to max level them you were getting most of the challenges done so it all counted towards each other which is nice very nice oh come on botch yeah triple coup now come on keep coming keep coming keep coming I know respond over there okay well you did nudie booty booty booty booty booboo the other problem too because of this double weapon XP I've had to obviously level of the assault rifles and I'm afraid come tomorrow I think Monday or Tuesday whenever they do that playlist refreshes they're gonna take out shoot house and put it back some house god only knows hopefully it's something good for challenges but it meant I wasn't able to focus on knife and ride shield because what I was gonna do aside for maybe try and hit the enemy is while the shoot house playlist was here finished Golding the ride shield a knife but I'm so busy with this own rifles that hasn't happened there's a guy right behind me oh my god get absolutely destroyed watch out for that Claymore buddy here I got you you're good there's another one around here did it kill you I hope not I don't know where they spawn I'm gonna say in this corner survey says I was right dodge I think the reason I like this guy excuse me this gun so much is because it feels so visceral so raw it's the reason I like bows and stuff because it just feels it's it feels like it's from another time you know it always has some interesting mechanic or like skill that you have to specifically cultivate for said weapon am I making sense I know this feels like an old western gun you know like the the reloading and everything and I like that I'm quite a fan if I'm being honest with you oh I almost stuck him jumping out of the window that would have been cool but then it wasn't oh my god just wants a man one life I'm hot next 15 I'm not okay good I warned you about this I warned you but we did get our favorite war crime so really everything else is irrelevant because at the end of the day work down I'm just purposefully bounce bounce now my skill based management guy said yeah I'm dying on purpose oh here she comes watch out boss she'll chew you whoa she's a man-eater don't blow them up but I got this don't stop coming oh you're friendly dude dad chill chill chill with it I was gonna shoot you but then you start shooting me and I panicked got you got your Claymore you ain't fooling me there's someone over here Bam Bam you already got him oh yeah you know I'm gonna try the monolithic suppressor never tried it with the carbine but I love it on smg's I mean what can go wrong as far as max loveling goes i still for LNG's three shotguns and five assault rifles so i'm not too worried about it oh fudge me this is bad don't come for me please okay thank you they list oh my god well how nice of them instead of immediately coming for me they just waited to squat up a firing firing line for me like all right well enjoy this buddy ol pal and I said first off I'm not your buddy not your pal I'm not old so shut your mouth my gonna win man down - bit absurd but who put it there oh gosh fudge fudge god I suck a big thing behind me above me yap yap yap-yap yap-yap Europe yep yep yeah beer beer beer beer beer beer yep-yep-yep yep-yep-yep yep-yep-yep yep-yep-yep yep-yep-yep yep-yep-yep I suck oh my god can't I hit a thing no I can't oh hey there we go finally it's a bad time it all depends on can i lock on the upper chest stemming up baby come here I mean were you going were you going don't be shy girl okay alright yes fine we'll hit fire Oh hit [ __ ] I need water watch watch oh my god mr. fruit like I said I'm rusty when I was grinding him out though oh really I get a couple games in and then just hit that zone you know what I'm saying just freaking on fire brother like that just instant target acquisition your head is my target locked on people right now my god he has a name bye no only if you count the one God gave me how now if that's the case God gave me a faulty one come on bro couldn't give me a better one let's be right before Abdul you must have been a faulty release and I just never got the the patch update or something oh we don't have any of his owns by the way al I know I say that I never make a conscious effort to ever change that I know I'm a horrible objective player especially when I'm making a video though it's like do you want to see me sit on a flag you don't to see me Frank I'm sure some people might be like well we'd like to see you see the objective you know set a good example for the kids oh ma wow I'm sure he should have killed me I deserved it honestly he wasn't even oh oh from a distance I can't really contest at that range simply because I don't have a sight it's not that I don't have the range I still have the eyeballs still have the vision not like a hawk ah geez ah jeez ah ha here we go mr. fruit it did stop ready but it's getting the job done hey get off my Alfa oh oh oh ah Jesus you know how some movies have like an F word count mr. fruit videos needed a fudge count because that'll probably tell you how much i'm ii like every missed shot botch you know i'm saying it's more of like I'm just like come on you're better than that me lay in the OB dream which mind you my teammates aren't doing ok look at me huh a little ball up here maybe play some tetherball used to always play that on the little recess never I understood the rules we tried her bashed and never really made sense to me hello you like turned over to me he's like oh this is how I die yes yes it is ha ha see I avoided saying fudge on the first miss because perhaps I'm just psyching myself out you know I missed the first shot say hey steady your aim calm you'll be fine you'll recover from this but if I immediately just discourage myself well then of course my shots gonna be off I'm just setting myself up for failure and maybe that's the easier thing to do a scapegoat of some sort I'm hungry though it's time for my morning smoothie I'll have you know I've gone from 2 cups of raw oats to little over a cup simply because well funny story I won't go into the details but my body wasn't appreciating that much fiber if you're picking up what I'm putting down and I think you are because the toilet certainly was oh I'll bet I'm just on fire today hard time well not in game that's for sure oh my sweet Moses I know this is embarrassing ah jeez Oh cows and stop reloading sir I know it looks cool yeah oh you got all fancy hungry I'm tired when I'm tired I'm hungry okay the inverse is not true when I'm tired I'm not necessarily hungry but when I'm hungry I am tired wisely we need fewer filmy uh but I've just been so blinded by challenges and camos and assault rifles I've just I've been out of it see that's nice it's nice when they're not looking at me oh yeah my success rate of killing somebody goes up dramatically they were here hello oh yes they oh my god oh my god I can barely see him I just kind of saw its kind of shot while I 80s tanned it worked out I just happen to find their faces hey there we go see where is this mystery fruit the entire game I mean it's nearly impossible to perform at 100% at all times Oh shake it off baby shake it up shake it up shake it off shake it off oh my golly that was what uh-huh watch me oh here we go we're going for a war crime baby we're going for the war the whip all right there it goes never mind I thought I had my platinum rocket launches but I forgot took it off this because I swore an oath to never use them again who had shut it apart it was super easy to get that head shot challenges done for this okay just predict now fudge me all right blinded jump through this thing missed okay perfect cool and calm under pressure this is amazing way to finish it out strong mr. fruit two gold marksman rifles down one more to go and then a lot of other Gold's to go but I gotta get back to hunting away any sooner animals why they like 70 levels just like Jesus I don't I don't need 70 things to put in the underbarrel slot I'm never gonna use these things anyway with that said I want to thank you all very much for watching everybody I'll talk to you and the next one farewell [Music]
