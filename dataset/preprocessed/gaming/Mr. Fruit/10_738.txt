hi ad hope doin my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to a bleeding edge in today's video we'll be checking out none other than buttercup herself not to be confused with road hog believe it or not a hook is not an original concept created by overwatch so anyways that's not important basic abilities buttercup has saw blades slicer enemies with a circular saw blades alternatively if you hold the attack button you spin up the back wheel then launch forward collecting enemies with a shoulder barge for bread and butter special yank chain an enemy and yank them back to you oil slick drop a puddle of oil that slows enemies whiplash unleash a flurry of whipping blades the damages all nearby enemies and then to supers you get to choose which one you want to use for the match turbocharged temporarily in 25% damage 50% life steal an increase max life by 33% or you could go with burnout an epic burnout the damages enemies and knocks them away she's pretty straightforward on how to play her but her yank alone is a lot of fun so hope you guys enjoy the gameplay ever let's get into it watch this ready whoops let's do this we need to find the batteries any SAP let's starts in 10 seconds
