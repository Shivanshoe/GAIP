hey ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to today's video i'm rather excited about it it's a paladin's video and i know miss fruit you're just trying to kill your channel aren't you listen you there we go out of focus work with me paladins is a freaking fantastic game i've been playing it even more than usual recently and like i said or did i say when on my return video listen i'm gonna i'm gonna be doing a lot more videos that i just want to do even if they don't perform so well they might be sprinkled around everywhere but look i've said it over and over like paladins i love so i'm just gonna start posting more occasionally hopefully you guys enjoy it and support it and if you don't shame on you and before you ask yes that that is a ladder back there the stream's really been enjoying the ladder much more than they've been enjoying me smoke detector was just going blah blah blah so we had to get that fixed anyway enjoy today's video brand new here yagura it's sick let's get into it that's right welcome back to paladins ladies and gentlemen this skin i cannot lie is pretty sick it's like a viking berserker skin all about it but that's not why we're here today because paladins just released its most recent champion i'm not sure when this video is going live but i it's probably still going to be its newest champion yoga roth the developer yeah i hear that i could have just let her introduce herself i guess but whatever jagrath does a lot of things as you can see here and if you read it you would understand i know crazy right look i'll give you a better rundown once we just once we hop into it okay trust me i will maybe i'm thinking about it actually i need to make a loadout hey like it's the woman of the hour i think it's a girl i'm not really sure then again it's some crazy looking general grievous bug so i don't really know if it conforms to the same gender norms that we have here on earth it could be a herma bloth you're like what the fudge is that well maybe that's what it is exactly we just don't know because we're just so close-minded you know we only know what was in our world i don't know why i'm trying to get philosophical here or whatever that's just theoretical let's just let's just get into a game please otherwise i'm gonna i'm gonna word vomit or rather continue toward vomit oh but i gotta i gotta select them got him get destroyed a joke's on you though i can't worry vomit if i'm hydrating drink some water water check hydro homies how you doing out there go get some water pause the video if you don't have it i don't care no excuses go get some water drink it eight ounces right now at the very bare minimum do it now look at our totally balanced team of dps dps dps dps then there's me tank they have healers what's that like couldn't be us all right we need to choose one of these things this is if i want to be helpful to my teams screw that i want to do more damage let me choose my loadout okay so here i thought we were going to play oh jeez hold on oh no oh heavens i thought we were gonna play a game out that okay so i need this i'm in planted form now i'm in roly-poly form so when i'm when i get out of this form i'm literally stuck that's why it's called planted but then i get to attack and i'm i'm a giant by the way like literally in my planted form you would have to be blind to not see me i poke over walls and stuff it's pretty crazy anyway i roll around here i can do some damage and whatnot but mainly the fun comes once i unplanned but i gotta kind of get close okay here we go i'm playing that's what i do i spit up venom in this mode there's a kill and see now they're like oh i'm safe or are you i didn't think so there we go now i'm in and out like a bandito i'm like uh ow what the fudge i'm very much like uh what are those droids little roy pulley droids okay i'm kind of hurt now though booze i'm accelerating okay great somebody oh oh you guys did not kill him i thought you had i'm healing i think i i actually don't know what i'm doing right now pain suffering okay i need to get out of here i would say i could do some healing but we don't have any healers i just gotta sit outside of battle long enough uh go ahead and uh upgrade this i guess okay so in this form i go like this oh i'm going a little too fast hold up and i can't stop myself when this is happening but then if i do this and constantly hold right click as well i send out little uh i don't really know spikes or something i don't know but it it hurts people i'm so good at explaining things aren't oh they have no idea that i'm right here and then i'm about to go in wait what is she doing to me what is she doing to me i'm out of here screw this cheap now check this you want to chase me come here i'm ready for it no little rolly pulley that could plant come on now i'm ready for it was everybody hiding nope i wouldn't really say i can't i can't see i can't see i'm scared i'm alone oh i'm going to push him off the map did it work did it work i almost pushed myself off i don't think anybody died oh oh wait what i can't see you pleb okay that works okay so oh i forget when i'm rolling i can i can ping to like find people but check this out that's not really what i meant to do uh hold on let me let me try this again wait what why did it take up my ultimate wait what happened it should it shouldn't have done that okay whatever fine you wanna go you wanna go i think you're about to kill me but i'm alive just barely but i'm alive and now i'm healing i'm very confused but i'm rolling around i'm doing damage and quite frankly i haven't died yet so i'm here to help you androxus and by that i mean it's a little too late you're already done okay let's start pinging though i feel like uh clickers or whatever okay that's the full enemy team all right i'm out of here what up you still want to challenge me that's what i thought i think that uh means you don't want to here i go let me uh click oh my god you poor souls you poor souls i got one look at that one be like eight and i'm just going in and now i'm out l-o-l but now i'm gonna ult somebody watch this ready their healer come here that's right i just i literally eat him oh i'm gonna die now all right i had to die eventually oh i'm back okay here i go i'm going in oh right and on i'm not letting you get away mate come back here never mind you are you are healing because you have healers on your team must be nice okay well guess what here i am and uh okay you went behind the bush my immortal enemy of course now let me click a little bit uh is it working i think it's working we got a kill i see you but i can't do anything about you oh fudge i hate you i'm back and with a vengeance my ultimate is not yet ready but it's just a moment of time or a matter of time screw you oh what the wow you can fly around can't you look at you so nimble acid reflexes it's like none others no one can compare yo somebody's over here come over here bop run straight into you you're dead and then watch this so if they can't break my shield in time i just execute people doesn't matter their health i just num nom nom nom nom nom nom still said they took away like best play though does anyone know why they did that destructive force with me most damage what up oh yeah look at that not even comparable just killing it see i guess i really didn't give you guys much time to understand what's going on here okay so like i said forum swap we're either roly-poly or we're planted when we're planted we're like a big old tower we can't do anything but then we throw up venom all right and then we also have this when i'm planted reduces incoming damage um huh i actually didn't know that that's good to know and then that's how i click to reveal enemies if i'm really pully and then i eat people get it got it good see like allies within blah blah get helped heal for playing the objective come on now that's hilarious but no four three i actually don't entirely know oh wait what we're playing death match again i'm so used to normally getting oh geez okay well i guess i'm going straight in i'm so used to playing wow okay well this guy's not playing and yet still so tanky come on i don't have the range all right fine then i'll get in close i'll do it myself and he's sticking me with all the bombs in the oh my god i'm stunned okay i thought that was his old for some reason it wasn't i kind of freaked out for no reason and now we have a healer oh my god this is a whole new game here i go baby screw you no damage here uh uh yeah he's like oh my god wait i'm getting lit up yes right you forgot to account for me all right let me click around i can't who's hitting me right now oh i'm scanning i'm scanning i'm going in yeah i'm getting the healer his friend doesn't even realize la mao you wonder why you're not getting healed i'll tell you exactly why because i killed him it was me oh hello let me see if i can knock him off the map oh fudge really was hoping i could all right now watch this they're not going to expect me to flank them get the healer again now watch this i'm going to eat their healer come here boy you cannot stop the inevitable he just had to watch his friends slowly die and then i'm gonna come over here and you're dead and i'm weak so i'm out of here ugh it's just the ultimate disrespect like watch me you have to watch this happen and you going toe to toe with me ballsy but uh that's not the play all right i'm going to knock him off ah fudge the ability wasn't ready it never is you know i know i think it's gonna be best seven in a row let's go let me take this little thing and then we're gonna go back in here okay that's too many of them way too many of them so then you know the plan come right behind him right behind him they'll never know get ruckus first maybe not this is unclear what i should be doing running running is what i should be doing and that is exactly what i'm doing they hurt so much all right let me scout let's go for the turret guy he's got the tf2 skin that's funny oh whoa where'd you come from hello mr secret agent wait why are you why aren't you dying do you just have like omega lifesteal or something what the [ __ ] is that i don't know but i'm gonna go here wait am i getting sh hey hey what up bruh i was trying to buy my thing i

percent of my cooldown none me what the fudge okay somebody's gotta help me with this dude because god knows he's just gonna forever kill me there we go okay i guess i'm absorbing damage or something i'm still kind of unclear on as to what that does oh keep accelerating keep accelerating never stop never stop i don't want to run into them i don't want to run into them heal me good people oh enemy rampage what is we doing out here here i go is this guy this guy separated i got a plant though it's not letting me it's not there we go there we go oh you're all done for that's the good stuff i'm

take it mr fruit victory oh you know what i woke up today and chose violence because most shielding what that's that's what i got i did a decent amount of damage but they did more whatever dude because i'm a tank that's what they should be embarrassed about i'm a tank and i'm getting that much damage on them all right come on teammates i'm gonna play the dps then play the freaking dps so i
