i've got you my king they're shooting the butt they're shooting the butt see that's what i'm talking about oh it's it's looking it's looking so bad it'll sing heidi hope everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and wouldn't you believe it pigs were flying no cap datto was like hey carry me through the hardest grand master nightfall i'm like i'm a busy guy but okay i'll move some things around for you see everybody's been complaining about this brand new light blade grand master and um yeah i see why enjoy the video okay this was what i was thinking i'm rocking arby for that for the barrier i got me a grid skipper for unstoppable and void and then the new reeds regret with vice triple tap firing light okay i'm into it here's what you need to know about light blade there's no void shields there are solar but we don't care about that because we are blessed true and you get 25 bonus damage on arc weapons so if you have an arc pulse rifle 25 damage boost you have if you have a linear fuse a tarantula 25 bonus damage my pulse should i just do major spec nothing crazy in here right holes no i would do minor spec oh true the light blade there you go all right gamers go some words of advice the boss in this first area and in the boss room avoid at all costs um everything that deals arc damage hurts really bad the lucent hive are all sentinels the grenade will kill you one shot 100 to zero be aware of them so just don't get hit from anything pretty much yeah if you get hit by something you might die okay but otherwise you'll okay but i think they'll be surprised by my tenacity and willpower this is already terrifying oh please don't hurt me removing champs from the game win probably gonna be a little bit do you think they'll ever actually uh i think it's something that they're probably talking about i mean i like to think that like with the hive bearing guardians it showed this is an interesting way and challenging combatant that isn't also super lame to fight i've got you my king i'm not gonna lie wow okay i was shocked that that shield actually held up i doubt i told you i have those bonus inherent stats what uh what do we do is this boner lever uh you gotta shoot him a little bit but like when we kill most of the ads he'll go away oh man i hope if i beat him i have a chance of getting his helmet as my helmet as a titan wouldn't that be cool that would be really neat it's your fruit wouldn't that okay i need that yeah he'll get a little saucy with you he he he'd never gone that far before he's he's like that dude read the room wait like we'll kill you in like 20 minutes yeah it'll be about 20 minutes i rebuke you in the name of jesus okay well he dodged i do it i do gotta remember listen gm you know i'm a little rusty i'm sticking with the hallway yeah i don't know what that is but that sounds nice yeah yeah is that just hide in the hallway pretty much i like that strut it's a good screen uh he's down there this time oh wizard right here right come on uh he might teleport up to the top right yeah oh all right these lucent mods we're gonna have to talk no there's uh there's actually i got it i didn't realize that there you go there you go oh spot what the fudge okay uh the white bear right next to me oh they spawned okay back up back up back up back up back up i don't know you should be up oh he's mine there's some heavy boys i was going to try to go invis him to save him but the game said nope here you go you don't need it but i got you oh hey expressing bro it's 20 22. you can't just do that all right who's going to do that me oh no oh you're gonna want time castles hey daddle yikes i'm gonna need you to not okay i'm doing it again come on dino you got it ah see i gotta believe bro where was i can finish this kite too if we get them close i got all right that was basically the hardest section until we get to the boss oh no it's always easy wait what about the bridge part yeah you know out don't worry one shot just trigger zone all right so what's the play here because i feel like we just either stand here and get shot up the butt or we or we kind of like skirt on the sides and get shot up the butt no the plan is shoot them before they shoot your butt okay if they can't see my butt they can't shoot my butt uh shoot the shrieker i don't think it has a butt but shoot it yeah maidenless more like buttless am i right got him me in high school the irl nadeless and buttless it was a double threat i've only heard legends yeah some people talk about the triple threat with like acting it's the double threat what's with the tracking on this thing all right mr fruit thing to watch out for here wizards get those shields down yeah this is the butt shooting i was talking about trying to get a head start on the exactly uh if you feel like you can't move you just slide and let you move if you're playing over 60 fps what do you what kind of casual you take mr fruit for no i i don't want to make assumptions about people there's people on the internet who think gyms are hard what do you want from me man has the rtx 40 series already what's the wizard doing i only have two rb shots just
