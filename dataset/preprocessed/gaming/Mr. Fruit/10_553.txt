heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the cycle thank you very much to jaeger development for sponsoring this video if you don't know what the cycle is let me tell you you've been missing out it's a pve vp game it's like a battle royale but you could complete a match without ever having to fight another player i'm addicted and you can become two because best of all it's free to play on the epic game story they'll be linked down in the description box below to check the game out yourself it's a no pay to win purely cosmetic based free to play game with each match comes different contracts that are randomly generated that you can complete to earn points in that round whoever has the most points at the end of the round and extracts from the ship wins the game now even if you don't come first you can still extract get bonus points and make progression through ranks and other stuff there's solo duo squads and ranked mode and there's two maps not only that but season threes here with a brand new battle pass brand new contract the resource train and the prospect station the prospect station being the social hub of the game i didn't even mention the best part though they made us an exclusive and limited weapon charm in the game that's right i have my very own weapon charm in the game that you can see on the screen right now and it is saucy on the screen now and in the description box below will be the code to redeem in the epic game store redeeming it from your account and then launching the game will link it to your account and you can throw it on any weapon you choose i should note there is a redemption limit only 3 000 people can claim the charm so you better claim it right now with that i hope you guys enjoy the video i think i just need to pick one or two things and do that i should head to azeal as fast as possible wait a minute there's a flight recording oh wait this is that like story mission thing oh i should do that too well see focus on one thing oh i should do this i'll do that oh well what if i did this i'm ridiculous i think i can just go ahead and confidently say we're probably not going to place too well trying to find a flight recorder is it not up here is this it no those are credits where's the fire recorder oh what the we're super behind now so i'm going to grab his probably buy a ship shouldn't i yeah i'm already so far behind anyway wait where's the zeal oh i am blind jesus i was like guys i swear it says it's right here i guess i'll just do zeo and crystals i'm gonna save my money for 500 some 500 thing i don't know what yet but all right uh delivery for whoever the fudge has for this hide in your rascal i did it just keep holding the zeal and then i want to do uplink it's gonna be right there don't you dare make me drop my zeal you made me drop my seal what do you think you are okay ninth place let's get it okay that's going to come up in 20 seconds i guess i'll go do that oh it's good they're fighting hold on let me get the guy in the high ground because my money's on him never mind i'm the best i can kill this guy of enough money okay now hurry and buy this thing what up destroyed i'll go ahead and grab this i guess oh wait where's the uplink oh it's right there oh that's the next uplink oh i got you baited oh sweet jesus this again huh yo this smg is kind of nice with it i'm like kind of all about it if i'm being honest with you all oh i thought that was people always scaring the jesus out of me as soon as i take any sudden damage i'm like this is it this is how i die okay collect this uh upgrade that buy that buy that oh now i'm actually under attack by a hot stop prospector the fudge what up club what if you do win you are lost my friend he's like maybe he won't see me boy what you trying for oh you what mate you shouldn't have thank you yo this thing's sick uh what next i'm gonna go fight for that uplink okay they'll probably know i'm coming i'm not exactly subtle about it this guy's a little turret doing his dirty work not on my watch let me capture this and then i'm going to go kill him streaming from there knows i'm here what up dude i know exactly where you are oh someone else is shooting him did i get the kill i think i did i'm about to kill him let's join up like now i think the time for that has passed he also just realized that i am destroying him your turret will not save you my friend but there's still more available oh come here you're one shot i think he just jumped where did he go you coward i hear him hey come here yeah that's right get outta here see look i have the uplink i have the zeal just doing a little bit of everything you know what i'm saying the only problem is i have the zeal so they can know if i'm like gone but whatever we're triple tasking here baby i'm in third place as soon as i get that notification someone's taking my stuff it's game on baby let me get the grenade can i upgrade my gun not yet i still have the zeal like we're chilling man let me grab this real quick that's a lot of them what am i i'm in first place wait he wants the pact oh what up dude why you bullying me not today he cloaked but i see him i knocked him while he's cloaked he knew he couldn't take me i feel a little bad but oh my god that's funny dude i don't pack man and i'm thinking here like what do i have to gain i'm in first place right like why do i need to be teaming up because look if that's me i'm jumping the dude i ain't trying to packed that guy's weak i don't need weak people if i did lose that fight that would have been hilarious that would have been even funnier i just need to go get that uplink i have five minutes to extract okay make sure that i you know remember teaming in solos you disgust me it makes sense but you disgust me seems like someone has this uplink yep someone has a suplink hello oh he has the grenade launcher but unfortunately for him i have jetpacks i'll take this thank you very much that's fully upgraded let me upgrade that let me upgrade that i got the zeal i got the uplink i'm in first but by how much 20. it is kind of close is that some that is an enemy prospector the heck and he has no idea where i am spoilers i'm right on top of you and pistol whip wait where did he go oh oh my god i have to finish him off easy i'm gonna go to evac i'm in first by 45 points all right i'm not here with two minutes to spare oh and i hear somebody oh i see exactly where he is bye oh he had the omega zeal should i grab that oh yeah if i evacuate with it i get extra points all right screw it i'm making the run for it i'm in first i got the red seal what that's gonna be next active that's about right because that's as far as possible for me what if i immediately do the 1000 crystal we just got to go right over there i mean i hear some dude already fighting kind of want to go kill him but i won't get much for it oh oh oh oh miss shots oh mike wait wait have i ever done this poorly before he's just dipping well then in that case oh no thanks oh oh you still want to do this oh okay oh wait wait i can't tell if i'm gonna kill this dude oh all of a sudden things are looking real good let's go i think i properly asserted my dominance uh i guess i'll just do this though never really done this nearby power generator needs all nearby terminals to be activated i'm on it excuse me robots oh my god where'd they all come from i should just focus on crystals and i guess power stuff oh someone might be doing it gotcha oh but there's someone else i need to move no no actually what killed me i think i got killed by a spitter oh i think i did oh no it's a real person okay wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait stabilized let's do this oh my god get destroyed come on that was pretty good that was pretty good okay i almost have enough for a new gun and once i do i'm totally okay doing the 1000 i might just start it because i'm going to be getting um a lot from killing things yeah i'm going to do it wish me luck guys i need to get the uplink because whoever has that's probably gonna win but the next active is right next to me oh you gotta be kidding me i didn't actually mean to press pact has an automatic and can't hit me well now what are you doing what do you think you're doing get out of here man another one now i get my my good gun now no one stands a chance [Music] all right i just have to collect it oh i stopped it whoops don't touch me let's go i'm not now i'm gonna grab the uplink he's gotta be around here right i don't know maybe nobody has this because he didn't kill any of these look at this two for the price one capturing uplink and get some biomass oh i did get it i thought they destroyed it i was like you you little rascals do i still have the uplink we're in first oh we're tied though oh okay shoot game time baby focus up oh he's doing this little mineral extraction right here okay we received most of the data from this updating and i have the high ground soon it just finished oh you're perma dead two yikes sorry about it buddy we still got six minutes too we are making good time all right yeah so i'll do this power station after this oh wait never mind warden alpha i'm gonna cap this up link then i'm gonna go kill the warden alpha you kidding me sounds like a good way to die let's go wait i'm in second it's hot dang i don't know what that guy's doing but well played i could play it smarter and get more points but nah dude i'm going for warden alpha gotta be someone else doing it though you think right oh yeah actually i see the guy doing it well what if i just pay him a little visit okay bye there's the warden alpha what do you know wait where did it just go oh oh my god wow there's uh i see you got a couple minions with you jesus oh my god you're probably not even hard to kill just the fact i gotta go through your whole little posse oh oh ow oh my god he needed me this is a good spot oh yeah oh maybe not i miss my nate no but i'm almost done give me a second dude yeah well mao i killed him okay now i just run away from this dude there's another guy wait a second did he just go invisible or did i kill him i think he went invisible i could have escaped but the idea of pvp around here is too exciting oh i see the dude up there i'm chasing him screw it he shot at me bro he declared war yep there we go let me just finish him off real quick all right now who wants to fight me this guy okay well just remember you asked for it if you want to now yeah you regretting this decision yet there buddy should probably go extract huh i can even buy the grenade launcher though why not okay i'm ahead by 55. that seems pretty good okay actually i'm gonna get this last crystal because this should be enough no matter the size ah wait this might take too long maybe not if we get to a minute and it's not done then i'll back out okay 30 seconds uh i'm gonna be cutting it close i'll probably just buy another ship and just run on in there is anyone gonna do the evac chip though like what's going on there i know i know i'm cutting it a little close all right i got one minute i can do this all right let's go 30 seconds i gotta get there and place a banner get there place a banner yeah here we go now that's asserting dominance winning the game placing the banner thank you very much again to jager development for sponsoring this video remember to check the game out for yourself it's free to play and most importantly code is on the
