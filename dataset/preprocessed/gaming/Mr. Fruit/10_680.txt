hi 80 everyone my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to Calder tea modern warfare and whose spoilers duh my ass kiss that's right Damascus is finally unlocked my friends a little over five months later five days 19 hours and 29 minutes a thousand 53 games with the win-loss ratio of 112 and a KD ratio of 112 I persevered and overcame my friends now here is the exact moment I unlocked Damascus and was freed from the shackles of this stupid camel grind six months six months is stupid Damascus grind one more three kill spree now obviously the last video in a road to Damascus was a sniper rifle and we had a couple guns to go and and now you're like wait a minute now you have Damascus yeah I've been kind in so we're still gonna showcase those guns but now they'll have Damascus we're gonna be using the Keela we'll be using the monolithic suppressor Ranger for gram 60 round mag any FSS close quarter stock let this be known if a detrimental crayon eating thumb second poopoo people 5 IQ guy like myself can get Damascus you can do anything in your life that you set yourself to girl was it worth it to be like the pinnacle camel I'm not really sure but we have it so who cares best of all I get to use this in war zone now the past couple days I told myself I wasn't allowed to play war zone until I unlocked Damascus because well war zone kind of put a big old damper on the the camo grind as you can imagine with a quick trip we'll get out of my face what's going on here huh what do we think we're doing you know oh I'm not gonna have any of this hold my god all right well that's wittily a small army of people no thank you wait why the fudge do I have specialist on the heck oh well I took off specialist but my killstreaks are due to personal UAV UAV Christmas but that's because of my right shield grind oh that was the last thing we had to do and I got to tell you it was not easy it was not McCree Zee once everything was said and done the last thing that was required of me was a 13 kills third 13 3 kill sprees with the right shield oh my god it's even worse than you probably think it was think of how bad something could go pods are it was it was worse than that personal radar drone up in the a oh I'm trying to forget what these guys are doing are they up on the oil rig I get oh no he's right there what that alright there's a quick one no okay careful mr. fruit don't be too gung-ho with your bullets there oh how about we get my first nuke with Damascus I wouldn't say no would you say no I mean I'm being a little the dreams are a little lofty right now but you know like I said I got Damascus anything's possible I honestly feel thought there goes the the nuke dream we were so close just like nineteen more like God we were practically there guys I'll get this skewer yeah okay I don't know how I hit him I'll say what why do I have munitions box well might as well use it for now right thanks all right I'm gonna go ahead and say it but those of you who are still camo grinding if that's the case sweet summer child I feel for you I have been there so hear me now throw on FMJ on your weapons and here's something most people don't tell you shooting equipment and killstreaks counts towards every challenge if you are crouching and you shoot a trophy system that counts as a kill and a kill wall crouched and if you need kill sprees that counts as a kill towards your three kills Breana life don't ask why so I can shoot two dudes and a personal radar and that would count as a kill streak okay you just don't question it just accept it use that knowledge go forth and and prosper so you spotter use FMJ use whatever you need Oh mr. flute mr. foo I need to get up here real quick fight fight fight I tried to save the day but it couldn't get up it what are you doing over here oh yes how all right in the niccola hey get out of here don't don't no no don'tdon't ah ah [ __ ] there's a guy laying prone right over here just not me sorry knife ha ha now today second not do today what do we say to the god of death not today and my friends that was oh oh they respond check it ou debatable debatable debatable oh they see me oh hey see me oh they see me all right what is that falling damage or something dad heck I barely stubbed my toe what do you mean I gotta tell you though monkey off my back man it feels good it I've been working towards this so long I actually think though I have one of the fastest times to Damascus with playtime over just about five and a half days a play time norm way you see people 7 to 8 - sometimes nine days play time and if I had originally from the beginning of the game set out to only do Damascus it might even be shorter than that but I would equate that to just grinding smartly as optimally as possible which a lot of that meant you know like waiting for double xp periods and stuff bada-bing about a Booma about it being about a puma they're all dead I feel so relieved it just it just feels good man feels good clap I've been on proud of a lot of things I've done in my life but honestly the Damascus grind is one of them and that might sound sad and the kamo itself isn't exactly worth it but what I find okay whoops he's already dead but what I find to be so satisfying about it is the fact that I told myself I would do it it wasn't easy and I still did it the reason that Damascus grind seemed to come to a halt for a while there is one well war zone released and then - I gotta tell you like the last like six or so olds they just wore I mean like it the fatigue start to set in plus knowing that the last one was right field didn't exactly boost my morale like oh cool do all this to just have to do right shield but we did it and I'm proud of us and I say us because you were there throughout all of this you've been watching me slowly drive to madness over the past couple of months watching my videos supporting them telling me I could do it cheering me on asking me where the grind was keeping me accountable and my god we did it we did it this is as much of victory as Earth okay well let's calm down not like that much like you know I'm saying sure that's gonna say that looks good Bob I'm trying to tactically get my new fist game it's uh it's not working too well I mean I'm not like an eight kill spree so like I'm practically there I don't know why I'm so on about watch a desk pocket and now he knows are you don't ask how I always do that I don't know sometimes I my finger twitches I play my finger I forgot where the HQ was where did they disable it cuz that's where most of them will be good mount up oh that's the nice thing when I finished what was it the last gonna yeah the kilo here the last long shot though oh I was like I never have to grin long shots ever again these incredibly and actually well I'm thinking about it only SWAT mallow that's here I need to switch to DMR's and get kills with them every game because I still haven't grinded for crossbow I didn't do any back because I was too busy granted for Damascus but now I can do that get three kills with that twenty million games whatever and then after that swap two shotguns I think you have to do like ten games with seven kills shotguns to get the new shotgun I'm behind on that stuff and apparently some of the shotguns I've gotten some cool new attachments so I need to I need to move on in there you know what I'm saying because thank God I was worried about this at the beginning you don't need to do all the DLC weapons as well for Damascus thank god otherwise I'd be like literally impossible especially because it's like oh I'm close and then they would like release you know kind fudge I'm saying pot you're dead papi you're dead fudge it was close to dead I'm gonna get a ricochet with that knife no guess not okay pop my killstreaks there we go UAVs up in the airspace hey Stu this let's get some higher ground here fellas what do you say what do you say huh what do you say when I say it I am still somehow alive I really need to put on I mean I guess if I wanted to go for a new pie should have specialists on if I ever really wanted to do that I don't think I ever will only because of skill based matchmaking my play style and my lack of patience but now I guess I need to formally make a video about my thoughts on mana warfare I mean at this point I have I've played a lot and now that I have nothing else to grind for I have to think to myself I was that was a high kill spree I don't know how much but I mean we were getting there okay watch we're running out of time and I need two more kills this thing one more kill one more kill give me give me freaking kill oh hey we did it okay cool yeah it was easy look at look at this thing though whoo and it checked off can I get some can I get some light over here please oh yeah this thing oh the rocket launcher certainly looking real nice with it I know what was our kill streak was it did we hit 15 oh maybe I should have been playing a little more careful we actually were starting to get a little close there I to reload oh oh yes is dangerous this is a dangerous game we're playing fudge yeah but now the nice thing too is now I can just I can just play the game I can use whatever I want it's it's gonna be incredible oh jeez just run around hold on oh then let me use all this wait times about to run out drag out skirt oh oh ballsy mr. Furth oh they're capping it so the game's not over well then I guess let them cap it no no look at what you've done you're going to end the game curse you I get Damascus and then I pop oh my god just what I do wait wait a second wait a second I was at it was I 20 to kill streak before that game I think it was like 16 hold on I was actually like three kills off are you kidding me Wow oh my god mr. fruit I actually could have just I almost actually just first game Damascus got my first nuke as well what da thought oh you gotta be kidding me oh that's that's a heartbreaker oh that's ah oh I'm actually so sad right now to think what could have been okay well then you know what you know what everybody it's quiet fruit time cuz we're going trihard I have to do it I have to do it first game well I guess second game Damascus first nuke it's gonna happen okay so far so good I think staying up here is actually a little too dicey people can pretty easily see me up here but I think I'm gonna try for it anyway Oh yep they're trying to snipe me up here oh yeah okay well we got a seven kill spree yeah I might have to stay boots on the ground here I mean I don't think I'll actually anouk if I did that would be nothing short of insane let's be honest no see now I'm just getting hit by snipers everywhere I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying listen okay I'm just making this up as I go I just didn't think we'd I was me me but if I really did get a 20 to kill spree watch that's heartbreaking that's heartbreaking way to choke mr. fruit and some people might be only a 112 KT ratio this little to have what the fudge well one with skill based matchmaking I think it's pretty good and then secondly considering I haven't been able to play the game how I want to play the game vault like ever yeah I'd say that's pretty good this game is so weird we have cheese the entire enemy team is just sitting in corners holding lines of sights show I don't think the nukes possible this game corner campers breathing as heavily as possible yeah see watch I poke out for one Gale and there's some dude hardscoping adapt and overcome mr. fruit no excuses will you will you die thank you where's ein enemy hope design enemy is right below me noise got a real screw me that's an assist not cool let's go figure out where they spotted where are they spawning somewhere over by B there's wine all right well five kill spree we're practically there six and I'm done alright I think I need to give up on the new cream god I wish I was in the zone last game I wish I had a counter somewhere because if I'd known like oh wait I'm 22 mr. fruit shut up and sit in a corner or something you know I'm saying like who cares not today not today see problem is though that guy as a sniper and every time he's killed me I see him spawn and immediately look here with his sniper which is why I holding this rig here ain't exactly easy you know I'm saying seriously now I can just frag out though we can we can mess around with some loadouts - I haven't done that in a while make some weird zany builds or something I don't really know sky's the limit for us right now so feeling pretty good again unlock some of the weapons I haven't after this life I'm gonna swap to my MIDI mr fudge well guess I'm swapping to the d mark okay one keep count with me everybody we need two more fudge that's not a number two I know where I'm going three nice okay so we're done with oh we are done with the oh you want a snipe me boy all right a couple DMR kills down now it's just a lot more games of that honestly to grind those out I might just need to play like TDM those are usually the quickest games that way Matt just go fast bada bing bada boom I get the crossbow cuz I want to unlock some of the crossbow stuff maybe mean with it maybe use it in war zone or something I've always been able to use the explosive balls and something tells me I'll have more fun when I'm not using the explosive balls Oh game over I would say we chose a good time to pop off this however is now going to forever haunt me I'm just so happy we're here we did it and now we can just we can just play let me know what you guys want to see specifically I still need to cover the weapons we didn't cover with the weapons I got gold on but thank you very much for watching have yourselves a fantastic freakin day and I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
