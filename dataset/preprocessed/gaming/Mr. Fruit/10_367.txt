hi eddie hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to apex legends it's season eight and quite frankly i just wanted to play some apex you guys better like the video oh my god anyway it's a bunch of fun played with rob and then later on we invited his friend well i know the guy too i guess he's just not as good of a friend i don't know maybe would he call me a friend that would be nice but maybe he doesn't i don't know are we like that is it anyway his name is blake and he helps edit some of rob's videos but anyway i know him back from high school pretty cool guy we played some apex legends enjoy the video whoa there's some new thing now where in every circle there's a ring flare or if you get caught in it it hurts just as much as the death zone and then they swap every round or something okay and you can use a heat shield while in there to survive the damage but that's it that's all i know that's all you know and then there's obviously new skins of course i'm not kidding because apex has like the most insane kind of way they do their skins well they have a the free one the prize tracker is that all there is to the uptake do you imagine bro being like fifth grade and like the games you can like could choose from like warzone and apex to mention free to play games because back in my day i could only afford one game so like we're playing halo 3 or not that's it wait oh i guess this is the ring thing i don't know what that is oh wait here we go whatever okay um so we're just gonna go immediately into this and i feel like it's gonna hurt but let's see what happens oh yeah it hurts it hurts um how do i activate my thing quit [ __ ] pinging that i don't know what that means not pinging anything i asked you all this man and you said nothing and now all i am is a ping where are we going just nothing like you think i'm just thinking you're speaking vietnamese dude what what is your button for the heat shield thing oh equipped survival item heat shield what is
