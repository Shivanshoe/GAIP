hi ATO John moanings mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny - do you like my shoulder pads I'm pretty sure they're still glitched I'm gonna wear them for the memes they take up all you half the screen anyway another day another new Pinnacle weapon that has been out for a while but I never bothered to grind because the grind takes so long but for some reason I finally finished the grind what a mouthful that's right Reed Rix's broadsword is mine obviously not Regis weeks claymore because I didn't get it during the first season but we have the broadsword all the same but that was unaware what makes it special desperado reel in while outlaws active increases your rate of fire now I'm pretty sure this thing got nerfed a little bit not entirely sure I don't know I wait until all the good stuff is bad - then get them but screw it dude Here I am living my best life and I'm going weapons of light for the memes I haven't used the read Rick's since I've received it so let's see what I've been missing out on this entire time or what I haven't been missing out on I don't know boo boo boo alright check this out oh wait they already patched it no or maybe it only works with hand cannons or something oh that's so disappointing you guys missed it yeah these shoulder pad ornaments were just garbage the lower left and right corner we're just constantly surrounded by your shoulder pads and you like couldn't do anything enemy what the fudge is happening boy it don't work in the twilight zone dude I've died what I haven't seen anyone Oh ant and there he goes they claim Zone B but that's okay no it's not fine it's not find it all hold on hold on hold on I got into it I got let me check oh they did fix them oh that's truly tragic Oh desperado it oh wait now I have to reload without LA yeah well this is going terribly okay great yeah what is going on they have heavy machine gun ammo I think half my team is afk they have just about every single zone Bob I don't know oh I don't know what's happening we got a kill but that did not activate desperado because we don't have outlaw it's a very situational and I'm going to drop down before you can kill me sir hahaha I said no right go ahead and get suppressed oh that what the fudge is it's like a little corner on the wall of course I hit it now I kid get this map is not doing us any favors my friends and cannons are running rampant I tell you the team shot is real I repeat although I had an explosion killed Hank it's probably some sort of a misadventure but unfortunately again not an outlaw kill Shaw pretty useless for us okay what oh my god like the last shot of that burst classic what screaming yeah the last kick if the last thing wasn't a headshot so we don't get outlaw alright well maybe one of these days we'll get desperado desperado - perfetto coincidence I think now they both start with dis what does it mean desperado I wish I could get that perk but I can't hand I'm a simple man with a row I tried so hard to hit his head bro and I still couldn't get suppressed god I can't suppress anyone either I'm just trying to suppress your frayed up dude well 3v5 what am i what am i playing right now is this what is even going on fun and interactive Oh more heavy my favorite hello-o jebaited is dead shot out of the air like the degenerate he is my main man after my own heart come on try me come on show me your moves makes me want to play smash but then I remember I suck and then I don't want to play smash I go online to play smash I'm like all right I can't I'm not that bad right and then it's like no way yes I am screw douche ok weapons alight here Bob try to figure out how we're gonna oh oh my god okay we can - tap here and we have desperado active guy oh my golly it's rate of fire with weapons of light get destroyed G G okay another kill huh dad weapons a light go what other or two of them well that bubble was fun also why haven't we been mercied yet my teammates just keep quitting there's no point dude if I first some little divot in a wall now a little step up brah these grenades are so sensitive am i getting sniped are you sniping can't tell my teammates right oh this part is active I'm just letting it rip because I never get desperado oh this is so fun all this ends that is gone and I'm gassy let me just embarrass a couple that was a headshot this is the saddest excuse of a match of crucible I've had in a while I'm not sure anyone on my team is still here from the beginning of the game we never had a full team to start we've just been triple cap this whole time they refuse to give us a mercy it's like wood what's the point is this really is fantasy leave ass dude actually we might be the only ones that have stuck around and it's the others that just keep rotating in and out at this point if you join the game late god how many times am I gonna die too heavy it's 35 to 1 33 why is this not up mercy sorry I didn't mean to raise my voice inside voice mr. fruit sorry apologies apologies mm-hmm we outgunned and heavy machine gun god I can't even use desperado I get it and then I try and shoot that didn't I die can't even exist in this world oh thank God I somehow had an even efficiency sure best not to question these things my dear we're actually hopping into breakthrough I've never played this game up before so screw it but I gotta get my for weekly rotation playlists for it's not in pinnacle gear so actually I don't know the point are you looking with shaders buddy oh okay we're going black on black the menagerie is a sick player activity that is now completely irrelevant okay so what am i doing unlocking mmm yes do we have Reza's um do we not I do know that this maps a we're a little bit better than Twilight gap though go a little bit more range and I'm going in for that crispy I regret the flank I regret the flake is a regret you're so brave with your my brother's ambition how do you do it wait a minute we've got to crack the safe for the vault or whatever the fudge this thing is unsure oh but I do know that the range is not eating this one Israel they probably think I'm cheating and I think I am to the desperado oh wait a minute I have a sniper that makes a lot more sense but it don't matter we don't need it all right I'm deploying but I'm trying to bro I was trying to deploy a barricade for us he kept pushing me you pushing right in the sniper breath come on now guys we we have you have to sit on it in order for it to deploy yes jelly cases um duh dum da da da Dada oh if more of us are on it I assume it goes faster so let's try and do that huh I missed oh we got the kill though and okay so what's gonna happen I want to watch this okay now where'd it go huh what's happening oh we're break Oh a breakthrough ah very clever I see what oh so this is what early like like battlefields rush almost except it's its first neutral there's no attacking or defending but then whoever gets the point then moves on and gets suppressed hopefully thank ya give me over shield oh oh wait big brain if I can just get my super I can just throw it on the on the vault well you bet things like that bright light okay we didn't get a point though I'm gonna be pretty upset if you have to get both to get a point and if they just defend once they get a point cuz that's it's really stupid actually yeah this is very similar to paladins as well where they have a neutral objective and then whoever wins that ass like push a cart kind of similar idea starts neutral moves on to not neutral he's gonna ah guys are burning team there goes all the progress rip we only have one minute and I don't think I'm gonna get my super I need to get some sniping kills so I can get enhanced sniper energy what whatever I have that perk that turns it into like super energy so as long as I can what didn't what am I getting hit by wow this grenade got to get an easy peasy snake what what what she at least with paladins you get the first one like you get a point and then if they defend the other team gets a point but it seems like half the incentive here might be don't cap because it'll be easier to defend I'm not entirely sure but I won't let them do anything team yo that is a wide-open spawn but we got it we just had to wipe them and then I just had to watch a spawn let's go holy cow yeah that's one round my god okay so that's gonna be something all right yeah this game Oh takes forever that's fine or actually it might not if we just win really quick I have my super now though they do have fists though and his fists probably beat my ward of dawn okay that's debatable okay I don't have that kind of range I mean that's it's deceivingly far let me say that it doesn't seem that far oh this meant going in with the orbs okay so let me uh let's just help my actually I don't even need to help myself out because this unbroken son of a gun is out there distracting the enemy team we're deploying and we're about to break through Guardian I got a kill Oh desperado active where I'm going in I'm going it cover me oh I actually got the kill nice alright let me show you how it's done team first off Bank it off the back wall and I didn't suppress that Hank here I go ready check me out skirt screws yeah try me now plebs try me now they even had somebody quit that's right I'm cracking the code I'm hacking another mainframe oh shoot hold on hold on maybe I have time maybe I have time oh fudge I'm hacking okay and I've wait hold on hurry up indeed done all right I have the email ready this time oh but it's match point oh I thought it was first a four okay that's not as bad I don't have a super anymore though let me just go and bear some kids here I'll quick check this out using Icarus ah we missed sick okay I am well quite frankly team I'm in trouble not gonna try and sugarcoat this let me do what I do and actually play the objective in this game mode I've already played more objective than I have in the past like year of FPS is a strange but oh nice oh yeah blip rip was close it was close but not close enough we it you're almost done bro I'm going in I'm going out wait team shot him okay I have no idea what he was attempting to do but it certainly worked out in our favor I'll tell you that much nope wait there's someone behind me hello guys they're deploying the thing they're actually playing the objective guys go stop them get them off get guys focus on the people in the don't I got to be a hero I have to be the hero they got the vault there are a couple of vault hunters and I just have to get eight bro what the f··k okay we were supposed to win but now we've actually almost lost the the the the point the point can we can we stop the point yeah I guess not that's just unlock errs we let them get wonderful sense of hope and security in these trying times not many people have much to hang on to and we're giving them something to hang on to bro I'm the worst I understand I guess we're on the breaker though so good job you guys and there's a heavy machine gun in here but did you not oh okay okay you did did you not create any orbs though I'm looking for orbs okay sorry I'll come help the vault well I thought the dude with dark bolt would do something more get off of it you son of a you're wily coyote god I just raids all the time okay start deploying I'll cover you we've got the gob lifts up there mister fruit up here gobbles is dead unfortunately but all good things must come to an end I'm afraid okay he's dead you guys are making this a little too easy for me okay well he's dead oh I had to reload that's not good oh but it is because he was just trying to hate me your suppressed okay and you're dead just got to keep it going just got to keep it going I swear some of the shots of the birds just like don't register bro are we really third-person email peaking in this game mode is this really happening right now okay desperado active if I can just if I can just start your dad a whole desperado is in full effect my friends guys I have water I have killed everyone okay screw it I'm gonna do what I have to do couple okay they're probably oh they already did pop hammers is that gonna burst my bubble okay well once dead I'm hacking Oh a blade for Raj oh my god two supers we're still alive baby hey hey hey hey I tried to oh my god my bubble took everything and yet somehow we still haven't captain I wiped the whole team sat there took every super and somehow my team all died and wasn't there for any of it classic get suppressed Holy's sniper Batman eh is that grenade gonna hurt me I can't tell he's trying to break it but I'm hacking oh we got it alright hit him with the BM mm right here so if we I simply just thought mm-hmm click that button and come over right here and that should be game over well that I'd say the broadsword is pretty fun not too shabby I mean it's like decent until you get desperado and then it's like oh okay it's game time and it also took me over a year to freakin finish this so I better like it too with that said thank you very much for watching happy Hills fantastic then I'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] [Music]
