and ready to go this is whoa whoa mr fruit jumping in here because it was just literally a second view from the last cut but it's uh the next morning for me because as it just so happens when i record this last time the game audio didn't record so anyway today we're playing super meat boy forever and it's a shame you didn't see last time because we went through a whole area i beat two bosses it was sick so instead you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna speed run for you i'm gonna show you just how elite i am at super meat boy which if you didn't know super meat whatever it is equal to the house um earlier everybody is a challenging platforming publisher and you play a little blob meet that's yeah there's the story i also unlocked um this new guy called prototype boy so we're gonna play him while i absolutely speedrun this look they're gonna try and tell me the tutorial area as if i need to know any of this i don't spoilers okay yeah now it's honestly it's just a little bit insulting i guess i could have done all the other ones but whatever yeah i know how to do that it's fine but keep scrolling you keep moving and i'm gonna set a new look at that precision on this man nailed it oh my god yeah see easiest level of my life next oh god he just hadouken my kid i guess i'm supposed to just die okay that's not ideal there we go yeah yeah yeah yeah okay go prototype boy oh no you don't we go back we go down okay oh i was looking at the time why am i looking at the time what is the time going to show me oh i'm racing this thing and somehow that worked okay not today it's good it's oh no we're only halfway got a little ahead of my a little ahead of myself there okay hold yeah yeah yeah didn't see me figuring that one out did you can i go okay now don't be deceived this might look a little easy but oh believe what is going on my screen i'm so distracted it appears to be a part of the game it's not broken okay hold i held for as long as i could do i do i not hold i don't get it okay well don't do that i'm about to lose it but it's okay what am i supposed to be doing right now [Music] okay i don't know if i was supposed to do it that way okay guess i'm not supposed to go that way supposed to not really do that but we'll take it what am i oh i see what i'm doing skirt oh very technical oh my and then i make something like that look effortless yeah that makes sense yeah real great going there mr fruit dingus ah wait a second what oh i see i see ice okay hold on there we go very true okay this is fine just go under stop jumping stop jumping under i make this game so much harder for myself i swear to god what in the dickens is going on here oh okay all right made that one look easy because it was there we go this is optimal oh my god oh okay that just kind of went well that one didn't that one didn't time time diamond timing timing timing i did not tell you to jump that way sir i said ride the wall and what did you do you ran right into the death blade dude look at they just have my meat all over them i know how that sounds i don't want to talk about it there we go okay of course there's another one they're the the devil but i made it i'm almost there i can feel it oh it's testing me it's testing me oh my god oh that one kind of looks sick oh see and then it's just like somehow i just do that and now i save my oh another home run okay boss level great great this one goes so well here's the problem with this one my thumb hurts pressing this button the a button so much doesn't read my inputs i swear to god long story short this big thing comes and and destroys the forest literally i'm not kidding i'm pressing it from before and my thumb is wood it hurts it's sore i'm not kidding so you just gotta whack quack quack quack quack which without getting smash smash smash smash smash okay destroyed that one and complete oh yeah yeah yeah love this okay too greedy too greedy on the hits there we go okay i definitely [Music] there we go there we go now i gotta get the bottom one there we go ah whatever i'm playing lefty dude this is embarrassing for them i'm a righty guy and stupid there we go i punched yeah okay you're stupid 12 seconds later oh my god wait a second i'm kind of cracked with this right now wait that was kind of a nuts maneuver come on shouldn't have been that hard i've already beaten this one in a long story short this comes along we escape but then the squirrels are pissed that we destroyed their home next one please oh my god my thumbs my fingers my everything hurts so much pain my wrists you have to get air okay anyway like i said i know what i'm doing oh whoa what oh it was looking good for a second there bob and then it stopped looking good easy okay okay it's looking pretty dece don't go that way okay easy clap keep it going must look i can't know what i'm doing yeah oh read the needle there's my kid great either way really you didn't need to flip me officer a little rude if i'm being honest with you oh this is fun okay great great that's great that's just so great okay all right i'm in it i made it oh my god i could absolutely destroy oh okay i remember this one this one's real fun yeah real fun it you have to time it with these stupid blades oh my god wait a second what are you saying oh my god okay wow i did a lot faster than i did last time which is kind of sad because that wasn't exactly good but it's not the point oh we looking nice with it all right just completely missed that that's embarrassing i did it again fixed okay this one is actually tough the timing on this is very precise prepare yourselves for fruit rage oh my god wow i cannot tell you how many times i wiped on my last time i'm improving oh my god it's boss okay this one is fun fun fun fun [ __ ] [ __ ] it's it's bad because there's something i enjoy about the pain but you see i already know what i'm doing here ain't nothing new now the worst part is okay i can't get too greedy with damage i could have probably gotten a little bit more realistically i'm being honest but avoid all these used needles that did not hit me what kind of a hitbox is that what is that jiggly's fair and melee like hello you guys know what i'm tired come on whack a doodle okay that's good damage i think okay this it's literally the same thing every time but literally after like one cycle i just i can't do anymore i my body just gives up come on screw you okay all right second cycle just one more this one more that come on speed running indeed holy heckers well i mean it wasn't the best yeah look you're dead dude look nobody cares bro i don't care but my controller stopped working perfect i do have the third world app depending on how this video does and if you guys want to see more i'm happy to torture myself a little bit more um but a second video won't be as painful as long as my you
