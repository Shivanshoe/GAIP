[Music] um oh [Music] it killed me oh r3l any rezzes uh a middle attack mill attack he's coming for me i gotta go oh i'm here and there's a lot of mesh dps let's go boys super rocket whatever you got come on boys come on hi do you hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video i'm happy to share with you guys one of the most satisfying things frankly you can do in any video game but before we get to that i want to thank bungie for sponsoring today's video destiny 2 the witch queen expansion is out right now and with it being out for some time i have to say it's probably my favorite expansion almost exclusively because of the brand new legendary campaign the campaign as a whole is easily the best destiny has had but on top of that they've added a legendary mode it's obviously more difficult and one of the reasons is because you can't be higher level than the legendary campaign regardless of your light level what this does is make every mission so much more interesting best of all too you might be worried perhaps you play solo or just with one friend you can't get a whole fire team it actually scales depending on how large your fire team is on top of that beating it gives you one of the brand new exotics for your class that you played from the expansion 1520 power level gear which is 20 above the soft cap and if you haven't played in a little while a brand new player whatever it might be everyone is automatically brought up to 1350 power level which means you're on equal footing you don't have to do any grinding you can hop right into the legendary campaign and if you haven't kept up with the story or want to know more about it in a narrative then you can check out the witch queen interactive trailer vanguard report there'll be a link in the description for that myself blue and rob played through the legendary campaign together and i'm honestly so glad we did it was so much fun i think it's a great introduction to harder content that destiny 2 has to offer so if you're unfamiliar with those stuff i think this is a great entry point and beating this kind of content there's just that euphoria at the end of it which is why i wanted to show us beating the brand new vow the disciple raid during contest mode for those unaware contest mode is the day one modifier the raid has and the gist of it is it makes it much much harder so after 22 hours of in-game time in this raid we beat it there was every emotion this way and that and it all culminates to that final boss kill and that moment that moment of victory unmatched you can get a taste of this with the legendary campaign so be sure to check out the description box below to go get destiny 2 witch queen for yourself and feel free to tag me on twitter
