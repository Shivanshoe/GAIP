start a new game in our beginning there was the grove timeless supernatural and sentient it is the foundation of our home and the source of our existence a tree so large and overflowing with manna it spilled over populating its foundation with our peoples that time has ended and the grove is now silent ugh malevolent oozing rod has seeped in seeking be to separate us from our greatest protector oh such a cute frog mini heated the raj challenge rally in the grove to a time of bravery and action each guardian ayo exploring a new horizon of life's many possibilities more stepped up for the community for the first time we truly grew to most it was their first time fighting the meek forged their spirits in combat when the island grew weaker their desperation in hubris spelled demise for all but to the heroes of our world forever lost chasing the final horizon beyond our island the grove ever mourning wants for a new guardian to lead them in a new age of turmoil fate focuses on concorde the youngest of spring hamlet a quiet gardener a few words and fewer aspirations wow that sounds like me i feel like i'm getting called out what the fudge oh he's adorable what oh fudge my

where's the 112 um found it all right that's where we have to go we must explore the 112 head to the wood forge and the hamlet should really just read just so easily distracted oh hello cutie see how does this work we're all fruit but now there's a frog whoa concord getting bored of watering plants all day never too late to join this and the rest of the hamlet if you ask me we have enough green

farewell all right i think that was poetic what my new home yo this place is great free health care free housing what's a lovely place indeed it's rather spacious don't get too excited this place was a total dump before we got set up but i'm sure it's still way fancier than the shack in the kindergarten it is it's not a home without a pillow leaf to sleep on of course yellow kid that's kind of sound comfortable a pillow leaf okay okay three requests it looks like it's gonna rain i hope so oh i love rain rain rain don't go away morning already up and out egg concord yeah i slept for like 20 hours because i was up for like an hour apparently you're looking chipper hope your new home is holding up it was pretty nasty no i no trust me i know you you've radiated that plenty thank you the truth is that the hamlet story needs all the helping yet but now you're not cooped up in the kindergarten so we can make you see here lucky for you today i'll be september [Music] well i'm still waking up rana all right if you're working the hamlet you want to keep your eye on this board here the villagers have put up a few requests and it's now your job to help them where you can people always need a few things done here and there i see i see so you guys did me a favor [Music] but now i'm forever indebted to you and have to repay okay requests root of the problem fitted roots have grown into bell row cut them down the bridge from spring hamlet to the riverway has deactivated you can get there from the bin to reactivate it granny smith has to resharpen the garbage tools and ask you for glass shirts from the beach how do you eat an elephant by not going that way one by the time so one question at a time oh the roots die die yeah i need to restore my stamina die die you foul rotted demon yeah yeah uh whack whack oh i see i was just gonna whack it forever ha ha you're welcome oh nice bridge up request on nothing like the smell of rivers in the morning i'm going to kill them not because i have to but to send a message ain't no rot welcome around here well and free cash i guess ah the hamlet center of trade the docks have been better days but a lot still happens here once you've gathered all the glass you need put it in this bin here got to put them in the label bin since things kind of get lost in the village storage aye aye captain where be thy glass oh that's a giant bottle what the fudge oh wow what a what a bargain just like that we're done forget about it this request is in the bag we do good work together concord too bad it's still work you mind taking this last one concord attended to the kindergarten as a pacifist your entire life must have been hard i bet you're just itching to bring the pain well i won't stop you these rot roots we need to clear out can be a little tricky though which is why i got you shield that because i'm very helpful in general some of the route dispersed these near-hd sports that seek out innocent bystanders like us you can't just smack these things down which totally sucks but any shield in the grove will prevent the spores from touching you papa no you don't ha ha blocked stupid hit me tongue oh my god i'm the greatest little grape to do it man that's a toffee while you're still here so i guess it counts all the quests are done i'm still beat so i'm gonna take a hike back you're just leaving me here i mean i'm just i'm busy you can't expect me to babysit you for the rest of my life yeah fine i give in but only because i'm extremely kind i'll help you out more just don't expect me to overwork myself for you but for real i'm heading out i think you can take care of yourself i'm on the road again just can't wait to get on the road again i go bring hamlet status oh i leveled up i leveled up oh more places to gather rock grows feisty more upgrades in the local tool shop and more products in the local tavern and trader oh i'm down upgrading stuff oh boy and so a new one joins us on the greater plain of events welcome young sprout within you i sense many things juvenile doubt lounging dreams or longing dreams of a future fraught with possibility and danger the very same things that molded the other guardians in time you could be the champion i shake for now i pray for your success and things to come and safety you just realize my whole face game is covering the freaking [Music] backpack backpack backpack yeah here we go we'll just go in the middle [Music] hey good looking hey hi how are you oh you know just good looking yeah i can see that all right saved i'm back dude you there can't be two of us you gotta go geez this guy ah anyway plum originally called the spores you need to grow lily's within the library's depths we call it the stacks a large collection of unreadable works worn from time and use you'll need to venture below to obtain the spores we need be careful the same route that's in the library will walk you in you'll probably want to use the shield that we're on and give you you'll need protection down there whatever calls the route down there will not be used to get past dungeons yup oh spooky very spooky where do i go what's this thing a puzzle oh come on i'm so big brain all right i'll need to turn all these on i guess but it's not working yet we may have to use the stairs first uh i see i see duh who could not have figured that out not me [Music] whoa just got here man calm down ah bruh ah dude leave me alone ones are the biggest problems man so chaotic come here ah fudge come here yeah i see they did the little triple double frickin what the you have a nice day sir oh oh whoa what a boss oh fudge um i'm not ready for this oh didn't want it she's mcqueen am i supposed to be able to attack him when do i hit him ah yeah oh i guess i guess now ow in one shot this is fine oh okay all right wasn't ready for that sag we're good to go i'm gonna beat it this time i swear bring it on stupid i know what to do now just avoid the damage okay not a lot of damage but you know we haven't taken damage either okay i'm not allowed to get much damage in apparently but i've been poisoned yellow gumball's the wall oh maybe a little too ballsy there okay not my best but we got more damage then but i took two damage was it worth debatable hold oh you got what i was gonna say that didn't kill let's go i didn't realize i was one health whoops that's how you do it with some healing in the center of the lilies it's a small clump of fully matured spores these will be ample for lily propagation what can i say thank you very
