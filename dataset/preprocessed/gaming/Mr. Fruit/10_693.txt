every 10 episodes oh okay okay you just you just thrown that on us yeah yeah what the heck enjoyed the podcast and today's episode episode 30 the GG podcast yeah where I do not know we're all the way up at 30 we're ready to hit that primo midlife crisis but we're still going despite the Harambee going on if you didn't see last episode you're gonna be confused but watch the last episode yeah and leave a review we've debated renaming the harambe epidemic to either League ma what's like night month it was pretty good I thought that was pretty good though fortnight is good everyone's warranty nning themselves from fortnight you know I'm saying yeah I get that it's a spicy meat it's like you'll make people may like take it too literal and forget that I love exactly let's just keep looking what's good for now look nuts get them out well today is a special episode I think we talked about this recently didn't we I feel like uh yeah that we no I don't think so did we not I don't know we talked about deprivation tanks and a bunch of other stupid stuff but I feel like we've talked about wanting to do this or I talked about it off podcast I don't really know either way today is the live caller episode so we're gonna be having people from fruit new song coming in here we've got a bear and gark and shark thank you very much for your service they're helping vet some people while we're currently talking they have betted them for questions and stuff so we'll pull from the group they vetted pull them in here they have a question or a topic or something they want to briefly talk about we'll talk about that and thank them for their time go to the next guest so we'll be getting through a whole bunch of different stuff today it'll be pretty interesting all I know is I'm gonna be real disappointed if somebody doesn't go hey longtime listener first-time caller so I wanted to ask if somebody doesn't do that no stoppage of that I will bet you it nobody does that it's gotta be somebody out there that know your cuz now you're gonna mess somebody if we make a bet and that they are probably yeah like let's do this so we're gonna be hopping into that soon but first I know we remembered pretty soon the review I think one blue west slow song has a review ready for us yes I do oh you're gonna like this mr. fruit from Brandon hi brain hey guys hi long time viewer short time listener did not say that I have loved this group of misfits since day one or d1 for those old folks out there in the midst of all the craziness out there I'm glad I have y'all to bring joy back into the community there's not a podcast that goes by without me laughing really hard and I'm glad I took the time to listen post cast I know this is controversial first-ever 10 star rated review of your time well we're up somebody thinks we're up to ten okay we needed that we really did yeah reviews have been little shaky right now well I mean we've been all kind of all over the place I mean right now our stocks are hand in hand with the the Dow right now so it's not doing well I mean we represent the Dow you know we represent so much stake in this contract we have to be actually number one yeah we're the only thing keeping it together is everyone is awesome yeah you're welcome people of the world don't sell our songs bye bye bye bye bye please it's getting hot hot hot and then always keep buying and then I'll sell but no one else can we can only sell as how way if you're a congressman you could sell hey a very topical I like it so I guess for the most part we should just go ahead and hop into it because most of what we're gonna be yeah most of what we're gonna be talking about is gonna be decided by our listeners now to all those people out there that think they're gonna get the better of us right to touch Utah I hope they do the skin so I control we're not doing this live purposefully we're recording it so that if some troll does come in here we're just editing that so don't be that guy it's pretty gay yeah don't be that guy you're like a firewall and then a firewall although I mean it's not like at the hardest to get passage but oh yeah I wanted to ask about the lien trinsic nature of life and you get in here like boner boner boner like ah right yeah funny guy huh but let's go ahead and start technically this is the first one a bear and then bedded I will probably be pulling in the first one a bare ass that we're not waiting or they're not waiting forever at least this first person hopefully we can get through everybody but I mean a lot of people out there that have something that they want to talk about so you let him know wrong yes they are they are well informed they are ready to go okay well then first up McBrayer hi welcome to the GG overeasy podcast welcome first first caller ever had firs call hey thank you I don't know president it's an honor should I go ask the question or like a yeah okay all right so I was thinking all right so let's say we have the dream team right and yes you guys get to pick which person's gonna be President what would their first like act like official presidential thing be so I'm the president no you choose like the pretty well suitable yeah okay I would choose Dwayne the rock Johnson and everybody has to do to have to do his work out for at least an hour to have the two hours a day and that is enforced by the police and the middle end of the National Guard and if you do not do that then you don't get swole well that would be mine pretty hard pretty pretty critical but I think it'd be sweet cuz then think about it dude we would be a country of walking Dwayne the rock Johnson's everybody okay so and and women children everybody can be Dwayne that's his slogan so like if you don't do this you just get like absolutely destroyed wherever you well yeah when people take your lunch money you know why cuz you're not following the president's orders of gettin swoll don't shoot you out to space you'll just you'll just faintly start to hear smell that smell what The Rock school garden and then yeah he's gonna snap your neck when your teacher asks you like hey what do you think about this and then you start to answer then your teacher he goes it doesn't matter what you think people just interrupting you and saying it doesn't matter what you think that's the punishment no jail time but you get interrupted by that I would I would vote in nathan fillion Oh God and his first act would be to bring back fire fight still with this whole fire or really stuck on this or they go ahead and move ahead and finally make it Nathan Drake with the movie okay this has nothing to do with cayde-6 though no no okay I thought this was more of a desk he was way better as buck in Halo 3 ODST fight me okay thank you blue who would who would you vote in I'm gonna pick dad oh oh you know you know dad was a smart man he knows what he's doing and if we were to pick dad oh he would bring Hawkman back to D - yeah no he will yeah sharp rock would you bring it back buddy oh are you trying to do reverse psychology on the play no dad would literally bring a bag and that's what now me I think it would be like that I think would be the equivalent of like school president that'd be like I'm gonna get a water fountain out for recess and everybody said yeah they don't have that power and they don't want to did you get elected then like I never said that what does that look like student council or whatever I don't remember and I remember I got second though behind somebody that said I'm gonna get a water found out in the recess I was like guys he can't do that this is fourth grade yeah how is your time after reading yeah so I'm still upset about it but anything else but brawl Stein oh yeah okay so I have a question for you guys do you have you ever heard of like the whole like a Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon Wizard of Oz conspiracy is that like the one where like if you start like the movies at the same time like this ah yeah yeah I have seen that well no I've heard of it in the sense that like I've like I haven't like I actually done it but I've seen like the first part where it's like money is like the song I think it's called yeah yeah that's that's the only point I've ever gotten - yeah where she opens the door and it goes new color rides go yeah that's where like the only part where like I've really actually seen it and believe it but I haven't gotten any farther put any more into like looking into that but it's super in my dad loves Pink Floyd so I hear he's in touch all the time has he like watched it or like just my fan he's just a Pink Floyd fan like he's I don't think he's ever seen Wizard of Oz maybe he has no idea there are there specific conspiracy theory behind it like they yeah I made it or something Porter's yeah yeah that was a theory there's this whole debate over like whether they made it like intentionally to line up because there's all this weird stuff like the synchronization with the dancers and like the beats and some of the songs is like exactly on point and so it got to the point where I think they asked the band about it and they just messed around and didn't actually answer so it's just up to debate if people think it's real or not I mean it'd be fair if somebody thought I was in a conspiracy theory I'd totally pretend to entertain the idea like even though it's like totally a coincidence yeah like you're in Illuminati I was like well I'm not saying yet but all gods say you know confirmed through confirmed well yeah you just confirmed or did you just shot buddy you're done no no yep I'm about to get snapped by the rock I know I think it's if I had to like have a opinion on the fear I think it's just coincidence I don't I mean I don't know now that I think about it cuz you're right that songs and dances are pretty and then like if it does make sense to go with a movie like that because like it's a successful movie and has a good kind of like feeling to the story and stuff so you could like try and portray that in your album and try and like give off the same kind of feeling and stuff so maybe eyes I think like the UM oh yeah so the artwork you know it's a single beam of light going into the triangle and there's like five colors coming out yeah I think I think that was supposed to be a representative of like how the movie starts in black and white and then goes to color I never thought about that I'll buy into it sure I'm in he's in he's in I think it's like on YouTube it's an interesting watch well I will look into that thank you very much Mick broster for your questions and your time thanks for listening except one more question shoot okay can I be the first person on it's like the first I guess start to just say this besito yes all right get him out of you my desk by Steve done okay why does he of all the things I was like he says oh yeah he's like he's gonna say it Josh Chavez 29 I don't know if I said that welcome what's up Josh hello how's it going good how are you man I'm great I'm great thanks for asking what um what would you like to ask or talk about today um I'm uh I'm a physics major and so I wanted to get you guys opinion on J gravity gets a good advice I think the hoax things out can be bothered with the guy never and just in text books everywhere never yeah if you guys think we'll ever get ax to a multiplanetary species or anything so uh we talked about it a little bit in the alien pot like why I think we're so far away from that sadly I think when we're like older like in our 80s and 90s will maybe start getting to Mars and stuff like that hopefully think we'll ever see it to be honest you know it'll be in our lifetime no I don't think we're gonna see it in multiple lifetimes unless et just phoned home and he's like yo what up yeah let me take you to this other planet real quick and yeah something like et hits him up like yo my parents are gone come over like sick I'm on the way but I wasn't like Christian and blue set it to the alien podcast like if there have been aliens I think they look at us and just go like we don't need to talk to these idiots like yeah like they're just too advanced and stuff like that yeah it's just like would be a waste of their time so like they kind of just different we yeah we're not the good League the bad yeah but I just sorry um I do think that humans will need to be multi planetary race if we want to survive past like a couple hundred thousand years because I think we will use up everything on earth and I think we're getting to the point where like hundreds of thousands of views of the future well I'm a lot of time like hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands but I don't think we're gonna last hundreds of thousands of years if we don't yeah and humanity has not been particularly good at that Oh to be fair this whole Kuro I I decide named it lignin now jobs like this this whole league matthäus changed a lot of things pretty quickly so may I mean it sure does maybe we're Paula it's Kate we're capable of it but uh I don't I don't see us uh yeah but then I look at Clearwater Beach and I go oh right this is what's the what's the max like you think we get to through space in our lifetime like do you think we see colonization on Mars in our lifetime no no no no not at all time I think ya know yeah I think it'll be years and years from now on I mean it logistically how long do you have to be in Mont like in space to get to Mars like it's like as it years there's a month yeah years oh yeah I I can see having small experimental you know attempts at colonization but it would be very limited I could see that in our lifetime yeah but I don't see actual full-on like apply to live on Mars I don't see that for a long long time I mean is Mars if I'm getting older though sure I'm hopping over I would take it I mean if I got the chance to I was setting up to Mars and it's just a one-way ticket I would take it not even know yeah she can live this is really hard Josh good for you for being a big brain and no I'm pretty [ __ ] stupid I can't yeah study and read as much as I can as far as I can yeah my favorite formula is a squared plus B squared equals C squared so what are your thoughts Josh on either multi-planet species or as such um I think we have to get there eventually because in millions years or a hundred thousand years the Sun will eventually grow big and consume earth and things like that so if we want to continue to live as a human species we're gonna eventually have to move on and get there but I don't think it'll be any time soon not not a lot of times or kids or anything like that would we say like explore like like are the gallic guys we're not just talking about like going to Venus or going to Pluto like we're actually talking like we have to find people on planets or intelligent life no need to find something like a planet habitable for life okay yeah well the one problem I mean in regards to what Josh were saying with like if our Sun goes supernova will need a different place to live like outside of our planetary solar system yeah somewhere that the Milky Way that's the closest galaxy though isn't it or were in that dark out yes the big problem with that is like we have to if we're gonna really truly do it we have to figure out how to go Lightspeed which yeah that is right now is reading I don't think I'll never see that if I do not sick that's physically several generations if not more that's literally like fine unless we find exceptions to the rules of physics I mean or some sort of resource or something we don't have heard yeah they were looking at a ship it's like it's like a beam almost and it's to push like space and time through it like it's not actually have a propeller because like we have no fuel or jet engines that can go the speed of light because it's just kind of impossible so they're looking at building something to push space and time through it to go this beautiful so the thing to say stationary and space yeah yeah yeah just kind of flows through it that's interesting yeah well this be light is 299 to wait 299,792,458 miles per second yeah it's ridiculously if you're going that fast dude you're in like you have to figure out something that is can go that fast without getting crushed by the pressure like by going those feet yeah yeah and we have they want to send like little solar sails out there and they're real thin material but going at the speed of light would send even dust particles out of space would crush right through it because they're moving so fast little dust particles just oh yeah well that was always the the thing that kind of hurts the thing about like if you're growing life space how are you going to guarantee that your path has no obstructions in it or planets or anything like that yeah otherwise he just kind of it's not just like sorrow in a couple seconds yeah that would be nice if they can do what do you know it so I don't know hopefully cuz we're humans gotta get the writer of that over here get him to help us out well any other questions or Josh um no just the only other thing that I want to talk about it's completely away from my thing is you guys is I know you guys kind of suffer with some depression thing anxiety like that just some help for inspirational words for people to get through depression I well I think I think the most important for me I think the most important thing for me to was learning that like asking for help like isn't like a weakness like if anything like that's like shows your strength that you understand that you have something that you want to tackle and something you want to try and live with and something you try and get by with and so I think like going in knowing you can ask for help without being like judged or anything I think is definitely something that helped me with my depression thank you yeah I would say same thing one is either talking to somebody talking to people around you or looking for some sort of support group because the most important thing to realize immediately is you're not alone there's a lot of people when they feel that way especially like I do when I first got it's no one really talked about it you don't realize that this isn't a thing you only suffer from and so being able to in a way like commiserate with other people or realize that hey like this isn't just me one that helps a lot so that's something that I always suggest looking for help like Rob said is always really good and then also realizing that what you're going through isn't like a mindset issue that you're essentially battling yourself so don't beat yourself up about it um Sencha Lee you're fighting yourself already so if you go ahead and demean yourself like why do I feel like this um being so stupid why Bob what you're only making it worse for yourself so understand what you're feeling do some introspection like why am I feeling this way if I can you can't figure that out which is a lot of depression and stuff just free okay what can I do to mitigate it right now perhaps or maybe just let myself feel like this for a while and be okay feeling like that and then going from there well I would say as someone who doesn't get any personally I know there's several people who don't really get a lot of assistance for a lot of people works with what proven Rob talked about talking to people having people like therapy therapy really important for a lot of people and in general just like changing your social outlook on these topics looking for help very important but when none of that stuff really does anything as far as just the social aspects of it when you already know okay I can look for help if you already know hey this isn't a weakness seriously consider looking into professional help because nothing helped me until I actually looked into psychologists and psychiatrists as much as I doubt therapies being super important because it is and for most people a lot of people I'd say it works very well for sure but for the rest of people who don't always have it quite as lucky seriously consider looking into more medical help because I I I wouldn't have gotten as far as I did if I didn't pursue that and don't be afraid to I know for the Americans medical system is not exactly nicest so I've put in quite a lot of money to get that help but I would say it's 90% worth it I'd add on to that as someone who also takes antidepressants that people who suffer from it one if you can in a way figure out is it like a seasonal depression is it like a genetic hereditary sort of depression going on from there some medicine for instance like for like seasonal or short-term depression can help and then it's important to realize once you're getting past that to get off the meds if you can but I would also say that through some people I was in this boat for awhile hesitant to take medicine to realize that one it's not a weakness or something yeah and also just straight up the fact that pretty much depression is a physical part of your brain not working or not producing enough so medicine helps in a sense that would really just you know you're not producing enough of this antidepressant can help send signals to say hey makes more of this or something so I think for a lot of people there's that taboo that you don't quite new medicine but for a lot of people depression is literally just like physically your brain isn't completely so some people don't some people do some people only need like a little stint of it and then they feel better than thinking off of it vice versa but look into all your options and don't immediately rule anything out okay yeah thank you yeah that's just wanted some advice and some things like that thank you if you're struggling seek out help that's pretty much the moral of the story well thank you very much for your questions and your time Josh I just thank you for having me and I would thank you I wish you guys the best of luck with everything you guys doing like to thank I'm being smart that's the weird degree yeah I couldn't thank you yeah honey years ahead of me so I tried to write newspapers and dropped out so thank you very much hello hey hi how are you good so just ask my question for it alright so this one's for blue yeah I'm going to college right now first year for graphic design oh yeah so I was wondering what it was like leaving college like and starting out in the industry okay so the great thing about graphic design right is that we're in an industry that is pretty much essential which is marketing marketing is part of every single aspect of our life you see it on websites you see advertisements when you go to your bank's website even that has to be designed by someone you go to a restaurant someone had to design that restaurant stuff I mean you know mom-and-pop shops don't always do but every single aspect of our life is usually touched by graphic designers so we have a deceptively good job placement rate just because there's so many people who need someone but you can go with a graphic design yeah it's a very versatile market so my experience personally is that now don't just be a graphic designer be someone who touches be like a media expert ever design is if that's like your primary passion absolutely pursue it but if you're starting out you're probably gonna have to be like a generalist who does like video and graphic design and a little bit of web so eventually you can do those jobs and move into like a more specialized role like maybe you like doing layout design maybe you really like web design and you want to be like the front-end designer for that but um uh I also know your worth is probably my biggest advice yeah cuz there's so many graphic design jobs but there's so many who will pay you so badly and grab designers are to be paid incredibly well because I mean we we gotta learn a lot just to get our degree so yeah my advice is know your worth you have so many options for jobs but don't take ones that don't value because then you're gonna be miserable preach it is if the right is that the right answer yeah I've sort of been doing that already like as far as what you said to dabble in like a bunch of different subjects like I'm actually working at my school forward like programming and stuff so but yeah I just I in my area I think and have to move my area right now it's like small towns there's not a lot of jobs for it so is there any like any areas that you'd recommend for like starting out like that'd be easy to get to that have like a lot of opportunities for someone just coming out of college so where do you live right now like with us Southwest Wisconsin I'm dee dah she's giving some talks well as for the most part major cities in general well pretty much always land you several plenty of graphic design jobs and available for you they might not be exactly graphic design jobs they'll probably like multimedia design yup so hence the importance of kind of learning a bunch of things right learn graphic design learn different things that can apply can they use the skills that you learn for grab design right so like I know After Effects I learned how to edit when I was doing my graphic design degree because I mean when you had when your graphic designer you have an eye for things that are right or wrong that look good that don't look good and that it that applies to so many different things just about every single thing you could possibly imagine than the Adobe Creative Suite you have an advantage in because you inherently develop an eye for what it looks good essentially when you're doing stuff so whenever you move to like a major city you could find a lot of multimedia jobs that have extensions of graphic design or like if you're good a graphic design you can inherent you're inherently gonna be pretty good at a lot of the stuff they ask for unfortunately there's really like if you live like in like a [ __ ] nowhere town there's really not a lot of opportunities for you outside of like freelance but I would III think probably the best recommendation and pretty much all of my professors recommended if you're gonna have a graphic design job either live in the city or live like in the outskirts of a city like pretty much any city it does have to be like a major like you'd have to move to LA or like Chicago or anything like that but you know cities like in-between like you don't have to have like a million-person city to have be a successful graphic designer as long as you have as long as there's a level of population because as with marketing right you you have to have people to market to you and if there's no one in your town that unfortunately there's not a lot of these to market to anyone yeah sure all right yeah that's uh thank you pretty good advice oh sorry if I'm great when I can go on very long tangents about he's the best and that's like fax no no cat no yeah that's why hard truth is you got to be at least around something resembling a city to you know have a good job placement but my advice would be creating vectors yeah like blue said to though also when you first started out you don't know where to go you can always look up freelancing there's also a lot of websites that specifically you can like compete for freelance hard and stuff it might not be viable for like long term solution but maybe build a little bit of a portfolio of real-world applications and stuff and see where that goes well thanks I dove I appreciate your questions blue you nailed that do you have any other questions well I also I had a different one who's more of like generally for the group yeah so I know that like what I got into for this channel or like watching mr. fruit was sort of your earlier like destiny but you're too content where you do it on just stuff like that yeah um do you guys like see yourself ever finding a game like that again where you like keep like just really hard period ago how'd I do I hope we find a game like I just I haven't cared about a game like destiny one since that's new one which like sucks I just really want to find something that we all have fun and again kind of right now it's like everyone has their own kind of thing but we still love coming to destiny and like the only reason why I like playing destiny is because I get to play with these guys and like that's why I get like playing other games with them because I like playing with them not so much the game so I just hope one day we'll find anything where I like playing the game just as much as I like playing with them ya know please like Rob said everyone's kind of splintered a little bit everyone yet Rob loves [ __ ] going ham on shooters yeah I just love playing like more chill titles and then fruit yes three ways pretty youtuber look I go where the content leads me yep I'm a man of the people but yeah for the most part I mean we have in the channel itself I should say hasn't really had a staple game since overwatch [Music] a D 2 star dollar and please watch Valentino's when that comes up on your videos I'm hoping valor Anor something that like just hasn't been announced yet I don't know but trust me I miss those days just as much where it was everyone to do it it was easy to do a lot of different content and it also performed well it's like the triple threat and there just hasn't really been anything since but we're looking yeah oh yeah every day so game studios if you're watching like but yeah that I think that about explains that trust me we are we are looking and we want to get back to those days as well now questions and time either way before you go before you go I'm very curious what um uh what what is your like right now I don't know how far you in your degree what do you want to actually like do like what catches you the most right now and graphic design I like I think the most fun I've had with projects right now is when I did different like creative brand advertisements we did one for Ray Ban like obviously not for their final product but it was just like an ad campaign from one of their older ones I like different things like that where I can just make it look really cool and then like not have a ton of influence from them where it's like you know I'm sort of stuck in a box I like being more creative with it final goal I'm mainly just doing this so that I have a job when I transfer to get my masters in film but I do really enjoy doing like graphic design even as a hobby oh yeah I mean that's good the graphic design is I argue this whole time grabber design is an incredible degree just for getting a hang of exactly what the entertainment industry kind of is looking for and just getting an eye for things is super valuable so you're doing great also branding is pretty much where all the money is in graphic design so if you find the film stuff doesn't work out I mean [ __ ] brandings money dude so you're doing great thank you [ __ ] man we believe in you you can do it I can't wait to see him and like I was like we talked to him on GG overeasy that that was beautiful that was really cool blue I was really that was cool to hear yeah but I did what I tell them is shake and get miserable I mean guys like oh my goodness man when people are like oh yeah yeah can you uh exposure I really don't like the I really don't like what you did with with the entire logo what do you mean the whole logo yeah a whole new logo are you sure but yeah I just make a whole new logo bro when I used to do freelance work sometimes - for free the amount of stuff is like well actually like this thing could you just redo this completely I don't like that I'm like bro I'm doing this for free and I put like 20 hours into it like go somewhere else can you change the font what do you have on do you want though it change it to Comic Sans I love that I love that little bit right now times new roman' yeah the worst part for sure when I did anything is always the customer you're working for most of them don't know what they want and if they do it's even worse because then they only have a very predetermined idea in their head and then they're like oh I'll show you an example and it's like a stick figure like ah yes thank you that's why I always try like if I am doing like I always trying to come with like something in mind so if you're ever gleich doing that please have something in mind there's smoke oh I don't know just do what you want to do man you know what else is fine though this a drink yes fabric nice and welcome back the GG over easy podcasts were hopping right into it drew dagger dagger Doug Walker W and BIOS I do how's it going in.i fine I guess we're here with you and ask your question away buddy totally yep I was wondering for mr. fruit you said in the podcast that you went to Iceland yes time yeah and you said you didn't like the showers there I don't reason for some how do you live in Iceland yeah okay Libby says have you ever been out of AI excellent a Tenerife not mess though okay have you taken showers outside of Iceland yeah maybe it's just because you're used to it because here's this alright I'm used to my normal showers I go there dude I take a shower and it smells like I'm bathing in rotten eggs it's maybe well because is probably because um the house we're at like it was all the water and stuff was pulled from Asheville Springs yeah like from the hot springs and stuff so just sulfur so yeah the water hit different you know what I'm saying and then it just smelt like I would get out and I'd smell like rotten eggs I'm like this is different yeah that it was that was the reason it was terrible because it just I just smell horrible and I don't know maybe yours doesn't and there's other places that don't but the only feeling oh yeah I mean it's beautiful but we only had like two different Airbnb Zand they were both with this like spring water or whatever and yeah it was just poof smell it from a mile away no we wanted to but we're also kind of on the other side of the island because we're also told like Blue Lagoon is cool but it's so touristy and busy that yeah we shouldn't bother too much so yeah but if I go back I definitely want to I want to do tours fine I absolutely want to go to blue again yeah I want to be I want to wear shirt you'll see me in the Blue Lagoon says I'm from USA I love the Blue Lagoon a stinky mud puddle for me and you that's a spongebob reference well thank you for opening my eyes and now I know that not all of Iceland has stinky showers but it's important to remember all of Florida has stinky showers and I will go we did go to like a hot spring place though that was just like a big natural hot spring I was like heated Hot Springs those those were nice I enjoyed that that was this closest thing we had to like the Blue Lagoon around us is that where you see the Northern Lights or like can you see the Northern Lights just anywhere anyway pretty sure oh okay I should know if like you had a specific your eyes learn to see the Northern Lights I mean they're really common a pretty common in Iceland that's what did you just see like all those are the Northern Lights like whatever like yours that's that's so cool okay I do have a question for you do you like is it is it the the shark is that the stuff you guys have yeah yeah shark do you like that personally no okay alright I was gonna have to be like okay well wait what are you talking about they I mean he might know more about it but we stopped at one part because we heard about like oh you got to try the shark like that was a touristy thing whatever like just like shark yeah okay it's why I like for the Martin yes you got it you got so we went we went through this whole thing were they like talked about it where they come from the history of all like the shark hunting or whatever all that kind of stuff and then also like how I guess like so many people used to die of it because all this urine builds up I guess and like gets soaked into all of the shark so people would try and just eat the shark and eventually just die from it and then they learned that they have to like freeze it like they would essentially buried in the snow or something for a really long time bring it out and then all that urine and all the stuff yeah well like all the toxic chemicals I guess would go out and he well I guess it should not have toxic levels but something about this so they did this whole thing and then they're like yeah now you can try it and it was like sharks that was obviously past all that gross stuff so I was like okay and I have to tell you probably the worst thing I've ever tasted it was disgusting and you don't want to like offended like well yeah it's kind of like a delicacy and to make this like please tell me what you think so well I'm glad to hear that a fellow Icelander actual lives there doesn't like it either yeah so I'm not completely I'm just a stupid American yeah well you'll taste buzz grows but you wondering anything else thank you very much enjoy Iceland man it's so cool it's actually super cool having to do from Iceland calling yeah cool hey the foreigner vehicles yeah I bet so thank you for uh for calm and have a good night cuz I guess it's pretty late for you right I'm better go to sleep okay night-night man thank you for watching see you man why are all our friends were interesting yeah that guy's cool well I pulled him in because II bear noted bonus points for cool accent that was strongest cause for - but they only did great buddy like I think whoever's around some told us that like almost all of Iceland dies like loves well is like powered by like the hot spring water whatever so I was like this is just what they deal with and I mean like you might be like oh you're over-exaggerating like no you gotta go there man like the water literally means I got like a egg right in front of your nose yeah like a rotten egg what sulfur smells like oh I should also know - they didn't have hot water for the showers that oh but you like cold showers at the time right no no one likes cold showers they might be able to bear cold showers you'd be like yeah I like it and that's just to trick other people in the doing it and also hitting their lives no one likes cold showers I'll die on the hill mr. Phan buns welcome hello how's it going good man how are you pretty good pretty good what are you wondering for our fine group of people today so my question is is there a time where you guys really felt like depressed or down and you watch a video from some your favorite YouTube or something or maybe like listen to like an album yeah I can so like when Cindy and I broke up a couple months back I like nine months ago I guess um I was watching I was going through all my youtube catalogue like everything that I liked so like one of them was like rust - I watched a lot of rust - when that was happening I also watched shadow of is Rafael it's a minecraft playthrough that I used to watch as a kid and it like me not as a kid I guess I must have been like 13 14 or 15 somewhere around there but it's like a Minecraft series where like they literally like RP minecraft and it's like a story and it's told they never finished it but light and I was always super salty about that they never finished it but then I became part of YouTube playthroughs with mr. fruit and then I was like okay now I understand why I think we're gonna finish that kind of stuff but shadow biz Ruffo is really awesome I watched a lot of Christians videos that like I was really happy in and [ __ ] like that like I watched them GG over Easy's when I'm having bad days or just something like the hot wings challenge video something like I like to really watch just because I'm like just having fun with my friends and it just like gives me like kind of a like a happier vibe so definitely those videos are like what I watch if I might were feeling down sweet sweet do you you blue or Christian do you guys have anything that you who you want to go first now you okay well for a bigger part back in the day like middle school high school when I was really down I used to rely on machinima respawn I don't know if you ever watched back then but I more specifically like the inbox boys which was like Sark yeah in boxes videos it was usually Sark and it's inside gaming before inside gaming be Ike but it was pretty much the group like Sark Hodge seananners that was like all that yeah well even before all that because we didn't really do their channels yet back in machinima I this is mm oh no mm around 2010 for a couple years before he eventually left and then that's when he did a lot of jima and stuff and then I kept watching then but back then I used to just love watching their stuff especially because it was just a group of friends and you could just watch and almost felt like you were there and just watching friends have fun and for me especially back then it was really nice and then I vividly remember the video where hutch said he was like leaving respawn I bawled my cried hey what do we felt like I lost a friend and then seananners he didn't make an official video where he left he just kind of slowly phased out she never really returned yeah it never really returned back to what it was and then of course they still did their own content but for me especially like out of all the stuff I ever did back then that was like the my go to sweet yeah I mean I remember when I started losing a lot of people it was weird for me too but Oh blue sorry did you want to say yours [ __ ] so I don't really have like a specific I don't know like a I guess it was for me it was mostly music when I was a kid I would just blast the ever-loving [ __ ] out of every single Radiohead record when I was a kid and I would just if I was really feeling down and pretty much always be very sad and then I'd like I'm in college mostly just whatever music like I got into like the national and radio Thank You ocean fire avalanches were my main go-to most of the time a boy needs therapy good and then I probably the YouTube channel I watched the most whenever I'm kind of like out of it from just having bad days as Christ or fruit Oh chronic is like the primal level of my my my goal and and content is it's pretty much to be like cry gonna be honest with you so yeah he was the which I actually obviously I think most people from watching him and PewDiePie play back in the day that was that was what I would watch on YouTube all the time was pewds in his entire gang with with minx and cry and all them and that was like my go-to but I'm uh he still streams occasionally he's on he's in one of arcade UM's Dungeons and Dragons playthroughs yeah like that's why I was like yeah he isn't one of he plays on the monday playthrough after ours I am yeah yeah his his Let's Plays just like literally hours of content to take you away from stuff and that's he has a very relaxing voice yeah it's a great honor yours like uh-huh that's my go-to that's like a Samar almost I would also say nowadays though and for some people if they want to I know it's we b-but anime one because I like anime I specifically I know there's like slice-of-life animes I don't know to watch those I like the ones that are like fantastical adventures that obviously can't really happen one it takes me out of the reality and then two if I'm reading subs all I'm focused on is reading subs I can't like think about other stuff anything like I'm watching so maybe in a second yeah like I'm in that show I'm focused on it that helps as well yeah my here I could Amy Lee really like save me yes yes yeah I love my hero my heroes great yeah I was just wanted to say thank you to you guys cuz there's been some times I mean even recently that I've been just super down on myself just because things weren't going my way and I've watched some of your guys's videos and it just man it just it would take me out of the day like maybe I had like a bad fight with someone or got bad grade or something I just was just bawling out for it right I'd listen to like NF right and get like my tears out and everything like that then I watched when you guys his videos and meant it would just calm me down and just which is like your favorite to watch do you have like a favorite kind of video or yeah honestly anything when the dream team or you guys are with like shark-tooth or like arias and all them and uh you bear like anything like that what you guys are just having fun as it's like a team mm-hm or even TTT or whatever is it's just it makes me feel good and then also I used to watch the Pokemon playthrough on the second channel that was that was like that was my thing I've been waiting for a new another one like oh I can't wait I was like the Sun was great I love those so much my man I appreciate that and as far as feeling down on yourself I know it's easy but everybody has highs and lows and just keep your head up realize that it gets better and not everybody despite what it might look like on the

[ __ ] best these dudes I'm watching right now believe me that's cuz we do awesome I'll say you're the fudging best okay there you go hey there you know about to get a plaque above my computer with your the fudge invest your nation that's right you are we believe in your man hello there hello friend well what do you want to talk about well the topic was board games seeing how they rien Sergent of it recently in the media and everything with the great clinical role in all you bunch of YouTube and everything people talking about board games it seemed that you guys like when you're like pack style for like the fruits um that you played board games let you played you yo and I think that one video I saw dice thrown in the background yeah I love my favorite board game that I I'm actually playing it today Saturno tomorrow Saturday I'm actually playing it tomorrow night with my friend Gibbs Blake and Jake but it's like the online version of it it's called a game called talisman I don't know if you ever played talisman it's basically like a class game where you basically like roll against enemies and stuff like that it's almost kind of like a mini mini dungeon dragons is so fun and it's just basically like you roll against someone else's rolls and it's just really fun and you like build your character and you can put it either into like strength or your magic and then you gotta get into like the inner ring by getting a talisman but you got to get a towel something by going through like either like the dungeon or you can go through the city and get a pet that they can help you get it's so fun like it then there's so many like every time you play it it's never the same and that's what I truly love about it and it's like none I've ever wanted to play like Dungeons & Dragons we're like ooh like that's way too much commitment like every time you play dungeon dragon or every time you play talisman it's like a mini dungeon dragons kind of quest and you can pick different kind of like there's like 60 different kind of heroes you can choose from if you have like all the expansions and whatnot it's super fun if you could ever look into talisman that's the game I'm going playing a lot in the school yeah I love love talisman um I love board games and the biggest thing though is usually I just can't get enough people constantly to come play them and like obviously a lot of my friends are well in different states that makes it hard but if I ever can get people together I have tons I always like to try when I look for board game - I like some amount of skill and I know some people like avidly hate die space games but I also like die space games because I kind of like some of the RNG you also have very nice die that's why I didn't well yeah like dice Forge for instance um not a lot of people have heard about that one but I really like that one especially because you would early build your own dice and play with them and you like you make your dice better I really like that one but it's cool yeah pretty much wasn't one me you and Dad oh and or was it Claire playing or no me you a band versus God meeting Claire and you played in the basement and it's like we had to go through that like spaceship Oh clink yeah clink was fun yeah we like clink I love any deck building that's for sure yeah so like that obviously shards of infinity was that one game we were playing - at PAX there's a card game that was really fun once like we learned it I was like that deck building game that we were playing all night - like three in the morning I think you think welke Forge that was a another one yeah I don't know if we if people put card games and the same lip and board games board games okay yeah I'd say key Forge obviously I love Pokemon the card game yeah but I love physical card games I don't know or board games any that kind of stuff there's just a different level of fun you can have with the personal interactions and stuff but I think that the fact that it's definitely getting more popular and stuff is awesome I think enough people also have the wrong idea of board games they just think of like Oh like sorry yeah chutes and ladders really monopoly right and then they don't realize that there's all these really cool ones and they can get as complicated as you like or as simple as you like dude you guys want to know what the most nor me like I guess quote-unquote board game is dude and I'm like really kind of sick of playing it cards against humanity' yeah oh I'm so over that game like it's just like me agree it's like glue I said something Corky like not about it like that's just so hurt yeah being that you like dice thrown have you looked into the Kickstarter that they had for dice throw adventure I think I saw a two-pack south ok I haven't kick-started at myself though but I do have dice throwing a dice around season - okay and I'll be looking into adventure the problem is whenever I play dice thrown all my friends hate it because most of them are like this is too orangey blue so then I only ever get one play out of everybody so I know that okay because adventures is the more PB oriented right yes you build like a dungeon and yet the other way to the boss so I think that when I could sell more people on because it's not us fighting each other it's more cooperative I have one friend in the area that I play with and like even at some points like now that we're quarantined we'll just play over a video chat oh that's cool yeah that's awesome do you have a favorite board game blue or like anything that you'd like to play when you over when you're looking into a board game uh I'm not like specifically board game oriented I've never been like I've never really had like a large group of people do that with and usually when people come down to pack south it's pretty much straight I sorta play card games so look chars infinity obviously I'm gonna like just about every TCG started infinities my [ __ ] though I love that game man of culture I guess for you Mendez what is your favorite board game at the moment dice thrown but I'm looking into getting aftermath it's kind of like yeah I've heard yeah I was a big fan of like red wall and all those comments when I was younger like with the mouse being the protagonist with like them being like human qualities and like swords and weapons and then that game takes it in it has a little storytelling so I think will be fun once I invest into it well awesome hope quarantine can in soon this you can play with your friend IRL it'll make things easier yeah true and anything else won't ask about oh no not really actually have to get back to work because I took off to do this real quick well we appreciate that yeah okay work man stay safe stay clean buddy good luck with the ground will do guitar go just wear a mask yeah have a good day you too bye Wow I know for we're worth that that guys nice everybody's nice I'm severance pay or something yeah you go fan welcome buddy you fan of like the Eagles or like just gonna ask so let's let's be careful here it may not be Philadelphia but you know I mean oh that's calling it down though that's okay that's fine that's okay I respect the Eagles cool cool we'll see I don't you know I don't respect the Patriots as much that's okay you don't respect this cuz you anus that's all I'm gonna say well to be fair it's the League versus the Patriots all the technology they put out a Malcolm Jenkins video dude like like sure now that video is hard do they make the dopest videos I know they're edits are so nice yeah they're edits are sick they got some dope design people over there I know for real for real it's sick I know yeah where you go sir what question do you this is with your saucy questions I know I was gonna start off so I guess kind of fruit Rob and honestly anyone just how do you all like handle your daily schedules cuz as of right now like I am you know kind of ripped with Corona going on I'm graduating college and written probably won't have a graduation ceremony kind of sucks but just kind of going in and making that next step like how do you guys handle your schedules and like what was something big that like really helped you guys kind of get organized I guess that's enough we for Robin fruit a question that like help me with my schedule is having an example to follow and a Christian is probably the example I did try and follow like somebody who even though he does have his bad days like he's still like finds time to go to the gym and like finds time to hang out with Clare and like Feinstein's like do all the stuff that you'd like me to like do in a day like that's what like I try and like do is just wake up if I can get to the I guess like if I can get to my treadmill which is two feet that way and where I do my box jumps and my dips now then I can pretty much do anything in my day now let me ask you real quick I'm sorry I don't know you're up to you so with the drum so I used to do those could I used to do rowing in high school kind of obscure kind of sport right but we had this one guy do box jumps and I swear man he was so scared he would come to practice you wear shin guards like straight up mr. Bachchan's like rushing yards and like he refused to do without his shin guards dude oh my butt and then like it's not and this box isn't meant to jumped on it's like a little piece of furniture my parents got like American furniture row house like this thing isn't meant to be like worked out on its butt it's meant to like put your feet up on where you like on the couch but I mean it's I've adopted it as my own now and is now refer blacks drums so it's not very tall so I had to like try and like make it work but you're unlike scrum but we're working we're yeah like and they're like I'm just doing like push-ups and sit-ups now like that's like how I'm trying to go about my schedule and then like thankfully like streaming and like doing content creation is something I'm still able to do like in the comfort of my parents basement yeah you guys have all been killing it by the way man I've been I've been tuned in to all you guys are streams blue I tuned in two years the other day I think you're doing wrecking that was pretty hype oh yeah well yeah I know it is the whole dr. pepper conversation that's the dr. pepper conversation that always stems somehow stems back into GG easy right right but yeah I mean it was kind of funny but I appreciate that response there and and the next thing I was gonna kind of ask you I guess more catered towards Rob I guess is so I remember you know a while ago you were talked about like your intramural League and how you got a red card and you know I like can totally get where that's coming from I'm a soccer geek too you know but okay and not big on Arsenal so you mm-hmm okay come on I was gonna ask like how do you how do you get involved in those I am leagues like because I'm obviously through my school like you know that was a big thing for me is like you know I was big on soccer and you know try do football and how did you get involved kind of outside of school I guess well thankfully Christian's brother Ethan likes to play soccer a lot and he's definitely more of an extrovert or like can go out and I ask people to join a team and stuff like I always want to play on a team and stuff but I like for me I just have to be asked and as soon as I'm asked like I'm in so normally I've just been asked by like Christians brother and then like people that like CSU like they knew I played soccer like at a high level so they're like please be on our team so I was like okay like what so like that's how I ever gotten I never had to like go out and like kind of look for a team or anything like that but like when I moved back up to Fort Collins is something I would have liked looking to what I love what position do you what position do you like playing um either white right wing or left wing depending on where the wounded deer is on the field that's what we like my coach called it was if if the left back was worse I was playing right wing if the left back was worse or right back was when I was playing left wing and whatever we could take advantage of yeah all right and then I didn't want to leave obviously fruit and blue out of this too but kind of the one other question I'll get out you guys just here's a-- i was gonna ask how you guys kind of handle like stress and anxiety because you know it's it's something that you know i'm i look at like social media and a lot of other people and that's kind of the sucky part is it seems like no one else kind of suffers from you know like anxiety and stress and stuff like that but obviously we you know share the the commonality of like you know going and playing games and stuff but how do you guys kind of handle stress you know in other ways like like maybe cooking or stuff like that you know the gym the gym yeah which unfortunately yeah which unfortunately can't do now but for me it's doing one doing something completely different than this which can't get much different from playing video games to go into the gym it's getting me active moving and on top of that just kind of like zone out and then cuz i'm like physically moving stuff all that stress kind of just goes away for at least the time being so I think that's how I handle stress by not doing it but if I know I need work to do or something I just go on the macro level what's because for me I'm Way better at doing big things and small things small things give me more anxiety for whatever reason so for me it's getting a big chunk done like just get this video done and we'll take a break or focus on something else so that I can just feel a little bit better and get something out of the way and I know for some people it's the exact opposite it's just do something small and then that'll build up but for me getting something big done helps me with the rest of the day and then move on and get stuff done and be productive which hopefully sometimes helps alleviate the stress because a lot of the times the stress involves what I need to do have to do time the sensitive stuff where I need to be for different things and if I can just take someone alleviate some of that stress in some place that helps and I guess blue what kind of stuff would you do you I mean I know you seem like a super kind of chill guy you know and I mean obviously with you to fruit Rob maybe not as much uh what kind of stuff would you do I mean you know just like like fruit said baby on a more micro or macro scale like is there anything specific you know cuz I love taking tips from as many people as I can that's it that's a big thing I love you know communicating to me is a really big way that I kind of handle it being around people but kind of like planning like you said fruit as well as is really really good you know it seems to kind of handle it as well oh ok so my answer is medication medication is incredible but as far as like it actually usable what helps me the most is I've started doing this over the past year I write everything down I have a really bad I've always had really bad like short-term memory and it's because I get really stressed so I don't remember things so it's really comforting for me I have like this big calendar I write everything down to like my okay this bills today okay we'll do this today okay today is this new Destin expansion Pawar's to even like on my like a notepad on my desk it's like what do I want to do today like when I get up before I do anything I like write it down like okay today I need to pay this bill today I need to do this today I haven't taken buoy the park let's do that so I'll write everything down to like alleviate the stress of remembering I don't know why I I get stressed when I have to remember things and I don't know why so I just start writing everything down it makes things a lot easier for me and because I I have to recall something I know 100% I will only like retain like 50% of what I plan out for the day if I don't write it down so I'll write everything down and over the past six months I don't uh when someone says hey you should start meditating uh I would absolutely say you should get on that train because it's there's something that really like slows down cuz my brain goes like a mile a minute constantly and when I'm not doing anything like even like a 10-minute just silent meditation has really helped me not like blow up in the middle of the day so meditation write everything down yeah and and and in one of my cuz I'm an economics major and rhetoric minor hopefully wrapping up like I said but and one of my rhetoric classes which is like public speaking they actually you know every time we would go into class they would ask us you know kind of all right go put your phones front of the class I'm gonna reach sit down we would actually meditate for like the first five or ten minutes and I could like really notice a difference like it's you open your eyes again and it's like you just feel refreshed and kind of reset you know and I could definitely feel that like yeah it's like a soft reset in the because we take we don't realize it but every single thing in today stacks up on us whether like we you wake up and you have like brush your teeth or you and then you have like Hawkman this morning [ __ ] sucked you bring that into your middle your day if you have like something bad happen and when you like just meditating vanilla day is like good little all right right here restart we're good yeah it's a nice little kind of interval I guess you can take and stuff like that yeah I completely agree I mean that's definitely something I think I need to improve on as like you said obviously fruits you like going to the gym is definitely something I need to improve on as well you know I think we can always get better you know as humans but doesn't like a positive way I guess more than negative yeah it doesn't always have to be the gym but something physical even if it's just going outside and taking a walk just the way that our brains work and have evolved whatever the endorphins we can get and all the good stuff we can get from even just a little bit of physical act he can go really long way yeah the gym for me was like if I can do because I don't want to go to the gym like but I know like it's good for me so like I know if I do something that I don't want to do to start off my day then I can go about my day about doing anything if I could start my day off that way yeah I agree I actually I saw one of your Instagram stories the other day because I followed you on insta and I see you stories whenever you go to the gym and I'm like man I need I need to get up in there and go to the gym and I'm like I need to pull up that I followed your the play this you got on Spotify - oh gosh sakes get grinding I get those bangers and those bangers in if I don't have my earbuds in I can't go to the gym I will turn around and go back and get my earbuds so are you guys when you're in the gym are you guys earbuds or headphones earbuds I'm at about 2% yeah I'm head phones yeah you know really I mean I like the the yeah for me their noise cancelling so just being like completely surrounded and doing that but also completely in my own head I like my own headspace and not hearing anything else it's like eerie at first but then also just keeps me more relaxed and focused yeah I love my Rea cons they just cancel out everything I got these like I got my computer when I was going to college and it came with like a pair of beads and I'm just like they're like battle-hardened beats and like that just work just is nice and so those are the ones I usually kind of roll with but I'm not trying to like roll in there be like hey scuse me I'm rich you guys but I know air pods are the new thing - but rolling that Android life so well Eagle fan I appreciate your questions I don't appreciate it as your Eagles fan now that's all my Patriots for a second yeah hey guys I really appreciate you having me on like I said it obviously keep them with you guys do you guys been awesome really happy I got to talk with you guys thanks again for a thank you man and yeah you guys have a great rest your day right you too coming in buddy yeah thanks guys blue interesting sidenote I too am terrible with memory and when I did like a gene test or whatever to see which medicine would work best with me I was actually lacking in a certain gene that is associated with memory and apparently that's very common for people with depression so might just be something you're lacking - oh yeah I've already I don't have any of that lack it's just I stressed myself out so much I have bad memory not to be confused with shark tooth shark oh the Gigi over names patented bringing me to the changes skin I uh hi to the viewers first person yeah Wow hey what about the audience would be if you had a game that would come out in the future what would be the storyline what would the game type be like what would be your dream game I don't have like a specific but I guess I could just like pull from genres I guess if you could take like I don't know like the shooting of like Call of Duty and like and like put it in like an MMO kind of world kind of thing but throw destiny kind of in that too with a little bit of division or something that's like the perfect game to me is like just some first-person MMO that is just like that gets it like a hundred percent right that but that is so like I not know way that ever happens but that would be like my like perfect game that I would like to make but and so point Runnels right yeah I well want to make a game and I have an idea so I won't say what it is because obviously want to be a surprise so I have wait come on I want to make it if I want to make another video game I would probably do something kind of similar to Rob because my main love obviously is shooters so it'd be some mix of shooter with progression systems multiplayer obviously PvP [Music] and because I mean like there's a reason I'm drawn like destiny and stuff and all the other looter shooters is because there's a they're the closest thing we have to like an FPS MMO kind of the same boat as Rob I mean I've talked about it before like I wish overwatch had come out as Titan or whatever it was supposed to be which was a essentially what they sounded like an FPS MMO something like that I really like but on a more reasonable scale I'd probably make something like a roguelike or a deck builder or a combination like it's why I love slay the spire some form of combination of those elements I really like and obviously are a lot easier to execute then an FPS MMO because if it was that easy we would have won but we don't oh this is gonna be controversial but really not controversial I'm gonna be honest destiny was infinite budget yeah more focus on MMO and significantly scaled back on the PvP aspect of the game yes he is themes PV you're right is good but if they have enough I'll do great also the back if they have an infinite budget they can apply even more of that budget to a more interesting god I love SPV he's tight right but they even Bungie sometimes takes it too seriously I would love it if the PvP were more treated as like Mario Party right we have all these you have all these mmo's like Final Fantasy and they don't take the PC seriously right it's still fun and it's something people enjoy ever heard but it's still like let it be Mario Party PvP so that PvE could be nuts so people the world are like I want this to be like League of Legends level PvP and about Mario Party they want it to be I mean the tuesd SUVs never gonna be eSports right so never my dream game is destiny with infinite budget more MMO aspects and less of a PvP focus so they could invest completely and just making the pv like ridiculous having stupid pollute who cares if it's busted in PvP because it's because Omega Lowell its PvE game let's get it not controversial in my opinion no it's not no it'll make me a little controversial sorry PvP dudes but if it a budget dicey let's get it do you have any other questions sure not really well we appreciate your question my golf at nap oh yes you said it to me right now bouncy golf bouncy hole-in-one bouncy hole-in-one can you link me the steam file because I'm always the golfer yeah I can I can link you it yeah if you just like right click my name and then message or something yeah dude that's the example of shooting your shot don't be afraid later get on in there this man's brave and I mean I gotta respect it because he just I mean you gotta push people right just like me dude I am a gamer do you want to like run a seminar cuz you you got it you're in you're in this guy's got it be like this dude everyone this guy's got it well whenever we eventually play golf it again which is hopefully soon it's not that we're like purposely avoiding it yeah want to we just can't get everybody yeah everyone's always yelling at us but when we play it again we'll try and throw that in the old rotation yeah man thank you shark thank you for your question man have a good thing confident that's Paul look how far confidence gets you shoot your shot golf and map right there boom go look where this ad gets hey pad welcome back to the GT over easy oh gosh yes John hum I'm hungry running on low fumes here darn quarantine bro well that's the reason I'm fasted right now that's why I'm dying clay furs you know I know anyone oh hey what's up guys yeah oh yeah how you doing buddy I'm doing pretty good how you guys doing great under your ear oh don't worry but it's serious it's always get the on that's what I'm looking for once more people feel like ah you know what this is gonna be I can just ask the question and we're fine yeah just good this is good man clap do you have a question Clifford that you would like I do so I'm a big in FL fan woman I know restore fruit you are a Jaguars fan oh no so I wanted to know your thoughts because we never really got to hear it or at least I didn't on back back last season during the whole Minshew mania thing like what what was your opinion on that do you like Gardner Minshew or are you a Nick Foles guy or well at first I was like first I was like finally we got a quarterback in Nick falls as we bring dealing with Blake small dick bortles yeah but I was like okay we got like an actual QB who can be consistent because that was the prom with portals he shows up he doesn't and thankfully the playoffs that one year a couple years ago like he was showing up I was like dude if we had this all the time that'd be great but doesn't happen I'm like all right great Nick falls this is gonna be first game it gets just like an absolute bullying of a touchdown well no he gets it he gets a fantastic pass like huge touchdown a meal me yes this is and I think it's either the same player like the next one and it's like way to it but Nick falls down it's the same place I'm like oh yes like this and this was like first Drive I think first quilt like this this is a good start like this is what we could have to look forward to and then he just goes down and the next you know it's like well he's out for pretty much the whole season it's like okay great you know yeah so then little did I know my boy men shoot comes out this boy with a mustache and I um I'm watching first game I'm like okay but I'm like okay sure yeah alright and but I'm like okay it might just be a little bit of a fluke to writing it's only first game we don't really know I have you know trust issues since bortles right but then he keeps showing up and he keeps showing up and then I got behind it the men shoe magic unfortunately utter what a putter a little bit a little bit but also our defense was pretty miserable and on top of that just apparently the whole entire team environment like with Ramsey and everything going on stuff too like ROM apparently just your head coach yeah I believe so yeah I don't think I've heard any news otherwise I would prefer if he wasn't but that's important yeah so they're just having like team issues overall and like Ramsey not like in men shoe and all this kind of stuff so and then we had the whole like personally when they're like Nick Falls is good to go back I was I was on the the side of just keep him on the bench like men she's been hot there's no reason just just which I'm in yeah might as well ride home right yeah and then I forgot did they actually put falls back in yeah so they tried him again and then eventually went back to men's shoe but so I'm personally you know what I'm all in on the men's shoe one he's got like he was able to just take the league like he made the whole meme like men's shoe magic and his mustache and all this kind of stuff so I mean if it gets us more fans which means more money which means you know maybe games aren't blacked out as much which I don't think we had them that issue last season but as long as we get some more attention in Jaguars can eventually build back up I I'm all for it and I think men shoes early he showed a lot of promise and I think if we invest in him I'm I'm all for I'm down yeah so kind of bouncing off that same NFL topic Rob yeah I wonder what you're gonna ask me I can only imagine there hasn't been much patriot-news here in the know I don't know what you're talking about uh know what I just want I just want to know like what's going through your head ah okay so like I wait so it's like 7:30 in the morning and I get my watches boo-boo things like vibrating on my wrist I'm like I didn't set an alarm who the hell is calling me and it's Aereo's and why the hell is like Ariel's calling me at 7:30 hang-up calls think I could get hang-up calls me back again hang-up calls me back again and then I get a text from that says like Brady left to Patriots and I was like fake news like yeah right you are fake news and I like open up Twitter and it's like his like the first thing that pops up is like Thank You Patriot fans and like a long writing that's like well this isn't like I literally grabbed my Jersey and went back to sleep like I would I grab my Jersey put it on it you fell asleep with the Jersey yeah I put it back on like I haven't was like I haven't watched that Jersey I haven't worn it since the Titans patriot game where we lost and it's just it's just weird I don't know what we're gonna do uh I honestly and like down for tanking and getting Lawrence but I don't think that's Bills way that's not the Patriot way you know we just because it's not the Tom Brady way it's the Patriot way all right let's just get that out of the way he just was like a great big part of it um but very very large very large pond I've it sounds weird I would love to if we got and like wouldn't try to get Cam Newton for something yeah it'd be kind of inches my house my next question is who do you think is gonna do you think they're gonna tank or do you think they're actually gonna try to get I would also like to see what Stidham has I would maybe Jerry said um has it and if he doesn't then we just suck with him the whole year and we go and get a quarterback yeah or go get Cam Newton that's really where I'm at hey dude Flacco a 34 year old who plays like a 68 year old yeah big guys no thank you so last thing I wanted to include blue because I know he doesn't really love no but I know you're more of an NBA guy so if did you were you like following the season like before I got canceled and everything oh man I got so depressing I'm glad that yeah yeah but we love Derek white we love Derek white we do love Derek so who if if the season hadn't been canceled who do you think would have been in the finals not the Spurs buddy no I feel I mean I feel like it's pretty straightforward I I mean Lakers have been popping off the season ask Raptors have been doing incredibly well considering considering Kauai is not there right sucks isn't poppin off for some reason the boxer like why me honest bro I mean yeah and I mean they're the whole like it's all you need they're just paid off big-time and then I mean what's the West Coast uh who's been Clippers and didn't crickets have been doing insane sleep they I think I feel like they could have made a pretty deep playoff run we wouldn't do that of course the [ __ ] year yeah I felt like Nuggets were the shoes I feel like they were pretty much guaranteed at this place I honestly saw this year Lakers taking the whole thing man yeah they've been on a different level this year LeBrons been playing I was mine these have such a strong team right now and huge - they're ginormous I mean III think this is bronze a year unfortunately they got cancelled for the time being but um I mean is it ever not LeBron seer said no [ __ ] yeah that's true but yeah I mean I'm kind of sad because I would love to see a Lakers run this year especially considering everything but God man Spurs have just been I don't how do you want this is it's so I can't even like be that upset because I have so much like privilege right now because the Spurs have been so consistent for like the past 20 [ __ ] years yeah and I'm like and I'm like overhead press like oh man I can't believe this year they're doing so bad you had the past 20 years you'll be fine with one year really Popovich Popovich is really the the Belichick of the employers yeah we're in a rebuilding process with the Spurs unfortunately but um hopefully we bounce back in the next couple of years it might not even be next year in the year after that but as long as we have pop I don't know how much longer we have him as long as we have pop he can build build a team good enough again well then I keep hearing things about like maybe Tim Duncan he's kind of training Duncan to be the next oh my god that would be the best timeline deed yeah oh yeah I know pepper yeah I know how you feel though I'm a I'm a Wizards fan so we do also I'm sorry in the same oat not unlike 85 and nitro don't even don't even Big East snub the biggest snub of like the decade bro how did he not get all-star and then like the wizard suck that's why that's great on his terrible team because he's not a big he's not a big flashy name you know that didn't no he's not and he's also just on a big flashy big team market yeah if you're not gonna be flashy then you have to play like Kauai unfortunately so yep can it really be arguably the best player in the league if you're not gonna be flashy well clay for thanks for your questions man we absolutely appreciate you guys time yeah thank you for coming on all right one of my least favorite spells on all of Kingdom Hearts Thunder agha I think it's fun Durga yeah another a in there well as a rock it's done Durga yep up here sorry no we're good man put the mic on today friend well you know I I always like to hear when you guys branch into the list like I like it when you guys go into the science world on the podcast first came probably least like know the least of it yes right yes Rob specifically when your weight on when you went look back at a 3d printing so I still stand by my statement sorry I will die on this mountain you will you will die yeah I'm a mechanical and biomedical engineer by trade and okay your swimmer one or I came they just went up by being around one of the one of the things that I've really enjoyed getting to do in the past is different types of 3d printing not cool okay but there is there's a special method of 3d printing called stereolithography essentially you you take photosensitive resin in shiny image editors in UK print an image from a liquid into a solid quite elementary yes wait did you say that oh Milan weapons could be a thing in the future I'm all about it so are two liquid bullets it's okay it's the way you can so okay wait if you can change something from a liquid to a solid mm-hmm isn't that like the state of matter like have you ever frozen water of yes exactly breaking physics no I'm not but like but it's water like what is it like is it like a liquid water and eggs but no per changing a liquid into solid is way harder to do that does it freeze it or does it harden it or like it matters always change right so what what this is it's a special resin that when exposed to photons raising my hand liquid state to a solid state so you went to resin I thought that's what you what jesse was poisoned with or what always a poison that's ricin that's very oh it's a liquid polymer so it's it's a it's a liquid with a billion tiny fibers on it that when you expose it to light then can become solid so you can use it for something as simple as like making a mr. fruit water low and low go to some of the things more complicated that when I got to do in school make it look like coal yeah making artificial heart valve chambers oh so okay so like why are all of our call laters like way more interesting than we are so okay so you take this okay so like what do you put in a 3d printer like what is it that's in there is it the ricin so you know that is the poison from that depression yes that depends on what type of 3d printing you want to do but the most common 3d printing people think of wait so there's like a little deeper ending yeah there's different types um the kind that you that most showing by is the kind that most people think of if you were to look on on Amazon you can buy a regular 3d printer oh that's just a little pen it will print lines you can drag it across and it'll melt what's already solid and you can drag it across your bilayer but other kinds like stereo lithography pull-pull solids out of liquids by exposing them to light but yeah there's a lot of different kinds so so ask someone who works on 3d printing what steps how close are we to 3d printing cool until I was super into this part okay so as until we can change the laws of physics we're pretty far away from doing that we would have to move first we'd have to move electrons so guys to even get things to change elemental vials but you just said you can make solids go into liquid super easy why can't we just make liquid cold well stasis matters does matter right yes the states of matter are very different from from like like states of existence right solid liquid gas plasma those are two very different things from changing elemental I always forget the plasma one it's a trick question yeah so we're very far off not even close not know you you've we've got a thousands of years before we can figure that out so like you would have to break down a piece of coal like I don't know I still don't get it I still you couldn't rise listen if this guy can't convince you that it's not gonna happen then I don't know what you want to hear yeah he is a 3d printing expert like like I was talking about it I feel like I went to Pawn Stars and I was like hey I have like I know guys I know best I can do is $5 Oh as tight as Hume it is we can't reproduce everything in nature just like that yet not yet yet so so like just cold specific like what if we wanted to make wood how far away a phone away from making wood from a 3d printer you know and that's depends on how technical you want to get you can I guess you can make like a play a two-by-four of this like material and it would yeah if you if you were to use a a resin that was filled with like wood fibers then yes in so we'll never run out of wood you know you still would have to have a still yeah it's not like 3d print again you're not 3d printing out of nothing it's using some exchange it's using the Rison so we know you sir isin you could use the Rison as wood now no he said but like you saying you would need like wooden fibers to put in and you don't have unlimited wooden fibers okay I have to I really have to appreciate how we literally have an expert in here and still some accepting of okay we're out of wood wood is gone we're in trouble and all I have left is this 2x4 okay like how how much of the 2x4 do I need to use in the rice in like do I only need to use like a like a little bit of like wood to toss in there or do I need to use like a chunk of it so you gotta remember the laws of thermodynamics right matter can never be created either be created nor destroyed so what you have is what you'll get so if you once you put that in that's what you can get out of it yeah so what I'm saying is like if I take a 2x4 and I take it it's not like you're planting a wooden tree or like a wooden plant and it's gonna sprout into a giant 2x4 it it's not how that works like you take a little bit of the 2x4 right just like a little hair off the top okay you're acting like we can clone too - [ __ ] you throw in the risin risin I wanna make a I wanna use this to make a two-by-four this guy is immediately regretting his decision to come on here I want you you know what I expected no less but I still love you anyway I guess I'm just viewing nonsense you get there you know asking questions is the most important part of learning so at some point he's gonna ask enough that he'll learn questions although they get very close do you have any other brain-busters for us to talk about go Jags I hope you guys I hope we all get back to normal life and football soon and thanks keeping the podcast going well thank you for listening thanks for coming on yes appreciate you coming on as well that I feel like we really needed an actual I'm always available anytime you guys want to talk science or engineering out like copy that wait that sounds like a ok wait that sounds like a tight like like Rob's corner part of the podcast where we get some burger on to actually explain the science that were oh ok absolutely absolutely thank you thunder go yeah keep it trill guys all right I will say blue I've learned plenty about the lava Quillin exchange from a Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood have you been why how far are you in oh I'm clearly not that far because you said you something about I'm only like 6 in right now but they're constantly like by the law of equivalent exchange and it makes me feel smart like yeah yes I I understand this and he's like wait a minute this guy can ignore the law of equivalent exchange how is that possible but we don't have any more time that's very good very good for the rest of this podcast episode 30 V live collar episode has come to an end be sure to give your feedback if you're a viewer comment down below if you're not a listening and give a review if you would like us to do these more in the future there are some people who were waiting to get pulled in that we couldn't get to so we already have enough for another episode if we want to just pull upon the people who were already waiting and got vetted but we had fun the cool thing too was just all the different topics that well it's a random episode but we didn't have to make it random I think for us I think what blue said like summed it up everybody who is a lot more interesting and cooler and smarter than we are they really are man they really are so I don't know what they're doing watching us or listening to us but we you know what I I know what it is they listen and watch us to feel better like oh well I caught at least I'm not a damn you I'm not stupid yeah least um so hey I'll take that I guess right find you on the internet if you guys can find me at in a solid state of matter over app you can find me in gas form on twitch.tv slash yvv and Instagram and Twitter you can find me in the laboratory cloning would over at mr. fruit I hated on somewhere either expert telling you here who's like no a newly Claus had to be a would molecular so I said what if I threw a little bit of we had a little bit left and then he's like a lot of thermodynamics but then you're like what if like I'm like yeah he's like dynamic I just put a piece of wood in there good thanks for wishing in this house for the podcast okay look at you guys soon love you [Music]
