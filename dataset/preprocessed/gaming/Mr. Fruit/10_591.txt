hi 80 Hogan my name's mr. fruit and welcome back the call duty modern warfare and in today's video a brand new weapons been added this time however the first new sniper rival the right check a.m. oh wow would you look at that however I'll be using the brand new blueprint for the weapon damnation what in tarnation but in order to unlock said weapon get three quick scoped skills using sniper or marksman rifles in 15 different mattress so I'll get busy doing that here soon but in the meantime its shoot the [ __ ] baby look at this thing I'm a race car driver or something like that I'm not entirely sure what the the aesthetic is but it certainly seems like I'm Lightning McQueen reincarnated let me just mount up here boom oh my god did you hear that though mmm it's crispy it's delicious and all around I'm a fan although I'm getting pushed off of my perch here I'm not real appreciate now I'm not sure if it's an attachment you get later or something but I dunno everyone was talking about the explosive rounds you can get on the sucker and how nutty they are oh I also forget that it is semi-auto all right be careful be quiet what a flank what a kill oh wait wait what oh my wait okay watch man the kick on this thing is oh so real thought you're just trying to fire through the smoke oh I see these little rascals douche or Real Talk though this thing means BISM my ass oh yeah I guess I'll take that kill totally deserve that oh it is tough trying to reset after one shot leave this thing douche it takes no prisoners even worse apparently just just completely bypasses and ignores all that you need a convention stuff it's like yeah we don't care alright that's kind of like super bad but oh but that wasn't oh but that was it still feels like and well quite honestly it might be that I have to still unlock every gun that's like unlockable for the most part I'm telling you I used to be real grinder here so I have Damascus but I feel like that like that was that was it mic winding just stopped it's like a can keep doing it captain so I just need to start Omega multitasking and doing like six or seven different things every match like boom three kills of this alright swap boom did this okay pop boom switch this top yeah is this like a one shot anywhere in the body cuz that's certainly what it feels like oh oh that was a head shot of course it will wait I didn't even see you you blend it and wait enemy white phosphorus wait a second I heard it but it didn't register and now it does jet come on oh thank you very much alright we're gonna sit right behind here where it's nice safe and I don't die from careful careful okay okay the dude just spa ah I didn't think it would see me he spawned it like hold on hold on hold on stay hidden wait he can't see me he didn't see me okay I could have sworn he like spawned it right here he's hiding around here somewhere maybe he's not not missed classic missed classic dead classic and style points with the slide Oh the slide into the quickscope mr. fruit you rascal you Naughty Dog you Oh deep dive dodge duck I'm alive enemy UAV overhead let's see if we can deal with that with this thing oh Sh oh Sh oh Sh Boosh okay yeah I'll do it quick scope it shot collateral oh my that felt good I bet this thing is a monster in war zone especially whitsett explosive rounds probably use those against like vehicles and stuff oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my I need to steal my heart before it cannot handle this okay let me get in on this never mind I want out watch that prevent and join the progress okay great yeah see this isn't my fault team wow I already unlocked Damascus on this I'm the best we are gonna play on the new treasurer Park 24/7 I haven't played this map yet so my rifle on the map that I don't know perfect I just want to talk about how strange it is that we haven't heard anything about the new call of duty this year nothing every other year we'd know what we're getting by now we would have seen some stuff but who knows uh welcome to trash hog mirrors oh just hopping on in Italy that's okay I'm getting a little overview of the map from here oh yeah I know exactly what's going on here well what game are we playing don't tell me there's a search in this joint oh it's hard point okay I was gonna say oh my god all right I'm assuming this is like a mega long line of sight maybe maybe not hey let me add dissect this the map actually looks kind of small that's nice okay evidently they are over oh they're right here what bro I could have sworn my sights were on right on the guy oh that one was though okay thank you came gonna say you've been deflating me a little bit could have sworn I'm hitting some of these but oh whatever oh there's another one oh my gotta get lit up oh yeah go ahead and mount up on your little Doctor Who phone booth oh my oh my what the fudge did I just die to wait what um don't know how my oh my teammate didn't see that but I'm not gonna ask questions most I'm not gonna ask why they spawn right behind me but that's neither here nor there because it's a new lease on life I can open the door hello I'm going to capture this point I hope you do not mind oh oh what's this music okay okay wait I was jammin bro I was just straight vibin why you got a doobie like that not on my watch no not as long as I have the right check Wow okay UAV takes more heads than that or less rather hold on Jesus oh my god wow that thing is whew and it is American engineer German engine suite it who engineers that oh my what a little flick there I messed our throat well drag scope at nope not on my watch not on my watch see I feel like feel like most would take their time maybe try and sit in the back with the sniper not me we all W as do with literally every other gun ever in Call of Duty because that's the only way I know how to play video games doesn't matter what I'm using at the end of the day I'm Alden w just like that see so quick scope it makes me feel alpha so alpha yes push no radar up in the air we realize it's gonna take a lot giveme thing where's my personal reader why isn't it give me eyes in the sky well myself might have to be because there's no one near me oh he's dead oh no he's dead hi oh I'm disowning oh jesus what a frag throw I'm trying to slowly but surely move my way up here I haven't been to this part of the map this is all new to me I will say though oh yeah gosh dang it if my teammates staff actually play in the game and doing what they're supposed to do and kill on the enemy I would have killed the enemy yeah what are those sticks though I gotta get me some of those let's look like a lot of fun oh ah what is going on here oh oh get turned on did I'm embarrassed for you bruh okay oh fudge ah fudge

elephant in the room otherwise that's like it just it just all goes to oh what wait what wait what wait what oh okay Oh mr. fruit mr. fruit mr. Frickey law rascal yo I just actually thought about it does using this blueprint count towards the quick go kills for unlocking the sniper rifle if they don't I'll be up coming come on book your little head that oh oh shoot okay like yes it's not a one shot anywhere yes it's got to be like chest or above or all Jim takes it oh that's a good throw that one felt good just coming off the hands you know what I'm saying nope did not kill a soul all right they're probably hiding in one of these corners they are what about what did I tell you ah Jesus just mowing us down out there cap dead we need backup okay I am the backup oh my god I am the backup I am the one who knocks fudge [Music] quickscoped I'm serious one oh oh oh oh my mr. saucy saucy sauce here dr. taki doctor here this would seriously be my favorite card if they just removed skill based matchmaking I mean at this point I'm used to it yes but I know what more it could be and if I didn't have to sweat every game I'd be great I mean I'm holding out hope because destiny you know reverted there SP mmm but at the same time I'm also not hopeful at all because this is apparently like the most successful Call of Duty which just means SPMS here to stay Oh what uh what a kill what a kill brah I need to snipe some more apparently I think I've got a knack foot I have a knack for it in deed that was nasty that was filthy pardon me I gotta go take a shower after that one I am filthy nothing never gonna oh wow it's like stop mr. fruit got me the career killer cuz that's all I'm doing right now oh there's a dude right here as you dude right here - right buddy - right - right never mind you're fine I guess Oh nope oh I found him this is a saucy game right now I'm telling you what and we're talking good sauce I'm talking like Alfredo with some protein added at Olive Garden kind of saucy fettuccine alfredo with sausage you get it every time and then you get an extra link hmm I could go for that right now but I've been dieting and that would literally break like everything been trying to work for in one meal but God do I want to do it right now anyway it sounds so good why does fettuccine alfredo have to be so bad for you what is most delicious tasting food have to be bad for you ah oh oh that guy hadn't come from behind oof we were about to apply for a sniping team phase win you know what I'm saying vert survey says yes The Blueprint does count for the unlock criteria so that's nice in theory I'll just have it like max level by the time I unlock it I gotta say that is one a Krispie sniper I don't think I've unlocked these explosive rounds everyone's making a big fuss about so that's exactly what I need to do so with that said thanks for much for watching happy Tulsa fantastic I'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] [Music]
