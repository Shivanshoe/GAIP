some call of duty and i'm ready to get back into it because i'm gonna be honest i just like completely skipped cold war and this is gonna be running on the exact same engine modern warfare was which has me excited because as you all know i really enjoyed modern warfare bear in mind we're playing on playstation and i use i believe it or not i used to be good with the controller couldn't that was long like six seven years ago so a little rusty anyway enjoy the video this poor guy at the main screen though just endlessly walking you look so sad it's like my feet are killing me help me all right

absolute potato yeah rob said the controller get them out yeah like ac130 it'll be ic130 above uh so just click the little button below the playstation so it's orange yeah it's yeah yeah well i still hear you i have a ps5 dude you don't need how to use the ps4 well i mean oh wait does that mean i'm gonna hear my team out of this thing though okay well uh this is only duos so don't worry about it uh so anyway we're playing champion hill champion hill what does that mean it's our only option uh i don't know much it's eight teams and essentially it's like a big 2v2 tournament so at all times there are two teams pitted against each other on different maps all at once wait what yeah like last team standing wins or something huh so we have to really like come on now like you remember we were the tourney winners in modern warfare i mean that was that was modern warfare anaheim what circa 2018. 20 2019 something like that yeah yeah that was uh and then after that we didn't record it but we
