that's a lot of damage chief that's a whole lot of damage spoilers oh jesus christ oh sweet moses i am right there booze oh my that'll do it be careful okay titans what do titans do hi eddie everyone my name is mr root and welcome back to destiny 2. and today is an important video because i'm here to set the record straight to put somebody in their place more specifically that's somebody being a data song data does destiny datto dad oh i don't know how you refer to him to me lover you know if you watched him roast my vault for a little over an hour then you know during the video well the key phrase was like in in a couple of weeks in a month you will just completely forget about because the true meaningful things you'll want to keep but things like that you'll forget that you even had them when was the last time you used this and as it turns out um for most of my guns i was like never but that's not the point there was a certain gun the warden's law which i could have sworn i made a video on but as we learned we didn't roll the footage my guess is that you used it for a youtube video yeah and then probably never touched it again yeah so i told him i'm gonna make a video on it just to show him for him for me you guys heard it so i'm here to stick up my end of the bargain and granted he didn't really say he didn't believe that i wouldn't do it it it's just making me believe that he doesn't believe in me is all right i'm confusing everybody crossfire increase is is this what i want actually i don't um uh i don't really whatever sure drop mag increased real speed reduces magazine size yeah we're going to go with that are we what is this great increase i don't want to decrease range how many more bullets does that only gives us two more belts kill clip reel and after kill grant to increase damage and rangefinder you know you love it everybody loves okay well i love rangefinder handling whatever but see here's the uh the big thing if you don't know what ward's laws it's a nightfall exclusive drop from that one warden's prison thing served her at the end i don't know but the intrinsic trait double fire hard hitting twin fire rounds that's right it's got two barrels for two bullets double the shots you shoot once but you shoot twice you see what i'm saying so i'm finally here to use it i could have sworn i made a video on this it was just a fever dream or maybe i recorded edited and just forgot to upload it it's been lost to the lady time i don't really know but today we're gonna we're gonna see how it does in pvp it's real old it's it's sunset i know that but guess what pvp doesn't care about that well that's not trials and not important so warden's law here we go the anomaly man there's two words i never want to see on my screen well okay i don't care about the but anomaly okay those two words in sequence thirty thousand crucible kill 16 000 i have 1200 oh my god we got some gamers let's see i don't need to uh flaunt i might have this many kills but what they don't know is that i enemy i don't know that's it's all the kills i have i don't i don't really know what else all right here we go so i'm out okay and i'm dead frozen and dead let's look at this thing all right i know i'm like years late to the party perfect boom you see that look at that boosh okay well when you're when you're too close it boosh okay that's just a better c two balls so once i want to know if it shows two different damage numbers when i had them step one need to hit something yeah that'll that'll do it uh spoilers it does not appear to but it does appear to do something damage was that 98 million to the face or something like that algofascis i don't know it was a lot though i'm just not good with numbers it's hard to conceptualize big numbers like anything above not it's double-digit numbers actually oh what you couldn't my anus how do you there's how i was strong siding how's he going to say that he can see oh my look dudes 92 the dog booze booze oh my mister fruit you saucy minx we got kill clip this okay well it helps if you can hit leave the reload speed though huh yeah you like that we can three tap uh i guess if okay okay i'm just gonna take a little little breather here little r r don't mind me i made it myself oh my god i am of a different breed i know it yeah yeah sir wait why what what okay i fat fingered so many i meant to no excuses 92 though with kill clip i could be too tapping but i don't think i've hit anything with kill club yet so jesus god give me a chance man is anybody gonna do something about this deli meat man prosciutto that's a it's a type of meat right i just know i don't i don't really prefer it but he's just sitting over here having a little picnic minding not minding his own business frankly because he's all up in ours but we're just letting him do it well he's never going to learn you got to you set these kids straight that wasn't my kill so no kill clip sad i'm crazy i'm crazy i'm not running in there i'm not that crazy okay all right well i'm dead crazy okey dokey come on huh try me wow what get the pressure wrong what kind of shotgun is that wrench can i can i have it because i think this one mr fruit yeah okay he's just running it what the uh guys go guys hello oh my god i'm fragging why aren't they okay ready to watch hello oh what what was that what marion i'm a real is that is that a fruit i have a hard time believing that's real guys i see the problem now i have no internet well i have to go flip some breakers or yell at somebody on the phone i don't know i'll be right back later in the void ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the dumpster fire that is this video headed back into control because what could go wrong because what went wrong with the internet i don't know will it happen again also i don't know how many questions so no answers no answers none at all not even a few just no answers wait you know what really happened centurylink the homies were like oh you're playing the anomaly oh say less we got you what is that abomination of a titan look at this thing i love it 24 000 kills goodness gracious he's a grinder what is the range on the warden's law you might ask and in return i would ask you the same thing because i don't know the answer but together we're about to find out at what point does i do i stop oh hey it gave me two damage numbers uh at that range clearly not both of them are spreading out a little too far so not really connecting i also did 25 damage cumulatively so not something to write home about i am absolutely cracked out of my mind get destroyed still getting used to this monitor though it's like i'm at the front row of the movie theater it's a little too big i'm too close and i can't do anything about it i'll have to figure something out my setup is not exactly uh ah what is the word i'm looking for well it's not the play i was looking for that dude wait is that eight hundred six thousand kills that's not that's cap right that can't what was his name heart statement what is it tracking that has to be like valor right there's no way he has 806 000 kills like i don't know if that's possible is it that's a lot of kills what um what was i talking about before i got so distracted aka oh modular that's the word i was looking look at this strong side though hey what really oh i pissed ola um i hope that's a reference speaking of halo 2 i got your pistola great halo player playing right now i believe again on optic and halo infinite watched raleigh halo championship event that was cool that's cool that's irrelevant tell you that it has nothing to do with this you guys could not care less i can only amount it's okay it's okay i'm fine also what the fudge should i do the volume i can't hear a penis a penis could be making noise right now i could not hear it where's master volume i'm very conscious of my hearing you know if you're young you still have your youth be careful okay once you hurt your ears and you're hearing there's no going back i have always been vigilant but a lot of my friends are not so lucky i'm stuck that did negative damage okay like for instance my friend once upon a time when like skull candies first came out or whatever they or skull crushers i don't know either way you would think with a name like that it'd be the first red flag right but he got him and blew out the speakers on him because he was playing him too loud and every while they were in his ear and now he's very hard of hearing you can barely hear anything so i that's what i do with ooh shoes get pooped on that's what i do with uh everything that you know you can never be too careful yo what up dude boosh stupid got him yeah he thought he could okay i don't have a sniper so oh nice try what are the what what the what is this oh my god that dude he do oh my god he do be skating and i run out of bullets i would have actually killed him okay if it was a normal gun but like see the the spread i mean like that's just not it's that's not as bad as i thought all right well that's not an excuse i mean it is at you know just ridiculous ranges but yeah at what point is anyone ever using a hand can that range the point is okay okay this map sucks for like what am i what am i doing what am i doing here i don't know what i didn't even get the kill like i'm actually not playing oh my god oh my god you're nuts over the flight no worth save me now you might was that really worth it you might ask it's about the equivalent of probably like what one kill which you could have gotten had you not fallen off and wasted time yes but i mean look i wouldn't have gotten this orb so think about it like that it it granted me opportunities that i had yet even thought to look at or perceive and i have kill clip and for once for the love of all that is good and holy may i actually use it upon somebody's i'm not molding your molding in order to mold one must be bolding and as far as i'm aware i'm not my hair simply just the hairline's receding that's different it was that golden gun what the fudge kind of thought that was golden gun for a second what the fudge is that that is a sword hello yeah nice try stupid loose let's try stupid here we go ready brady really really that felt good i'm gonna be honest the release and everything like that was a that was a spiral that wasn't an ugly duckling in the air i mean that was that was nice wow we're in the lead oh my god by a lot well known part by me that's for sure what you stole that that was too bruh bruh hold on bro i gotta kill this point all right let's do a little oh you like that oh yeah wow wow i can't i get these two kills to make sure my knee right here why is that mom shut up and play gekki and kill the greatest dipping balls all day three minutes you're winning well that's where i didn't realize open mic was on that's crazy all right well oh what the what the what just ow ow bro leave me alone come on ohana means family family sticks to family stays behind i don't really remember the phrase i i could have sworn shenanigan arena finest degree oh nice kd there the ice skating stupid oh get the freaking back yeah yeah that's right there we go we won't get interrupted this time right there yeah my man oh jesus back back back back back where you go your death was not in vain my friend has his mom come to reclaim his son's glory he ruined my sunscreen eraser it was an honor my friend dilly dilly i bend the knee did i get a little toxic in there maybe no shame in my game look at all that hard effort senpai and i have like the same combat efficiency you make me sick all right hey what about a um rumble test i'm certainly not hopping in ranked can't do trials and what are the other ones team scorched physically i'm pretty sure i can't even drop the scorch cannon so i can't even use the warden's law and then i don't know what the other playlist is i'm gonna be honest elimination i think so like unranked ranked no thanks every guardian for themselves you don't say it's almost like it's rumble wow pov uh you're playing fps but you've never played an fps in your life is what i wish i could say but that's not the case i handed it over to my dog who actually unfortunately this is no meme oppa did just recently man i just finally was able to hit someone with a kill clip why you gotta be like that why you gotta why do all of you have to be like this uh oh yeah yeah uh day after christmas for what bro i s it was laggy i'm not i'm not crazy you kind of see on the death thing he like swear to god because like i was like all right track the track the track that the fudge oh i'm dead nice rocket stupid [Laughter] kill clip where you at where you at i got kill clip boos oh my but it seemed like he was already weak okay well regardless i did lo bro kill clip's gone nanda two to the dome skip yeah yeah well he's that little flickeroni yeah i did my favorite kind of pasta right behind rigatoni you know we have rigatoni flipperoni fettuccine come on chase me make my dick that man was swinging for the fences like i'm the box and he's like yeah lunge already come on bro neither of us are warlocks or don't they have the same range now or something i don't actually know i don't know how they differentiate maybe they how do they differentiate actually i think they changed it or something but i think like hunters still melee the fastest maybe warlocks are the farthest and titans titans titans what do titans do you're in first place i'm not i'm not trying to be toxic or like titan's free we don't have i'm not like serious like what do we do of that oof i don't know i don't really know i was done i don't know man okay i don't make the rules i don't even follow him actually i don't even know the rules maybe that melee or melee that's a grenade mr fruit what see that dirt shot dude there's something about the warren's lots a little sassy but here's the there's so it's like some of these shot was that oh that's a real spawn that just happened huh wow wow i literally got spawned getting shot at and at a range i can't contest as you all saw there it's frankly pathetic yeah oh are they on me are they around me oh thank you you had some heavy ammo and you brought it to me i appreciate you okay go wolf backgrounds he's like oh my god i survived is not what he gets to
