that was my number one answer all right you don't want to buy an island no why would you do that that's a waste of money hi there everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to more jack box shenanigans with my friends this time some more pull mine where we're pitted against not only each other sometimes but also twitch chat so i mean come on you know us versus a hive mind we should win right guys we we should win [Music] hello is anyone out there yeah i think we're excited too many cooks in the kitchen over here on ratio that's true why is tar not in the top three what's wrong with you guys i feel like tar is totally what's stickiest it's gonna be based off of other people's votes yeah well other people are stupid oh there we go no it's because i play overwatch what are you talking don't even try to pretend no that's just what you're talking about you know what that's that's fair what where you would have so you are going to pick your top three in order as to who you are at the nightclub so this is what most people would think they are at the moment what you are you you consider yourself to be yes and then after that we're gonna vote based off of uh what we think the other people chose yeah they had my number one at a nightclub i know no no because that's the whole give everybody all right ratios all right we vote for the one yelling woo because it's pretty safe do you do you think that's what i think would do though no this isn't check chad no chad is also part of that there's a third team oh they are this is a bunch of gamers so i feel i feel like chad is a bunch of introverts they're all wall huggers they don't want to be a part of it i agree but who wants to admit that they're a wall hugger i i mean it said be honest be honest i know you're not going to be honest for your own pride wait what i'm scared i'm scared why i gotta pick i'm okay with going scott taker or the one yelling show i think i think second i think of an important one that we're all kind of missing here is the song requester i think everything i think that's that's pretty solid that's it's not so much you're talking to the dj it's you're trying to set that atmosphere of the party i know when i'm at the party it's like yo i got that that's a little too ballsy i say we go with the one yelling woo but i'll i'll i'll follow you into the door there's no way number one is walker and then number two is yelling whoo like you can you know yeah they're against the wall the wait that wasn't one of our time all right i think now we go with the one yelling yeah i'm gonna be honest i even put down the one yelling blue so they chose two ones that they actually were and then they're like ah it says to be honest yeah that's what i did so you just kind of like psychoanalyze me and i'm not okay with it but all right well somebody oh there we go it's all good come on get the [ __ ] out of here see even they guessed it incorrectly okay i feel that i let me just say anybody that watches us doesn't get [ __ ] because this is true significant okay so either lightweight or instagrammer i i feel like there's there's [ __ ] everywhere what if what if we have the [ __ ] watching us all right song requests there's no way i don't yeah no way oh yeah let's go this is a night club i'm glad i got raised what i mean that's what it is wow literally i chose song requester while hugger woo so yeah i i chose uh one i chose all the ones that pretty much didn't involve i didn't take shot taking a part of it uh i actually didn't do shot taker for nothing like that's the last thing i want to do you've been parting it up since oh well this is going to be easy wait what was the worst time for the groom to get cold feet and leave their own wedding [Laughter] these are all bad that's pretty like that is by far guys we got a ratio there is a guaranteed number one ratio of them i think there is a lot of a lot of these are pretty bad though honestly i think there's a guarantee i think i think one two and three are obvious yeah but i don't know what number four is i think you guys are all wrong yeah boom get ratio i just ratio my own team we're on your team yeah get ready yeah cool bird watchers like to watch birds i think that's right wait are the speeches yeah that's why you guys are over there requesting songs okay oh my god this is not true i love my wife all right wait no put the gun down babe good let's switch up the rules for this round you'll need to find the answers ranked two three and four oh number two hold on hold on unanimously let's say what we think is number one we're not going to vote okay during the vows yeah yeah i think kissing's a safe two three or four i yeah 100 percent 100 number one no i'm thinking you may kiss the bride and then no yeah but see like if he's gonna leave i feel like he's already no it's after actually i would go with the bride walking down the aisle but i think the rest of us that's what i think number two they're split this is good i don't think number two it's number one no that's crazy which one is it one no way that is absolutely wow that's what i know that's is number one bro like that vows comedy movie or whatever yeah i guess that makes you think about your future no but vows is like you're professing your love like this is why we're together that's what i'm saying like think of any romantic movie when they like leave it's like around the vows that's what i'm saying yeah it's either vowels or yeah just do well just go balance because it has to be second yeah [Music] you guys are so off right now no this is just the audio walking i like the aisle play yeah one too four is going to be hard okay because i i personally said during this speech i did too joey it might be hard but the groom won't be i'll say it's either speech or first hand so no cap yeah i do not see that joke coming yeah so where are we what are we going to do and uh the the bride won't either so i'm gonna go for this she also won't be hard but i think i'm going to go with first dance here yeah i think it's a good idea i'll follow you into the dark room i think speeches because yeah because it's it's basically like valentine's day [Laughter] together with his wife you know something's right and he just leaves oh my god dude we're killing it they're nice get ratio see i i chose everything befo before they actually like like consecrate it because i was shocked well you had to pick four up yeah they appear to be i think ratios win quite a bit right now actually we're winning because we our team names mean we're gonna get ratio that's what we were shooting for no it doesn't no it doesn't hey hey burger ratio shut up watch your dad all right how many of these are five of them what i did mine i feel like these are pretty truthful yeah um to at least who i am you know yeah yeah yeah the kind of swimmer i am yeah you are you are though called the michael phelps of our generation yeah if michael phelps had no arms or legs maybe [Laughter] i'm a terrible i'm a terrible swimmer very very if he'd been if he didn't have any arms or legs he's practically a dolphin so yeah he just needs a fin and he's good to go don't touch the exact unless you've got [ __ ] i think this one's going to be like bottom line yeah i feel like we have to get the bomb yeah probably yeah because the number one the ones that aren't yeah oh god i'm so smart there are ghosts didn't get picked shark i'm honored to know you dude like thank you you're the reason the raiders have a chance i can't believe there's generational oh my god generational talent and reigns in this call right now like that's not you'll no longer gain toys oh my god we have one we're about to be out of the game we have no we win these when you're on your last torch and you answer incorrectly the game is not immediately over that's good we need to provide a correct answer to eliminate that very we're going to have to get like everyone right easy we will get everyone if they we need them to go first and we need them to screw up they are going first they are going to scream okay all right okay i'm gonna be honest i wish we went first because i feel like eighth is obvious yep i think eighth is obvious eight yeah yeah yeah i think it's i simply will not who doesn't no way dude i don't like the pool that was yeah i'm not getting it i'm not getting it i'm not getting it that's not eight that's nice is one of the top ones because you want to get it okay you just oh yeah yeah all right boys is clearly the bottom yeah i don't think slow creeping is very obvious i think it's probably either slow creeping people is safe for later because it's like you don't need to get in the cold water a small creeper is like a worse way why would you go to the pool to not go to the pool but it's holy water floaty but i don't know what you guys think right would you want to slowly creep in too cold you got 10 seconds fruit i think that is so dumb that sounds so unpleasant listen who in the right mind is our first thing to do is go floaty oh we gotta get if we steps audience what about what about being tossed who wants to be tossed by a friend i mean that's true i hate that i got my phone on me [ __ ] like that yeah what do you think we finished you guys got destroyed i i have taught why instead slowly just hate it why is there an electrical outlet in a cave i know it's the majority but majority's problem all right you guys are wack we're cultured this is a stupid game we're doing it again what oh sure we're too busy to see interviews i liked this one this one's fun i wish we didn't have the audience because they didn't know they're done i mean we can we can cover the code i think number one is going to be very obvious hey reuben what if like you stop talking about all right cause guess what ruben we've we've both been in agreeance i think every time on what we think the number one answer is and we've been wrong every time no but here's the thing here's the thing i probably there is an audience yeah so we're still gonna be wrong okay no but we're gonna be right on this one in a pandemic if someone sneezes now it would be a guttural responsiveness not great nose juice one billion percent without a shout out i in a pandemic you're not going to go like no like dude you're going to go great nose dude like yo great nose just keep it up i i got ratios right i'm not gonna lie i i saw that one laughed and immediately chose it as my notifications this is why the votes are so screwed up because some people are like that's funny and then they choose it i mean those are the right ones just [Applause] because it's funny because it sounds like uh yeah if great nose juices thank you so much i'm in like the top percentile that makes sense because like this is this is i'm losing brain cells you don't like great nose suits it's nice i don't think they're gonna go for the wonder bar dang it man okay yeah i didn't love that choice shark but i really i thought i think i'm gonna congratulations i'm not gonna say anything to be fair no no no no no probably is a high one as well uh honest don't trust me it i don't know i don't know i like that and put it back i like congratulations if the zoomer says put it back then he's probably right yeah and congratulations he's a zoomer and he plays overwatch man he thinks differently all right i'm 20. he knows he's like dead man oh my god i'm not the youngest one here anymore yeah yep okay so what do you think it is reuben i think it's congratulations or put it back [Music] put it back come on no let's go let's go dodge accountability and say it was better than one of our okay all right boys don't worry we get a redemption we get our redemption here it's gotta be no no no no i think i i i think no no no no no like that one oh my god the punisher i know for a fact that the other one all solutions all right so we're playing against the audience this time so we're all waiting at least this time if i'm upset i only have the audience to be upset i'm gonna dump store on this audience dude we give up we chose we give up [Laughter] audience is just griefing and just choosing the worst that's what i'm convinced is they've just decided that they're going to mess with us you guys just can't be confident about this one i feel like y'all should listen to me about this one okay this one's different though because like as a kid i've always wanted to be a pop star my number one thing okay well we're not gonna stay awake okay shut up my number one thing i love a dramatic makeover um hey waste the money europe with other people celebrities movie cameo obviously movie cameo party with other sleds yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a good one that's a good one yeah yeah yeah yeah you're lucky you're lucky okay so confused i want to say that's what i'm saying my answer is i know what it is that's such a waste of money actually griefing they are no doubt did they only choose mr fruit did mr fruit become a god at this game uh yeah get destroyed that was my one two and three and then movie cameo number four [Applause] so you are trying to make your dream boss anything you don't choose though they will not have hate to make mr fruit these are all great because success uplifts others empathizes this is all wait say that again joey no are you trying to say i don't have any of those qualities communicates effectively oh this is who he's like it's the entire list man this would be great if fruit had any of these qualities for this round you'll need to find the answers ranked two three and four there it is oh it's me i'm looking sorry what do we think number one is uplifters difficult decisions oh no oh okay so what can we find like a two or three here what about inspires i put in spyro i think i think inspires pretty much i did put inspire i had inspired four okay personally though communicate effectively is is gotta be number one i like inspires inspire i like inspires inspires let's do it [Music] wait no that's number one like lets you eat too it's like so i'm saying let's just disregard anything shark is saying the rest of us that's it i'm choosing oh my god wait i like that though oh [Applause] let me reiterate that they said if you don't choose it they won't have it which means they put others down you want that in your box it doesn't necessarily mean yes it just means you know they're just obviously man i think like recognize success care about me don't worry don't worry don't worry they get this one wrong they get number one i think i think in today's generation recognizing success is really important let's go number not everybody because i don't know what i'm going to have i'm taking the shot here nobody wants to be recognized in our chat apparently huh oh my god well they get it for free well uplifts others with seven there's no way pretty much the same thing is going to be higher yeah people don't care no one wants positive reinforcement i think clear vision is really good and you guys should vote for it if you guys don't that was crazy please leave a like and i mean think about the head of the project if they don't have a clear vision like empathy the one i spearheaded was right okay so whatever dude spearhead these nuts i'm glad we all thought the same thing was gonna the five things i just chose honestly is easily nominated this is not gonna be the backwards one yeah it's gonna be literally just war horses who is meryl streep i know who meryl streep is come on jerry saved himself movie movie meryl streep is in okay i didn't say i knew any movies i just googled and these are the people i'm having to make decisions with i will say we only have one match just like last time we've been here before bryce this is number one i know number one is gonna be meryl streep because there are that's a good choice out of all those choices you're gonna play the movie with chris evans and that little girl who's really smart that's a great movie i was thinking of uh i i don't think they are what i think they're all gonna choose doomed horse now and win the game [Music] i think what we've learned today is that i know our audience the best i agree i prefer to live in my little bubble all right i also like my bubble where i don't know everything i think is right and what everyone else thinks is wrong okay let's keep it that way that's not a bubble that's just reality if it makes you feel better our team name from the very beginning was we give up i'm not this makes me depressed [Music] [Music] you
