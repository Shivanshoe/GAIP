guy came behind me i called snapped and hit him with laurence i put myself in a corner so they rushed i popped my rift froze them does that freeze and then i i once shot meleed him i got the titan but he popped it so immediately popped super i have no idea dude i was dude we beat a team that was 190. i was in uh like no no health on my bar dude seriously like his shotgun if one more pellet hit or if he was closer it wouldn't happen i know i was like how did you survive when you pop that rift in his face like it's like something lift on this part right i don't know that was incredible binder man stasis versus void that's the greatest thing i've ever seen that's so awesome to witness i was so hyped good team to choke that way like damn they just gave it like they threw it away they were choking but they choked bubbles that's how they lost that game i wonder what would have happened to when four four like that would have been a different story man put that in the cool clip folder i shadow played the entire card i gotta i gotta clear my my drive man this one's running out golden tricorn there it is how perfect is that dude well then try corn i mean we missed on uh the mags but
