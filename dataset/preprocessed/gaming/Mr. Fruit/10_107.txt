hi there everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video a special video because for christmas i asked santa daddo to well help make space for some presents i have a hoarding problem i always have my vault has practically been 500 out of 500 since i don't know years my my character inventory is always full like i i can't just move things around it's always a pain so i said hey dado i need you to come man there tell me what's good tell me what's not and i'll put it this way dado said this was like the worst one he's ever had to clean and i don't think that's a badge of honor so enjoy the video she's got a new 4k monitor so yeah so although i can already tell i'm not getting my frames man okay it's winter cleaning most people do spring but i have acquired the best what kind of a title would you give yourself uh vault cleaner um yeah a vault cleaner you know removal specialist oh yeah i'll say luke curator there you go yeah i was like i work in a museum yeah okay so 490 out of five hundo all right yeah let me well let me let me put i recently courtesy of chat actually cleaned out a little bit so if you think this is bad just know it was worse i didn't say you did clean out a little bit there's only 10 slots yeah because that's the problem is every time i get new loot i'm like all right switch i'm full delete like one replace um because i'm a hoarder dado okay all right and i i also mainly blame content because i'm always like well what if you know i want to go back and use the nine hunger jesus okay if you [Laughter] look i don't know datto okay when it comes to rolls i'm confused like like i i this was full of tokens that that yeah like that is just like for fun like it literally says on the item this item serves no purpose right it says it right there but yeah i saw that but you can't get them anymore yeah we'll get them out of here okay where do you want to start let's just go page by let me just go ahead and start i don't know what this is doing here okay this is awkward i swear i do a better job could have been like a dim like rotating your guns out so yeah i've had that happen a couple of times where just like a blue gets heated into your vault for no reason um okay let's start with a lot of these retired weapons um okay you just want to go left right around okay um but generally speaking uh does it have a kill count that means a lot to you like does does it have a kill count that you're like especially proud of because for me i think the the limit where you could start appreciating a weapon or at least where i can start appreciating a weapon that is retired is probably in the five figure kill count so okay let me just go ahead and say this you're not going to appreciate any of my retirement okay okay so let's see let's see some of these kill counts here like what do you got okay 1307 that's nothing okay let's see i was gonna say that might be one okay that's one of your highest 125 okay let's keep keep it going one this one that's crucible that's crucible okay okay yeah crucible uh zero zero like i probably got that i've never even used it but like what if i do what if i do that's not even masterwork but here's here's the thing about what like what if i do end up using it is how long ago did you get it and then say to yourself what if i do use it and then how long has it been all right like how long has it been since you got nameless midnight with zero kills on it and we're like maybe someday you know how long is destiny been out this is exactly this is a perfect example of get rid of it does it does it mean anything to you like that you're gonna have a hard time like look i'm like that guy you come in on those like tlc shows or whatever and their house is a mess and they're like wait don't touch that i need that i'm just gonna do it myself so it's like no big deal and it's been buried under like 20 pounds like but why do you need why do you need that i don't have an emotional type but at the same time it's giving me an emotional reaction thinking about deleting it what's the reaction that you're getting though when you're thinking about deleting it regret you know why why would you regret it i'm just thinking down the line i'm like man if only i had that name was midnight i'd never used all right find out all right i'll give you the nameless midnight there we go in in a couple of weeks in a month whatever there's going to be a lot of things in here that like you will just completely forget about because the true meaningful things you'll want to keep but things like that you'll forget that you even had him and it's not going to matter he doesn't mean that name was midnight there is no more nameless midnight um let's well let's let's get some numbers here okay that's 539 okay i mean and that's not that's not technically retired yet so like that's no within reason we have some non-masterworked retired items let's go let's just do that second row there okay at the trigger high impact i heard that's good i've heard that's i mean it's not bad but okay firmly planted full auto firmly planted wrong side of right 150 rpm okay here's well here's the other thing is i generally don't dismantle if i don't have another one even if it's a garbage roll okay for that same kind of i it's see i i would understand that okay that's a good move i would understand that if it was like the only kinetic 150 rpm scout rifle kind of a deal or it's like it'll be meta soon man like i swear but for something like that where there's already way better scout rifles that you can go get right now doesn't need to be there especially when it's retired what else uh dust rock blues that had its time to shine it it certainly did is it shining right now no do you have a masterwork on it no no i put it i put a shader on it though you did you did put a shader on it i don't remember that we don't even we don't even know tracker on this thing i don't need one datto okay all right you got me online there you go well it's locked like see this is my passion i can tell you how to unlock if you want look at that's a roll right there i mean it's not bad but you know there are other things to go get and when was the last time you used this it's locked i can't that's gonna be the number one question here fruit when was the last time you used this more importantly when did i lock all these i don't i don't know i don't know why i was like hey this trackless waste yeah make sure i don't get rid of it okay can't lose that one rapid hit rampage great pve roll and you know what not a bad pvp roll but 120s i don't think they can uh two tap anymore with rampage uh times one i think you need times two now okay i would very much consider this a pve roll as well and weapons old weapons for pve have even less you know i'm gonna be around a pb e guy man okay okay i didn't match to work this but i know i used it because it had outlaw kill clip yeah no it's a very good gun it go figure has one of my highest kill counts ever on a weapon let me let me go look at mine real quick because i haven't gotten rid of mine i know if i had matched a workday it would probably be higher than yours what's yours uh mine was easily in the 50 000. okay so maybe mine would be a little lower all right okay you know what i'm keeping this one because so far it's the only one i actually remember using okay i'll keep that and that's fine you know that's sentimental to you you have a solid reason for wanting to keep it what else we got no exotics i know you can just pull them so is it really yeah so exotics i you can just leave them there like if you want to keep one of every exotic to just kind of have on tap ready to go especially if they have a you know a catalyst on it and kill tracker if you care about that so i don't mind if if people have a bunch of exotics in their vault even if they're not using them you know for for most people like like we do youtube we need to have things on tap does the average person need to have an 1100 malfeasance in their vault no is it kind of trying to call me out like getting some notoriety right now absolutely but if you're not using the exotic it's 1100 it doesn't have a kill tracker on it and you need some space there's no harm in just getting rid of it and pulling a new one when you decide you want to start using it okay you can just at me next time all right and a lot of this i'm guilty hey look at that it's back baby nameless midnight with opening shot high impact drop it's so good they added the drop mag on it come on now do we need this no we do not okay so the toil in trouble this is the second slide shot snapshot shotgun that's been retired that we've seen in your vault and it's only page one what are you trying to say that's not okay all right well very common question that i'm gonna be asking here long shadows use it solid pvp role yeah you know that's when was the last time you used it but when it's 12 51 so it's somewhat recently yeah this is untouched that is an untouched gun all right i can tell it's untouched well okay look better devil's snapshot opening shot like come on yeah again not bad but when is the last time you've you whipped out a better devils uh practically the d2 beta okay so that's that's our question answered okay matrix i'm not gonna lie to you i have i have a better devil's but it has like 18 000 kills yeah yeah we get it okay you got a big dick down but you know what i'm keeping this redrix because i actually grinded for this and i regret it but like do it i did it when it was miserable to get so yeah nope do it keep it if you want to keep it keep it and the saddle you can pull it out i'm pretty see i grinded all that to get 27 kills in the cruise yeah it's 27. what about pve anything you don't want to know let's say zero okay it's it's great now granted pvp you know you could have left it on the crucible tracker because it doesn't track for whatever reason i i don't know why we need to have separate things in order to keep track it should just keep track of both but that's a whole other topic yeah warns law nightfall exclusive yep kill clip rangefinder that's not bad not bad at all and it has gotten some use because you didn't actually change one turns as you can see i didn't but look i'm gonna be honest i've always been stingy with upgrade materials and glimmer so like you're gonna notice the theme i don't match to work a lot okay also kind of in the same boat of like i don't know how much i'm gonna need in the future so i'm not willing to commit to a lot right now okay you're gonna see a common theme here okay so i might have used this for a decent bit but you know i don't know and i don't know if i have another one i guess my guess is that you used it for a youtube video and then probably never touched it again yeah but she what if i do it again let's let's take a look at the mr fruit gaming channel and search wardens law oh no let's see we have ant the only thing that came up was antaeus ward's reflect supers destiny 2 forsaken three years ago ah maybe you were using it in that video i don't know i swear i did let's see now i have even more warden i'll search ward if you didn't find it there i'm not gonna all right you know what i'm locking it i'm gonna make a video with it this okay it's pretty and then i'll delete it okay okay there you go talent to the ether uh pretty well rolled scout you know if you don't really have like what's that night watch go down one uh okay those are kind of counter-intuitive very counter-intuitive perks right there drop mag subsistence and multi-kilt up all kind of they're all good they're just like all completely on the opposite ends of the scene he's already dead uh where um well we can't you know like should i i mean do you need to skate lock with one kill on it to be fair i i don't actually i'm pretty sure i swapped it because it was pvp but like i'm talking this is like these i know for a fact like this is special i'm like antio i remember rocking these all the time vanilla so like like this one too like that was the curated explosive payload before i got nerfed to the ground it was the only good thing in pvp like i remember this okay if you don't mean something to you then keep it but i'm i'm mainly looking for like does it really mean something to you or are you just holding on to this for what feels like no reason right like you're giving me good reasons to hang on to those four weapons right you're giving me a response but then we come up on some other stuff and i'm just kind of like do you and you're kind of like and that's how i know okay look you know this like this one you know like that like another don't donate and you will eventually forget that these things were ever even here i've already forgotten behalf of them uh these were when black armory like because like that was kind of around the time i was in and out of destiny but i bothered to come back and get like a blast furnace i mean i never used them but i was like hey look i got the black armory stuff you know and like it's a cool bow yeah look at that the reason i kept spiteful fang for a long time was in case i ever wanted to go back and do niobi labs because you needed the bow in order to do niobi labs nobody lives not in the game anymore so there's no point to it yeah but see now there's a memento left right you know i'm just saying if they ever do bring back nyobi labs boom they would probably also bring back the bow they wouldn't be like oh yeah you have to go get your retired bow at your vault that you probably deleted otherwise you can't do it whatever all right but see like this one i was like ooh black armor you can never go wrong back you know outlaw kill clip back and accurized rounds like come on now it's a good gun when was the last time you used it better stop quit asking the hard questions was the last time you used it when was the last time you even acknowledged that this gun existed in your vault right now oh yeah but blast furnace i did use a lot i like that bothering mass weapons yeah yeah like i even got the um wait did it go away i used to have the thing where it would like light up you know you know yeah yeah it's it's not there anymore no okay i'm not crazy uh wow that's so good i'm seeing some um ritual weapons pinnacle weapons here and i've been very guilty of this as well that can go break neck with no sort of kill tracker on it you can pull this out of the ball and you can pull it out with all of the perks everything it's a static roll you can rip it right out it doesn't need to be here okay mountain top though i can't like come on who's gonna forget the absolute terror for like a year you you can pull it right out and if 689 kills is something that you are happy with okay then then we hold on to it uh look at that no sons another outlaw kill clip icarus grip have i used this it seems like it it's looking like it quadruple tap it hey there it is come on um okay five i mean it i mean you do have a body in it and it has a shader so you know you probably did use it and you know you just got rid of that that bad news uh black armory hand cannon that was retired and we just replaced it with an outlaw kill clip the same exact role of something that's actually not retired okay yeah that's fair it's all about filtering down it's all about filtering what about this look at this huh nywatch is a great scout rifle and you can still get it and uh there's tons and tons of tons of good rolls to go get on it um this is retired uh i consider this more of a pve role if anything okay so it would be something i didn't get rid of yeah i'll look at outlaw multi-kill clip look at that huh i'm not gonna argue with you here i'm not gonna argue with you thank you uh service look i'm gonna be honest i pretty much if i ever got a hand cannon it was like some mixture of like outlaw kill clip you know rampage that i pretty much just kept him yes look at that stringer storm rampage that is come on even in its retired status uh that was not one i'd be keeping around okay come on it was like a part of a thing you know see at least you have a better excuse than i did for keeping a rose because i didn't masterwork mine it was just in the vault and you can pull it out whenever you want yeah wow that is i don't remember that but look at me go let's start taking a look at some some non-retired items now let's start purging all right seventh serif we got a fourth times rangefinder we got uh the next one underdog or weapon and we have a fourth times rangefinder i saw fourth time i'm like ooh that seems good so i just kept those yeah two of them they are exactly the same let's check the mass work on them yeah well one of them reload okay and the other one is reload um the minor perks what do we have and okay okay so i would probably take the one that has the tier 5 reload speed mast work on it because at least you already have some progress there i don't think the average player is really going to notice a huge difference on those minor perks okay easy easy done yeah that was just a bad uh um okay firmly planted osmosis okay i don't know how that got in there i swear this is one you know you want to maybe keep a seventh serif in order to proc warmind cells warming cells not exactly great right now right but that's what that's exactly why i kept them or myself yeah you need some variety for the war mine cells i guess yeah um guilty you know this to me is kind of a toss-up time payload is sort of like an explosive round kind of deal you know i'm kind of thinking of like okay if i'm using this in grand master level content how often am i really going to be procking multi-kill clip versus something like a timed payload right like how many how many times you think you're a proc multi-kill clip to the point where you're getting like two or three stacks because honestly it's not very often you're hurting me okay eye of soul okay snap snapshot celebrity and out loud okay so this is an example of having one good pve roll and one good pvp roll and yeah i think it's totally okay to to keep both now i love vorpal i'm not the craziest about for pve um just because you're mainly using this as a boss killing weapon probably and you're not going to get out lot of proc at all you know i'm way higher way ahead we don't need that leave this slide shot one two punch okay those kind of go together because you slide and you punch [Applause] i mean i love one two punch i think everybody should have a one two punch shotgun yeah [Applause] so this is just a matter of uh how often are you using it do you have a shotgun that you like no it sounds like you made a call i i have a identity crisis with shotguns but that's a whole other thing i don't care about this gun personally at all it says i played trials okay okay that's so bad i didn't get flawless so all right there you go uh triple t i got a better one than this in fact look i keep it on me at all times there you go perfect thank you yeah so a lot of a lot of inventory management as well that vault management is like just going through and being like okay what other versions of this gun do i have even if it was a 200 rpm but you have a 150 that you like using you know are you ever going to touch the 200 rpm oh but what if bungee buffs it like i get it but you know at a certain point you just got to be like look i'm using this gun i like this one the most there's not much that's getting me to use the other one so i'm just going to get rid of it okay let me hit you with this okay field prep demolitionist i don't know what i was thinking clearly you know yeah that's kind of an all over the place kind of a deal that that one over full vorpal like i got to decide what i'm doing right no not bad yeah with some of the other ones here uh the same moments surrounded that's i don't think it's the worst thing to have like a couple of guns with osmosis for very very specific use cases you're not that use case okay i'm i'm getting yeah if you want to keep one i'm gonna be honest i don't even know this uh aiming this weapon for a short period reduces punch that sounds great in pvp right draw time not bad swashbuckler that's what's that uh what's the other one we got there rapid here rabbited rangefinder um look i can't believe that the 666 do you have a bow already that you like using in the kinetic slot uh i'm not really i like le monarch okay so that's that's pretty much the only bow i'm really attached to the main reason to keep a bow in the kinetic slot honestly this season is just so you can spam fusion rifles in the other two slots uh and so you can have an overload bow but fusions are just so good that any sort of primary weapon that you might have equipped is used solely for stunning champions and then you you just go straight back to your other weapons i will say check this out okay boom you boys been doing master lost sectors for the first time look at that nice yeah they are blessed you know i heard about the uh catalyst looking for that stag because a lot of the time it overload and arc mainly the overlap yeah i use a field prep uh field purple threaded needle as well yes yeah i love that extra ammo but look at that that's so cool so these are kind of counterintuitive um ooh it is isn't it yeah yeah so like subsistence you want to keep firing all the time but then sympathetic rela or synthetic arsenal is about reloading to reload your other guns oh i tripped oh that's embarrassing yeah lead from gold recombination this is a pretty specialized role uh i i think you could totally keep that one let's go okay i don't know why i have so many heritages let's see let's just go down rapid fire i'll load okay pop okay okay bop personally i'm saying all dog but if you want to keep i'll dog walk either the auto loading holster one or the recombination one okay ideally you're looking for um recombination and uh reconstruction on the same gun right you don't have that no so no it kind of depends on what you're going for like the we'll we'll just i'll leave one good um guiding sight quick draw vorpal quick drop iron gaze that's a good roll it's cool it's you know it's fine but this is uh when was the last time you use this kind of a gun my man look at whoa look at that i'm moving on from these i'm seeing five auto rifles i'm seeing five false promises right here let's go move on over okay what do we got okay oh that's okay yeah okay [Music] when you already have a killing when rampage one all right right you're keeping that and yeah and there we go perfect that's like um good good call good call uh that one you gotta really like cold denial for that one big fan you see a thing i like to keep design grips because i'm i put a shader on it man yeah no i like forward path i like it okay thank you uh overflow okay great role there outlaw for all also not bad extraordinary rendition has so many good perks on it that i feel like it really paralyzes people because it paralyzed me it was just like god wrote after god roll after god for them i know you can get so many of them with so many good roles uh that not that is not one of them but that isn't you can get rid of that um so i i completely understand like when certain guns i think headseeker by the way is dog uh but what are you trying to say well we'll have a talk later this is built like a tough like a ford f-150 dental it's like a truck built forward tough i i have a personal vendetta against headseeker i don't like it okay well you don't need to bring your biases into your desk i'm just that's just me some of those are gonna come through multi-mock look at that multimod is a great smg uh you have iron grip on it uh i think on pc uh people prefer the iron reach just because uh you know you can control your recoil a lot easier i'm a gamer i'm a gamer it's true i look at that the only reason i would keep this is for blinding nades and that's it look at that well that's the only reason i would keep it ah yeah if you don't have another blind and grenade gl in that slot i'd say keep it that's the only reason i would keep it what about you oh you do have that uh killing danger zone i'd probably do that one like danger zone is good because like you get that increased blast radius and that's good for blinding grenades because you're not really using this to kill a whole lot you're using it to prefer crowd control um so i'd probably stick with that one okay although it does have killing wind but like yeah uh prey this revenge i'm keeping just because i've done vaulted glass like once so whatever weapons i got you know i'm like the good old days back when um oh what was that in d1 um it was rob's crutch final shot right was that it round yeah final round classic classic um gonna be honest don't dog i don't know how that got there you have five vulpeculars all god rolls like killing wind [Music] if these are all okay shoot the loot open opening shots it's really fun i really like shoot the loop you really like shoot delete i don't really think shoot to loot has much pvp viability no we have two killing wind adagios see we got okay bungie just does not want me to say okay if you have perks please leave a comment okay reload reload and stability uh uh i'd probably keep the reload you're you play a mouse and keyboard more often you don't only you really need the stability plan it more often both of you to think i use controlling destiny too ever fished i always get killed by this so i've just kept them in hopes that maybe one of them is good and i've been waiting for this moment you know let me know not terrible quick draw okay full auto adagio dog lead from gold opening shot okay uh uh just hover over adagio roca i just need like uh um okay joshua's okay so you know it's good for like follow-up shots like if you're in like a 2v1 you kill someone and then you get adagio to proc and you're trying to kill another person i do hold on to you that's that's where it's good um i think ensemble opening shots going to give you more of a oh my god it even has uh uh fn yeah that um we went and rifled geez yeah i'd probably sway more towards this one okay good for pvp sam yeah we're gonna get grilled look at that wow this is pretty good especially now with adrenaline junkie being the way that it is uh that's a keeper that's a keeper right i'm locking it down lock it up not bad i i just personally don't have enough experience with adagio to really give you i'm gonna be honest good i have a lot of these adagios i don't think i've ever used a diver okay okay i'm just trying to make excuses yeah i don't i just i was served this legal action you know i didn't want to get in trouble yeah um i mean if the cops don't know duh come on look at this huh do i have to uh no i think i need to shield my eyes that you didn't see that one okay that's that's you i mean nope not no it's tough to judge pve shotguns right now because they're they just haven't been good for a while okay all right fine uh drang the two drinks um you really probably don't need either of them that's not even like something that i would keep even if it was relevant okay ah look at that it's magical confusion i i get that it's masterworks but um you mean to tell you want me to dismantle this and those three poor pve enemies i died their memories will fade with it is that what you're trying to tell me you know i i hate to be that guy but that's exactly what i'm saying that's cold um genesis explosive payload huh you you put some masterwork materials into that one huh i want i want to say that i don't know that's i don't have a excuse for that uh that thing's not bad for pvp if you want to keep fusion around that's not bad if you didn't scoop up the the main ingredient uh zur roll that he brought around a few weeks back nation of beasts come on be real i don't even know what drop mag does anymore what does it do if you don't know why why it doesn't matter you know well i mean because it's outlaw kill club it's like it's not bad increases really oh it reduces magazine's size now okay send it back yeah click that how many shots you get like 13 oh 13. okay that's um and you got a range mass work on it uh this is a good gun triple tap outlaw uh very counter-intuitive uh perks there and it's retired i don't know about that same thing with that uh i think i might have used that crucible because i was desperate hip fire grip on a sniper hip fire nosq well come on you know good good roll good pve roll yeah have you broken it out in pvp there we go uh this is retired you can get another arsenic bite there are so many arc bows whatever i don't know dog don't know how that got in there i've cut a lot of people that's kind of sad uh that's that's slipped in here somewhere you know come on that's yeah what is this junk that you kept in your vault whoa someone who cuts junk in their vault yeah come on look not retired under pressure quickdraw uh you know it's fine that you have see which one you like more or you can just get rid of that one okay yeah we'll just get this i don't use items let's be honest it's apparently the same thing if you're not work for that lunar towel we're keeping that that's dog but it dog what are these guns mr fruit it it's gonna get better okay why i don't know black armory this is that's not even like a one that you got from a bounty or whatever that's just that just pooped out of the forge when you were done with the for from like leftover parts come on look at that all right again good looking weapon on principle i'm keeping it just because it looks good okay fine the dish that roll is dog i used to target this for a very long time uh okay slide shot opening threat open slide shot ring page uh probably keep all of them right i wouldn't keep all of them okay you know i what was that first one again slide shot opening shot so that i i always forget if slide ways give you gives you the range or if it's slide shot that gives you the range why don't we check that one right okay it is slide shot you're like sideways might be on a different gun so i would probably keep that one i'll get rid of those two yeah uh fog before we play it's my face okay snaps all right don't skip over that oxygen don't skip over that go back no two it's go right two clicks this way yeah all the way are you sure other way yep that one get rid of that come on hold on you can pull that out of the collection you're not wrong you're giving me the strength to hold f yeah look at that rapid hit firing line great pve weapons which is no longer actually you want to know what's funny probably one of the three times in my life i've streamed gambit you probably don't remember this but you were in my chat when this dropped and you go oh my god that's actually a good role yeah and that's the sole reason i kept it and put major spec on it yeah no it's very good but nowadays i mean that's that one's even better but neither of them are relevant anymore okay well i'm going to keep one of them just for you know yeah sentimental sentiment that's ugg that's dog yeah you already got a blinding grenade gl yeah yeah get rid of them disruption break that's not get out of there another mine and nope how did these items find their way i actually you'd be surprised i'm holding onto that one i grinded gambit for this stupid thing you can pull that out of inventory as well i know but i don't look that 17 alone means a lot to me yeah hard-earned uh nope nope yeah i know not anymore no [Music] no all right now we're getting somewhere right a lot of people have said to keep this just as a kind of a novelty item totally get it if you want to keep it you know we do have a deafening whisper now that's just a different element uh but yeah if you just want to keep that as a novelty you totally understand sidearm with heads i mean no no no okay [Music] all right we have four seven serif anger and finger i mean actually you know you deleted that first one real quick i would have kept that first one uh yeah no you want to keep one all right there you go okay what is this six i've heard these are six i've heard they're good quick draw vorpal quick travor slide shot trench quick draw trick draw train left uh shotguns just like i would this would like would you put any of these in your goal um i'm just searching for the word seven i have one of them and it has auto loading trench barrel which is a pvp or a pve roll uh and none of yours have that and i don't think you have trench you might have trench brown on one of them i think i've got trench on quick slide shot trends or quick draw trends you know uh you know either one of those i'd put them fairly equal the fact that we have talked about this just means it's we're just not really in a shotgun pve sort of meta and honestly i don't know if we'll ever be in terms of higher level content that seems cool you know what's my first one what's the first one okay i would have kept that second one i didn't even see that first one but it's master work but fourth time's feeding frenzy is sort of counter-intuitive is it yeah because i knew that because frenzy i kind of thought feeding was like continuous shots i don't i don't know what it was yikes uh summoner i want to skip a lot of the one-offs so like you only have one summoner you only have one exiles curse right the this is this row is what i want to see so okay go go back let from gold demo left from gold snapshot auto loading elemental capacitor and i'm not keeping a single one of these okay i don't know why i have four of these outlaws full auto rampage zen moment rampage full i keep auto third one because of rampage you made the cut gn7 rifle uh to me there's only one good roll of distant tumulus and it's clown cartridge firing line that's crazy that's exactly what i don't have corey [Music] i i wouldn't even be using this at all anyway because i didn't even exist i'm gonna be honest yeah so you're not gonna miss it okay i heard you mentioned this earlier that's the keeper yeah rampage posterity i've never been a huge fan of this hand cannon at all you you can get some rolls but i've never been a fan of them get that in here uh the only reason i'm keeping that is because it's a 260 rpm and i like 260 rpm scouts the most you do have a good servant leader though but this is a solar scout but if you have a good vision of confluence do we really need trustee i don't though okay so if it's the only solar scout you got keep it see i'm in like a weird thing like man why don't i have vex mytho class and i sit there and think oh right i don't do vaulted class yeah so that's kind of where i'm at uh you know okay that first one all right come on how would you feel if i told you that all through your ass okay i was about to say like what if i told you that's a god roll like you're sitting on gold that's not what i heard um that that's that's fool's gold right there okay we have six hollow words six of these things all right is it ever worth keeping one of these okay wow these are pretty bad i mean it i none of i don't think any of them are redeemable pve really [Music] uh that's okay uh feeding frenzy multikill club also pretty okay uh that this is kind of like an experiment you know mess around with both of them but they're they both serve very similar purposes they're both blinding grenades they both have feeding frenzy they both have a damage this one isn't blinding oh sorry sorry sorry um concussion yeah so i i think it'd be okay to keep both um and just kind of figure out uh where you're gonna use them subsistence feeding frenzy iron grip uh i'm this is a pvp weapon i'm ditching subsistence okay all right we'll keep you buddy for now uh ikelos hand cannon i'm the only reason i keep this is for war mine cells which are not great which i use all the time whoops um pulse trench lead disruption i would choose the first one oh my god do you really want to keep one um look at that look at look at it what time is disruption that those are that is a damage perk combined with a utility perk what if i like to do a little bit everything um leave this needle like one of these has got to be good right i'm keeping archer's tempo i think archer's tempo is just a very very safe perk okay hip fire grip's like actually not the work what is happening here i don't know where these came from seven of them good lord our futures quick okay okay a lot of opening shots here a lot of opening shots here okay a lot of opening shots here um types have not really been it in pve for a while so this is going to be more of a pvp pick i can't live without snapshot on my sniper i just need to have snapshot well guess what it just so happens that no no none of them have snapshot um opening shots not bad but you have like six of them we've quick draw lead from no moving targets not bad that's a personal preference perk you know oh wait wait wait wait wait two of those i'll make the decision easy handle them both wow okay uh yeah i'd get rid of that one too okay nice look i play trials okay subsystem snapshot outlaw snapshot encore once for all and i'm not getting rid of the adapt even though it's not the best okay so i i don't care much for snapshot on a hand cannon on in pvp uh i don't know how other people feel about it it's it's something i can live without so yeah subsistence snapshot to me just kind of feels wasted okay but that's the adap data i'm not deleting it okay keep it keep it hit fire grip on a sidearm dude that's not uh no oh my god that's crazy all right um look at that clown you said clown for something um look at that there you go in the next season that's a that can be a that's that's a good spec play right yep yep that's a spec play all right that's the zer roll i remember that one didn't end cause it's 1100. but it's a good gun it's a good gun yeah i remember read it was like bias i was like okay stop yelling at me i know cartesian's like the thing but like these are these are counter-intuitive perks you want a hip-fire you want to bring up the site i did not realize what are we doing maybe i want maybe i want to be able to pick in the moment um ah there's i'm maybe going the killing wins kill clip one yeah or sorry killing wind uh one for all um say left i think one problem is like a pretty underrated grand master level perk but over okay that's a keep [Music] [Music] i literally never hit fire even if it had it i wouldn't hit fire so feeding frenzy demo or auto loading demo ooh tough call um like a good tough call yeah that's a good tough card autoloading is super convenient because you can just shoot stow and then come right back to it feeding frenzy is not bad although feeding frenzy only with like one or two kills is not like the craziest thing in the world i think i'd probably lean more towards autoloading just for like the use case that's no everyone i don't everyone that i've ever inspected has a the number in their vault that is just complete garbage it's so it's like everyone has to have one come on the d aside come on snipe shot four bowl i mean why not you know yeah okay but i might have a couple of these yeah you got a few of these jesus okay uh i'm gonna tell you what i told fallout when i looked at his dog uh i don't think i've seen a single person use not only iota drakonis this season but also ever any slow rate of fire charge rifle okay now if you want to keep one you can always get more though i'm not all right brim you're right on my effing bone i've never seen look at this [Music] are you using bows in in pvp at all i might all right would you use these all right for sure mellow who could you have a lot of these two who could forget like look at that friends be okay all right okay you have another heating up frenzy fourth games dragonfly okay hang on to the outlaw frenzy i understand it's rare yeah but if it's rare and bad we don't need it cancels each other out come on that's uh that's okay okay yeah now i feel like we were okay emptying out so many weapons that now we just want to make sure we at least have some decent coverage of like you know elements and and uh different weapon types for you know champion mods and stuff like that what about the classic annual skate here azure cross loves this gun for pvp i don't think you have any good pvp pvp rolls i would maybe keep the third one no distraction swashbuckler yeah i would maybe keep that one for a pvp play but otherwise i'm not in love like some people like time payload for just for the time being i i understand i don't have an excuse on this one multiple ward cliffs area see like the nice thing about that is that it's super easy to get rid of yeah true okay multiple bad omens uh neither of which i'd be using in current day i never assassin and auto loading holster yet again more contract ambitions these are contrasting perks that is i again i don't know how that got their data okay that's no yeah that's that's if you want a solar grenade launcher perfect i love them uh that oh my the third grenade i don't auto loading ambitious look i'm illiterate datto hammerhead i can't get rid of all right you have two hammerheads yeah they're just you potentially avalanche these are just like the first machine guns okay the awning is live right now so like you can go get another one that's not retired um and um no come on i didn't even realize this was a gun like come on yeah no that's enough that said no that's a no uh this is a weapon that you keep if you have fond memories of throne cleaver nope this is a gun that you keep because you can't get the gun anymore and it's only available for a very limited time but this roll is terrible oh okay got me excited oh no yeah there's so much it's fruit that's what oh but here's the nice thing is that look how many slots we've cleared that's true i've never had this much space since like week one half of your vault yeah half of it we've kept out of here now i also usually don't go this in depth with people usually i give them like 30 to 45 but this is like this is bad this is like a house call like i tried just my wife's giving birth right now i need someone here okay all right it's the holidays we have five seven sarah saws very limited range of good rolls here um and what do you know you don't have a single one of them but i would keep the first one okay um oh oh damn okay i was really hoping i was really hoping for a clown cartridge here because i just did a video um i'd keep the field prep one for the extra ammo and uh and the reload speed the other one then all right i'm seeing some um oh you have two of those i think this one has uh spikes yup that's fine okay so so i think like you have a masterworked one yeah and then you have a bunch of non-masters so let's let's see him auto loading holster full core that's that's not bad okay like that's pretty good um clown full court i'd put that kind of in the same tier you know both certain similar purposes clown cartridge demo uh maybe a little bit slightly weaker but it really depends on what you are what you're doing right like that clown demo would have been good if you had some sort of grenade built i love so yeah what's up what's the other yet spike nate on either though no okay so you know if you want to keep one of the other um grenade launchers not exactly in right now if you wanted to keep all three i would understand nah um but i grenade launches right now again i gotta wait and see yeah those are both dogs get rid of those dies or something that what i don't even know what this person is i mean there's relentless strikes there but that's about it nobody's blocking this board i'm sorry just nobody that's doing it through never have don't even i don't even think i have it bound to be honest um tireless oh but the flash counter thing again okay that's it that's the only reason i would keep that okay see i got um guillotine okay what's the next one you have 18 i think those are the exact same ones no one's in yeah you just have a mod in one of those yeah so those are both the same so we can purge [Music] that's this no that's okay that's behold okay what's the next one okay it's the exact same thing i think it is yes yeah okay get rid of that one okay uh yeah you can get rid of that one okay uh this is gonna come down to like do you have impact casing on one of them okay that hasn't back casing look at that okay you miss the other one yeah it does not i'd keep going with impact casing it's a very very minor dps upgrade but it's still it dips his dips that's true a lot of threaded needles just because i heard it was good so i kept all the ones i got yeah um if i mean you said you got a field prep that's the one that i use right now i i think that's totally fine i think the rest of these you probably get rid of them um tarantula moving target rampage field prep and genesis kill clip uh tarantula you're mainly using to remove shields or do sustain damage therefore uh all these are kind of bad but i'd keep the field prep one for the extra ammo and that's it copy that dog yeah do this definitely no okay that's that's a spec play right there the auto loading uh destruction break that's the spec play that's good whoa that's a good that's a good that's the key get rid of that one get that first one yeah all right impulse whirlpool it's not bad it has spikes okay know this one's horrible and impul so impulse chain reaction that's more of like a fun gl but it's probably not something i'd bring into super serious content right right now i need to roll your roof too okay you like you already got the masterworked one you made a decision oh oh yeah triple tap firing line regrets what the hell yeah i do remember this it was first trials weekend or whatever and i was like i need to get this and then i did yeah come on i don't even have that but i haven't really done trials that much um what's the uh the master work on both of these and what are the the sub perks here charge time charge time okay ionized enhanced error is good all right what's the next one we got uh rain range you have enhanced accelerated coil liquid arrowhead small board i don't remember the specifics of like um charge speed and dps but what i do remember is that the results were not very significant back when i did like line in the sand testing um ages ago like season nine um to make people not angry that you accidentally deleted the one that they wanted to keep i would just keep both of them and we'll figure it out later i'd rather hold on to them but the first two like that one can go and that one clown cards okay rampage i'm not really procking rampage on linear that's right i'm flexing the adapts anyway yeah keep keep both of those and then we got demolitionists on guard and what's the other one try this bloody trigger action like they're they're neat all right but i'm not wild about them uh we have a lot of armor here we do a lot of a lot of titan armor well i only played titan mainly so yeah okay first things first let's do some of these exotic dupes right right let's do dog dupes here so you tell like which one we keep in here yeah so part of me wants to lean towards the first one because it has the strongest recovery and intellect and pretty good discipline but it has no strength and doom fangs kind of like about getting void melee kills to give you super energy um honestly i feel like this is kind of a toss up what i would do and this is what i've been telling people who have multiple armor pieces or exotics is go into your favorite item management system extension website whatever and go in and make the armor sets that you want to make with these exotics and whatever it tells you to plug in as your exotic plug in that one because like this one might be the god roll because it has the exact amount of stats that you need in order to move up like three tiers in three different you know uh three different paths and then the other one can be like uh it doesn't really do a whole lot so unless something is glaringly obvious that uh it should be the one that you pick then that's the kind of situation uh that i would say you're kind of in is like make the armor set see what like destiny iron manager says or whatever you're using um and then uh make a call okay i think the only like sunset stuff i kept was the solstice stuff okay uh that that is an ornament this one it is okay well that i had it before it was i mean like all of all of these things are ornaments now like every single thing that you have ever collected is an ornament that's embarrassing um well i'm trying well that was just i like the the chicken yeah that's fine yeah uh that's the only one that you have of that so that's just an automatic keep unless you have one in your inventory no i don't think so um okay these i mean that's these are armor 1.0 armor pieces sorry dad sorry yeah those are those are 1.0 that you're only keeping those because a novelty at this point this one was solstice yeah that's also a armor that's an armor 1.0 yeah but i'm just keeping it because i that's the only buy that you can buy that right now but it's the only time i ever bothered to do it okay it means something to me okay okay um yeah so with a lot of this armor it's kind of the same situation unless something so egregiously bad um that you can just delete it right away this is where you're going to want to go in and make some armor sets right like figure out like okay this is my armamentarium build this is my ursa furiosa build this is my phoenix cradle build and you kind of go in you pick at the items that you want and then as soon as you're done making all your armor sets anything that's left over you maybe keep a couple pieces here and there otherwise you just ditch the rest of it and you're way way happier how do i feel naked we cleared 300 slots for you feel naked sorry 292 slots and we didn't even go over a lot of the singles that you have so you can even clear up even more of this all right this is good this is the best we've ever done on a vault panicking what uh what about i didn't realize i have two match to work oh no that's not even the same guy two different guns yeah um and see here's the best thing fruit is that by tomorrow or by witch queen you're not even gonna remember any of the items that you deleted you're not going to remember at all but like why did i even care about this but then somebody should be like yo do you have this and i'll be like ooh i believe that are you going to remember that you deleted it well i have the receipts now yes i mean i guess but like i don't even think we really deleted that many things that were good you know what i mean it's not like we were ditching god rolls all over the place because you have 17 of them we were ditching hip fire grips and underdogs and ambitious assassins like man what's good to keep it's like is there anything valuable in here yeah is there any are there any pieces of gold this was dumpster diving like hoping like there's got to be something in here right i i hate to say it but that's the most descriptive thing i could call your vault when we started was a dumpster and we were just looking for like oh here's like the space bar of a keyboard that i could repurpose otherwise otherwise good otherwise real good now we can start taking some of that stuff out of your current character inventory we can throw that in your vault so item management's not as annoying make the armor sets do yourself a favor make a couple armor sets make a pvp set make a pve set something like that i have to do that through damn right uh you can do it through damn yeah um there are other websites as well i'm sure someone in your comments will uh will say what good websites are um i should just go ahead and apologize for everyone too like i'm sorry you had to see that but see it's it's not just for you it's also for them so that they can go through their vaults and be like okay what kind of garbage i feel like most people are gonna be like wait let me go in my vault well i feel a lot better about everything i have in here that's what i bring to the table here it's about clearing space it's about making the loot part of the game fun again right it's not fun when you're when you're like fallout who has nine all nine slots full on every character and 500 500 out of 500 in their vault and 21 out of 21 in their postmaster they literally cannot pick up items and that's that was my problem right that's fine so now you have a lot more space to work with that doesn't mean fill it up with garbage but i'll see you in a couple months and you'll be like what have you done yeah right we'll be right back here witch queen i've relapsed but yeah otherwise i would just make some armor sets get them all ready to go look them make them all look nice nice fashion them out get some ornaments whatever you want to do um yeah and then just start clearing out the rest of it you know i feel like a new man you sure this is the best i've ever done on someone's ball hey 300 watts there was like two guns in there when you're like ooh so i'm gonna cherish those for the rest of my life the the reads regret not only just one reads regret but the back to back yup adapt triple tap it's the only thing i've ever gotten in my life that i can be proud of love you bud [Music] [Music] you
