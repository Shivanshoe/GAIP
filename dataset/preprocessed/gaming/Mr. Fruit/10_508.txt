heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to among us got a couple of things to do here everybody is bunched up as can be this is exactly where somebody wants to get a beginning kill aristata everybody's still alive just double checking bodies penis sitting on top [Music] nobody knows if dad will just move just kidding all that has to do darn it if datto had left i would have done something i would have acted up bro i would have done acted up nine [Music] oh i can't believe you've done this it was at this moment that he knew he [ __ ] up oh mr fruit i was about to say there's you but you literally just walked past a body and hopped an event you're [ __ ] in the same building my retort is i was wanting to see how you were going to try and spin this wait dada where were you because i saw you near me too yeah i saw you at dolphins and yeah rob was dead outside i come out of med bay i find down around the corner dead body and he just does the skirt report but you're not accusing him that was a killer rim job wait where yeah i don't know what he's on about venting he didn't i have him dead to right i have you dead to ratchet i wasn't even sure it was you the body was outside the door of the med bay area then how would someone invent it [Music] mr fruit okay bro i have i have a say in this too because i saw datto too is there a vent in like the office because the event is in the little lights see the thing is okay office vent get to that area i'm not saying it could be fruit too but i feel like because i saw datto recently he like the body could have been fresh and it could have been a self-report wait wait hold on hold on no no no no no no no no no no no where are you in the back because event in that area is in the bathroom stall yeah and there's another one literally right do not big brain on this there's another one don't let get away with it no no no i wasn't even gonna accuse datto i didn't think it was him until he he immediately starts with um yeah i shot fruit in the body and then which makes me know that it was datto you're not getting out of this one entirely because i know you're not just placing yourself properly telling me that i don't even know what you're feeling everyone's i don't hey guys i come out shark kills the body right from him like oh my god and then i get paid for it oh are you uh imposter or no oh fruit was for sure i saw the body i was like i gotta get out of here so i try and hop in the vent dado turns to corner meal i mean i didn't even get the kill man [Music] sirs i just checked that area and there's only one vent and it's in the bathroom don't even don't even i just looked where's the other bed dad i will show you as soon as we leave here follow me i will show you i think he's talking about the one by the the reactors yes literally right next to the reactor stairs like the bridge thing why did i thought outside of med bay into the doors where you first go into that building on the upper right the vent is outside how did you not see them yeah that's what i was confused about as well but it does make sense okay so shark do you want to talk about why you were trying to throw datto under the bus last round because okay that's fair because i saw datto in the office and as soon as he left like the body was called so i don't know that that's why i thought data was sus because as soon as he left the office the body was called and datto called it how did he leave the office which way to the right side well then he didn't vent because there's not a vent close enough correct okay then i guess it's not datto maybe it was fruit well how about i have a proposal it could be you what if we voted don't vote me no do not vote [Applause] we don't do that chaos here i don't think it's you please let that be it wait a minute if it was a daddo no it was me oh my god but here's the thing i didn't do that i didn't get that kill on that bunny ah it was just super unfortunate time can you guess who the other one is then he's gotta be shark yeah you would be correct because shark damn it dude right he defended you yeah well it's because i got caught on his body i come out and daddy sees me and i'm like oh but it's not and did you not have a kill cooldown for daddo no i mean i didn't even have a ch like he literally turned the corners reported i was there i was like well that's the worst i've had that happen before with somebody else's kill and you're like well [ __ ] yeah well he kills him right in front of me so i try and run back when i'm in the middle of med band there's people like oh mike so i'm like okay there's a vent right there i got it ah and i don't self-report anymore because everybody just votes me off if i self-report so i hear that hey guys i found it yeah it's like i don't think i've ever self reported just who was on the right side did anyone see anyone on the right side i think a shark it's shark 100 you want to know why wouldn't know why because battle and price are in o2 get them out of here right now yeah shark you're done buddy you're done okay wait hold on blue wait why are blue and sonic so quick to vote for me wait a minute why are you a murderer he's got a point fudge you in the butt like wait hold on i'm just a simple worker just like everybody else except for you because you guys are get them off of yourself okay hold on you lost your brains you lost your partner and your partner tried to big brain it but he was small bright and now your extra small brain extra small small brain okay that's you make those slides then it's blue but guess what i don't feel like he'd be this adamant if it wasn't no way right now why doesn't no one clear me ever i always get voted you're the only one not next to anyone tell you where my location was because i know why i wasn't near anybody the location is lava and it's melting in the lava bro listen i was turning the knobs turning on your murderer switch what no the knobs on the south side dawg what knobs knobs are not a task or whatever the little turny things man we're like you get water the water the water yeah that's where i was doing it now tell me did you hold on did you say where the body was because i'm pretty sure i was nowhere near it i just missed i just said body was i just said body was on right side did you say you were on the left side of the map just now take exactly the south side yes doing the water yeah yeah the water wheel yeah it's him take his ass out take him out isn't that where everything if it's not if it's not shark and i do this you said it you said we'd never clear you well we just did it we cleared that shark i think it's no [Laughter] i'm sorry what happened was shark killed him right in front of me so i was like oh my god i gotta go the other way then i go back into med bay there's like eight people i'm like oh my god i gotta get to event so then i try and run back to the vent and you turn the corner when i'm like literally

perfect alibi i'm gonna reverse blue so hard my defense is gonna be airtight i'm not gonna leave my impostor boy hanging because by my calculations it's approximately noon which means the sun is roughly at 29 degrees using this knowledge i can place and determine where shadows will be casted i can use this to my advantage if i just simply share i just wanted the content do you really want that content huh you really wanted that content well guess what mr fruit the only content is you getting voted off because you're the imposter you murdered ariels aries was your ride or die dude all right you remember all the good memories we've had there dude that dude's poor life was the content worth it worth it was it worth killing your home you're not to defend yourself through me it's because it's it's because it's ariels it's because he knew what he did to aries he got him what did he do i saw him he's dead right now i've never seen i've never seen a man anally murder someone the way mr fruit did no it was sweet sweet anal murder yeah i mean i guess you can't sweet love i mean it's blue hey whatever floats people's boat it's me about me it's a fruit it's a sales report it's not a self-report fruit a partner it's done dude mr fruit you really you wanted the content so bad but you didn't ask to think he is doing the horn he doesn't do the horn unless he's guilty [Laughter] [Music] i know dude everyone's bunched up and i was like i don't know i'm just gonna i'm sorry he walked right in on that i know i walk out it was blue i'm like well that's game like you know not even gonna bother not even gonna bother trying to make a story i'm just like i've never heard you just like give up like that's like yeah i was like yeah no defense for that well i was like i'm running with rob for the longest time for double kills but everyone was bunched up so much i was like i've waited too long you got a little bit of blood thirsty huh yeah and then i died that's all good who's the other imposter rob why isn't rob stabbing why isn't he doing it sonic's right there oh is he rob are you it's rob i'm on it oh it's rob okay how do we know it's rob all right yeah explain it give me give me a rundown and a comprehensive analysis perhaps a 45 page essay on why it's wrong it went to the reactor people don't know this but if you go to the very top of reactor you could hide behind a thing and still pre hold on so i did that saw rob and ohm come up saw rob and um then go down saw home's body fall saw rob running you guys are really gonna believe that did sammy should first splint yourself all right let's get that vote in i've never seen anyone do that like honestly that's like some big brain [ __ ] and it honestly just sounds like okay that's like like solid stuff sammy's playing middleweight and rob's playing among us i don't want to be certain for voting sammy and maybe he's right but he was looking at me waiting for the button and as soon as he left the the reactor saying like you know did the er and i'm voting sammy sure but this is not here's my defense sami that was kind of sick dude that's ted that's tag take my gun i was like rob i was like oh my god rob doesn't see him how does he not see him and then you stab him like oh there was there was no name i wouldn't even i wouldn't be mad at that like that i didn't what i thought was weird it said one out of one and i was holding down the scanner and i was like why like it's got to be that side why isn't it finishing like i thought that was really weird that was a [ __ ] huge great move right there dude that was good don't do that all the time i was running with rob forever trying to double kill everyone's like grouped up in threes like yeah i'm stepping people are coming into the games now and like they're like yeah come on [Music] foreign
