hi 80 hope your own money mr. fruit and welcome back that titanfall to I don't know if you guys want to see me make some infrequent titanfall 2 videos but I'm happy to do it she may be a couple years old but she still holds up in today's video we're rockin the wing man elite and we're gonna be using the monarch Titan the monarch has always just seemed really interesting with its whole core upgrade mechanics so we're gonna see if people are sleeping on them and with that away oh it's been a little minute since I played on this map alright Marauders it's time let's do this I will admit though I do miss all the prestigious or generations I have on ps4 but would I end up living la vida loca ogo and a wingman elite is level 1 which is a bit unfortunate we don't have any cool attachments or anything but we don't need cool attachments and I need to work on my bunny hopping on PC look at the movement titanfall 2 so good oh those are grunts which is a good thing because my god what am i aiming at right now hehe I kurz am i right or am i right mister I'm about to throw up myself I'm so ashamed but you guys know me hashtag no filter Yas so I'll show you the fails and the winds too

phrase now I think it's son of a gun was that supposed to insinuate the phrase potentially has its origin in a Royal Navy direction that pregnant women abort smaller naval vessels give birth in the space between the broadside guns in order to keep the gangways and crew deck clear oh I see a little rascal over here excuse me God oh there's another one though there's another one you ready where
