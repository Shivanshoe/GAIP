expensive things probably not you know first run maybe let's take it slow well i figured you know hey if i don't bring in my best gear then i'm reducing the likelihood of me being able to survive you know my chances of survival are better with my best stuff true i just don't trust myself but you're right though there may be like a rhythm game you know like a feel it out game you know like the first game i'm only bringing it's it's a it's an uncommon pistol also in this beta there's a new map wait what like an entirely new map yeah it's called crescent falls but difficulty is hard i mean we just hot drop in a new one if you want i like the idea of like progressing your way through one map to get to another i like that i've missed your face i missed you i mean i can't see your face but i can hear oh yeah i missed you as well the the raid and everything was good hope that went well stressful but yeah but it's over that's the now you get to uh now you get to play like other stuff a

you want to push that um let's see how many they are because it looks like he he has a sniper yeah we lose those okay okay i have an smg and a pistol okay range isn't really my game okay we could try to cut the gap on he has a friend there's at least two of them there's two of them yeah one's uh below him so i think we kind of wait for them to engage because if they see us at all we're kind of dead in the water here i'm trying to not kill myself oh okay there shouldn't be falling damage if you land everywhere here yeah yeah we do got to be careful though with two snipers uh one headshot might kill us but if not if they're especially both honest two bodies and we're done we're taking it slow i thought they saw someone us all right let me see if you want to sit up there i'm gonna try and go for the farthest door and work my way in and then i can just split whatever i'm able to get okay wherever you go i'm coming with i'm not letting you go in there alone that's a suicide mission
