oh my god it's even worse than i thought what in the world are you pract that's how you pronounce that if you're curious ah hi eddie hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to tainted grail thank you very much to tainted grail for sponsoring today's video you guys know me so i'm just gonna say two words and that's all i need to say deck builder roguelike tainted grail conquest is a unique roguelike that takes the deck builder genre known from slay the spire into the next layer by adding a full layer of rpg experience and involving a fully voiced storyline you can play nine different classes choosing between blood mage pathfinder weird hunters sell it and many more you will discover tons of awesome cards and passive runestones items and try to create your unique combo to beat the game and dive deeper into corruption some of the cool things you'll find in the game map exploration with weirdness mechanics deck building accompanied with runestone passive and usable items side quest and npc interactions deep dark storyline fully voiced in english roguelike mechanics and weekly events and endless modes adding tons of replayability if you want to check out tainted grail for yourself which i highly advise there's a link down in the description box below to do so the tang to grail conquest yes now we could choose any of these you unlock later they did give me the option to be able to unlock them all for free to be able to try but i figured why not just start where everyone else would start so you guys get a feel for it and it's probably best usually in these kind of games you know the beginner class usually gives you the best feel and rundown of the game so you know someone like the necromancer sounds cool but probably a little too big brain for me right now oh i can upgrade his abilities get runestones i don't really have anything right now you know we're just starting fresh yeah we'll just start so out the gates we go and into the weirdness we approach as you can see it's spooky tainted and i get to choose my path so the question is which way do we want to go i don't know what that is that doesn't look great i don't know what's over there though let's see uh enemy enemy and lots of enemies but to be fair it looks like it all kind of connects one way or the other so you know what let's just start out balls to the wall we're going enemy to enemy this thing is hideous atrocious and i can't oh my god it's even worse than i thought what in the world are you an infected human i don't know how to tell you this but whatever this is you are no longer a human this enemy shape and the pulsation of its body suggests that you should be prepared for an explosive surprise it's preparing for a special attack in two turns where evidently i think it's going to blow up on me it's like deck building rogue likes you know we got x amount of energy we can use three we have a hand so we have some pretty basic stuff at the the start of a run just you know dealing damage gaining block we can deal a hit and reduce their armor by 10 until the end of combat although they don't appear to have armor the next hit does 100 extra damage which seems needless when i could just you know hit him anyway but i guess this actually makes sense because this would only hit for four to six but if i double this yeah so we're gonna go broad reach into an attack into another attack and pray to god that we can kill him before he blows up on us so we discard our hand as you would expect we have one more turn until he's gonna explode or something like that his two hunter marks because of my passive and at four he'll become vulnerable and when he's vulnerable effect that doubles damage received from any source like the sound of that ooh deal three hits for 46 to random enemies interesting so if the next hit does 100 damage it would only do one of these hits right not all of them probably but that's pretty good i mean minimum we're looking at 12 here so let's see oh okay oh it's because the hunter mark applied i see so if i do this again it'll land on a hunter mark uh huh he's now vulnerable and 100 incoming damage so let's pop him okay we're not letting that explosive pimple touch us today no sir i leveled up let's freaking go i gotta pick a new car a new god deal one hit for 125 damage duplicate the next card played draw one card it cut syringes turn or stun all enemies with no or negative armor stun prevents an enemy from performing any actions the next turn i mean that's duplicating does sound rather fun stunning though is nice and defensive perhaps a necessary play yeah i'm gonna do it oh and a new passive skill oh i'm all about this okay let's go with uh eternal return and we got some loot cracked that's how you pronounce that if you're curious oh my oh my wait i have to deal with both of these now i mean it was one thing what is this tainted force a weird card increased armor of all enemies by 50 for two turns if i don't play i draw three cards less next turn oh okay well i'm not i'm just gonna have to draw three cards less there's no way i can manage that holy cow okay well this enemy redirects damage from all of its allies to itself oh so i can't even attack oh he's gonna hit me for six to eight should i just stun him i feel like i should just stun but there's no way i'm gonna do enough damage otherwise okay well screaming we're gonna we're gonna overhead bop get rid of your armor skirt yeah that's right nothing left one hunter's mark we'll work on that let's just do small strikes okay gets redirected to him every single time regardless okay and then hit him with uh with just uh an attack okay great so i believe he's vulnerable for next turn or something like that i draw through less cards they're screaming okay don't got much to work with here do i okay this is fine everything's fine actually wait a second this is actually watch this this is perfect get him to vulnerable next attack doubled and 32 to 48 damage boom yeah you don't oh wait but i s i'm seemingly just forgetting the fact that you know this dude's about to explode on my face what is my alt here okay so if i charge it i get to do one hit for 20 to 31 okay i don't know if i'm going to get that in time any attempts to attack everyone on the battlefield and buff no no no that's not okay although i could block it blocks the next hit taken from an enemy okay well then if i just did that twice i should be fine right son all enemies with nowhere negative oh why didn't wait can he not get stunned or immune to stun maybe i should look at these things huh yeah maybe okay well here's the deal we're gonna hit him whack and then i'm gonna block and then i shouldn't take any instances of damage here because he's not attacking he should get hit by his friend if anything bop it what what the fudge is this flesh eating maggot it's gonna be either attacks or buffs of diamond damage okay well it has negative damage so i should do like yeah i just do extra damage to him regardless okay well thinking we do some random damage that kills you and go ahead and block your next attack and i think i'll use my ultimate steal one hit for 60 to 90. you're dead not quite a level up but now it wasn't a perfect fight we don't have full health but hello armed wanderer learn a new skill get one out of three advanced cards that's gotta be good forget a skill remove one card from your deck now that's tempting you know in a deck builder you always want to figure out what synergy you want and then sift out i guess is a good way to say it all the cards you don't want in your deck to be able to you know get that synergy going but i'm just going to learn a new skill because we we don't have anything oh look at these final strike deal one hit for 200 damage upgrade for every enemy killed by this card increase its damage by 10 percent now does that mean he's just for the rest of the game i can stack this that's pretty interesting finishing blow do you want to hit 450 damage for every enemy killed by this card increases damage by 200 till the end of combat oh yeah so i guess it's just permanently this is pretty good though it's only one mana but it's only one combat and deep wound mark an enemy for the next two turns each hit it receives while mark reduces their armor by 10 until the end of combat that's pretty good especially if we come across some thick bones uh but amigo face i want to stack some final strikes screw it so i'ma do just that adventure is the name of the game wait a second i forgot to turn on my candle ah stupid that doesn't look very inviting uh but i'm gonna attack these guys anyway double battle whatever you'll need all the numbers you can get uh i regret everything what is this intends to debuff a bounty hunter and a mind bender this enemy will spawn illusions of random enemies don't like that some sort of summoner and tainted force another weird card stunning enemy if not played next turn game 10 barrier oh so this one's helpful because i a lit my torch my blaze burn level high see weirdness is repelled completely nice okay yep that makes sense well i like barrier a pool of additional hp yeah don't mind if i do okay or i could just stun you know that that is an option too nobody has armor but i like my barriers so i'm gonna block to avoid that damage and then we [Music] are going to maybe double the overhead swing nah not worth it i don't like the randomness here let's uh hit you and oh i should have done this first to reduce your armor now stupid i mean because it does put it negative 10 which means we'll do i assume 10 extra damage is that how that works i'm gonna i'm just going to say yeah all right we got a barrier na and he added disturbance special look at that face okay i also realized i don't have to wait for this to be fully charged but if i do does more damage so right now i can do it for 19 to 28. which is pretty good don't get me wrong actually it's really good hold on okay if i do this that'll do let's say 12 damage 78 uh then he'll be down to 58 then i could do this when he's vulnerable still not quite enough all right well you know what let's just finish this i won't take any damage i don't get to stack my cool card but it's like the right thing to do we get a new card oh shoot so i can gain two damage unlock a new weapons slot for runestones or gain 30 max hp wow well well a new weapon slots sounds real nice who am i kid we're going damage let's be honest with ourselves okay uh i think i might have to light a new torch here burn level low not for long but uh i need more torches evidently what is this thing a blood halter do i even want to screw it push in my luck baby gambo oh no 75 this enemy will negate every hit under certain threshold damage you can also deliver a certain amount of hits to temporarily get rid of this buff okay well nobody here has armor so this is pretty easy because i can just go and then decrease the armor of these guys so that this abomination helps me out there when he does attack it'll negate the damage here but i don't believe the armor debuff part nope big brain uh i'm going to see is the blood altered does that mean i'll heal or am i sacrificing hp i don't know i guess we're gonna find out who doesn't love a little bit of gamba stun an enemy if not played next turn gain 10 barrier well all of that is interesting he intends to give me a bad card honestly not the ooh double pane wait a second this is the combo we're looking for i'mma do it double pane deep breath to guard so we're not taking damage we get two minus one cost next turn and then small strikes i like it and i'll get 10 barrier look at that hand i mean how bad is it like what am i i'm gonna take probably 14 damage i have a barrier and to be fair i can get one block off i think i already watched this we're gonna mop now damage into them is gonna be doubled so yeah i really can't miss here so we're going to stack that one more energy so let's do the amaryllis easy oh my god and then my barrier shall protect me now hitch wait for a guaranteed kill what are you gonna do buff you're gonna debuff um [Music] i don't like what you're all doing here again uh how do we i just don't really do that much damage see what i'm picking up pain and unless i do damage it does not stack my small strike so i have to kill him with my weird hunt do you think right in which case i could go oh but it doesn't count if it goes in okay good news guaranteed to die get out of me fast forget about it you know i'm gonna stun you just because i can and then i'm gonna double up on this that's a lot of doll that's a lot of damage all right please heal me instead of damaging me but i'll pray ah requires hp sacrifice hp for two weird candles i mean that's pretty good sacrifice hp to remove one card from your deck 33. stack of hhp for a level up weird candles weird candles rather leave myself a two hp don't forget so let's go with the weird candles now what is that i wonder it's time uh i'm nervous oh it's a big boy oh a thousand health batman crumbling stones gum will spawn a new enemy after receiving 10 hats enemy tends to attack all enemies and buff for a lot of damage how much you buy any 75 armor holy hackers okay what's this reduce damage volumes by 75 this turn if not reduce the cost of one random card by two okay as long as i can get a block yeah okay so i'm not gonna play that uh so reducing armor is a big one that did one health huge okay we're gonna go that's how much armor he has my stack thing's only doing nine to twelve good lord um well block for sure and it's even worth doing three to four damage honestly no i think i the only attacks i do right now are to reduce his armor and we'll see if he has other mechanics but i'm going to wait it out we're going to wait it out i don't want to know what his buff's going to be i'm kind of scared about that but what did he oh so he transferred armor into damage he's gonna block himself again does he maybe just keep switching back and forth back and forth ooh random attack is good here reduce armor by 50 this turn this could be our moment to attack and it could double it but that's only the hit itself i guess right but then what do i even follow it up with oh wait i need to stun him because he's going to attack me three times okay yeah so let's go broad reach and then do that uh i don't remember hitting you 10 times he says he'll spawn a new one after receiving eight more hit uh stun enemies with no or negative armor this is nice stupids ah wait so every time i stun him 300. you can he's it what the holy suck okay we're this is this is bad frankly yeah this is bad not gonna lie sure taking anywhere from 12 to 18 and seven to ten you know i'm just going to go ahead and heal once go ahead and do that i have to double a block and then reduce his armor even more and then pray somehow i i don't know how much we're gonna be able to do it exactly but wait are these guys attacking me or not like did they hit me i can't really tell oh my god what have i done oh my god what have i done am i dead are they all attacking me is this how i die i'm gonna pop another health potion because it might be high doc ah that was not worth it because let's see right now i'd be doing maybe half his health but maybe not you know and that's kind of my trump card i think i'm just going to take out to this guy is the most help what did he get she's the opportunity deal one hit for 15 to 21. i'm gonna be honest that wasn't worth it okay but it's too late now so i'll take 17 to 26. that could just kill me all right you know what i'm doing it well you live and you learn we unlock blood loss blessed curse and rage now i also know going into that fight what not to do aka stun him yeah don't don't do not stun him and unfortunately half my deck was stuns and then i'm like surely he there's a limit to how and then they just kept popping [Music] [Music] you
