something i swear to god blew just let me live my life dude he's probably pitying me he's like you know i won't kill him immediately soon yeah but like not right off the bat i'll take i'll take a pity not kill i guess pity mercy whatever you'd want to call that specimen room is the sussiest it's just very far apart if if if you and the killer are in here and no one else is like there's like you can't escape you're dead pretty much pretty much the only way that can end i'll just leave the sample to stew or brew or no that's not the right word you know what it's just not english today oh there's blue again there's blas she's doing blasts i should have checked the okay better check the oh god oh this is bad this is bad i'm out of here bro oh god i don't know who that was but don't mess with me bro i'm just doing my tasks man come on i'll let someone else do the lights didn't go so well for me last time i can't tell if somebody can see me i'm just gonna keep doing my task bro of course i got all these long tasks oh god nobody's fixed the lights fudge i gotta go do it myself i'm gonna die but nobody's doing it so pray for my soul oh thank god what what was taking you guys so long er [Music] yeah what's up christ freaking two people are dead oh shoot really sonic yes because i checked the freaking life alert freaking crap i don't even know what's going on you're doing your job and i can't get up um okay i have a question for sonic yeah i feel like i saw you at the electric yeah i saw three of y'all go in that room and you know what happens when there are people grouped up especially as of recently someone freaking died so i booked it but why didn't you go in it when you were there by yourself i wasn't there by myself i was going in when you guys were going in hello i saw you standing at the door doing nothing i was opening this i don't believe that no not no no i don't has anybody seen aries or datto during this round uh no simply no uh oh can i show you guys something can you guys follow me to the med bay no i would like to show you all yeah the last time this didn't go well this last time it was a double kill i would like i need somebody to come with me dude somebody somebody told me to death last time and i'm not interested again okay you got tongue i got talking dude i'm jealous that's hot we have no info we got to be careful though because they could win this pretty quick at this point it's not called tongue this called rim job oh my god okay one of these days dork voting for himself is gonna backfire [Music] i guess i should i mean if he really says he's innocent i probably should this price can just destroy my life right now if you wanted to i gotta upload this i should oh bryce don't do it i'm dead i'm done here is it this is how it ends he's gonna kill me he's gonna kill me and i can't do anything about it oh jesus it's blue and it's him and it's hold on it was blue and bryce pulling bryce let me check here okay nope it's a blue's still alive and bryce isn't dead so we're good for now what man this is bystander effect at its finest man nobody ever i mean i guess that was part of the problem but nobody ever just does the electrical oh jesus god that scares me every time all right i'm almost done now i swear i'm gonna come over to med bay and oh i was gonna say om's probably dead but he's not dork and oh i'm just kidding this way no bodies as far as i can tell and i'm almost done with my thing which means i can go do whatever i want [Music] oh wow some easiest wires of my life gosh this stupid who keeps turning off the lights i'm over it thank you blue blue's our hero blue was number one any bodies a shark okay ohm's down there he's definitely doing stuff rice and bless uh oh bryson home where did bryce gnome go um where was it what it was like down south yeah i checked the vitals too fruit did you see what i saw almost dead do you know who was with um bryce yeah i was just about to say yeah we got you you were right with ohm and he's dead yeah would you like to uh explain to the class why home happened to be with you and now i'm dead i wasn't with them okay listen i saw you so that was a  lie no we got the test no no no no here you know what let me let me uh let me remind you i you got some elapse of memory let me help you here okay okay yeah yeah if you if you could help me out remind me yeah i'll just fill out some holes here you know what it's okay murdering people it has like a big psychological effect yeah we forgot you were headed down southwest you went to the trash bless was there bless left you kind of watched okay cool whatever meanwhile ohm was doing the water wheel stuff and then you come back yeah and ohm's going up to the nature room and right as soon as he goes out the frame and you're right i look like i would know how to kill somebody yeah i don't know okay here's when i found the body i don't know who it was i forgot what color it was either blue or purple but you that well so if this isn't you i'm really sorry but if it is yeah okay we're trying it wasn't that hard the cameras never lie okay so who do we think is us aside from that maybe dork or shark i don't just want to be camera christian because you're going to expect that so instead i think i'm just going to walk with them talk with them you know what i'm saying the only thing though is i risk myself dying oh but the tasks are almost done who's not doing the tasks fudge and then i come here to try and identify stuff and somebody turns the freaking lights off so now i could be dead for all i know i have no idea could be the end of me if i could i mean this you know it's been been a fun ride you know uh it's been a pleasure everybody the camera strikes again because guess who i saw murdered in cold blood like yorkshire you ruined the surprise detective thing yeah go ahead go ahead like give me a story because i don't know what's going on you know now dork probably thought that he was gonna get away he thought he was off scot-free he closed that door but guess what that door opened giving me proper vision with a security camera to see a dork strangle that dude's neck in cold blood and then he went up north to try and look like he was gonna fix something but reality all he fixed was a plate of murder so that's that's about that's all i got wait uh vote i want to do the uh emergency i'm gonna do my bit uh that's like another minute and a half bro yeah that's like can we just skip please i'm begging you it better be a good bit because like it is a good bit bro what though is it 75 second good bit because like no no no no no no i mean like on the i mean like he can't kill two of us with one kill button so like things i do for content bliss oh oh yeah sorry sorry for the bit for the bit for the bit for the bit what wrong bit blessed sorry i was reading the dm you forgot the script different script different script well it's for the bit so [Music] ah i saw all naked and i am the imposter [Laughter] i told now now we stay here for a minute yo the cameras came in a little too clutch there but that's only because like i was literally all my tests for like forever you had a good run but you two just got unlucky with the cameras i striked again dude the cameras do be getting you george orwell was on to something he did kind of pop off but you know who else popped off us let's get it justice justice nice work boys freedom dude i've never seen crap camerawork do that like yeah it was just right place right time he literally clutched the house like literally i think being for both of them was our task and i was like you know what i'm gonna give you a fruit and then i just see bryce and om and i was like oh that's pretty normal and then a meeting gets called ohms it i was like i'm sorry i gotta no one would have known that it was bryce if they did not see him on the camera because he murdered yeah he and freaking home to hit i'm just like i got three people and they were all clean except for the stupid camp and i would have gotten away with it too god maybe one day dude maybe one day i'll get imposter can you imagine because i certainly can't [Laughter] just vibing bro you know what an innocent dude just by ben how many fixing lights i'm not gonna sit in that little sausage fest though and get stabbed in the middle of it and then somebody else blames me a shark and blast nicely done gentlemen now shark went to cameras but is he actually on the cameras that is the question but i'm not going to bother to check it oh i've never done this what though oh my god this is terrible it's rough yeah come on nailed it that was kind of fun i don't know how i've never gotten those before yo i found arrows no out on the computer um how are three people already dead dude that's what i wanted there's like the one person that could attest that i was innocent and he's dead i didn't even see any of those people who was the guy who could have tested i don't think i saw any of them either wait i will say that blue and i were chilling he was filling up water i was filling up water he left mr fruit came in from approximately the same direction and lose debt i don't have a lot that's all i got curious my name is datto my name dave that that's it yeah i don't even know what you're talking about so oh you don't know what i'm talking about mr fruitin i don't know daddo song fruit i know listen okay obviously we don't have enough unless that's actionable is that actionable do we want to make a vote based off of that what could we be funny if it like it's it's not probable cause it's not probably please but freedom considering that i would like to invite you guys on an adventure i will be taking my clothes off yes i'll be in the front of the line three people are dead we're almost we have always lost who cares just come with me to the med bay and you could witness the greatness of me showering so like you think it's a lot more great than the rest of us some i think we just lose here how did three people be heading right there no one's seen anything i've been vibing and i get blamed not that i'm surprised it always seems to happen oh my god first time nuts i just need to keep count or pay attention to who all's here om dork price it could go for a double kill which would be unfortunate okay so let me see here do your thing um okay ohm is good i'm gonna choose the anomaly i'm just watching him get scanned okay we know ohm's good we know dork's good all right so they're chill home and dork are chill that eliminates this a little bit no let me let me out oh wait i do technically have it however ah dead body man it's datto datto is dead that's all i know okay well here's what i know ohm dork are innocent so it's bryce shark or you well actually it's two out of the three unless you're alone i don't know what's going on in there i mean you can think that all you want but i know i'm gonna report two out of three are bryce shark i just wanted to do my duties and like be able to go to bed like okay wait where was the body sorry if you hear me where's the body like i'm sorry you died last look i i wish i could be a better detective i don't know all right we've lost bless okay shark what have you been doing where was the body bless uh on me where are you really uh uh next to a round circle table with uh it looks like soundproof wall floor what part of the map center center right all right here's what we know rice might have been able to get that kill but probably not the only people that weren't with us are shark and blast i was yeah well bryce did come watch me shower for a little bit that's what i'm saying so either took the shot i was just saying for the med based thing and i couldn't find it all right we have a 66 channel yes say something to convince me five seconds okay i can't i literally can't i gave you a chance all right if it's not shark then we know it's bryce and black good luck on your long con fruit oh no don't say that i'm a ho you scared the hell out of me shark what'd i say all right so i know who the last one is i'm getting all these wheels have i never gotten these before how do i oh uh but all i have to do is call the meat well actually no we still it's either bless or bryce one one or the other lesser bryce bless you bryce if they kill one of them it's going to make it real easy they haven't so far so we're vibing i'm just going to do my tasks i've narrowed it down med bay cayman clutch what's going on here come sabotage shiver it up super duper oh shimano nailed it if i were the imposter i would not kill those two because that's how i've narrowed it down if they do that they're just gonna make my job much easier and in the meantime i'm just completing all the tasks what the hell oh man down bryce made this really easy you saw me in the bottom left man you saw i mean the bottom left it's bryce sorry but i've been following fruit because i've been following me in bottom left it was between you know each other like two seconds ago here's the deal i know ohm and dork are innocent and they know that too they saw each other scan yeah i'm innocent yeah i've been watching for i was literally talking i was talking to myself like if i'm the imposter i wouldn't kill bless because that's going to eliminate and i know who it is and you you happen to kill bless and by process i've been watching through like a hog bryce i i feel like there's no one else that could do it because i saw a dork scan yeah bryce i'm sorry it'd do be like that wait was it two seconds ago do you have a defense it was two seconds ago because you were an event bryce is that why you go through the fence like i know what's going on then i wouldn't put that past him i think fruit is messing with you guys for real though uh i just voted shark i mean i'm just trying to think when fruit could have killed anybody i'm voting if i'm wrong with bryce you can vote me out and you guys will still win if either vote i'd maybe but i've been watching fruit i don't know when he could have killed anybody he was nowhere near where the body was yeah i'm chilling i've legit been like watching for the whole time literally was in hard mode this round i don't understand dude he wanted that dub it was you all right it's your favorite crewmate if i don't say it then i'm not really a crewmate i'm going to sit here and hope i don't die don't do it bro [Music] uh uh oh daddo oh what door hey shark not bro all right so here's what happened right i'm in the where's the freaking place where the the button is right that that whole area right yeah i am fixing the wiring i see shark come up i go down from where shark was coming up and all the way down there is a dork's dead body so nice treasure how do i know you killed him and reported the body and blame me how do i know that oh sharks okay [Laughter] there's no need he's just trying to inflate you up man i understand like he could say fruit what sort of distance are we talking between him and the body i'm talking there's literally no way he would have gone the route he went without seeing the body i didn't even see nobody i saw a dork but i didn't see him like i didn't hear me out here i'm going with sonic because i know how it is to find the bodies and then be accused yourself that is literally the worst so but if it doesn't work then we're voting charcoal it's fruit and sunlight this right also i can i say one thing before you guys finish that vote he said i vote for ab not shark what he said shark yeah why did you know that green you got my mastermind [Music] see dude i've been there i i had to relate to him so many times have i seen the crime or figure it out and then i go guys this happened and then they go that's kind of sus dude it was probably you so you know what i said sonic seems genuine i've been there they try and spin it going on a limb and you know i i believe you and it worked out that's my boy right there okay i'm gonna fill this up and then do the seismic stabilizer [Music] please don't kill me don't kill me don't kill me please don't kill me i don't want to die okay data seems pretty good because no one ever just sits at that one i'm guessing i'm making this up i'm gonna die sitting on the stupid stabilizer the love of god somebody somebody they should see one out of two i'll do a bus don't kill me like this dude don't do this there any bodies bus is a hundred percent oh there's been communications at the doorway okay i could tell you i was near blub i saw bryce recently mm-hmm and i saw sonic recently where was this body front door of communications but just barely inside the building okay so sonic and bryce are good and i'm good we were all on the right's good that's implying a lot of people are good based on literally absolutely nothing daddo and bless shadow and bless both look a little bit suspect i mean i was with fruit like i just who do you think did the other hand on the reactor yeah it's very convenient and like i was helping a traitor to do that can you can you collaborate daddo's story uh so what happened was i was filling up gas and then the size of anything goes off i go oh shoot so i go to the left pillar and i sit there for 40 seconds i hate you all and that's pretty much it because you all wasted my time nobody went to the thing so i can't i okay fruit so i saw you go up to that one i was like okay someone's definitely at the other one already i'm gonna finish my task i saw you go up five seconds go by nobody does it i'm like f it i'll go over think i'm gonna see a dead body no dead body scan it go down to communication no dead body i saw datto by the cameras when i was going up to the thing after that i don't know but he was there at that time when i first went so i think it's either or bless i just i think it might be blessed also was coming you wouldn't follow someone keeping an eye on y'all right uh you know this is what i get for trying to be a good crewmate man doing the seismic stabilizer but that's the thing dude they're like fruit what are you doing like what's the size i'm not even gonna try dude look this is what happened this is what it is you believe it cool you don't you're wrong you know what i'm saying that's it i will say though if uh sonic's actually going the omega con here that would be pretty sick because as far as i'm concerned like that it's good you know what i'm saying all right now i got to go to the stabilizer because nobody else is doing it okay so is bless bryce and plus i swear to god quit closing the doors on me dude okay sonic's good he's been down here a while which would make sense because these mini games are so convoluted i barely know how they work uh you're good in my book sonic you know you've pretty much already been proven you could have done the double dip you know betray your own friend but i don't think you did it's a little too early to play that it's a very ballsy move it's high risk low reward you know it's one of those things all right but i'm almost done what were you doing bottom left i was  down by the trees and the other thing i just did those two okay wait wait wait you just what the tree like inside the room i did that probably about a 45 seconds ago a minute okay i was about to say because if you're saying you were right there then no no no no no i just moved down to the bottom of the map so i think you're good here's what i'm plus i know sonic's good i went to check on vitals right before this was called bless came from vitals would have known someone was dead on the thing wasn't going towards the button and also would have been coming from top right actually i came from okay yeah after murder i've been on bless me too no i really did come from top left so who else so data where exact you said this was somewhere in the lab i uh i came up from the specimen whatever the f in the bottom right came up through the contamination lights went out i hid in the corner i figured wait likes to come back on went out out the door blue is right there right in front of the light switch trying to repair the wires i i was really top left i swear no you weren't because i fixed the lighting top left voting bless you just gave yourself up i'm sorry bless i'm gonna feel bad sometimes it'd be like that listening last words oh [Music] that first body i was literally stuck in a corner and blast was running at me i was like foreign
