in today's dream team the dream team's in the new dungeon we didn't have to do that i'm like i'm like blue normally normally we enter a dungeon like blue what do we do now i know but but i'm gonna let you guys figure it out okay oh so now you can be like pepe left they don't they lack the critical we talk that took us 20 minutes let me see that hippo dick nice he looks like trent alexander arnold it's a very niche joke but if you watch football you'll understand oh we're going into the sussy baca land where the imogas imposter lives whoa whoa what actually we're in the mindscape of calluses but that's you know we're in his mind yeah the mindscape brother we could look at this porn history now like cows oh okay uh what do we do there's a gate can i run through it oh shooting a red thing that's a bold choice i'm shooting oh nice okay teleported oh no looks like callus is on his period oh i'm pretty sure this is morbid time so we come back over here okay oh this is uh and shoot it oh no nice oh ding dong this is actually one giant advertisement for stranger things season four we're in the upside down stranger things season four is one of those shows that i'm never going to watch because everyone their mom is like oh my god it's the best show ever waiting for like it's actually made me not want to watch it did they release it like all the episodes are out um or is it like a weekly thing i think just all of them but here's the thing dude i think like the average episode length is like an hour and a half what yeah that's too much of a commitment man we're back more than now what we morbed okay you morbed we more go back over here and morb away what do you think away we need to escape the mindscape well actually well no we need to delve deeper into the mindscape figure out his psyche shoot the thing bold very bold that was wrong no actually that's the mechanic is you wipe that is the mechanic it's time to go back back back so now why would that have killed us because we were in not in uh spot did yeah perhaps we transported and there wasn't geometry oh i'm not saying that's the answer i'm just running with what he was saying i'm not handing out answers no no free no handouts here no handouts until possibly final boss dps otherwise i think you guys are gamers you'll get it real quick okay so we killed the mobs [Music] there's no geometry so we have to find i think i think i know what is it you you stand we need to go up like here so we stand on the little side spots a hardcore parkour ah add on you rock nice okay so like yeah you want to stay in there okay yeah you stand there chime me daddy okay so that is why we died okay so we have to find a spot to morbid maybe we trusted you oh wait wait wait wait wait i think i know i think i know okay so maybe i need to jump up here and then you morb or maybe we all jump up here and then i think we do jump up i'll focus there's no geometry in the way in the in the more world so we've got to go up i see radar whoa maybe we don't need yeah maybe we just climb up actually okay yeah so we just more buff got it enemy sniper ow snipers down cheap oh i see the entrance i think uh-huh what have you spotted wrong oh i missed oh oh i missed nothing now what's in there oh there's a problem there's a broken spoiler here what does it mean do you think it speaks our language i think it's morp's power steel all right rub hurry up so we can coming steady yeah shut up steal memory it's mine now nicely done now now what uh we keep morphing i think it changes the bell memory probably because eris was saying how we're entering memories so now we shoot this are you oh oh okay so that would that was far too creative for them so how's there no geometry there perhaps that's not why you're dying maybe i'm young oh i see where we have to go hey we should go up there rob and then we shoot it from up there okay i like the uh the cape you got there's that herman miller looks like it's got some good spinal support it's great spinal support actually i got it from the raid oh what is this all right so let's see what's in this one ow not rob it's okay shoes what's the mouth doing you can spectate winners pov you know yeah looks pretty cool the aesthetics so is kallus like a person or is he like an ai he's a doom it's kyle's dad yeah he is kyle's dead but he is also has essentially uh uh forgotten his physical form yeah he's like mega brain kind of you know he was like usually commute with the darkness and i'm too cool for flesh we found a ding dong bing bong this is great i can just kill rob on demand the guys i don't feel like just don't do that again oh i guess i'm gonna go down here then i'm going deep so wait his mind is a ship like inception oh this okay well now it's i mean it's not quite as literal you guys are doing great yeah sorry rob we're well that's what i get for this morning punished very punishing well you got symbols bungie loves symbols they love good news um it's not gonna be anything like the raid as far as symbols go so well here we go rob oh i'm joining you guys okay what do what dude i'm on my king james [ __ ] i'm shooting things the bell's ready to be wrong acquire standard essence so perhaps if we kill a standard bearer i don't know what just oh we killed the bearers and then we get their assets i died again i'm coming rob drop a bubble you're not my son i don't have one but there oh i can't hurt him oh jesus are you sure have you have you tried everything no um there is a bell over here nightmare collapsing i think we once we start it we have to get all the nightmare essences take it out uh i guess shoot the bell okay okay so i have the standard essence axe what do i do with this thing uh there's a sun here and a cup standard essence x what do i do with it oh there's the axis there hey there's a nightmare bell in the words of our lord and savior our game but leader what would he say in here yeah bank those brother oh hello nice bank so i guess then we go four times oh wait there's no door open oh oh really good observation rob oh yep almost ran away it's what they want you to do they don't know okay good news is i don't think any of these encounters have enraged timers so well let's go find another one to kill yeah there's a there's a nightmare dude over here the bearer you miss okay uh yeah it's a sun so you got this one okay so grab the sun one and then we open another bell wait do we need to we need to go shoot the other bell uh yeah i think so the bell's not there though why i don't know because the bell keepers probably okay but the ballet hurt we got 13 seconds oh my god i don't want to die what the bell doing not that i know that that's gonna kill us in six seconds but i mean if it were i'm so young jesus christ oh the bell's here pep dub wait what oh we have to go back back kill the bell keepers big brain okay well that's easy so we just pick up bells from the bell keepers and then we go back i want i think we could pick up more than one i want to see that would make this encounter way less annoying i'll back you up rob you're not alone together we can do anything even maybe not destroying the yellow uh room for this so we have to just we have to just look for where the spawns are so i guess we can oh god look at that that's up at the mall double the time i got the sword let's go kill the bell keepers bell keepers have been slain awesome let's go boys okay then we go back yes uh oh we have to be next to the bell took you guys a little while but there you go i grabbed

okay there he is all right i got it you got dogs it's time to go back back back uh let's go let's just kill the ball and we'll go back in again i'm pretty sure you can override whatever one you got right you're let's go oh okay all right find your ball your balls and hold on to them apparently reuben's balls go in them every now and then hey yo what the heck what are you telling me like his balls like his ball will go inside his body but then he just gets it back out wait what yeah i told him that's not okay i mean i think okay so i have heard of people like when they jerk off that their balls will go in them yeah and that's come on i was like i don't know if that's uh no i think that's pretty normal i think like if you bought it never happened i've heard of the hospital no no cap i have heard of a couple people saying that yeah when you buy this like when you're taking off oh but no no cap you uh i some people have said like your balls don't go inside you jerk off and i was like haha what the [ __ ] dude yeah it's happened to me but apparently for a lot of people yeah if you jerk off well that's we'll retract it it doesn't even happen during that sometimes sometimes you're just kind of like where'd it go that there it is oh really never in a million years since i've ever happened to me i'd be so i mean hey you got to you got a tight sack then bro that's that's respect you got some tight balls bro nice hey gotta keep it in check i actually it's actually defense mechanism evolution uh if they i take away my weak spot that's pretty true it's like armor it's like a turtle shell you know like yeah you can't got you but have you i've trained my neck to attract my my boss only heard legends of someone who could control their balls like that it's you wait that's retracted i didn't know someone could do that what kind of power does he have all right mine's good oh god you got it rob oh the goalie love it yeah i'm scared we have to i gotta be really vulnerable right now no i'm saying without you we wouldn't be able to kill him this oh wait i'm out of heavy ammo so that's fine just plink away boys ten seconds get up to the back of the belt what should i do one more time yeah well i've never had my nuts go into me so yeah i didn't either and it sounds terrifying it's not like i'd be running to the hospital like i'm like always the kind of person where it's like ah nothing's wrong with me until something's wrong with me and what's going on so if something's wrong like that's that's well the thing too is if someone's like if reuben's like yeah it happens like every day i bet that's probably not normal but for me i can count probably on my hands amount of times happen i mean sometimes my balls get like really close to me but like they never like you know what i mean like just getting real lonely okay i'm ringing the bell they've certainly come close to i've been like where'd my balls go because like i'm so they just want to get to know you better yeah we just want to get to know them like but then like i reached out i'm like oh there they are they're just a little scared right now they're just they've recoiled a little bit you know how you've always wanted more um ad density oh i love it it's just everything happens to be able to totally mean you haven't seen anything let's go boys i'm here all right get to your rooms [Music] where'd my hammer go all right i'm ready captain are you in your room alone no okay i'm almost there boys is easy what the it's almost time i can feel it it's almost it's any second it any anything i knew it took a little bit we just had to get the ball out it was hiding tucked itself in there nice and snug just kill him i'm trying my lord oh my god we're gonna choke aren't we no we're fine we're choking oh my god nothing to choke here my lord the battle's over all right now give me a weapon oh sweet i got a platinum medallion why did i get a platinum a diet wait what did you still have like a guardian games quest that'd be pretty funny how how did it not take it let's go whoo yo world's last platinum medal why did i get a flat in the medallion that's kind of sick that's like tax yeah maybe that like unlocks some secret i don't know you know well just have that sitting around something i'm jumping down i'm just kind of running what are you holding a gun no wait look at me wait stay there wait you have you have your like that little like dynamite thing you throw yeah you're just holding it oh really yeah it's like actually it kind of looks like a penis i'm doing it blue we're so proud thank you whoa anybody want to be a dead man open cough in here oh try not to lift the guards but my dummy thick resilience saloon the centurions come sail away with me oh god how the [ __ ] dude i'm like just going down the tube and now i gotta wait another 40 seconds welcome yeah right now wait for you guys oh okay how did he get there oh i can't make this jump i want to make this jump as a hunter here here it goes oh [Laughter] [Laughter] let's that is the dumbest thing i've ever seen um there's a secret chest in there but i suggest opening it because we've only gotten armor because it's same thing as all the other dungeon chests it's only going to pull from what you've gotten the waking bells may ring once more not the nightmare of kahak wait actually actually [ __ ] i'm a child what's the boss doing i found some bell keepers and i'll have you know they are dead i'm coming roberto [Music] so i'm running around in here but i feel like a headless chicken oh my god dude i hate this well then uh no exotic armor no mods the whole bit but you know oh we're gonna die i don't watch not on my watch yes on your watch well actually i was afraid i was gonna get shot blue all right real quickly i would tell you what exotic to use here but i don't know much about hunters wait first off the reason you're dying too your boots are 13.50 brothers it's not looking good my what your boots are 13.50 i didn't even really have the wrong boots on there you go you don't like the game because you refused to so long i would by the time i said that you could it would be done it's literally that much but now i got you complaining people attacking me i see and then you're like destiny's so late you refused to even put a mod on i never said destiny was like well yes you have many times actually you're not working i don't disagree with you but if you're going to play if you're if it's going to be lamb at least play it lame correctly you know if you're gonna if you're gonna be bad just be good back in the right way all right let's figure out what we got a minute uh you appear to be at axes yeah well i'll kill this guy and then i'll get his loot oh i got son nice you picked it up and the timer extended what are you talking about it didn't extend it went lower six seconds somebody did something wrong well so what ended up happening was rob accidentally picked up the right symbol blue you killed the wrong one so time went down how do we know what the right and wrong one is uh my hint which is not a hand the primer says uh just look in the middle okay son and chalice nice now like rob was saying how do we figure out which one's which i guess if only we knew rob if only only we knew which corner would tell us this is a good question oh it's really musty over here don't don't come over here allergies oh man hey fever you know how it is these days that would be and i'll get chalice nice oh yeah there's one below you got them might be one more somewhere no there's not okay oh there we go we're doing great proud of you guys yeah we're just we're just cyber gamers nah don't let me in with those hey okay we have the dallas i got the chalice as a i be killing my uh thick boy what happened to the extension it did it's just we just need to kill the bell keepers yeah rob you do the you do the ad duty and being [ __ ] get it okay uh whichever place you shoot the bells bell keepers won't be yet it's usually always the opposite oh okay so drill looking for a bell keeper is usually not close to the belt you're going to use okay it's sun and swords sun and axes uh i have sun what you mean sword and shield sun and moon gun sword and shield so where are you going through i'm son another thing too though is even in this room uh there's usually something in the room to indicate like sun literally has sun axes have like axes on the walls dogs has a dog statue so you can also figure it out from here wow man all right i've got mine son acquired i also have mine i'm here i'm pulling i actually couldn't find yeah i don't know where he was i was like i'm trying to find him but nice damage nice damage keep going keep going zerg zerg zerg stick it stick it stick it i'm sticking play it uh that's not the boss yeah it's not over oh there's another one but i can't shoot we got to do it again it's time to go back back back i have acquired my essence i just jumped off the map that's okay you don't have a thing i was looking at my essence uh did you get the bell dudes or not yeah i did okay i'll get his wrist stick the rest all right and go what the dog doing all right now if the boss stays there it'll make this a lot easier yeah there's so many bad guys no you're not you're a gamer look at this man surviving no no no you're not dead i ain't hear no bell i ain't herobot hey bat dad i didn't hear no bell let's do it again oh it's time to go back back back all right i'll be at swords when we're ready okay okay fire [ __ ] hippo wait wait i'm getting the camera yeah oh my god i'll come back are you dogs or well i'm a dogs so uh yeah i'm at axis hello friend you're ready i'm ready you stop putting your shield up bro so annoying oh my god sometimes my grenade launcher does not want to work i've got axes and i have dogs okay my new little ass just keeps getting pounded [Music] fresh meat brothers uh yeah bell's ready all right only four more of those no these are the last ones no i was hoping you would notice this i was like i was like i was like that was the last one right like you say psych i was like there's no way i was like that fills the circle don't worry guys i'm helping with my auto rifle from a distance thank you okay i'm like out of ammo and everything or just about nice good stuff gamers clean there's no chester that's encountered oh okay i was like no chess for this encounter that's a deep explorable a cloak dude god i got a linear fusion let's go i'm like mr fruit luck right now finally i got a weapon i'll give you a deep explorer bond and it looks so sweet i like that i'll try this on the box shoot um if you want a secret chest there's one here but only if you want to get something you've already got him come on come on come on i'm fine it's how am i dead what i should have let you know it was morbid time that is kind of breaking the rules of morbid but the first rule of mormon dude always let your partner know you're morbid yeah you gotta let your friends know you're morbid friends don't let friends morb alone it's morbid time no please don't we're gonna be stuck here the entire time you know what you go i'm gonna go to bathroom you know what you got more yeah yeah all right without me i don't care i knew that was gonna happen so i slowed myself down because if we both died there we would it's more bent i'm all the way back here it can't be his daughter betrayed him yeah i see trout and dogs for what it is you know you know how you know how sometimes people have daddy issues where kyle has daughter issues trump but would that mean she has daddy issues i don't think she has issues with him i think she just kicked him out she's like get out of here old man uh we have chalice and dogs we do so what do we do with that information the symbols are on the top yeah yeah yeah what do you mean dogs all right let me know what to do chief um um you suck me softly i got the asses good job blue mr fruit go get chalice i'm dead [Music] okay did somebody shoot the wrong banner thing i think that's what reduces time all right i i've got chalice shot dogs how copy i'll get chalice i'll get dogs i'll just add clear sounds good thanks man i got chalice i've got dogs make sure to kill your flag or bell keepers otherwise we can't teleport looking for them right here they spawn on these platforms everything oh okay and then if we shoot a side then there'll be one in the middle and the other one so and so forth okay let's get out of here get me out of here all right i'm planting dogs have been planted chalice planted i've got sun chalice how copy uh i'll get chalice i've got son uh you can actually pull us immediately from the right bell rob i hope blue's in position all right son has thoth been a quiet holy holy damage batman no honor colossus you've got are you i got the essence doesn't one shot cringe quit moving all right which one did we shoot left i'm planting sun oh my lord keep missing we got sun and then one other one uh chalice i got sun oh no it's okay i'm fine you're a gamer what i got killed by the architect what well i lost the symbol so screaming um don't dunk yours i don't know if they'll we'll just literally go like right back so it's sun again let me just get this on uh you want me to send us uh one second you can send my brothers in christ bell keepers are dead jesus we can go oh the oh my my sunshine explosion no my sunshine explosion exploded it and the explosion hit the bell well that's fine blue already put us in right no no so we'll just do it again go again oh oh timing i got him i go oh lucky odd timing i accidentally like instead of like sliding i press my throwing knife button architects again moving in a fever dream right now uh it's on the left side wait wait i'm grabbing some oh no i don't need to go we need to go just go come here oh my god i didn't hit this i still have my challah so yeah well i still gotta grab that what is it son you you know where son is all right i'm ready whenever i'm sorry the wolf i got i mean that's fine i was ready i was like the wolf pack rounds alright i got it before i get cheesed to run it somewhere god yeah yeah you can grab uh i got both of them wait you can get more than one kill yeah kill the kill the dudes kill dude which ones are alive the right okay we're ready let's go pull the bubble all right i'm going i'm good one and i'm going to dunk the other dunking the other i dunk the other everything hurts conquest where's the bell of conquest is it mean jesus christ dude nice so this is a big bell huh kyle is vulnerable ah i'm only doing like 600 damage though like i think it was good dps was that the big bell right there blue that you were under uh yeah the big bell makes her vulnerable and then she was going to another bell so i think we have to kill the ball bears before she gets to that bell i just need to kiss this get my energy [Music] [Music] uh bells ready whenever don't kill us oh don't kill those if you kill the wrong standard bears you can come here oh i didn't realize i killed those not bad or that or picking up throwing essence it's one of those i just don't bother uh dunked i've also dunked i'm killing the bear oh my god i'm dead but i don't uh dogs and get away from me oh let's get the nice middle jump same and i just gosh this colossus is trolling me um flag or ball keepers on the right belt i keep saying ball keepers now uh ball keeper too in the middle let's go oh just get over here i got a dunk jesus christ i'm dead did you dunk yep nice conquest is primed so that's gonna send us oh i'm so dead blue i tried to get you so it won't automatically send us i'm dead i'll show you a little pro tip wait what is that why why would you do that if we're not ready but you shot the bell no you have to shoot the thing that hit the gong oh we have to kill these before she gets to it oh it said a bell is ready to be wrong do we have to shoot that one we don't have to shoot the bell after she's vulnerable do we i mean i i can give you answers or you can keep trying to figure it out because if that's the answer that's actually so stupid well but she goes straight to the bell and there's no other way and if we shoot the bell we take we go away though right like the shooting the bell takes us out of the nightmare i'm assuming why would we shoot it no but she's vulnerable we haven't had to bring anyone any other vulnerable person it probably makes her vulnerable in this world when we bring the bell like because she's moving straight to 100 that's what we do we kill the ball bears before she gets to the bell and then we shoot the bell when she's at it uh all right the things are chalice dogs i got childs uh i'll get dogs god damn it dude uh dogs and son you're next to his son i'll get dogs i can't see penis i have mine shane uh the bell will be middle once we cleared them god i'm almost there almost there shoot it like do be dunkin duck uh it'll be sunny again scion's like the scions like are on actual dev accounts all right kill that for that kill the dude you're next to rob and just pick up the sign okay and then we just got to kill ball bearers like god i just keep saying ball bears oh my god my riffs right here up oh well it's gone now it was there no all right rob she's gonna go to the thing i'll try and go with you just kind of dunk it nice valve conquest is primed and then we go and then see the giant gong yeah there we go yeah okay where's she going come go to the middle camera girl i called it that's so dumb we gotta kill the other ball bearers just kill the other ones like while she's like in this little stadium oh it's already open yeah i i killed him already oh i'm not doing any damage we have to be next to it when we no we i think we all have to be on it cow oh so like a sniper is really good for this because like her helmet opens and you can she has a bigger helmet hitbox yeah yeah yeah this three burst is nice oh that would be wicked [ __ ] yeah sure we have to be on the bell because it gives uh more damage yeah that's what uh we couldn't figure out we figured out everything else oh really yeah we were sitting like we knew how to stun her we extended dps phase we did everything because the reason is the first time we went in one of the ballots got like accidentally stored and it tp'd us so we're like okay don't be next to it it'll tp us and why would it give us a buff so we tried everything because when blue brought that up i was like why would we shoot it because if we shoot it it'll just take us out well the shooting we got that and stunning her and then next to it yeah yeah but then why shoot it and you have to be in its radius to then get that's what we couldn't figure out and other people couldn't figure out i see that makes sense and that makes sense as to why you guys were like what yeah cause like and it just so happened to that like when it happened it seemed like okay don't do this and also because again the entire raid sit next to it get teleported all right i'm [ __ ] i'm shooting the middle wait wait oh nope sorry um i think this is max okay i got axes i don't know what the other one was all right it is we gotta go uh he's just get kill the ball get out here oh i swapped my blow blown out though where the last spell keeper oh over by me what you got you've got to be you wouldn't find if you didn't jump there he's so big this guy's nuts i'll go get blue uh i respawn don't worry about it oh man we're gonna try and dunk i go to dunk again we good we got ax sun so top right top left uh bell is ready and i have buff i have the boof i'm almost there oh gosh dunk it i'll kill all the ball bears uh and pro tip is kind of like the guy in the dungeon if some person gets her to stomp every now and then we gotta do it up so save biggest dips for last phase because i think it scales i will admit it's super counter-intuitive for us to have to be next to the bell for each dps phase like right on it yeah because unless you accidentally do it you never we went through ever like we was literally like tech support we're like okay do this don't do that okay go through and we went through everything this encounter definitely would have been way more fun if it was just you just kill the ball bearers and shoot the bells when she gets to them right like the part where like you also need to be it just it's not any else of this dungeon and it just feels like that like it just super fun 100 100 100 let me swap to my well like if you stun her with the thing that's it it's just weird that they're like yeah we don't want to have we don't want every encounter to be a well encounter makes a mechanic that makes it a well encounter um dogs chalice we gotta get blue though are we ready to go i'm at chalice i got oh god why is everything shooting at me dude colossus you're so cringe dude you're so cringe i'm coming blue uh i'll go i'll go get the essence all right i got both just kill bell they're in the middle yeah you know all right i just got double dumped i'll try to cover you on chalice and duncan all right we're good it is chalice uh axe so you can get axe i'll go get chalice hey come here got my essence shane getting them bail keepers i'm shooting these annoying claws dude with 100 resilience and they're shooting you i yeah it's like i have tremors dude i could i'm like i can't hit anything it's ridiculous uh bella's ready i'm coming all right last phase boys clear some of these just make sure kill the bell keepers don't get in there asap trying to help blue but also it matters more just pay attention where she goes first where's she going where the cat will go and it's like just and go uh one more just kill kill them because we'll have to figure out which one she goes to uh left she's going that way you have to kill me oh he's dead oh get her to stop that okay do it do it do it but we got it we got it finished finish nice nice guys i said see as soon as you say as soon as you know it too it's so easy of all the dungeons oh that was a dungeon i got the pulse [Music] it's it's a roll oh well fusion rifle backup plane surplus is that good surplus is a decent bag of planes i mean it's very average this roll ain't great but it's the pulse baby the weapons the one thing though is the aesthetic of the weapons in this raid very hot yeah i do like these yeah i like the the aesthetic like like we've said the art team don't miss yeah yeah it's it's nice for all if i want to stasis build but brother when do i do that this linear though is not here oh we did it boys good job you guys killed the the mechanics as always you get damage that's dead for you baby
