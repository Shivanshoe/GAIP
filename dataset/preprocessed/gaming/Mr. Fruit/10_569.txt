hi 81 my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to smite and today is the day today is literally the day I played smite for that is because as you see here the Avatar The Last Airbender skins are officially and the game and in today's video we're gonna be showing off egg the Maryland skin now fair warning I've only had a game of Merlin and he's a little complicated okay we still didn't get mid but we got solo we'll make it work oh look he's doing the thing alright let's level this up oh boy this is gonna be fun look at the recall skin oh oh I'm gladder so this will be interesting oh I see so possibly my auto attacks are just air and then everything else is the other elements so the way Maryland works is he can constantly swap between elements it's well it's quite confusing in fact I don't even know which one I'm on I am on the void 1 or whatever which i roughly remember what that does this what what does this do again alright let's see what this looks like ba ba ba oh so that's airbending we love that now check this out okay well one I'm just I'm just wrecking him with my autos bow because you know at a distance okay and then I'm gonna change to fly off yeah you like that back off buddy all that holy Jesus what's this damage God the minions hurt so bad I didn't really mean to swap to fire I just kind of panicked it was the next one in the line so I need to watch this more carefully but yet now I'm a firebender because well I've said yeah but darn I do whatever this guy is pinging something oh you want to give that to me okay well I'll take it just give me a second shoo oh look at that fire bending yeah hang was scared to firebend but we ain't baby we ain't all right now I I'm gonna destroy this girl was a visual delight explosions manna fudge yeah and there's no way with all those minions to die see but we did some good damage I'm out of health pots though so this is extremely dicey I need to be using the ice though because I think ice is the best one in fighting because it can slow people and stuff again I'm not entirely sure all right so see I'm gonna send out my window or tax which completely missed I'll get destroyed that one didn't though good damage and I got the last hit oh my god the fudge yeah she said she's kind of bullying us if I'm being honest we're doing good damage but also not good enough damage you straight up I gotta go i'ma die she might just come yup oh okay well you know I wouldn't fear guys okay yeah no I'm worried that's that's pretty bad now the reason we like what well now waterbending is because yeah I can slow the enemy which is always nice we do like that like this pop and then if I come over here no they're forgetting movement was too hard for me to hit my autos ah all right well you know we weakened them and now these minions are just [ __ ] me I kind of miss some of my slow cuz this is the my main slow and if I miss it well then we're just kind of screwed you know I'm saying so I'm just gonna do what damage I can I think technically my firebending is my best wave clear but let's level that okay this guy's still sticking around though he might be getting greedy we might also not be able to do anything about it I'm gonna pretend like I'm not gonna go for him but then we do fudge dang it alright so oh we got him all right I'm gonna die but that's fine oh Jesus man all these people have like super long range high damage friggin things and hey but we got him we died for it but a certain our alpha ness we can buy that that's great what does this do whenever you damage an enemy god when the ability you mark them to take increased damage that's that's great yes okay just what I wanted I have no idea I'm just following a bill that just tell me what to go I never bothered to pick up the regeneration camp which which well quite frankly I should have we're up against what abalone Bologna Bologna whatever however you want to say okay so I'm gonna do this leave that wave clear it's a little expensive man wise you know but I'm gonna do what I want to do so I'm gonna do this surely because it's good wave clear and look at that consistent damage well not today oh yeah the only problem is I just got have like no base HP so Jesus any damage is a lot of damage for me I'm debating if we want to try and bully this person off I'm just gonna wave clear why not spread oh yeah look at that wave clear that's fantastic I should probably get out of here what's happening over here by the way my lane opponent is missing so I kind of feel like I should be helping oh there you are you little rascal I see you hiding around there are you know you don't cover governor oh she Alton cheese okay well we got our old town a little all right I could be getting ganked here at any moment oh my god wait she has a freaking she has the teleport room well played so they forgot earthbending which I guess makes sense you know he only controls three elements but ya know we're spending I got some shoes though so now we fast we got them booties matured on the right is almost down my team is doing great stuff they're all doing a lot better than me you know technically I'm supposed to be a mid laner you know that's that's the problem this really isn't my fault so I'm just gonna go ahead do the good guy dying for my ability just gonna go ahead and do this hit you with that that you with that come on try me now unfortunately I'm a very bursty character I'm definitely image if I miss or once I do my rotation like that's my damage you know I'm saying although I'm gonna I'm gonna start whacking you what up where you going girl you're going away and I can't do anything about alright well play yeah so see I think I should be out of my waterbending and save that for later in the fight because that's when I can chase and do all that fun stuff oh but oh but I'm gonna oh my god the freakin oh my god I'm the best oh oh I barely sniped him out of that that's incredible okay I need to run away oh that was so greedy of me and we managed baby okay yes oh my alt is I swap between my abilities and it does damage when I do it I just feel like I'm never close enough to like get that damage off oh I went the wrong item first by the way oh oh well so I don't know when I should start roaming I have taken my tower so it kind of feels like now wouldn't be a bad time to do it but I'm just gonna immediately start with that that's some solid damage I'm gonna TP out of here actually somehow I think they're they're up on that okay Oh what I thought I swapped in time oh my god wait you're going in holy jesus whoa the heck did you just do that's No oh my god okay okay whatever you just did good job it was crazy I was like oh we can't catch up to him and then you're like jumping through mystical phantasmal tree branches or something oh I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming you're not my friend come over to me come over I'm coming I'm coming buddy where'd you oh god am I gonna get jump now what the fudge I'm on my ice I'm gonna slow I'm gonna hit him with the only that burst damage they weren't ready for that what is this guy doing you you do know what the heck okay well evidently doesn't really care holy damage you know you know I'm not entirely oh good damage good damage ah oh whoa you just like karate chop something like push our some that was sick it missed though let's go in this and then I'm supposed to get the spear of desolation that was apparent what I was supposed to get first whoops I actually think the skill floor on Maryland is pretty low but the skill ceiling is pretty high it definitely seems like there's a lot of combo potential and stuff you got to learn when to use what thing and all that kind of stuff you know oh oh we're doing it again I'm coming I'm coming coming oh my god screw this guy I'm trying just run away run away run away yeah I got you I got you I think I'm doing a great job at trying my best I'm giving it my all team that's all you can ask for me trust me I can't do anything else for y'all so I'm going to now I'm gonna save my blink okay slow like that then come in and then well done that went pretty well I'd say so let's just wave clear we're good at that you see that oh there was a wave and then there wasn't that's what I do I'm gonna try and steal their region camp not entirely sure that's a good idea okay I can upgrade my old that's good so let's let's just continue uh-huh let's apply so I actually I can't see any of the enemy team I am just asking to get ganked right now okay so there's someone mid wait a second how the tides have turned I'm about to roll up on this person in mid got my ability ready I see them and they're gone all right Oh God screw you oh yeah that's really only good against the wave oh my what is going on here okay if I go to my ice I might be able to pull something off here not guaranteed also I don't know what that wall is but I feel safe when I'm around it so he was slowed man these guys can just jump okay I'm gonna blink I'm here to help like I said I'm here to help what the [ __ ] dude don't need nobody own independent jungler and he don't need no help I'm gonna go for a slow here what up Cthulhu what up yeah he's like oh shoot I didn't realize yes right oh my god ah everything hurts what did you just do to me sir I don't know but it's kind of going down right now okay I'm out oh we're doing the gold fury okay okay let me rotate through my spells that's all I can do why is it immune I don't know ray oh I do have a large amount of gold I'm out of here I got 3,200 to spend oh shoot we're going shopping oh that looks great yeah I don't know what it does but I'm about it yeah I feel like I should really look up a guide how to play Merlin when I should be on what element oh oh oh oh oh oh you my friend have made a grave mistake no you don't know you don't all I even got the knock up and I got the kill surprisingly with an auto attack it's gonna say I don't have any more abilities so probably not gonna get any of that but little did I know I'd get the whole thing I hate not being able to see in my peripheral like right here I feel like I could easily be getting ganked but who really knows all right they're fighting and slain that's great I will wave clear and take objectives which i think is just as important oh we are destroying this turret by the way yeah this turret didn't stand a chance all right I can push the Phoenix or I can help my team I feel like pushing the Phoenix would normally be the best play here because they seem to be doing all right however I want to kill things oh you're just gonna jump away really you coward you make me sick Oh God oh wait we don't have this turret what am i doing oh what's up what is that thing some sort of hellfire I'll grab this now I'm a speedy boy all right yeah we're just grabbing all the objectives now we're just teaming up you know we're doing things what level am i 17 so this person okay keep your demon soul fire thing away from me and I'm gonna help you with Cthulhu over here I'm right here baby and then swap elements yes and I got the kill I think my my stance change is actually what got us the kill which I normally never get that damage off so that's it feels good we're getting this Phoenix we're destroying this Phoenix more like it this is a big play this opens up a lot of possibilities let's go although I don't think it's like League where you start spawning super minions when you destroy something like that but look at that's just squatting up dude dude what up buddy look at my damage right now oh my I'm gonna kill guys wait what you guys really didn't kill him you guys just left me here wait what I did how did this we were like we were like together okay we could have like one that but it's my bad he was so weak too but I whatever team okay so we got Soul Reaver which I didn't read what it does but I'm sure it's great to have up next it says to buy obsidian shard I'm a simple man I listen to the bill there's this weird part in smite where I just don't know what to do like once you're but once you exit laning phase with the league up I feel like I'm a lot better and knowing what to do where to go how to spend my time but in this it's just like I don't know run aimlessly help my teammate if I can someone killed the Pyromancer was that us I didn't realize we were doing that all my old hatch juicy hole oh this is gonna be even juicier yes and I leveled up easy peasy all right I'll just burn you guys up here cooking me up a couple of minions how do you like them medium medium-well I'm gonna get this region and then I'm gonna oh no I'm not yeah that's right get zoned idiot you're still gonna try and grab this aren't you I know you you're greedy you're greedy you're a greedy little girl that's right uh-huh i'ma do i'ma do all the damage try and oat me oh I just annihilated you i read you like a book bro that is embarrassing oh my god it's probably the best Playmate of the game ha ha Nuwas come in but a bing bada boom just get out of the way ok oh I can get my I can get my old oh wait a second I think there's someone flanking me I can't really tell ya oh yeah I'm definitely okay I'm out I'm oh we're attacking the fire giant oh that's exciting I'm helping why you're so tanky I'm gonna do a fire cuz this is some real good damage especially if they're stationary you know I never wanted to use fire Benny but I'll make an exception let's go we killed the fire giant what are all allies grant gold damage region okay apparently across the board we're just like where Omega right now and I can fully upgrade to have a full build but I guess I'll wait on that okay I'm gonna go to ice because at least I have range and slows oh you like that oh oh yeah he jumps out he's out okay okay yeah no I don't really like that thanks for asking oh I barely missed it I think it was just out of range for our first ability oh oh oh team G to do okay yep that was quick I do feel a little out of my element because it in any mobile I played I never really play mages spellcasters heavy spell casters that is I'm always better on people who are a little tanker because I get myself into some sticky situations often I'm now I'm not letting you die oh my god okay maybe I will oh my it's quick his jumps bro like there's no way I kill this guy go fire him never mind he sat right in those flamethrowers who roasty-toasty oh now we're going in I love what I'm seeing oh my god I hate what I'm seeing get away from me I'm gonna slay him or slow him rather now my teammates come to help beautiful beautiful beautiful appreciate this guys you're all doing great let's go some residual damage but I'm not too worried about it and they surrendered okay so not my best game but I think in the day we won I think we went positive again Rowan's definitely a little harder to grasp in my opinion because of how much he's got going on and the stain switches and all that kind of stuff so it's definitely a little more advanced I did my best that was aang obviously we still have Zuko and Korra to cover we've already done Susanoo and scauldy or scotty whatever name is before but i've said without the skins that was our first maryland game you know I may not be the best but I'm having fun hopefully that's enough for you guys to enjoy the video with that said only think Oh much for watching how doesn't attest I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] [Music]
