hi ad hope you won my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to chichi over easy episode 34 in today's episode we had a rough outline and as always we never follow the outline no not really we start out by discussing Moop well actually yeah movies and yeah a lot of movies takes on some of like the DC Universe moves that have been coming out recently we talked a lot about Zack Snyder's filmography and whatnot then we go ahead and talk about cheating in videogames there's been some rampant cheaters and some various games how do we feel about that what motivates cheaters and so much more and then we move on to some overwatch drama and some patron questions and obviously aside from some tangents here and there that's about this episode you'll like it most people seem to agree that they like the intro and if people don't they can just skip it so it makes sense it seems to be more useful than anything so essentially what you need to know is you shouldn't skip anything you shouldn't even need an intro you should just blindly follow us and listen to everything thanks we say yeah GG / hello this is me saying yeah come on in welcome back to GG overeasy I'm gonna start this episode with hidey-ho so I'm not doubling up on the hidey-ho instead it's a single Highness I don't know I think I keep saying like I think I don't and then I do I don't really know but I know for sure I'd only gonna say it once I might even forget so maybe there won't even be CID hose and if that's the case the world just gonna explode it's the wrong time line but this is the brightest timeline because GG overeasy is back for number 34 I'm pretty sure one of the best and then the SPN twos next and pspme Oh Jo History Channel are we at 35 gee that's pretty nuts when is like a year how many weeks are there in the year but we've missed some don't ask me yeah we missed a couple but 52 I think I said 54 well no I I it's somewhere a middle or late August I think because we did fruit summit early August and then we started uploading them after that so I think somewhere in August we'll mark a year of at least when it started and yeah we missed like we've only met somewhat like three three weekends I think three I think three weekends I'd say that's not bad especially considering with with our track record yeah and the exactly the circumstances given the nature of our reality you up like already like what nine videos a day now you're on yeah we're you know what we're we're in nine and a half star podcast so I upload nine and a half videos a day you know I got to keep up with the stars you know it's crazy he had the second channel because I get less than half the views oh yeah we can talk about that soon we have a couple topics here today the thing to though about this this life we're all currently living is things are slow not much is happening the the most exciting thing out of the box I guess that happened I went to my mailbox today Wow outside is cool I forget what it looks like out there I was it is the sky like red on fire every I don't like it I watched a new movie last night and that's probably bad did you watch sucker punch I've never watched that what is sucker Paul remember that I remember the hype behind that movie and then like it came out and people were like just really had a poop on my Cheerios dude like yeah I I'd never seen it I'd only heard a little bit about it and I'm pretty sure what I remembered was it it was lackluster so I'll give it a shot why not and it was I didn't know much about it certainly wasn't what I expected and I came out going and so no it's I don't I'm gonna have to let me find it a synopsis because I don't know how to explain it I watched a movie last night - oh wow what movie a silent voice Oh would you think that's a good one I liked it I liked it I didn't absolutely adore it but I liked it it was a good movie well take I like the message it's a good good like feel-good very emotional to add yeah it was like I'm happy I'm sad I'm indifference guy I love this guy I don't know what to do anymore but for those interested locked away a young woman named babydoll retreats to a fantasy world where she is free to go wherever her mind takes her determined to fight for her real freedom she finds for women rocket blondie amber and sweet pea to join together to escape the terrible fate that awaits them with a virtual Arsenal at their disposal the Allies between everything from samurais to serpents while trying to decide what price they will play for survival it was bizarre yeah and oh that looks like trash and the thing is and the thing is I only vaguely remember like parts of a trailer I saw so I thought this fantasy thing I thought that was the world realize this was her imagination so I went into it like what's going on and it's yeah and so it turns out she's like at a mental institution or something but it's not really a mental institution it's like it's like a brothel or something kind of low-key and she's like a in a slavers I don't know it's strange it's all over the place I will say as always that was X night er listen avatar you're free and stuff it did have some pretty cool moments but I feel like that's really all the movie had going for it yeah isn't he behind uh Batman versus Superman but he's also behind 300 and that's the important thing it's not like he has I mean he's pissed Barger it's pretty spotty out here but I feel like when he hits he hits and when he doesn't he doesn't yeah I remember so many people were excited for his locker punch and then he came out and they're just like wow this is no it was a I think was a novel before a manga he hit his manga it was a manga I think so I want to say there was it was like a knob I don't know I can't watch a bad movie I can't like I thought it was cool I thought that watch a bad movie I didn't think the movie was cool but I thought the actual concept behind the movie was tight and then the I remember seeing the trailer and I was like man it really looks kind of sick and then I don't think I ever went to go I know I ended up watching it like later like what it was like on on some network and I was just like wow this is I remember being I remember this having a lot of hype and man that way it's really bad Zach I thought you thought you had something gun your hands okay well here is well I was interested so I was like alright well let me see his filmography okay so his his directorial debut appears to be Dawn of the Dead 2004 I don't oh never mind apparently it's his first film based on an original concept Cuesta and whatever the whatever that means oh the sucker punch was the game and then 2007 was 300 which i think is sick don't movie 2009 was watchman famously the it needs more blue penis movie never seen Watchmen underrated movie in my opinion it's my freeway I don't want to see that there's red though the color is you know my super mentor I remember when I came out I was like that's that's black and white what is this plays an important part in the film trust don't we all remember Wizard of Oz when color became a thing like it why stay like that ridiculous you know what I was a kid I actually believed like we didn't have color until nineteen sixties or something and I was like and I was like I was like I remember asking my dad I was like do you do your parents like I was like like not living with any color and he's like I've raised oh my god my son he's like I'm genetically like related to this like someone did it somewhere like from that it just yeah it actually looks hit yes is color yeah oh my god big news it's just color has been it's like the movie Pleasantville with a the dude that played yeah yeah the dude that played Tobey Maguire yeah have you not seen that movie I think that's what it's called it's kind of something like that where it's black and white and then I imagine is cut like color just like there was like whoa I fail you blow people's minds the 1910s they had like SEPA they're like from that going to like what's that what's that one called that the the filter were it's like not black and white but it's like a brown yes Chevy like sepia is how you say it Mike Sowa 1910 that there's nothing in fact their vision to like crack with a little bit with like little like white spot like and then like the old film sound that's how they saw I will crack well these are just all movies he's directed a legend of the guardians the owls of ga'hoole oh dude I'm not kidding you that has one of the best trailers for a movie all-time just because it has thirty Seconds to Mars that's all I stand yet do you guys see Jared Leto was like like well I just came back from a two month retreat in the desert with no phone and he's like wow this virus is crazy like it's like your Leno of course you go on like a two-month hiatus and like the desert and come back and it's like whoa the world's most celebrity response I've ever heard wasn't me but as bad as the imagine stuff wasn't he seen on the beach recently or something and he's like starting his own cult or something like that or like it's not like saw a headline I didn't read the article that I saw a headline that he has like his own coal or so yes he was coal Rob yes Seward's degenerates we're like I saw this headline I didn't bother to read it and I'm just gonna regurgitate the title or the problem like Jericho has a cult yeah dude I think so yeah it was enough for me to go huh but not enough to me to go like I don't want to know more let me go another click especially with all the new site snaps like let me go a click and then it's like you must subscribe you must do this please support it and it's like I wanna do this you would do the shift-tab thing we're like you make a new tab or something like of course I don't want to leave my spot on Twitter you know I'm saying how many tabs you have open right now actually only like three because tragically my chrome crashed and it didn't reset my tabs so so you're the type of dude who just has like a ton of tabs oh absolutely so you're chaotic I use those as my reminders like those to me like each tab it'll be like a video game then I need to a video on but I forgot so it's like the steam page pulled out and over here is like some movie I googled because I want to watch that and I need to remember that and then over here it's just all tabs to remind me or something I don't even want to think about your phone call my tabs on that or even worries oh my god it's chaotic his and then 2011 was sucker punch 2013 was Man of Steel 2014 did you guys like do you guys like to hit my Superman or like Henry Cavill no DC movies in general like I just like I mean majority of them centered lately yeah they've been a lot better lately but I mean they started off like Marvel was like this they made such a weird point to be like the inverse of Marvel because Marvel was like action but serious but with luma comedy but whereas DC was like we're super sure that we live in the Shubert bleak and Man of Steel has to kick some ass the worst but a crazy thing is DC managed to become the uncool comic-book people like how do you mess that up yeah before it was like Marvel what do you have like Ant Man Captain America yeah Iron Man Iron Man you said yeah no one used to like Iron Man and now he's like the only one fighting in the Hulk the only one I liked was Hulk and Marvel everybody else was DC today I mean think about what you got over DC got bangers bro and how do you mess that up yeah I think that way Marvel was considered like the silly ish comic for a lot of people like for like hardcore readers but then DC was like super dark and like grim and like really adult themes and then just the iconic superheroes are in the positive into a meme I didn't watch the I didn't read the comics but I watched just the cartoons and the DC cartoons are always better than the Marvel oh yeah for sure I think DC I think he's always had it locked down on the animation Department for sure watch the main hunter is one of the dopest superheroes ever a hundred percent I love the Martian man the Martian Manhunter he's so Teen Titans Oh or the best animated series of all time shows not the reboot right no not the rebuilding like those original I mean it's not bad I heard it's very it I mean it's funny like I it's not like it's bad it's just like it's not the original team animated Teen Titans series which is super super special i am i have seen clips on earth where they're like where this New Teen Titans though they're like they're very self-aware though and that's funny or like like they back the fourth wall yeah that or like they've straight up like brought Teen Titans like the characters and their designs like back from the previous one they're like wait what the heck and so I can appreciate that like they kind of like poke fun of themselves it's not a bad show it's just but they're also where the people don't like them the show like the actual Teen Titan character like in the new one or aware that people don't like them because of the previous show so no one wants to watch us yeah you're right but personally I love the Man of Steel I think that was a dope movie one time and I wasn't that impressed I loved it I loved the tick you did on it and that's when I was like okay DC's on the rise and then they managed to pretty much just ruin everything yeah that was like probably one of the least dark movies of of the DC Universe yeah it was after Man of Steel in the DC Universe I think they went right into Superman didn't day it was something stupid there and then they went straight a Justice League Marvel takes like eight years before their first infinity war DC's like we make like one movie let's just start just throw them and Justice League let's just do that if they jump didn't wait too fast like it was and there was like no I I didn't have any connection to any of these characters and justice that was fuego dude the only reason to watch that is Blake Lively and and Ryan Reynolds and that's about it what is the movie Wonder Woman I feel well I assume probably critically it would probably be Wonder Woman you know I heard she's an was really good I haven't seen wasn't really good it was a lot of fun it's actually really sad because she's a it was really good but like people from DC forgot about it despite being one of the best Easi films because it was like it was fairly like silly film well I mean kind of sad man it was nice though a nice turn that it was like lighter yeah I think they can strike a balance between Shazam and then like Man of Steel because I think Man of Steel was still pretty like gritty so that's when it's like someone's like yeah comparatively Man of Steel was rather light which is true because somehow they went even darker and grittier like unnecessarily they won't like mean Batman yeah like parodies you see yeah yeah MMN it's just like IQ people oh god I feel like these white it can't be done well like the gritty kind of things but they just like they don't nail the writing so you don't take any of it yeah if you go dark the writing has to be perfect yeah or like the atmosphere in it you just you don't feel it like ever when your whole movie is super serious and then the one defining moment is artha what what'd you say like really bro wait a second wait oh my god nice little light flat like a class yeah I broke they all come on Superman is my biggest problem with that this is my biggest problem with any movie with movies in general today I don't know what it is with studios and making a trailer that just has oh really big like purpose here like that just like breaks every like why would you show that in the trailer like why is why I hate them well then I hate when I'm in the movie and then like oh oh there's a Superman that was like yeah what and then like I hate when I'm at the movie and something in the movie happens and it's like a funny moment and I've seen it in the trailer and people in the theater still last it's like 20 times you've seen that like why are we laughing at that we have seen that before I hate with no but ya know rob is really mad when he gets close to his what he's like he's got to be like listen no I understand a Batman vs. Superman suit like they should have stopped after the first trailer it was great it set the scene Batman vs Superman and then you're like okay and oh hey by the way doomsday well yeah we were throwing up - doomsday Wonder Woman by the way we're just gonna go ahead and spoil a it's not even really Batman V Superman because you seem working together it's like what what what's the point like bra I and that's when I pretty much would early like that moment was when I pretty much said like I'm not watching trailers interwork yeah and it didn't help when I saw that movie I was literally in the second road sucks it's the worst I would I would if those are the only seats available I wouldn't go to a movie even if it was like the option have you never sat in the front oh I've had to and that's why I know how terrible it is and it's usually like with my family because if it was just me and I walked in and those are the only seats I'd walk out okay I wouldn't even I don't care if I get my money back I'm not doing that like that's not how I'm gonna experience that movie for the first time his neck grant like because it has to be a popular movie because like I well oh I also think was my Christmas Day because we always go to like movies or something and we didn't get tickets ahead of time or something and so we showed up and I do think one of them was like a fast and furious it was there's so much but all I saw was the bottom half of the movie so I don't know like literally is oh dude I'm telling you one of my like favorite parts of the movie got my favorite and like least a part depending on the thing when you walk into the theater and like say this is the wall and you make that turn like when you make that turn and you see like a lot of people you like [ __ ] no I like this but nowadays I go to theaters with reserved seating nowadays I don't go to the theaters because I can't what's the last movie you guys saw in theaters like now that I'm like thinking about it it was actually a DC movie what it was Harley Quinn oh oh you saw them right what do you think I started even seen it why really is ever I haven't seen it it was I've heard makes things I've heard it's good and I heard it's terrible I heard if you're like one of the people who on ironically like are really into the DC Universe as it is then you probably wouldn't have liked it because it was one of those it's a very like girl power wise hearted I mean they had creating moments but it was like a very it was it was like um in the same it's like kind of like a dumb action flick but that's what made it so fun like it was kind of it was really cheesy and but but it didn't feel like a DC movie like you didn't feel like it fit in that universe kinda or I would I mean the general art direction definitely felt like a DC movie but it was also it's a Harley Quinn movie so of course it's gonna be super colorful and out there I thought it was a dope movie I definitely though I I know I know the mixed reaction yeah box office wouldn't agree uh it did we did as good as anything else does in the box office well the problems with other DC movies it certainly did better than Batman or Superman well they had it estimated do better but like I think one of the first problems and they realized it and they changed it at some point was like birds of prey I was like the fudge is that and so eventually they would early just change it to like Harley Quinn something like that should have been that from the start because people like birds operate what I don't even know you you just got a it's like doing a clickbait title you gotta just realize hey alright this might be like artistically what I want but no one's gonna understand Harley Quinn and then oh okay yeah the marketing for the movie was super weird I think that's part of the reason why it didn't help the movie because I didn't see any marketing of it like on TV it was all like internet marketing which is not bad but like I was very surprised at how little marketing I saw for it but um I thought it was really really good movie I thought it was definitely one of the I wanted I wanted to say better but because it was a good movie it immediately makes it one of the best Easi movie the last movie I saw in theaters was the my hero movie that's a good one name is omen yeah what about you what's your last movie it was literally like right before the cutoff essentially onward oh yes like when it came out like we um we saw that I liked it and then pretty much like the next day is when I woke up and was looking at everything that's when I decided to self-quarantine and a so you guys had to guess what the most like the the highest domestic box office movie for 2020 what would you say it was like right now sometime the movies that came out this year was when I'm able to look at a list ah oh oh I think I know Sonic no yes I'm really not son there's one there's one ahead of song well - technically technically what does that mean yes it can't be that much inflation well cuz one came out on the 25th of December oh wait they count them yeah well I maybe I guess I guess there's anything after the Oscars I think they kind of just can for the most part Sonic is third Sonic came in third I never saw this international or domestic this is domestic this is okay - a mess - I remember what released on Christmas Oh Raisa Skywalker know what that's fit that's damn that's v I okay I don't know that gross 515 million but like great also the movie sucked some people who want to go see it so much okay yeah I don't know that movies oh oh you know I think I know up to you but one of them what and it was one that I was kind of wanted to go see just because it was his first role since another iconic role that changed pop culture forever it was that uh but I didn't go see it because I heard it was awful is that Doolittle movie with Robert Downey jr. no I think that flopped that's so that's better than I thought it would though that gross 77 million yeah I think the Rotten Tomatoes on that is like 13% or something I thought that popped off purely because it was Robert Downey jr. Yeah right birds of prey is six at 84 million not bad yet dr. Doolittle Rotten Tomatoes 15% bad man I can't do bad movies man like I won't I didn't didn't the on word came out right on word came out Marta six yeah and those times like a week yeah 61 million on words at 11 on word would easily be number one this point if like theaters were still a thing oh yeah no no give it give me a big hint all right [ __ ] just got real I don't know that's a great that's a great hit for anybody who stands this franchise like I stand it uh uh I could give I could say whose oh my god is it is it fast and furious know when the back to last come in hello [ __ ] just got real no come on me okay give me an actor bad boys hey wait that's the number-10 scene bad boys the life I thought that movie come last year nope January 17th 204 million dollars I was like why are you well that's number one I was like I know this reference but definitely I came up I doesn't movie came out way I did nothing that's like a first bat or the second bad I thought you just said Star Wars gross like five hundred well that's like total gross but I guess like what like cuz little I think that's in 2020 it's like international no there's no way Raisa Skywalker no one made five hundred million world one father even if it was a bad movie really yeah yeah it did not do good somebody's gotta be hired what Sonic 146 million really 204 million I want to look at our look of worldwide numbers okay I would not have gotten that well I didn't think I did yes a worldwide bad boys is number one 419 million Sonic is xe2 worldwide 306 damn bad boys popped off was domestic so Doolittle was number three with 223 so I'm Robert Robert Downey jr. in there we'll try it might not might not amazing in the States but apparently he popped off internationally for his praise for 201 million that's why I think that's where I remember birds are prey not like doing that bad because and the US was amazing but internationally it did pretty good whoa what at this movie would have bombed because of Corona I mean legmen Robin you know 25 I've watched that on Amazon that movie was badass I watched that well I wonder cuz I watch that online as well I I wonder if that counts digital at all yet I don't know I'm sure it does it hash to because it was it was out like as long as M word was I think mm-hmm it was it was only out for like yeah because I was gonna try and I see great things yeah yeah this damn 28th a week before I mean clearly people went showed up because it internationally it did better than onward onwards number eight visual means five man that's pretty uh I was pretty good I was actually worried about that phone because it looked super tight I still haven't seen it yet by the way his but it looks super tight and I just remember it releasing like in the worst time possible and I was like damn I feel I'm kind of uh she she's an act what's her name oh she's a dope actress Elizabeth Olsen is from madmen and handmade sale yeah that's wonderful to be good cuz I remember her

34 talking about movies watch this segue we're gonna miss them cheating in videogames that's the segue there wasn't I actually want to lead with something that happen in destiny I know it doesn t omegle because I stand destiny and if it's not good news about destiny I don't want to hear it we could never heard you say and it was all meme to my hands we could talk about oh I'm sure blue screen and I d'etre has the potential leaks for the fall expansion I feel like those are really out there well I'm setting out there because it's a 4chan league that and it's just expectation it actually gives me hope which is why I can't believe it I think it was a I think I think those are I guess again but it really feels like who really feels like a fanservice League I don't know if I can it's it sounds like a lot of stuff we've wanted which is why I might no that can't be wait this is a game from 4chan yeah dude they may be real good it's gotta be real they helped find was it in this last Boston but marathon dude I don't know I don't know it seemed a little out there for people who aren't aware of the lake it was like a whole it was a very fanservice leak like field or like pyramid I hate where we probably did not invent the Olympics we can't get Rocky hey you'd be surprised we ended that you'd be surprised with the trademarks and stuff and intellectual property we can we can fit our way here so till there is like oh we get like dark disabilities we basically like actual like Stora characters in our story where they're like oh people team up to defeat the darkness guardians from their past like an tabret and other people from actually group up finally and a bunch of other stuff like and they were like oh yeah we get like three new strikes and I mean it'll equals fake because that's what I knew when they gotten no the darkness summit class sounds called I don't know if they uh it was called collapse quote-unquote which is Terra if you don't believe it but the Persie remit chips are shown up yeah finally after three years or whatever it's so funny because yeah destiny - yeah actually I was talking about this on my stream the other day destiny - has been out almost as long as destiny one was out this is cuz we're on has not raised as well shadow keep would have been yeah shadow keep was equivalent of rise of iron light yeah well at least now we had D 2 news now instead we're at like the saddest state with nothing on the horizon we don't know we know there's a fall expansion but we have no idea but I guess we'll find out because they really talk about how excited they were for this upcoming season next one and how like special is gonna be but I'm expecting like the age of triumph type ish thing or an icon like all the old raids get like I've learned though because it'll be like an age of triumph same here do all this stuff to get this gear that will be a completely irrelevant again even though we're never gonna learn as soon as this next thing comes out we want you to spend hundreds of hours doing things you've already gotten to get this special cool looking armor which is completely irrelevant as soon as in that we've learned now there's what we call them attics which still don't fan yourself fan yourself and yourself you're getting hot you're getting up by the evening sorry just a desk understand it's a sec awake from density into into GD in video games actually want to talk about this I actually didn't even think about this until like fruit was like so cheating in videogames and I'm like oh destiny yeah I see a segue do you I knew it work someone recently did an interview with destiny to hacker because you guys know that there's like huge amounts of people hacking in d2 right now and peely interview two six-year-old no they certainly interviewed somewhat resembling a six-year-old they interviewed a mentality must be says dude so this dude played charles match and the guy he was playing against clearly was hacking he had like wall hacks and an aimbot and he interviews the dude and it's so interesting why he chose to hack he chose to hack because his account got banned for communication so he was super toxic apparently in the actual like text coms I'm assuming uh even I'm talking that I've never been been I mean there's toxic and Bungie don't ban people that's crazy but I mean there's Rob toxic and then there's like probably like racist and [ __ ] right so obviously gonna be paying for that dude basically said I'm I'm hacking because my D 1 beta character got banned from D 2 and now I just wanna hack the game and ruin other people's fun because not because I didn't get enjoyment from ruining other people's fun but because I want the game to fail but then he's like but I also really loved that's why he's like but I also love destiny a lot but like also I want the game to fail because Bungie failed that's so petty oops it's so petty but what do you think about it how many people probably really want destiny to fail to like kick Bungie into high gear for some reason or another I mean if that's what it takes David don't I mean I don't want the game to fail I just want no I just want them to fail I just wanted well we don't know what they're doing but I think the where they're coming from is they want it to get to a point where it's do-or-die and so Bungie realizes like oh okay yeah this isn't worth like we've gotta actually like blue said look kick it into gear we need to do something essentially in their eyes fix the game whatever that would be for that person but like that they want them to hit rock bottom so it's like this is it and then they nail it that's the idea yeah yeah it's not like anybody continues to figure yeah so the interview goes on about how easy it is to get these hacks like the dude was like yeah I pay like twenty a month and I get wallhacks and he's like and he's like and then he talks about how there's like very high-end ones they're like a hundred a month and those are the ones that give you like a rapid-fire like you see the four lands class started you see what your rockets fly at you he said those are more expensive and he says a lot of people do them for Rico's and he also this was probably the most interesting response he said someone at Bungie actually has caused law this because someone at Bungie basically told someone who was a cheater who ended up cheating for one reason another that they had messed up and told them like a bunch of like sensitive info about how I get packed what they look for when you're cheating so now a lot of cheaters know like okay I need to avoid this yeah I need to avoid this way don't wanna get banned but if I'm gonna cheat I need to be mindful of these things so now cheaters are becoming like even more robust and destiny cuz they're learning apparently they directly know from someone on the Bungie team what Bungie looks for in cheaters I was so it's what do you mean what do you look you look for if their wall hacking or I don't understand like what the I think another thing he talked about is how they don't actually they do have an auntie Qi but it's very archaic but that they mostly actually look at people's stats to determine if they're gonna ban them or not so it's like kind of like a slap on the wrist like Marty sets us hmm I knew immediately when they switch from battlenet to steam I knew immediately as soon whenever they were gonna not launch trials whenever that was gonna happen that cheating and all this [ __ ] was gonna be the biggest problem it is and then people are like surprised that it is like if you didn't know that this was gonna happen you're lying to yourself it's bad though it's worse and I founded me it's like rampant really cheating cheating in trials is so bad you see so many clips like every single weekend with trials like the five people that play trials on a weekend and as I say you know it's really depressing III didn't come across many hackers when I was doing Charles but it's kind of crazy how bad the morality game is right now because I think it's less about who you come across that's actually hacking and more about the game isn't such a bad state that you don't know who's hacking or not so know everyone is super paranoid because it's to the point where man is this person hacker like I just don't know like they they honestly could be so every single person is is at a point where hacking is just so common that people genuinely just don't really know who's hacking and who's not and it kind of sucks because especially in trials are supposed to be super competitive it's like your end game for PvP your what your whole season this like thing is about like your end game PvP is just a huge question mark for good players who like man did I lose because I mean obviously like someone fires bunch of rocket launchers but sometimes it's like man the student knows where I am all the time like is he cheating are you just a god and it's like match after match after match you don't know so it's just the morals no this is only like a PC problem right like it's not this on console right this is absolutely PC problem on console apparently ddossing is still a big issue oh yeah well I mean I can't even tell what's ddossing and what's just Bungie errors you so often get kicked anyway it's hard to know did I just get DDoS or is it beaver you know with trial or trust at one time it was scary my whole internet went away and I was just like I'm sorry no one like internet goes away dude I'd like literate scary you feel like my whole world goes in black and white because I'm in that you've lost a while or you before the color was invented like I feel like I'm back there man I hate it it's like literally like the saddest thing ever or if I had slow internet how do I get my grandparents place I'm like what's the Wi-Fi password you're like what little wood and then I'm like well let me call my dad and ask and it's like one of those like a telephone that's the joke for all ugh that was an old-time telephone I don't think you see any of those anymore No but you're not gonna see me playing trials anytime soon the when we went flawless I was shocked I was shocked we didn't run into a cheater once now that we know that we know him if they were they were trash they need a they need to get some new ones cuz whatever they're paying in we're but the thing I've noticed is I mean I haven't tuned in recently but I mean even like couple weeks ago I would tune in occasionally to some people streaming trials and not kidding like every other game they were hitting cheaters is insane and I was just like bruh and like blue says it's also just like the culture around it right now is because all the viewers are like oh my god this is trials so then no one's gonna even bother hopping in which I don't blame them cuz it's like be like this person be like this guy's hitting every shot and you look up a stat he is 99% headshot accuracy with the remote yeah with like a thousand kills and some people try to be like no he's just good like no that's not how that works you don't hit 999 headshots out of a thousand that's impossible but just seeing stuff like that time I thought oh my god dude like and that's the annoying thing too is like cuz if he didn't look those stats up for instance if we didn't have any way that's not as egregious as like a full auto sniper rifle with infinite ammo or constant Rockets full auto and that's more like the the respawning like I see those like they die in trials and then they just responded saying like over and over and over and over and over and over like those like blatant those are like like specifically like hey I'm cheating so I eat [ __ ] but but in the interview he was just saying like most people don't do that like most cheaters or Loki and he had said he's known to people who have been cheating since the game came out so it's like why do you play the game I don't get it like why like why I want to interview one and it's probably like why like was why well he was response was how does invite my spy it was out of spite he did it cuz he got in a bottleneck node cuz you're trash that's literally what I would say you're literally trying there's actually funny cuz the dude was like yeah it's actually like a really good player and then the dude was like oh it was your KD and the dude was like oh I like 1.2 1.3 it was cracked I was insane dude that's like because there's also recently like one of the other big cheater once it's like war zone there's been a yeah a good amount of like cheaters and hackers in there and again like I just don't understand it they must their their prerogative must be like I just want to make sure other people don't have fun because I don't see what's fun about just running around holding left click and just killing everything I mean maybe fro one game that was but like I don't know if you're not playing a game anymore there's nothing to play there's no risk there's nothing and all you're doing that's just yeah it must be bad well it's funny you say like you do it for one game because in modern warfare 2 when I got in a 10th prestige Lobby when you get in a 1040 Lobby you have all these kind of like hacks you can like see where everybody is it was called like vampire you could see like where everybody was like through a like a red box to be a red box today Oh somebody's behind that wall and when you got a kill you'd get your 10th prestige you'd everything unlocked but then you'd be quote-unquote infected with like a with like all those hacks until you turned off your Xbox so I went to one one team deathmatch game on that one crash map or it's like the plane is like crash and it's like all those hills and stuff oh yeah so I had like I had quote-unquote hacked for a game but then like I went like 30 and 2 and I was like this is stupid so I literally turned off my xbox and turned it back on and then all the hacks really FBI yes this man right here yep I did I have to go or something in modern warfare 2 wow dude your you haven't changed yeah I'm I've changed man you know I do not aspire award you know cuz I really want the game to fail I mean here's here's my argument to cheat I don't care if you use cheats if it's like a single-player game or something as long as it doesn't impact somebody like which is why yeah which is why cheats and multiplayer I'm against like I would argue cheese I'm super jumping in halo 2 is that not a cheat no super jumping at that point especially if they didn't do anything and Bungie didn't outright be like hey this is not okay then it's an in-game mechanic and even if it wasn't designed like that like that's just how it works I mean a lot of games have been based around like for instance halo 2 was bxb that was literally designed around a thing they didn't want me with you yeah a glitch so it's something like that like I would argue - in PvE like in destiny if you use some exploits it's on Bungie to fix that PvE I guess I would argue that maybe the person you're playing with just wants to play that contents let's say you get matched with somebody doing that you're like bro I just want to play then it could be an issue but for the most part like whatever that's on Bungie as long as it's not like an add-on you've got or something but like that's why like I hate third-person peeking but at the end of the day it's in the game and those aren't cheaters they're just degenerates yeah it's awesome like but but then again garbage yeah but then again like like like I'm not a fan of and stuff but that's just like halo 2 right like somebody be like I can't believe he px B's like yeah a double shattered like it's also just like the culture around it but I mean I still think third-person emote peeking is dumb just because it's a first-person shooter and you're well I'm not I don't think that'll ever happen well if you disable email some people just can use swords yeah and then if they disabled emotes that's a lot of their ever verse that they don't like hey you can get this email but you using PvP some people are saying I think I think the best suggestion was to lock yourself into an emo when you use it so when you like ya finish the entire animation before you can even let's like what overwatch does yeah and why not I have like a PvP emote like instead like you just stay in your little first or like you inspect your gun or something like something that's like different you know or something cooler and then you have your PvE emotes that are like the ones that put you into third person or something like that no I mean that sounds that's like a lot of resources for ya budget would never system that's already yeah I think we need to lock you into your emo as soon as you mean like when you start it yeah at least it at least just in PvP like like everybody was like like bagging on people who time travel an animal crossing I don't care if anyone does that I mean I don't care but you're wrong but like but see like some people be like you should like why do you shouldn't even be able to play the game and stuff and to that point again it doesn't impact anyone else like it doesn't a pet but you're wrong if that's how they want to play I don't see any problem with yeah they're not they're not playing it I mean they can play however they want but they're doing it wrong that's all I'm safe yeah well I mean but also for some people like playing at the pace Animal Crossing would like you to normally play though is like the beauty but that but you got some Quine does or people who just like especially the first couple days I mean we talked about this but like yes I can't do anything because I have to wait for this store to show up in two days or I have to baba wawa and I think that's part of it sure going a week is alright but yeah like so much to do like at one point like I couldn't imagine but cheating and hacking I just don't see the appeal of multiplayer single player games same thing sometimes it's cool just like do something you shouldn't be able to or like will give us like using like action replay in Pokemon like I shouldn't be able to find this Pokemon but whoa or like I shouldn't be able to get this item below I caught this very close on route 22 yeah it's like messing around and I think it's fun like I remember I had an action replay that when I did that and it like ruined it as like okay I have to turn this off like me to my guy but having a shiny Dragonite and everything but clearly there's like some sort of mentality that drives someone to do that and consistently and I just can't think of any reason they would do it aside from like wanting to just grief people especially in destiny like that's my thing you could she in so many other games like bloodline destiny makes more sense to me than like warzone because at least you're like you like for trials it's to get loot like you couldn't normally otherwise get this you can get pinnacle rewards or something but war zone it's like to win a match but that doesn't get you anything and you didn't really win like I don't I don't see where the sense of satisfaction comes from I like even if you get the win you're like yeah okay I just feel like it wouldn't feel the same I don't know but clearly I'm wrong cuz there are a lot of people that like to do it I want to interview that hacker cuz that guy let him off too easy when he said that beg [ __ ] dude suck look that's why like because you want to get back at Bungie if you wanted to really get back at Bungie you wouldn't play the game anymore like what do you mean well I'm the the problem - why it's so easy to cheat - is because it when it went free-to-play yeah so now you just did another account hop back and do it again so but I mean you have your gear though right like you can't just I mean not like not really for like PvP or something yeah I mean you're gonna cheat that's how I be do be how it'd be dope and you know what else how do it Beto oh this ad Oh welcome back ladies gentlemen to the greatest podcast this side of the Mississippi I don't know which side that is and hard to say well but I mean like technically it could be to the right of the Mississippi if you keep wrapping around right that's easy that's ones but like is there a north and a south technically in Mississippi because I mean like there's a starting and a somewhere I think yes yes there is a south of the Mississippi and there is the north of the Mississippi technically so we're technically I'm a West but if you go far enough east we're on that side you know it's like if you take enough left you're gonna make a right we're always on the west side of the Mississippi not not at one point we ever east of the Mississippi the Mississippi doesn't move okay no no okay okay look look okay unless the earth is not flat right mm-hmm I'll set you okay it's a sphere okay so do you believe is not real we're talking about the earth being flat blue if it's true not that what the earth is flat but that's very thoughtful yeah okay so if you go east which is right okay yes from the Mississippi sometimes East is right east isn't always right right Court because if you're facing West East can sometimes be left right well I'm saying like if you're looking at neutral like you would just like okay like a moral compass moral compass my moral compass points east so we're just looking at the earth right from space we're looking at a North America right we see the Mississippi we're gonna go east which would be right so that's gonna wrap around you're gonna hit the ocean then eventually you would hit like Europe Asia and then you start wrapping back around and now get back to us that's why I'm saying if you go far enough east you'll find us just like if you if you turn left enough times you're gonna make a right I'm saying but if you go subway you can say you can go enough north and they use it us yeah that's what I'm saying it's it's like a stupid way to say it but technically we could be but yeah that's just I'm just I'm being a dad right now I don't know what do you want for me the world is flat you know what else is flat what the world the comment section on the overwatch video I don't I don't know if that really worked but the video the over watch video fell flat on many people about it fell flat well more specifically I'm just saying a handful of people but a handful of people who were wanted us to know that they were not happy I commented on it I said I kind of hate this game now those I have the loop we made an overwatch video echo came out so I was like screw it I what are we putting the DMA hey let's just try some overwatch placements I'll play agri and that was it's it was so innocent and yet a little did I know so like robbed a band short caught yeah sure so we go to play and I knew would be pretty rough and it wouldn't even watch that thought it would and I thought that was hilarious like you I thought it was a lot of I thought it was funny like we and knowing we were gonna struggle but then like just to see how bad it was cuz like I was telling Rob I haven't laughed that hard in a long time we're on route 66 whatever that map is we just tried defense and got just steamrolled and we're sitting on offense like waiting ready to get going and I'm like I have bronze with one eelain's what's gold and Robin Abbott the same time go to so we just went on the whole entire thing would early best kills us too so I'm starting to crack up and then ABS trying to like explain something but he can't remember people's names he's out of gravity boner dude and summon sharks freaking out I just lost it and I'm like this is great like maybe the games aren't going great but this is hilarious and then ironically on that offensive push record as well we actually rolled them today but people were so upset because mainly but mainly because Rob was like anyone who still plays this game like eats glue and that's just Rob being robbed I don't truly mean that but like it just makes me feel that the only people who are gonna enjoy this game is a six year old eating glue like that I'm just not having fun like I don't get and like sure you can have fun I just don't get it it's just not half the time I'm shooting at a shield or I'm shooting into somebody absorbing my bullets or I'm shooting in this it's just not I I don't know I just this is not fun like I know and I think eating glue would be more fun than playing this and that's how I express that let's see so so many people were upset because we Rob expressed that opinion which I don't think I put it in the video but I think I even remember when we were playing like I think I would do I said something like I envied anyone who can find enjoyment in this cuz like really I wish I wish it and I'm normally a half glass full kind of guy I can play something and usually find something but man I was struggling it was just a fiesta and I mean the the the argument like for us I think the reason we were so upset too is because it felt like there wasn't a lot of skill expression like what we were talking about like I wish I could just have hitscan and be able to hit targets and if my aim was bad that they would die I mean that's what we've been playing for a while but in this case it's like it doesn't matter what we're doing we're trying to shoot I'm gonna be honest I'm struggling with echo because their entire team is so evasive and her projectiles take like a minute to reach primary fire my bombs it's like I can't hit anything except for a shield and there are plenty of those and so it was just frustrating and I don't know or overwatch has always been for the most part like teamwork communication abilities yeah but it just it just feels different and it just felt like a No Limits game like I've never played overwatch to where if I like in No Limits game and that just felt like cooldowns were unlimited like it was just weird like it just needs to slow down or something I don't know what it and so like I think I'd mentioned in a comment stuff but like obviously our opinions as players have changed our interests have changed but I mean the thing is uh saying that overwatch isn't good is not an unpopular opinion right now in fact I would say it's a more 40 yeah I think you guys got that response because the people who are left playing overwatch are just they stain these and they're probably just sick of having to hear people like this game sucks like people coming back to it after not doing it and then being like damn this still sucks it also doesn't help that well I mean our videos all of our overwatch videos have always been like that it's always been just complaining and memeing and throwing and a lot of talking about how much this game sucks and I don't know man I feel like a lot of people I feel like it's just like the stand mentality where it's like and like I really like they stand my homies I love this channel why are you taking it this is the only game I play it's fine but like at the same time it's not like it's like the video is anything different than we ever did with overwatch and it's not like or other games that suck dude like if a game if the game sucks I'm gonna say sucks like I'm sorry if you don't want to hear that don't watch when the literally when I make a video the purposes is a nerd there's never anything more it ain't deeper than that there's no underlining like I wanted like push my agenda get right over watch like in this case it was literally like I want to make an entertaining video I think it'll be entertaining if we try this and fail and we did I was editing it push some good edits in there I was like this is funny and then just sucks to see some people just they missed the mark and I mean I can understand why they're like man this kind of rubs me the wrong way but for me like that didn't even register like that wasn't what I was looking at all it say this is funny Rob's raging we're struggling I can't hit the broad side of a moisture evaporator we're laughing it's funny but it just didn't I didn't hit with everybody some people I mean for the majority it did and that's why it's tough to do this things because I'm a people pleaser and I hate upsetting anyone so when I do it sucks and like it's like that vocal minority kind of thing situation here but it was just it was just such a bummer I mean it's like cuz that's how that's what I was kind of saying it's like so I can't upload an overwatch video though unless really this is great yeah the best I love overwatch like wow and I feel like if I did that people would be like oh you guys are just flying so you guys could get views and like the overwatch sucks like you don't really mean that like oh my god but it was just that and then I do understand the people that were arguing like well for us a lot of us found you on overwatch and so a lot of us still play or found it because of you and still play because of you and then we see you're doing it again so we get excited to see like something else and then we click on it and show you guys just like bagging on it and only game and which like fair but also like I'm not forcing you to watch the video and I mean there's a reason I haven't been uploading overwatch is because for the most part it was not doing that and bagging on the game yeah which is why like we don't do destiny anymore as often I don't do overwatch as a woman because I would really make a point to not play something just because it's popular good on the channel if I hate it yeah and so when I made that video wasn't like oh I'm gonna cash in on echo views it was literally like I hate overwatch it was like I think this is just gonna be funny us drunk trying and family that was I was like is it for content no that's all was no and there was some comment I just delete it I wasn't gonna have it some dude was like cussing me out and saying like overwatch made you and you're ungrateful and you need to blah blah blah X&Y and I'm like what I just ride to say like it was some like I'm an entitled prick and I owe this game everything and because of this and I'm this blah and he kept going like what which first off blue is probably gonna bring that point up destiny made me overwatch certainly didn't yeah that sees what started my channel overwatch helped give me a lot of subs and stuff for a good period but that's not what made the channel and it wasn't what made me I can't believe that's that video as five million views though yeah well some people point out your son game yeah the four of your top five videos overwatch man like come on I'm like yeah overwatch overwatch was was so hot on YouTube it really was I was and then it wasn't and that's the thing it's like well that's why I stopped uploading too because then just one day it wasn't and the thing too is if we look back like for the most part when we were having the most fun with overwatch is always custom games there's like a six six month period where overwatch was just the hotness and then preferably year is pretty good on YouTube but then eventually it just I think people just it was right around when the new wave of games from the next year came around that overwatch just yeah and I mean it sucked because I enjoyed it and it was always nice to have a staple on the channel like that but another argument someone had which for them made sense but for me it didn't is like okay well you didn't have to play cop you could just go play quick play but for me like I argue with most games yeah for a lot of games there needs to be something at stake for me especially over watch like that's the entire at this point at this point quick play isn't even I feel like you play click play because you enjoy playing the game well I think my main problem with overwatch is that the entirety of the game is based on ranked and and people like it's so weird because you have like pros you know overwatch talking about how oh don't play ranked if you want to improve you play quick play I'm just like wait what what what about listening to they were talking about how they're talking about people and quit player better players than people in ranked I remember this I remember talking I remember hearing this and it wasn't even like an unpopular opinion how someone was like yeah if you want to like learn character and like kind of like learn to improve you should go and quickly not ranked what this is okay well I mean overwatch is a inverse world where I don't understand anything I would maybe argue that to learn a champ or hero I would say go into quick place or you're not with your teammates in ranked and they're dealing with you first timing like dingy like guys what am i abilities do I think the general consensus for my understanding was that ranked is awful and that's not a place where you actually improve or something and I was but I don't I don't know how popular that consensus was but I was just very I was taken aback cuz like you don't hear that in any other game where a pro will tell you don't go in a rank because it sucks going to quit play well that's just cuz they are and the skill based matchmaking is bizarre but yeah like for me it's just like a game I enjoy kind of like what Rob said I'll enjoy like a casual or quick play playlist if I like the game because I'm enjoying the ranked cuz for me like for instance League I stopped playing normals like almost permanently like if I'm getting on I'm getting on to play ranked cuz I like to see yeah true but I like to see every game like is there something on it I can either see myself improving I can see a number climb or fall and I know why TFT for instance as soon as I understand like the new set or a patch normals I go to ranked only ranked yeah only ranked valeria when that comes out probably a almost exclusively playing ranked when I need to take a break maybe play with buds yeah they're like customs I'll go to normals but for the most public when I play a game if I can play ranked that's what I like to play because I like progress and even if it's negative progress I I like having something to play for and so like for me like hopping on cop I was like oh we'll just play placements get place for the fun of it see we get place we couldn't even make it through the placements yeah like for me like that's what it's and so for other people they're like well I just enjoy the catch well that's fine but that's just what it is for me and again it ain't deeper than that I'm not making a video to say hey you can't enjoy this or hate play ranked or hey only play ranked to have fun yeah like I I don't try and put any agendas in my videos hey it ain't that deep opinions are our own I'm not trying to sway you one way or the other if you enjoy the game enjoy the game go play it that's it I just don't yeah but I just don't and that's that should be that can be okay even if like you know I could understand like I don't know watching seananners one day and he just makes a vide and he's like you know what guys prop hunt sucks I'll you understood it I'd be sad but doesn't mean now I hate prop hunt too so like I hate so I can understand that we're like families so I mean it's weird to think that like I have a pull like that but like as a content creator you watch maybe like my content especially over watch and I can understand how it can be defeating to see that but like it ain't that deep and the only reason we're so upset too is because we we love to watch and obviously know what to say overwatch is fun if overwatch is fun at some point like that's I'm not gonna if the game does turn out to be fun and overwatch - I'll say it's fun I'm not just gonna say it's shitty because it's overwatch - yeah like I mean that's pretty much what we're all waiting for anyway it's like overwatch - hoping that they're gonna make some like big sweeping changes at least that's what I'm hoping for otherwise it's just me more of the same I hope I like it I do too but so don't watch video just enjoy for what it is relax I mean I would really put like me Matt it's in there it ain't that deep I understand some of your website love you all that's that should we move on to patreon questions then yeah all right um let me see here um all right this one is from that guy all caps what is your favorite animated movie and why is it Shrek that's funny song I know cuz I do you touch from my spoke dirt he still you used to forget me it has to be my favorite theme the Shrek hut you sure somebody kicked open the door my spot get I love that I'm like a boomer but like yes but that's my favorite animated movie there's so many animated movies like I are we talking like childhood favorite movie or like oh I I'm gonna say Hercules then Hercules let's go back I love Hercules I can watch I will find my way I can go the distance I love that movie I love wider stuff that's my favorite Disney movie so like that's I can't maybe the new spider-man is really close to that I guess in the spider-verse what about your Nia see but that's a baby your name yeah for sure that movie yeah bro you guys gotta stop asking these questions because I can't do these questions I'm so bad it I can't think it came up with mine for me well off for me yeah I thought for you but I can't think for me I don't know man I can't straight up like gives me anxiety yeah I can't I don't know I'll I can't even think of one just throw out there either spider-verse I liked it I don't know if I'd say as my cuz but see that's the top like this here's the thing I could I go like oh I like that but I feel like I probably like one more so then I have to keep thinking and then oh my god it's like what do you want for dinner oh I don't know what do you want for dinner it's like different you're a lot of one ask you're asking someone to to summarize their favorite animated movie bro we we went through our childhoods we saw so many it's like you're trying to make me name like my favorite kid you know it's like oh but like that I I you know come on now I would say of my adult life it's gotta be either spider-verse or either spider-verse or your name one of those two I can't pick between them because but I love them both as if you were to ask me as a kid the answer would probably be spirited away let's go yeah sure ignore me animated web so understanding I think it's not your fault it's yeah then I guess most recently I would say your name and I'll just go there because I'll never be able to pick one so alright so bargain let's go with the Joel Johnson here if you could have any exotic animal as a pet what would it be and what would you name it I would have no exotic animals because they're exotic for a reason and they need a special love and care that I could not provide to them great stuff blue but in this imaginary world let's pretend we could give them everything they ever wanted and they'd be super happy and it would have no long lasting effect on their egos there's some other species you wouldn't get a ping any kind of thing I would feel in a perfect world sure I would get a penguin but well we're talking pretty wrong we're talking perfect world don't like you'll have you'll have a perfect Arctic ecosystem for them you know and they love it and they have a little family and they don't know any better and they let's just say you have a giant pool that's as big as I do go to him you can go to him yeah sure like in a perfect world I would easily pick a ping how about in this world you're his pet so you go to his place in which case we're chillin right yeah okay yeah in a perfect role obviously a bigger penguin penguin with antlers yeah you like

second keep them far away from the Cincinnati Zoo with the overwatch guy oh wait no it stays again listen what music genres artists or songs do you most enjoy I know one of one of fruits is jazz but I generally don't know what artists to look out for in that genre looking for some good music recommendations because I enjoy lots of different kind of music love the content the content I've been really I've been back into my old school III hit my flows like like ask me two months ago I was super back into my pop punk kind of phase and then like a month ago I was into my anime music and like now that I'm back into like MF DOOM like my old school hip-hop kind of like underground hip-hop phase so I'm back in like MF DOOM and like mad live in Quasimodo and A Tribe Called Quest and that kind of [ __ ] so listen to that by you but your this is an impossible question for me I know but like I have been listening to lately I've learned you're kind of all over the place uh we'll go jazz since I mean that's probably be mine anyways when you see jazz do you mean like jazz or do you mean like Frank Sinatra jazz awesome I'll listen to like pure instrumental jazz I listen to like live band jazz like like Miles Davis or like it on Coltrane oh really well that's what I was gonna say like I'd probably it's like a phone you could go like Miles Davis consider you could go Frank and then like some of the big like if you want some like vocalists that are really talented and some of the more well-known ones like Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra those are always good ones um you could go like Dave Brubeck he's got a lot of good hits Bill Clinton and his saxophone both could play a mean sax yeah I mean you don't even really have to I would just say like just don't look up jazz because then you're gonna get like this like like coffee house or like elevator music which is just a disgrace like like if you hear like a lot like that people think that elevator music yes yes but as is but no like it's so much deeper you listen to just what's a jazz the call like it's not called like a band right a jazz is clegg up there's a jazz band yeah but isn't it called like a quartet or something like that isn't like a different kind of word which that would be for people I think when I think of quartet I think of a like the what are they called so whatever singers barbershop quartets yeah yeah what about I go by that yeah Batman ever Davo there is a great one to listen to though is a cover in BioShock Infinite but uh god only knows that barbershop quartet cover oh so good I know all the parts to it god only knows what I'd be without you I couldn't name you jazz like maybe uh it's Frank Sinatra consider jazz yeah he's considered I mean I guess he's considered like vocally but yeah as far like as far as his genre it's like my pop jazz there's a DES covers a good bit I just remember like I was like traditional jazz doesn't even have vocalist yes they'd always just listen to jazz but they had it had no words that's what I never understood like just listening to instruments I can be can be very soothing yeah I'm just a Zoomer percent some riffs or me a good sax man say saxophone just sounds like someone farting sometimes hey maybe that's why I like disrespected you won't well that'll do it for the questions here on the GG overeasy podcast which means we need to wrap
