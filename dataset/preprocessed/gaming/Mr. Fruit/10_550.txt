hi eddie hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to full honor and in today's video there is a brand new hero that goes but oh ah that's one way to introduce him warmonger a brand new hero for the knight faction now for those that have played the campaign you'll recognize her instantly but now we get to play as her now i should go ahead and warn you it has been a little while since i've played on the battlefields of glory i mean what better way to hop into it than with a 1v1 i'll have you know i spent about five minutes in hero tactics with warmonger so in other words i consider myself somewhat of an expert and oh boy it's an orochi i'm about to mix this dude up he won't even know what weekday it is never mind the fact nobody does in quarantine it's all so confusing the days just blend together emote hey let's have an honorable duel gonna let him do his emote okay ready and then i'm gonna do this you like that oh he's like what just happened i bet you would like to know oh oh what the fudge don't try and parry everything mr fruit okay what freaking no oh my god them heavies hurt bruh i forget how adrenaline pumping this game is give me that victory i need to remember everything my character does though gotta pull out all the stops okay well oh all right maybe i should put my guard up that would help they're probably just gonna go on the offensive so that's why i'm gonna okay that's shenanigans i guard broke that fudge my finisher heavies are undodgeable but it doesn't matter now check this out pop oh what oh that's unblockable oh my god i'm the worst no oh i thought i broke that guard break dang that was a close one well played oh boy oh boy all right i'm trying to parry everything spoilers it's not working out very well for me well in classic mr fruit any melee combat fashion i try and parry everything instead of just blocking and wouldn't you know it it usually gets me killed you can't dodge away from this one sucka wait oh it's because he tend to give his dodge attack i guess that's a little different enough [Music] i don't know what's going on here i'm blocking all this suddenly they're like hold up wait a minute oh what shenanigan are in the finest degree you can't dodge this okay we're taking it to a game five i don't know why i didn't do a finisher that's my bad oh i am rusty to say the least but this game no matter how long i don't play it it gets better and better i swear okay he does the same opening attack you think i would i would realize that by now but okay see that straight up just goes through my block all right well then how about this yeah yeah you like that i bet you do i'm throwing this game away chief what where's the guard what the fudge oh my god i cannot give up until you get one win please i am not confident in my abilities at all yep don't know what to do at all here nope not having it this time no no no okay i was supposed to uh impale them but whatever what oh you lucky son of a that's right get out of my life my heart's beating so fast dude frowner does things to me that aren't good my anus bro there we go and hit him with that and another one god his attacks just come out so fast screw you yeah okay and we're gonna get a free top heavy that should do it that didn't do it oh wait they were bleeding yes very good very good come on get the sweep mr fruit my broken ego needs it so much right now jesus dude oh my god that's right run away you coward no they were what screw you into the wall you go you didn't see that one coming which means bop bop uh-huh suddenly he's like sorry sir this isn't really what i bargained for oh my god i'm blocking this stuff okay you're so done for now wait what yes yes ah it wasn't pretty but we see okay i gotta win it's not always about winning the first match it's about adapting to your opponent oh no i've never been able to fight against these guys and if i'm not mistaken or didn't centurion get some sort of like a a change or a rework or something i'm i certainly don't know what it was [Music] oh that's shenanigans oh here it comes wait what i didn't dodge that what okay apparently it tracks it's lame that was embarrassing well how about this oh you like that oh into the wall you go wait what why didn't it throw him into the wall okay all right whatever it worked out in the end so we'll take it thank you very much goodbye i had a little chain going there at the beginning for a second and he just blocked it all and then i made a fat wiener uh because of it but you know aside from that it uh it is what it is i've never really been able to figure out how to use okay there we go what why would i i can't even get a top heavy unless i put him into a wall so i'm not really sure what i thought i was doing there [Music] i'm out of mana i just don't know what to do i don't know what to do when they start kicking me so i just panic oh that was a good thing but you sir are not gonna like this oh wait how in the world was he able to uh huh can't run away from that sir no oh oh chuckles i'm in danger just gotta wait out the stamina this is nobody's flinching okay got him and i get good momentum at the start and then it's always just downhill from there i then have to go on the defensive and quite frankly i just pooped myself he's he's trying to do it i'm just trying to get don't say you're sorry because you're not but you can't knock me off here fight me like a real spot well i guess you're a roman warrior but you get the idea i like that i can't get that for free oh but for some reason he didn't stop me and just like that we take that dub that was a cleaner dub we're getting better or maybe my opponents are getting worse i don't know he wants a rematch and a rematch he'll get ah the black pryor that's my favorite thing when you beat someone in the duel they're like oh fly wait do i pull out my mane jokes on them i don't even have a mane so i couldn't even tell you what that's like oh wait no i meant to emote you yeah prepare yourself warrior [Music] good luck dodging this wait a second hold up this guy's like dude please stupid light attacks yes i'll trade those lights for the kill it's just so hard to react fast enough guard wise to the lights i actually think i'm at a disadvantage because i have like you know like the little analog extenders or whatever so it actually takes me a little bit longer to get to the different sides so that's that's my excuse and i am sticking to it yeah yeah i'm following you to the ends and depths of hell wait what oh okay oh this is bad wait a second suddenly suddenly oh he did my name is mr fruit and i really play for honor but when i do watch out because i'm gonna take and put you on her fudge god you know i had it i had it oh well played my favorite part about the old rascal blackfire throw him into the wall pop pop pop whatever i'm gonna have to ask you to stop throw them on the ground wait what does that mess you see the heavy end of the faint into the guard break he didn't know how to respond just like that a sweep on his evident mane my name is mr fruit and i rarely play for honor but when you stack against me you're already a goner okay that's a little better i mean at least that rhymed right it's like one of those like clapbacks you don't think of until way after like you have like this confrontation and then like two days later you're like oh i should have said that that would have been so clever hey look it's me i wasn't even paying attention hello all right i have no idea how our mirror match is gonna go up here so i'm just going to start with this oh good perry oh but i'll just pair you except unlike you i oh wait what we'll throw you in to this he's like oh shoot oh god we are just trading heavy this is a fiesta oh my god oh but the ready got gut and he's bleeding let's go god that was just that was just a slug fest we had no idea i mean what are at half the battle was just us too far apart and just swinging heavies out just like don't get near me what can i say dude i'm just uh warmonger natural i think i'm able to throw in oh god i wasn't even blocking oh into the fire oh wait what oh yeah she is in the fire all right again i actually just lost a guy with no stamina and a heavy attack oh wait no it's a light attack that explains a little bit more but i was trying to get fancy with this heavy that wow way to throw that one mr fruit i was trying to use my zone attack because i think that's something i can do but i actually have no idea okay i definitely parried that there we go i'm a parry fiend man i'll do anything for that perry especially die evidently oh wait i got the the perry last time but i didn't do anything with it like a dum-dum i parried oh fudge it's my problem in fighting games even like smash and everything like i don't like to just be like oh these are the two things i'm good at or these are the two best moves just use them no for some reason i'm like no i got to use everything and oh like if i'm winning the battle oh i haven't used this set let me use this like why why do i do that i don't know it just gets me killed over and over and over wow that was incredible however you aren't aren't looking too good there buddy and uh let me just do this again he's like dude this dude just never misses with his parries you would be correct like i said you would not be wrong sir another one and then watch this into the wall wait what oh he's gonna bleed he's dead the slow brutal and unforgiving death the bad man or death we shouldn't even be at the final round totally my bad literally this match is just i parry this dude oh wait a second i think he is using the zone attack against me yeah that's the zone attack dude when are you gonna learn that just doesn't work against me what did i tell you how many times is it gonna ah wait and another one and then all i have to do is wait this out oh my god just perry after perry after perry into the fire into the wall into the fire into the wall we're running it back though i have to continue to prove that i am the best warmonger oh here comes our favorite time the i lost in a 1v1 so let me rematch you and pull out my main because as we see here lawbringer you just got lucky dude i'll show you how it's really done okay this should be fun do a little emo good to see you good to see you let's keep this honorable good you're not going to beat me maybe we'll oh you want to do this again you just want to keep giving me all these free parries because i'll do it wait what just happened another one hit him with this where are you running off to you can't get away from me okay well you can roll away from it he's like bro not on my watch unblockable right into your side right into your body let's go warmonger let him know i don't know what's good i still think this game like revolutionized melee combat like to me oh what that like magnet handed me to me like this is just so intuitive it's just too good and with the zone attack it actually comes out way quicker than i thought oh you messed up boy thank you for the free overhead boom come on he's got to be pissed nope again you silly goose [Music] yeah he's like wait this is supposed to be my main because i get warm and i adapt to the enemy rather than the other way around like if i'm already winning the first best of five it's over you know i've got you downloaded you're on my usb stick you ain't going okay i literally dodged out of that one but we'll uh forget about that and here we go again maybe into the wall yeah oh perfect let's do it again why don't we hit him with the light before he can do anything he got out of that one well played [Music] oh you're so done for i saw my opening i was like you want to do this well guess what my range is going to beat you here and just like that he left before oh that's when you know they're pissed man what better way to end it on than making your opponent rage [Music] quit [Music] you
