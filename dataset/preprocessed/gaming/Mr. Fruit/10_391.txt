hi dear everyone my name is mr food and welcome back to today's video in which i want you to bear with me here listen and follow my instructions close your eyes i said close them are they they're closed okay good now imagine this overwatch what immediately comes to your mind it better not be what dork probably immediately thinks when he thinks overwatch but think of that okay now think of what year that would have been what like 2017 20 didn't it come in 2016. it doesn't matter now imagine what it looks like in 2021 because that's what we're doing baby overwatch in 2021 used to be a staple on the channel and then well i don't know like literally it was like a week difference you guys just the interest in overwatch videos just like to poot and then on top of that aside from custom games i was just kind of burnt out on the game so let's check it out it's been a little while now it's the year of the ox hey this one's actually kind of cool you get these for free if you do challenges so that's nice i do like this look at this ash skin what do i know how many skins they've done though since i i couldn't tell you the last time i booted up this game and by the way oh you want my money overwatch well it doesn't matter because i can't even open blue boxes so you won't get my money either way yup can we talk about the fact that overwatch 2's delayed to 2022 it furthers my hypothesis that when they unveiled it it was 100 to diver attention from that whole hong kong situation they had going because they clearly weren't ready it was super far out and they're probably like guys why do why are we even making overwatch too and so that's what they've been asking themselves so hopefully overwatch 2 is sick who really knows so with that [ __ ] we're just gonna what use priority pass are you kidding me flex what the i just want to play quick play i'll just do flex because if i do that i think then if i want to play damage i don't know all right yeah i'm tank wow who saw that coming obviously my boy roadhog my try and true most time played on him so we got to switch it up but i don't really know who else i want to play we do have sugma oh god it's such a cool skin though but i'm bad with him i'm even worse with wrecking ball we do wrecking ball you know what it's correct let's go sigma he throws cool i don't know like nerfs and stuff i don't know what's happened i kind of don't remember his abilities i throw a big rock i know that much push at a barrier right right right okay okay i got this holy cow look at that guy's border k on on the mat he's got like diamond gold plaid so does that ever go wow suddenly my two star prestige whatever is looking pretty sad well it's always looked kind of sad but it's whatever all right hodor look at me starting with the shield yeah okay like i said it's like i never left let's go everybody push up i'm the tank i'm the tank we got we didn't get a kill how is she not dead okay my team's dead my team's dead okay

oh my and of course he just cancels my all i forgot about that stupid stuff god i hate it i don't know it kind of sounds weird but it's been so long since i played overwatch i'm kind of in the overwatch mood again i don't know i don't know if the channel even remotely cares about it anymore i can't imagine it i feel like it's pretty dead it's like most people or it might as well be you know what i'm saying yo like what's going on here because i'm getting [ __ ] on by some tanks okay get the monkey get the monkey don't let him out of here don't let him out of here yeah get him yeah he's

remember what absorbing things does i guess i'm not entirely sure if it even does anything oh he's so weak though okay we have definitely fed this zarya though so if we can kill her before she does something oh my god that's what i'm talking about i'll help move the payload that's an important thing okay somebody needs to somebody needs to oh that that's the roadhog i know in love let's go stop

forget it's not ranked so almost isn't good enough it's all or nothing i gotta get this mercy if at all possible because if we can get her possibilities are endless oh okay you know what i'm kind of having fun again even if i'm tank because i guess i'm decent of this tank that probably helps huh i'm blocking for you uh-huh he might pull you but he's not going to get a kill on you we have to do something about that stupid bastion oh my i thought i had more help than that if we got like i don't know why we have a bastion on offense but if we got like junkrat or something i don't think it's worth it i don't think it's worth it everyone back up back up or maybe not go forward i'm getting damage boosted though okay i'm kind of doing real damage right now not today you like that you like

blocked it out of my memory and it was it was two months ago not even two months ago that's bizarre anyway let me know if you guys want to see some more overwatch honestly kinda down there's also probably a whole bunch more custom game shenanigans we could do and there's like this like mystery death match and bounty hunter and stuff with this [ __ ] does he sound sick so i'd be totally down to do some of that so with that said i don't think i'll much watching have yourselves my testicle talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
