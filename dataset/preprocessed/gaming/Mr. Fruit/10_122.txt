oh we did it grapple with rockets they're pretty good does that count what the fudge i killed him on the point how are you get good dude hi eddie hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to halo infinite and in today's video we bid ado to fiesta until the next tenrai fracture event i suppose and you'll see what a day in the life of mr fruit is as he has to be a completionist i'm more critical of halo infinite because i love halo infinite the gameplay is there but unfortunately it's 20 21 and just gameplay doesn't do it anymore you need progression you need things to chase blah blah blah blah so if they can figure that out honestly i could not be happier but let's get into it okay we're going to hit up quick play because i need to get strong holds it's got to kill people on the point and then oh and win a quick play match well there you go it's kind of lame now that the only way you can advance is by doing the challenges because like if that's the case that'd be level four five six i can only get to level six this week how is it even possible to complete it in three weeks all right i need to find a pulse carbine get one kill and kill three people on their point which actually promotes me playing the objective so that's the good news kind of i guess right you just get a quick uh overkill here oh pog i'm doing it it's so bad it's like is this guy actually using the pulse carpet dude look it's great at dropping shields but it can't finish and the challenge doesn't tell him to drop shields with it otherwise the easiest challenge there it is here we go baby [Applause] it's over baby now the fact that i have to kill him directly on the point though boys i need them to defend it which means they need to have it captured first you boners there's like two seconds off why aren't they why aren't they taking feet they're taking c what why i can't everyone just be like complete a game of stronghold instead i have to be a daddy that can't even manage okay all right we just need to bait him to the point buddy just bait him on the point okay well i guess that's not happening well you can take the point just let me kill you once you do does that count with the fudge i killed him on the point oh my god that doesn't count i was hoping he would run on to the point i think they're grabbing oh that's another one that's got to be another one right how is that not a ninja oh come on man sir sir why must you hurt me so okay i didn't mean to help you ow all right okay that's a lot of them good good good good good good good no no let them let let them take it gosh the one time i have a team that actually does something that's that's gotta be killer on his grenade got the double um all right now i'm pissed punch man it's fine it's fine i like that little cheeked up back look like yeah they know it sells all right that was two right [Music] okay you know what i'm not gonna question it we did it now what it's a it's actually bugged it's actually bugged what so do i just have to reroll this what yeah and people just like reroll challenges with how slow you get levels challenge rerolls are like gold how precious of a resource there more valuable than armor i'd say and i'd rather use it on a challenge that's just stupidly hard then oh 343 bugged this challenge let's see what we got okay well we'll try capture ten enemy flags i refuse to accept that that i think i'm just gonna how many rerolls do i have i have six i'm swapping that killing enemy spartan with a throne fusion coil i'll take that honestly yeah if i can complete these two i get the armor baby oh hello okay right in the thick of things there's another pulse carbine for the glitch only one way to find out though oh i was hoping oh my god oh my god he has a hammer and i don't want to do that he has a hammer and i don't want to do that what kind of sick sense i i don't think you could make an fo b high enough that would see me there come on what did they despawn that quick in fiesta dude actually bought the entire oh my god that guy bought the entire battle pass but the 15 or 20 dollar sword in the store it's a menace hopefully he can afford it it doesn't put him in financial strain if he can then you know more power too i mean it's his money but like that's the reason i didn't buy the battle pass like well i'm gonna be playing a lot of halo might as well have something to grind for you know but little did i know the grind will kill me wait okay that azt griffin dude kind of popping he might be on the killings first well now he wasn't on a killings how are you not get good dude okay well boos grapple with rockets are pretty good oh that's as bad so that's not a fight i should be taking all right well that was fast surely somebody was he on a kill streak at some point no max killing spree four and four see what what am i gonna do here like honestly if they gave mouse and keyboard bullet magnetism then i think fair playing field or might even edge towards massive keyboard fin but that's not gonna happen like mouse and keyboard has better movement uh like turning capability but it all comes down to shot oh wait there should be fusion coils here huh okay what is this garbage what the [ __ ] uh fusion coils oh there's a fusion coil there's one right here davis scorpion what how in the world where in the what okay check this out ready oh jesus just wait for somebody to take it they're gonna no of course you sponsor the sniper again yeah let's let me fight back against the sniper one second oh this is gonna be sick is this possible i don't know am i gonna try and find out oh you betcha dude's got a wraith what okay hold on i need someone to weaken them where are they getting these vehicles though like actually what the [ __ ] i need you guys to just mortally wound them please guys got a melee throw melee throw i need he's like i see what you're trying to do yup yup yup ah fudge there's a warthog this is gonna work copium fudge i thought he would be weak spoilers apparently he was not [Music] come on weaken him weaken him yeah don't kill him that fast take me up oh jesus [Applause] we did it what what's the point of that oh okay what's the point of the freaking ski where if you hit the vehicle and it's like no god like i would've can't do anything and they see me okay okay well that certainly helps okie dokie and no vehicle spot on our side that's actually criminal okay anyone tell me how wait was the other challenge i completed complete non-ball match kill spartans while carrying the ball well all right though we're in a killing spring fiesta i believe he has to be i'll do one more of these but i can't even get oddball yeah well how do i get out there's a little embarrassment happening what the [ __ ] guardian what the [ __ ] like how did that not kill him why does it keep giving me a plasma pistol i don't i don't want it excuse me i'm just trying to drink this thank you very much oh deep drops at the first time he's gonna be right here yup perfect electric i get it because it's like it's an arc weapon [Music] oh i missed my gravel oh you've got a sentinel beam i've got a sentinel beam yeah let's go ninja you hate to see it oh let's go okay you stole my [ __ ] [ __ ] no being not even close oh i saw bjorn [Music] hey what are you doing over here i'll be taking that ooh i'm back oh i'm back oh i'm better okay i'm not gonna lie i saw the shots ricochet so i thought he was behind that pillar it was very big of me not gonna lie this no that still pulls a car man wait but i still need a kill this time and it still won't work will it well not if everyone keeps taking the kills but whatever that arm is gonna be mine now [Music] okay it's time nope nope yes let's go um that's interesting sure you know it says a statement that statement is most certainly not i am a samurai but it's so sick wait do you have to oh you have to specifically unlock these ones how do you do that one's sick how do i get that one like this one's okay but then now it's so sick and of course that one's the not free one it's everyone's favorite colorful samurai i gotta play some oddball which normally it's all i can ever get so surely also i look sick people like ah sheesh that's sick brother thank you you plebs yeah look at you default looking i'm just kidding just kidding best part is didn't even have to spend money you know just i got the free stuff this is not oddball by the way i'm not sure if you realize that they were there too okay i'm better i'm better and better oh my god i'm better oh how many shots one shot all right got you bb very clearly did not bad what do you have for me what goodies did you don't mind if i do he's like where is he coming from captain i suck yeah fudge yeah i'm trying to [Music] hey come on ah fudge perfect oh i wish nothing but the best for you and your family fudge man i admit it sidearm isn't very good uh i like the siren i like it way more than uh the assault rifle see like they're at range because that's good i don't think i've ever used a sentinel beam in here this much but here we are where's the triple where's the triple give me the triple uh stupid oh somebody got me away that's why we've gotten a kill anyway but copy it's his fault clearly another one down i love that [ __ ] no you don't love to see that i hear but i do not see oh hey one shot left that's all i need just wide open training ninja a little ambitious sure sometimes the most ridiculous play is the best i think that was gandhi all right somebody said they request a sticky kill so i'm here to deliver ask and you shall receive okay i missed ah well the way he walked on you would have thought i stuck him oh that is shenanigans wait i didn't pick up the i thought i picked up the uh spike take two now looking for someone to stick what did it just face through him how did that not what like there's no by the laws of aviation there's no way here i go no no i'm not here for you i'm here for the stickies but we won [Music] [Music] you
