hi dear everyone my name is mr fruit and i want to wish you all a merry christmas happy holidays whatever you might be doing with your friends and or family and just wanted to give you guys a small update if you ended up watching the destiny 2 but if i ads the video ends then you have some backstory but essentially my jaw has been killing me if you don't know the whole situation a little over a year ago my jaw locked and would not unlock turns out i have this issue with my jaw some bones deteriorating the condyle bucket handle thing i it gets technical point is yeah my jaw's boned so what ended up happening was i got a splint in my mouth and for the past year we put it in and the goal was to bring my bite forward to give my jaw a break in hopes that at my age it would repair itself fast forward a year no big problems and so we try to bring my bite back just a little bit you know ease it back and immediately jaw locked it's unhappy so clearly this is not going to work which is why people are like what's in your mouth it's a splint i've been taking a lot of meds and steroids to try and debate the the pain for now while we find a different solution which is looking 100 like it's gonna be some sort of surgery hopefully not super invasive first see if things go well but i'll be looking around uh getting opinions moral surgeons in january so because of that uh this past like week week and a half i haven't been able to record so apologies if videos are a little sporadic in the next couple days between the holidays and lack of catalogs or back catalog of videos the more the story is i love you guys hope you have a wonderful holiday and you don't have to give me a gift because you already did it's you love you [Music] you
