this game is mine to win in mine alone it was my birthright you sassy summoner hey brother there's an english row i can't hit a thing heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and in today's video a new season a whole bunch of new things and i'm not trying to say like hey what season just happened i know we're a couple weeks in now in fact actually a month which is really weird to think about kind of flew by maybe it's because i've been no life in it uh like a weird hermit but we got some cool new stuff there's a lot of stuff to get to frankly i've always been trying to work towards crafted weapons to show you some of that this new pulse rifle being one of them the peace of mind it's a brand new weapon introduced with this brand new season 16 which i just gotta say off the bat love the aesthetic of these weapons not only that but all of these have a brand new origin trait land tank final blows with this weapon grain increased resilience and additional damage resistance from combatants i don't know how much that comes into effect in something like pvp but pve that's certainly something nice to have and if you combine it with the artifact you can increase the duration of that origin terrain i don't know the exact details but i'm sure if it's like atlantic lasts four seconds or five seconds with that artifact it's probably like seven or eight seconds i i just never know what mod to put on a gun if it's not a hand cannon i just know it hand cannon nine times out of ten icarus like targeting adjuster or counterbalance let's try counterbalance we have here fluted barrel it's a fun word to say if you say it a couple times fluted fluted fluted fluted one of those things that just like kind of loses it to me like you look at it and you no longer you know what it says but you also your mind is just like this just doesn't feel right blurred magwell for the increased stability and increase your relative speed should say we also have full bore and the range sounds nice but i don't know if i like it enough to be at the expense of stability and handling that much compulsive reloader grants increased reload speed when close to full magazine practically made for me man you guys have ever watched me play like call of duty for sure then you definitely know that would be nice if that was in that game because i have a problem i'm like oh fired two bullets let me reload adrenaline junkie weapon gains increase damage and handling from final bloods with grenades or this weapon so i've been trying for a month to get enough of these deep sight drops to be able to get the pattern and craft the weapon myself and make the god roll i want that hasn't happened i remember seeing some people like you crafted so stupid like i i have all the patterns down like it's so easy gabe's over like what and i see i have like double their play time and stuff some people are just getting insanely lucky with their deep side drops i don't have a single new season weapon crafted not one i'm not even close to one like this pulse rifle i've gotten two deep sights for it over the past month over here what do i do with all these crafted weapons oh yes what a hard life i'm so sorry am i i ain't got nothing all right we need to stop the shining things on me all right you're you're upsetting me spoilers though oh this goes with that saying we're heading to pvp specifically to vostok i said it oh hey guys it's midtown that felt very end game though you know i'm sitting there like on your left cap or was it on his right i don't i don't really know does it really matter that much but and then everyone shows up that's what that felt like oh i'm in the lead everyone's like oh shush what's that drop i know i know what's up so yeah the reason i've wanted this pulse rifle specifically this thing is crispy and hopefully i can show you just how crispy we're talking we're talking like some deep fried d like a fried deep fried can you double fry something has anyone tried that has science gone too far i don't actually know these are questions i don't have the answers to get absolutely pooped on i can't see penis are you hello what what's happening i'm pushing the advantage but we're just we're flanking oh he's got the uh where did i just throw my shield to am i okay i don't think i don't think i am where is where are you all you have friends in all the right places and yet i still got the as that trains mad effect i never bothered to put on trans manifests who do they think i are oh look at look at the fire right now just freaking in fact maybe full auto would have been the play because i don't even know how fast i can feasibly shoot this thing look at that holy wait that was that's pretty quick look at that pretty cool i think well i was also weak had i not been weak we would have won that but yeah all in all that felt pretty nice ostio strika who wait what how did you where was he that entire time don't keep your secrets speak i'm your teammate after all oh here we go okay is that that's it that's a tikkus divination chief aka i want none of that yeah yeah yeah oh he's gonna kill me he's gonna kill me he's charging up he's trying to explode me it wouldn't be the first [Laughter] my wife tries all the time to know of it what oh come everyone just keeps jiggle peeking and running away what what where i turned that corner and saw no one absolutely no and then i just spawned on this dude look at that ttk man i think you could three burst if you hit all of the burst shots as headshots not entirely sure though okay the the freaking flinch that's the word i was thinking the flinch on that thing was insane i don't know if this gun just gives me negative flinch resistance or if his just has omega extra flinch giving because it's not it wouldn't be resisting yeah oh come on give me that triple baby [Music] oh baby a triple yo i'll defend you while you capture yeah eh what i fat fingered my melee while i was trying to throw my class shield thing so that's that delay those couple frames you know what they did they killed me that's what they did i'm freaking dead because of it and it told me vote yo get your tikkus out of here i let you auto man told you what come on you're a space cowboy dude like come on try and do something holy crap i know we haven't had the game of a lifetime right now but i'm just telling you this just feels good to wield to grasp within my cheeto dust fingers gonna let you capture that because i haven't killed nearly oh but see if i'm able to get some more engagements right at that range bro that's where we're eating that's home you know that feels good right there that's i mean i think i got like a little help from someone but here you stand no chance i've got the beast in my sights come on tikkus me he's close i'm flirting with danger here that was my high school crush danger yeah i deserved that one not my best but now it's time to sister's sister wait i didn't even touch him but okay like when i was with my younger siblings like i'm not touching you wait was he in the super i think he was in the super well obviously no more [Laughter] get sucked i hit him then now he's gone away oh jesus help me help me tom cruise yeah he's not expecting three of us to roll up on him ah revenge is a fickle thing is it not my friend the compulsive reloader coming in clutch you're dead i'm weak so i probably shouldn't be up here but that's not gonna stop me boom grab a little overshield everybody's like oh my god you you filthy titan i am what everyone hates where are they what oh flip sponge guys come on i thought we got the memo we weren't flipping the sponge holy suck this game feels like it's been dragging on forever it's such a what's like yeah i'm top of the team so like ow dude hey hey i'm looking at the scoreboard bro come on like i mean like i guess i'm happy to be on the top oh god i'm so gassy right now but i think the point is i don't feel like i'm doing that well so i think it speaks more to just my team in the in the pa like no one's really popping off no it's no one's real fault either are you gonna peek or i guess the answer to that is no i'm coming my guys let me do some sort of heroics let me assist you in some way let me let let me help me help you okay and we lost the lead okay great perfect you give me just what i needed just what i need you know what's weird is i associate that song with christmas and oh my god best buy so whoever's idea that was to what to make that their song for those commercials like well play that is the best buy holiday commercial song they're not gonna expect me to repeat like this okay and i shouldn't have it's also part of it i always forget that my action oh wait wait i'm trying to i'm trying to teabag he was tea bagging me see i'm gonna let him live he's cool oh wait was he the tea bagger i don't remember it's hard to say oh geez this game is gonna end on time what is happening goodness gracious if i was in a complete daddy i'd have like three supers by now that just doesn't happen you know compulsive reloader activate according to my scatter levels l plus ratio plus maiden list let's get pooped on oh it feels so good it feels so right to be here with you i'm going in i'm going in yeah okay i respect the hustle oh my god oh my god what the fudge oh it's my alarm oh fudge my alarm like i have to solve math problems to stop it oh jesus okay i'll just i'll multitask um uh oh god uh math matt's hard uh this is hundred two hun i have time 17 seconds get one more kill before my alarm gets pissed at me come on it out it's not going to happen or is it yes and just like that that's a fat w okay and that's a super no stop now it's not the time alarm all right fine i'll i'll do your math problems okay i also need to then in three minutes let it know that i didn't fall back asleep like what the fudge yes my alarm activates and then i have x amount of time to solve four or five different math problems within a set amount of time and then if i complete the math problems then it's going to ring again precisely three minutes later unless like a couple seconds before that i disarm it again that's that's how hard of a time i have to get out of bed and this doesn't always work i sometimes i still fall back asleep me and waking up you know we just don't really jive like that you know we don't really roll like that also hey hi how are you i'm in rumble oh i didn't even see my last game stats was it bad was it good no you don't yes you do all right well he's gone and now this guy's behind me hold on i'm reloading wait hold on oh this hurts i'm dead yep all right have you had to get in a fair fight well i guess it was a fair fight look at me just spin yo check out this ricochet oh my god no you boner i have to reload oh freaking pee pee poop that was my kill getting so close to kill oh my god that's a sniper yo check it what my anus suck my ass i'm sorry that's oh you're gonna jump over to me okay i'm just gonna die right off spawn i guess that's cool okay maybe not the best rumble weapon hankins definitely rain supreme for the most part or maybe i'm just making excuses you know what i'm thinking i'm making excuses wouldn't be the first time it won't be the where is this dude god i always get caught running around the corners someone's coming from behind are they someone's coming over here are they oh come here you have a shotgun or something yep answer is yep i have no special weapons so yep don't have that going for me what okay there's the kill you oh i was hoping i could clean up on both wouldn't that have been fun lars she blows your captain to psb rather effective captain i really thought i'd be able to what how did wait i killed what what was was that lag was was he flinching me out of like some of the burst because otherwise i i truly i don't know how i didn't kill him oops yo peep that you sassy rocket launcher vodka ooh get boot done nice summoner yeah some of these nuts that's toxic i'm sorry how could i just say something like that you shot you shotgunning fiends oh oh oh 40 seconds oh okay okay i diffused my alarm no no jesus and i got to defuse this situation please don't kill me oh my god get killed it's that easy ah little t-rex arms just flail in the air while you melee me we're supposed to have the same melee range i didn't feel like it you know but what do i know you know i don't have a degree for melee ranges in destiny dude like that last burst there is something weird he has to be flinching me or something like deviating my burst just barely gosh dang it like they keep just ah i'm just getting tilted and chasing things cause it's like this is like the fifth or sixth person where it's like oh i got him one shot and they're gone again and i don't have the loadout to chase maybe if i had an energy weapon but i don't i'm gonna die that's a nova are you kidding me what did i do to hurt you so uh let me apologize at least we what it's that sassy summoner dude that's what i'm calling it from now on it's not the adapt summoner it's the sussy summoner my oh my god jesus did at that range whatever okay guy got him i'm third what just going way worse than i thought apparently oh my god he finally didn't get away before i could kill him pog oh yeah sit in that grenade what the fudge somebody want to explain that one to me all right this is the comeback we need and the one we wanted and the one we deserved main character syndrome let's get it you sassy summoner not this time land tank is active and it's already gone yes good good this game is mine to win in mine alone it was my birthright you sassy summoner zoom zoom zoom oh i knew you would peek and that was ballsy because i i just ate that action bolt i hedged my bats you know i'm like i can survive this i tried to i knew i was gonna die but i tried to throw my shield last second so that my last dying action would be throwing that and getting the kill didn't quite work that way but okay only problem he's getting kills i i haven't found anyone i'd come to me okay this is probably saucy summoner it looks like it is one minute okay i got to kill sushi summoner what dude to think i would have won this game if first off eight different kills didn't escape with one health or if i just had an energy weapon i didn't even i was still third oh jesus that was a tight one okay i'm not i'm not satisfied with this we're doing another one we're close we are to perfection it hasn't been bad in fact i've been on top of the leaderboard mainly both games essentially but it's like if i can just clean it up a little bit this is a map now this is mars wait what the fudge bean no whatever planet is this it's mars mercury it's mercury that's what i'm thinking of what the fudge yeah what is going on right now okay well this is one way to introduce me back into a game i don't know why i gotta join all these games in progress why can't i just play the game like a normal person and up close like that i'm gonna lose that every time god and then he has to check his ghost oh my god did i just kill the real mr fruit okay well now i gotta bag him so salty a good one you and your hand cannons your rascals yeah that's right i'm gonna pad my stats here with a quick rocket launcher except there's no guarantee i'm gonna get a kill here yes there is what am i saying that's a scout rifle what i only have this equipped so that while i'm doing this i get levels so what are the only reason i live and i avenged you good good good good good good good good refresh my overshield here lord knows i'm gonna need it it's me crutch yeah okay i don't have my shield probably an important bit of information to remember okay you're already dead i don't know what hit me i'm blinded by your smoke molly out i hear him up there no stop stop it that ain't cool man i'm gonna assist you here buddy what a spawn for that dude and he's afk and you stole the kill i just didn't have the range for it oh yeah the fire rate baby okay 100 always forget just how fast i can holy lag back what i don't know what's going on with you but that's a super okay just got a team shot team shot team shot wow that went pretty well some orbs for me well i accept you that is an arc staff and it's coming our way i'm coming buddy no oh he's already dead he wasn't able to properly pay for his crimes see it's i just need to get more of engagements at that range and we're eating um it thrives there it loves it there that's home there's another one around the corner buddy careful careful careful he's weak nice yeah i gotta cap the zone and then i'll help you okay you're dead it's gonna make that a little more difficult i'm gonna nade him and hit nothing i think i can't see anything so it's uncle i'm getting i'm getting patched brother hey brother there's an endless row i can't hit a thing hey sister do you still believe in love i wonder that's two kills right there okay it's one thought i'd make a bold guess though i wasn't like too far off yeah that was ambitious i'm trying to help your friend here's one shot there you go there you go nice finish strong finish okay i don't know what exactly you were doing but hey there we go okay it's it's the whole team all right fair enough i like
