yeah who is who what is what yeah what is going on oh lord oh i'm overflowing come here he's gonna grab the heavy i'm coming oh geez wha what was his idea there he's dead got him heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video trials is back in which queen this is the first weekend and with it a new adapt weapon so that's what we're going to be using today the brand new summoner adept auto rifle now the summoner and its adept version aren't necessarily new but one of the new things you now get are the origin perks so alacrity gain increased real stability aim assist and range when you're the last living member of your fire team or running solo which we've kind of had before with trials weapons and one quiet moment the pvp origin trait grants increased reload speed when out of combat so if i remember i'll swap to this during rumble because i'm pretty sure it activates since i am the only member of my fire team yeah it's your solo it's free for all this one came with deep sight resonance don't get yourself too excited you can't craft them it just happened to drop so i can extract if i want to and finally i acquired adept icarus grip so now i have all the adapt mods i have every mod actually aside from taking spec i don't know why the game didn't it like just that's that's a story for no time but so i figure hey we'll use it now it seems pretty good for just about everything increased accuracy while airborne slightly increases weapon range could be an argument for counterbalance stock perhaps targeting adjuster sprint grip i am an ape i actually have a rampage so rampage spec but then even things like adept range add-up stability i don't know lots of stuff so yeah i'm not sure which is the best we're just going to go that optical or maybe well you know what maybe we'll do that in rumble let's just go add up stability because i'm currently using elemental capacitor with void which increases stability so it's just really stable we also have overflow picking up special or heavy ammo will automatically load this weapon beyond normal capacity which is okay the thing is i got a couple ad ups not really any good pvp rolls this is about as good as it gets there is rampage and we could use that but frankly i'm fine also just kind of running around with elemental capacitor for the fun of it so that's what we're doing went flawless the first week went flawless with emtashed and rick caccus classic it was pretty fun pretty sweaty took a couple resets i'm not gonna lie and something note as usual this is the default shader the gun comes with you can see the lit up eye is yellow as always if you put the fall assembly on it's now red so i think something like that that's clean we're gonna rock that i'm all seasoned saitan's ramparts because i'm just kind of feeling like a scum scum lord right now soles but before i forget i think i'm using actually i am using bubble and you know what i'm fine with that weapons of light you know why not they threw this map back in the mix it feels like it's been forever since you've been gone this does look so sick though and while we're here let's talk about auto rifles man they just haven't had their time in the sun and frankly it feels like forever also this thing is a laser beam right now holy yeah yeah no you don't yeah wait where did my sentinel shield go bruh can't just disappear like that oh wait oh that's a sniper rifle you can see i think i hear a sniper rifle a scout rifle frankly if i had a little bit more range i think we'd be faring a little bit better but oh it's pretty stable chief which i would hope i've specced everything into it but let me pick up this heavy ammo and overflow doesn't proc apparently when you just pick up heavy like that that's unfortunate thought it might yeah it does not go figure ugh yeah this range i feel like this is just a little bit out of our uh working range that that we would want what i was around the corner my anus my anus disagrees as well so i got you buddy i got you no oof you're so dead okay i whatever this yeah this little engagement right here the range we got i don't like it ain't about it which is exactly what i'm pushing through anyway oh we are in so much trouble yeah what is happening right now who is who what is what let me kill this whisper of the old child god thing all right nice i didn't do much but i'm proud of you oh yeah oh wait i guess i picked up ammo because oh low look at look at the magazine 94 in the mag well there's an overflow for you i'm sure i'm not going to even be able to use most of this magazine i'll probably die before then okay you got that great stuff what am i getting hit from dude it's man just like the wall piercing it's not even armor-piercing it's just like land piercing bullets what's all that about okay i'm freaking lighting people up right now this thing bro this thing do be nasty all right there's my grenade close but not close enough i don't really know what happened but it's it's it do be pooping on him wait what wait okay okay guy excuse me was that like three melees that just didn't connect come on silence and squall my anus well i mean i don't want you to i'm just saying my anus is yeah screw you man do weapons of light so it's a matter of where do i want to pop it what do i want to abuse it i'm thinking popping it on b seems like the best play that man's pretty weak this thing's this thing's just feeling snappy you know i like it come on girard me okay he's like what the fudge molina come get your weapons of light here oh i'm charged with i got weapons of light charged with light oh sheesh you'll let me and then and then oh overshield shooting through a shield oh i'm the worst i'm the worst kind of person right now oh my god oh and i regret nothing well now it's like how do i why is my stasis middle mouse button that's the hardest button to spam oh you're dead you're dead you have friends never mind i just always love auto rifles if you've followed me or the channel for a while you know this especially back in d1 i mean hand cameras are fun but i i don't know what it is about auto rifles it's i just enjoy them i don't know why but they're just fun to use for me but i know for most people they don't really feel the same for most people it's just another gun like automated we'd rather just have infinite amount of hand cannons which to be fair can't blame you because the hand cannons are just fun it's for destiny it's just like their secret sauce you know it's that one weapon that no matter how good or bad they are whatever people are doing they're always going to want to use it because it just feels good to use and you know so i think i think they did it right there yo what up yeah let's go sighting ramparts oh my god okay well that's unnecessary sir so i'm just gonna run right into him [Laughter] holy cow how am i still alive what the [ __ ] what is going on i lived way longer than i had any right to devil show thyself i didn't realize oh well fair play he's like what you want me to come out okay it's like no i was thought i was talking about a different person oh getting melted son that's the wrong button how did you see me and also i fat freaking my grenade i know might throw on adapt brains here in a second plus 10 range might not be enough but bump me up to like 20 more and i think we're buying i got you buddy uh what is he going to do supers maybe trying shotgun i don't know i don't really know what his play was frankly yeah stupid and i'm fro are you kidding me i've got you for no i don't oh my god i'm getting revenge for my shelf okay let me overflow the mag oh 94 in the mag oh god i keep faffering in all my abilities okay i don't know why i cancelled i'm looking yeah all right hey great work guys great work give it give it i felt like a pretty solid game for me probably you guys too hey we you know team effort nearly top of the team will take it best efficiency on the team okay well now it's time we hop into rumble and rumble specifically is fun because these trials weapons as mentioned has this alacrity orange origin trait so theoretic i'm pretty sure that's how this works while we're in rumble because we're our only fire team member we get increased reload stability aim assist and range pretty good so we're we were obviously very stable yeah so what if i'm thinking let's go out after us sure it gives us a little bit of range but also in rumble you're probably you know flying around doing things a little bit more so this might be a little more advantageous for us you're on your own i know i'm on my own thanks for reminding me i didn't need you to tell me you invisible looking sassy bacca gotcha oh yeah look at that alacrity okay i didn't even get a chance to he's invisible he's dead got him i think is there someone else invisible i think i saw a blip on the radar i hate it it's just invisible boners everywhere man it's it's middle school over again you know everybody's trying to hide it but also uh just don't call on me don't call on me i'm coming oh jeez ooh now i'm the guy getting the cleanup kill oh it's so fun i see why everyone does it now come here yeah okay i didn't really suck him you've got to be kidding me there's no shot he just survived that all right we got now i must stop the evildoers from grabbing my heavy i'm hold on give me give me a second i'm almost there oh god he got it oh he's got a sword but he's dead there's someone over here were they chasing me i he's gonna grab the heavy what the what the what what's actually i don't know what that was i didn't get i didn't get a killer what okay we got that one though oh load oh i'm overflowing i'm ah i tried my best but i couldn't vanquish them all in time he's right here he's dead let's go okay overflow with the mag you know overflow ain't bad you essentially kill one person odds are they have at least one special ammo on them so you get a brick you don't have to reload and then you've got like three mags worth seems like a pretty good deal to me [Music] come on he thinks i'm weak but i'm not yeah oh he weld all right i'm out of here oh i thought i killed him with that name i was like wow that's incredible jump up here do it you won't coward wait he fired one last second shotgun shot what what was his idea there smooth as a butter baby i'm not using my special at all because why would i i'm here to use the adapt messenger stupid icarus dish look icarus dish yeah i'm my favorite nothing quite hits the same like an icarus dish yes i've got weapons to lie baby oh melted yeah he's pissed he's pissed so would i i i would be as well yeah okay yeah whatever go dancing about somebody somewhere else buddy i don't know what he's just planning on doing there he just kind of froze i don't necessarily blame him but we are melting thank you yeah he's like hey that was my kill it was wasn't it so thanks ah you like that ghost mainly through the beer yeah but i can't tell you how many times that's happened to me welcome to the club glad to have you all right dad oh dude it's already up yo i kind of nice with it right there wait did i get some of all tears let's go i think i did i did popping off 20 to 19 technically that's a feels good for me chief i need to get my exotic safer from here before before i forget because well 150 in the season pass by the way and we're not even like three weeks through i just want you all to take note of this because this is a rarity and it may never happen again so just you know remember this i know i've been playing a little bit too much destiny 2 when i was playing trials with rick cackus and i was like wait a second i'm higher season pass than rick caccus which isn't a dig against rick ricky you know the man the myth the legend just man plays a lot of destiny you know and i it's it's new for me to be grinding this much uh compulsive reloader adrenaline junkie i'm not against it i can attune this and collect resources but i don't need to right now but yo this summoner adapt kind of like the elemental capacitor could probably roll something better in this slot but like unironically i kind of the overflow elemental capacitor was working frankly i didn't hate it and alacrity always brock in in rumble is is fun i like that the summoner adept it's my baby auto rifles i love them and i'm happy to say that this thing just kind of slays regardless of the role it helps that you can put adept mods on it you get alacrity and rumble but if you're a fan of auto rifles try and get one uh well unfortunately by the time this is going up this trials is probably gone but any trials you can always try and get a regular summoner if you got a better adept or there's one you really like let me know what the role is down below maybe one day i'll be able to chase after it because that's the thing i only bothered to go flawless on one character i guess if i had tried for all three could have gotten even more adepts but didn't really have the time and i can only handle so much trials anyway i love you guys thank you much for watching feel free to show support if you're if you're not subscribed feel free to would appreciate that any likes comments any of that stuff i normally don't ask for them but if you're if you're feeling so inclined i wouldn't complain love you guys see you next one bye [Music] [Music] you
