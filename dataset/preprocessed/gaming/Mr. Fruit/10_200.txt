and vibing we're healing and vibing okay it doesn't make it i can't escape the stamina doesn't appear to be a problem blocking you still get hurt i'm confused the the core the the pr there's something here but it needs some polish let's be honest yo yo yo yo yo come back here you coward all right whatever you can have your way but you must die oh my god and i fell are you kidding me yo what do you want man you want this problem but okay i guess we lost what we even had so many more kills we just we just never captured the points all right well like yeah the the bone the meat is there i guess it needs the potatoes or maybe vice versa i don't know it you just it doesn't feel like you have much agency in a fight you don't have a lot of control over your character is the best way to put it so i'm interested to see where they go with it uh it was fun def like i said yeah it needs a little bit more so good luck uh if you guys want to check it out free to play on pc the open beta well because
