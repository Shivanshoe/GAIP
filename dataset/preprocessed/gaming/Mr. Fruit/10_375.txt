hi everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to eternal waifu eternal return black survival we made a video on this couple days ago and a lot of people were confused because i was super pega and forgot to put in an intro so some people were confused and some people unsubscribed it wasn't you right it better not have been so totally uncalled for because i really like the game and the people that did watch it seem to enjoy it even if a little bit confused so we have another video here and i can at least give you a brief introduction well first off i can say the name of the game that helps it's on steam free to play it's a moba battle royale it's freaking sick i love mobas i have far too much time and money in the league of legends so seeing something like this it also reminds me like battlerite royale and stuff which died for no reason i wish it was still alive i wish a lot of games were still alive but that's not important this game it's sick it's grown in popularity it's really difficult don't get me wrong and there's a lot of nuances and i suck at most times but that that's beside the point i'm still having fun even though i suck that's how you know it's great so please support the video and subscribe if you haven't to make up for yeah the last video anyway let's get into it bro why do they just do so much damage for no reason all right screw this i have enough to buy her i'm buying her he should have been dead by all rights all right i'm sorry believers at this point doubt so you can get your points back god i'm still so upset dude okay so what you want me to go hospital doc uptown for well that's no good what am i looking for that clearly okay i'll have to read my abilities when i'm in the bush later i'm just gonna have to try and avoid any kind of fighting right now and i hear someone oh all right they're right here actually i know i just do bleed over time which is why i'm fighting yeah they don't want it your dad your dad let's go yeah see dude so stupid i just did so much damage over time nothing makes sense like i'm like you know i got to avoid fighting though and literally level one i'm like let's do this kill them still can't buy anything that's the person i killed she's level six i don't know but i'm gonna try and it worked out she's trying my problem is i think she's faster in just about everywhere oh my god that level difference was real again shouldn't be challenging these people but i am i need branches there's branches nope go go go go all right we made the dock pog i need glass bottle apparently i'm full on junk i can finally make something i guess there's somebody right next to me insufficient inventory especially kidding me oh [Music] somebody want to explain what's going on over there we're just gonna pretend we didn't see each other i guess oh i got my full one now though come back here boy boy there he is why does he do so much damage for no reason i'm dead okay maybe we're going our separate ways i don't know what he did and why i don't know where he did so much damage but that's just how it worked gotta go to uptown hunt you up uptown i got the jump on him i hit him with my full rotation before he touches me and then i just disappear i like like forgive me for thinking that i was going to win that same level and everything this is the redemption arc round i'm gonna try i just don't like the problem with that fight is like i don't know what i did wrong it's just one hospital that's manageable and honestly level one i think i'm strong like i think they're in here i'll straight up fight him immediately i i really do think i win this fight they're not even trying to fight back for whatever reason come back here how are you already regaining so much health what the fudge i will die for this and it looks like i'm going to because i might kill him but then somebody else will get me see i'm not applying my max bleed stacks that's what i have to do come here i hope no one else comes hospital because this is all i've been doing the fudge this poor guy he's like leave me alone and i just won't i will not let you live i have i'm just too committed at this point i'm sorry man yeah i'm a horrible person oh you've got to be kidding me the fudge is wrong with you leave me alone why are they so fast it has a leave me motorcycle why why why why are you all hiding together i'm having fun big huge nuts crazy let's go ahead and do this i don't know if any i didn't bother to see if anyone came here so give me all your meat why aren't you dying i don't understand anything i was a level above the whole fight i have bleeding going on the whole time i don't know am i like they probably had items bro that's the one problem with this girl she has nothing to start i can't craft anything i'm just gonna do this until it works it'll work eventually i swear it oh what's that don't fight early got it i'm fighting early and they're level two and i'm out i never learn i never learned nothing nothing nothing sorry i'm running i hate everything and i'm running come on give me something to craft for all that is good and holy in this world i don't know what that does but i'll take it honestly i still don't feel comfortable fighting i don't think i ever will come here come here i have the level advantage gotcha okay i actually killed somebody i'm the greatest ever played escape oh okay i can craft this maybe that can craft into something else yes slow me down yes what else what else is that it oh my god we got okay okay i can't fight oh come on yes oh it looked real bad for a second okay armor butler suit already got it so now i need a fan and a doll and stuff whatever what's this thing collecting tree life they're right next to me i got it i just don't know what it did oh jesus okay they even had to jump on me don't ask me how we won this gives hp regen oh tree live okay whatever this gives sp regen hp region oh okay so i don't need that i don't need that this gives hp region hp region sp let's do like that that very good very good now i just need to level up as much as i can so i'll search things i'll run i'll do everything i have to just loot everything baby give it all to me i can't sit idle must level farther yeah all right this is it this is where it's going to end so and nobody's here what are they doing oh big level up all right no one's here i'll just keep hunting do not sit tight at all big big big big big i don't need you kill everything where are they are they still in the hospital oh they're behind let's go what the somebody fudge to explain that one to me they're like almost dead and then suddenly i'm dead okay she missed that time i got it this time bleed bleed oh god she has so much damage but let's go where the fudge you can just run backwards and do 9000 damage but we did it shout out to the believers faith pays off that's what i like to [Music] hear [Music] you
