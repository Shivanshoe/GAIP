though we all through that last round i'll put it on i'll put that on me guys i don't know how to tell you this i think i'm washed mr fruit don't say that no i'm not surprised i've played at this point like six d2 matches within the past um couple months frankly it feels like or at least the past like month so the fact that uh what what is this what what am i looking at what does he use them kinetic grenade launcher nothing i mean evidently it is don't really matter if oh there we go that's the pick that's the pick where are my boys at where my boys at where my boys at there we go there

not even remotely close to my super so i guess i'll sit back with you guys let's see they've squashed storm trance honestly i think we're just dead if that comes after us okay so this is is this i can't tell if this is unusual or this is what they normally do i really can't because this is what it feels like they normally do not dead my yo boys where you at and that's kind of how this all comes together you know one minute i'm nuts i'm nuts super who never heard i'm never gonna forget about this and i'm never gonna forgive them or my teammates i refuse to acknowledge my mistakes and instead i'm gonna push it on my teammates okay because that's how this works welcome to freelance baby look at that whoa you know i remember going to the reveal what was this like curse of osiris one of the first dlc's going to bungee playing this i'm pretty sure i remember thinking like this map sucks and you know what i still think that that's that's my whole story at the end don't you just love story
