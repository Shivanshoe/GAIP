hi 80 Hojo one Munnings mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny too and I got to admit a guilty pleasure of mine wait what the oh it's just it's just a ship coming for mine I am lovin all this arbitrary salt and hate for the Guardian games what am I talking about well let me show you no wait go stupid crayon eating can never win anything ever good destroyed room the best part do is we might win but I have I had no expectations and I have like no stake in this if we win sick that means I get to make fun of everybody else who really wanted their class to win cuz I don't care I don't need a games to tell me Titans master class you know you know what I'm saying seriously though it's hilarious how upset people are they would early said hey Bungie we don't believe you show me the CARFAX and the money's like yeah here you go and people like know rigged oh and I bet you thought you wouldn't see this I have the heir-apparent on my account the ornament is looking as sexy and I thought some of you would appreciate the irony of having the Warlock shell on my Titan anyway I don't really get what everybody's so upset about like this really isn't that hard let me show you what I mean cuz I don't really get where everyone's coming from here meat I turn me ponch is so easy also ignore the absolutely gaudy shader and put it on for the memes it's like the the gardening games camo honestly just looks like a retired Ronnie McDonald threw up all over me oh this festive fellow honestly I just see the Guardian game's armor and I think wow that looks like scuffed srl why have we never gotten Sol back but let me show you what I'm talking about here this really you what me aha great stuff guys master race you're now I just say that a whole bunch too to trigger people give me a second sorry I'm just so set in my Titan crayon eating ways let me just say this though don't knock crayons until you try them no I got my laurels oh and we died simultaneously Jim means my melee didn't reset wait a second I'm giving up my strategy which really really isn't a revolutionary Ludo everyone's doing it you just what just reset Oh but played well played you sick son of a wait a second I forgot I have a certain something equipped fudge oh he is the heir apparent and the ornament that was my idea you can't take what thought there was more heavy there too and I saw all that day of this Granada in shame it didn't hit anyone I'm nutty dude oh my god he got away yeah right and my mother's name is Martha GJ Martha name that iconic film ah no no no I do not believe it oh god you to all these other classes like a hunter grouse warlock Oh get out of my way I'll show you the way the game is meant to be played Bob we do that give me some morals Bob do that darn it I didn't get the reset though let's see there's two quick laurels dude easy more Titan laurels it's all I'm seeing out here because everybody's realized wait a second guys we should just play Titans because they're the best and also the games if you want to actually get the exotic machine gun actually promote you to just play all the other classes instead of the one you main which doesn't make any sense but even still there's a drastic amount more of Titan showing up what are we the first day of garden games wasn't like hunters one is like yet well not surprised there and the next I was like hunter I think it was tight and I was like wow that's okay that was unexpected I think every day since has been Titans if I'm not mistaken like haha let's go wait a second oh I see you heir-apparent all revved up I wanted that guy that Pete just stole a bit more so you just quick little headshot it also doesn't help though that my snipers Solar had it been arc I coulda just laid body shot him and absolutely destroyed oh my god it's error parents everywhere evidently I need to put on an arc weapon wait a second we don't have any of the zones I forgot I'm a Titan I don't know what objectives are I really hope I'm just triggering people in this fail even Yugi really keeps thank you but I've been putting it guy kicked listen bro it ain't that deep man like this these games are a joke anyway we talked about it on the podcast but here's a better Guardian game's idea and they had in halo by the way is one of my favorite halo 3 things to do in fact your skirt oh god that's so stupid okay but some good old laurels skirt oh well played well played fellow tartan brother a man of culture hey go ahead and get those laurels you might have killed me but it's for the greater good it's for us for the clan brother King for the King for the sake of Skyrim which apparently those aren't even like even remotely close to the lyrics even if translated which is just like honestly blew my mind and I kind of just want to not accept that that's true because I don't want to believe it that's not as cool for the king but a king for the sake of Skyrim for a king but I think what I think damn way cooler than like hobbies are fuzzy foo jammies um Bhagu - and then like it strange I did it - like he was Hein and there he was she is one to the Dragonborn there's an L yeah I'll help capture this so sure welcome but yeah we're we're almost tied up there and we've just had like literally no sounds the entire time we're just out slain but unfortunately we don't do objectives but I'll capture see out I'll do my part I am once again asking for your objective capturing support feel the burn rip no more burn to feel I hope there are far more of them than I previously thought holy bejesus oh my god oh I thought my grenade kill him was like that's incredibly and here I go skirt Bop you're dead we got a little helpful but he'll to this do my bike miss fruit okay so like what are you what are you doing in this video well what's going on here well I'm literally demonstrating that all I have to do is run around in the crucible and melee people and that's the life of a Titan right now and also say Bungie please full of God I'm hoping next season's a banger or something but like brother bounties bro like bounties and bounties and bounties this is a bounty and a bounty simulator come on man I'm telling you halo 3 multi-team for teams of two cool in this game guess what easy peasy three teams of three leave one for each class melee registration is so good in this game by the way I've been playing a lot of Minecraft recently and I think that's more competitive this low-key though yeah I just been grind in it I don't know it's like it's 2010 all over again or something I don't really know here I go though time to absolutely destroy some plebs my machine go go go Bert no that was my kill my kill and miner God will you guys stop oh nice nice pun oh my god try to control the recoil I was like man I'm playing power in here for a second hold on Bob your dad oh my god Bob I can only miss so many shots holy cow mr. fruit look like I said give me an enchanted bow and a creeper bro going down going down down and zagging down but a bum buh duh buh duh buh shiva dip murder I'm stuck on beat and I'm gonna die Oh Bob no no yeah what the fudge rush straight up yeah he like didn't even take a scratch I hit him three times you you think like oh I can challenge this if I get in there and fist a couple times in LA it's even what the dream team hey I've heard of those guys big fan big fan but they're destined one stuff was way better dude like nowadays like a dream team who you know I'm saying hey mama I did it I got a kill I forgot that that's possible wait a second wait a second wait a second patty cake patty cake very good cake we're three points off this is doable not likely but do you know the more thing about the two it's like what's the heir-apparent grind worth my soul maybe not but at least we have it roasted lanes noise trials Armour you know I'm broken I did passage of confidence I did three out of four weekends flawless I just have to win some more after going Follis got to bring someone there and like I need one more armor piece but man I don't know if I can bring myself to do it man trials is roof and the thing too is just every weekend less and less people are playing it's getting sweaty ER and sweaty ER it's oh my god it's rough out there man I'll tell you what just isn't really Oh just isn't really worth it well hello friend ah alright let's see we go Oh oh my god okay all that running to diagnostic here computer says that he's dead I'm sorry I'm sorry you had to see that come here come here it's alright you can talk to me we're friends you and me right here this is home mm-hmm right here right here never let go Oh jack feels bad I feel you man what the heck is this guy doing huh I didn't realize we're playing MLG sweats breath look at this dude we got crouch shot and spare rash and Sun Oven bro my MMR was kind of rough already but then I was like hey let's go for not forgotten and then literally every game and just fight people at 55 on your glory even if I'm not playing cop anymore it's it's a great idea oh it's that you wanted to play for fun not on my watch it's strange too because some games I'm totally down for that like valor n't I totally get why there's skill based matchmaking even in normals you know same with the League of Legends it makes sense but man someone like destiny it just it doesn't like it just doesn't feel right I mean I don't why am i why why is this same with call duty don't really get that but they seem dead set on keeping that and they've yet to tweak that honestly the biggest thing holding Modern Warfare back which is a shame because it's a great modern warfare a great modern warfare great call of dirt or dang it dude I'm trying to melee these guys but they won't they won't come close enough to let me melee them hello skirt thank you yep need my laurels don't mind me yes collected my laurels laurels laurels come get your laurels read all about it Titans Titans winning the games everybody's past except for the Titans lmao no he's half health somebody nicely done now here comes the fun part skirt all the double-wall you're not getting through this no says Satan you want to do this you want to do this my heir-apparent goes [Music] the batteries missed all a bunch of snap [Music] my friend dude oh I got you ha ha it doesn't eat go alright came here we ago skirt gobos and didn't work at all skirt good where you going boy you're not running away from me yeah I pretty much use my yep I use my entire super to kill him but we did they're all departing the match haha their spirit is broken now break their physical party their bones will crunch under the might of noxus shine League of Legends we're playing a lot of T of T literally well just quite frankly I missed the head shot on Ben aside from some of this heir apparent shenanigan re been playing a lot of TFT I actually just hit diamond which I'm super happy that it's it's top like 1.5% of players in that game oh I've been grinding the hard feels good to finally get there it diamond in that been grinded minecraft hardcore world's going and on that streams two days in a row of like nine hours streams or eight hours streams or something and then on top of that some legends of Marin Terra so just a lot of League going on we glory at least league world characters so noxus is a is a region in League of Legends but I won't bore you with the lore although I probably will be making a video on legends of her and Terra because I think it's so much fun unfortunately like literally all those games I just listed aren't good for the channel nobody really cares about them which is on lockers oh and then also of course grind in Pokemon we got that let's play on the second channel going super ripe yeah what are we just feeling like what it seems like about every other game then then like FPS is right now for no real reason either Valerie rank came out played a few of those just not feeling that right now either I don't know I'm in a weird spot grinding FPS you for all my life you know I'm saying so now maybe it's just like you know hey let's take a little break don't ask me why and the thing too though why I think I'm so proud of TF T is because that's not just like who me uh shoot you shoot mcboot it's like actually a strategy game and you have to like use your head for head to prove myself that hey might be a dum-dum but I'm not the biggest dum-dum and all in all still just super sad about what Guardian games is and whatever these triangle ships are this is what I don't get they certainly make it seem like next season triangle ships really showing up for something but like you would think they'd save that for the fall DLC right so what is this next season gonna mean is it just gonna be like they're getting closer they're getting closer they're super close and then we have to wait for DLC I'm just I'm excited for fall because I do think they got something spicy in store something that's gonna gonna mix up the bot at least I can help with that sale Asian gentleman thank you very much for watching remember Titans master class confirmed no doubt about it you look at the gut look at the banner and the tower I don't have to tell you it destroyed everyone else friggin peepee poo-poo let's get it [Music]
