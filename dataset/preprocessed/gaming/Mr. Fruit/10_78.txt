new objective get zero kills don't frag me don't stop step one don't get a kill right here step one grenade won't weaken somebody for me to then kill step one don't get a kill it's already going exceptionally frankly every everything hurts jesus yeah yo yo i got you i got you buddy i didn't kill don't worry i'm the worst oh my god why do you watch my videos because they're so bad heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and in today's video i'm taking a gun for a drive to test drive she's gonna say drive test that's not how that works i mean i don't need to pass a test i already have my license that's not the point and that license is a license to carry this sick son of a gun if you haven't already watched it what are you doing go watch go watch the grand master and i did my first grand master okay and because of that i got the adept palindrome what do we got look at this increased range with hammer forged increased range with armor piercing quick draw because i'm the fastest draw on the west essentially killing the guardian in this case will trigger health regeneration reload speed oh and maybe i should should probably put something on here huh look at that range oh yeah icarus is good i don't have adept icarus i'm looking for that good adapter range it is and yeah um am i going to waste some things to match to work this yes why i'm not really sure but i did it so here we are and i got to keep it you know it's my little guardians first grand master weapon okay probably i locked it i like i can't delete it now we're good we're gonna take this root and toot and sucker into some pvp and see how it fares we've had a little more than more than our usual fear of pve so let's remember our roots absolutely feeding in the crucible let's get it the real question is is there any other way to do it you know the answer is no we're going into control a skitty oh come on a little bit of time out here my wife just brought me some brownies cooked it in the back of the ship i know what you're thinking wait there's room in that ship for one first off two people yeah and an oven yeah yeah there is so what did i say we let's go can we put pods on this thing oh my it's anomaly uh i don't care what anyone says man i got drip no i didn't get to finish my brownie it's okay these are things we sacrificed for the content but i'm not gonna sacrifice this out at palindrome now it's been a little while since i used or played pvp but it don't matter cause it's like riding a bike both of which i don't know how to do wait what did my grenade just refuse to work oh oh oh he do be hurting oh my okay this is a great start this is a fantastic start i see you with a stupid grenade i'm not gonna fall for that because i've fallen for it many times before and i'm all out of ammo so that's embarrassing i gotta say so far skirt this thing handles real nice okay actually a real big fan real big fan of this how is he already starting this health regen what the fudge what is all the what's all that what what huh how did he hurt me first before going through whatever that's okay this i'm not i can lie to you guys this just handles nice right out of the box factory new i know what you're talking about what do you what do you mean you added mods you uh you master but but i mean yes but the point is even if i hadn't it'd still feel nice this baby just knows how to purr okay well that's embarrassing oh hey look at that respawn any real well that deserves it by the brown don't worry guys it's um it's a cosmic brownie did not ruin your your immersion quick little um assist yep my favorite yeah what are we what are we doing panicking and stealing my kills two things which i don't appreciate cardinal sends as far as i'm concerned oh okay unrelenting i mean it started my health regen but like only a little bit what the fudge is the point of that huh hello and rolantine is a scam what is this crypto like come up nfts more so than crypto my favorite thing are people complaining about crypto coins and like i got scammed and then people are saying like what so what do you want you want to regulate it because because the whole point of crypto is unregulated and they're like huh anyway that's that's a pretty that's a is he still floating what's what the i what the fudge i have proximity grenades on this thing believe it or not hey it's broken forgot to check proximity apparently did you guys trade what a legend rushed in speaking of meme stomps look at that amc aimc to the moon baby actually oh my oh wait oh wow we merged them i don't want to serious because of my adapt palindrome but i mean look if the results speak for themselves mercy [Laughter] uh look at that combat efficiency ignore everyone above me i'm top of the team if you ignore everyone above me we're running it again you know what i'm also doing i'm running to the bank because i should probably wait a second am i playing a six stack ah whatever i'm not worried about it are gonna be some famous last words that aren't true i need to uh yeah probably cash out on my meme stonks um well actually i only have jimmy left but i never sold baby monkey hold banana ape stronker together what what is he is he talking about that oh gamestop start wasn't that like over a year ago yeah yeah it was but i am in solidarity with my eight brothers monkey oh what a lovely view what kind of a what is this it's a 140 okay 140 what 140 these nuts does not work that's not a joke that works sorry i'm also getting shot in the buttocks from my quote on quote friends that ricochet did not work however would have been pretty pog let's be honest with ourselves okay this is gonna hurt if he hurts if he yes well i reckon that's gonna hurt if it hurts yeah well said me hold on i'm pushing i'm pushing you got him now i'm here no okay i'm like max range hand cannon and freaking tickled that dude man what's that about yes it's so nice just to see you too what a ricochet it didn't work it did ricochet didn't move run run he didn't expect me to push right there i need to exp wait what 10 in the mag i don't remember shooting 10 and it's hard to believe i never reloaded because it's habitual for me i mean it's it's frankly it's a problem i've gone to rehab seen some people i can't break is call of duty hold on hold on i'm puckering it's hard to talk and pucker you know it's hard to keep two holes open at once oh what a flick thank you my friends royal sacrifice you set that up you won't be sung in the s what the fudge is this though hello what was that hey hey there's not there's not enough room here for the both of us no okay okay i mean that's fine that's fine what are we doing we emo peeking i feel terrible let's go come on you and me buddy where did he what what the what i see right on the radar but then i also don't see them perhaps i'm the problem oh that's a nice double grenades that's a kill excellent okay i'm not i'm not peeking i'm trying to redeem myself if this hunter do keeps running that's hey you want to say hi thank you i was like that's great but shoot them too more shooting them less shooting me yo tag team get in there watch out watch out watch out let's go i'm on a 10 kill spree ironically i've only killed about two of them that's cause i'm a team player baby assists going for the trip dub all right check it check it check it are you checking okay i i keep missing the second shot i get a nice do you know what what to be fair i did i got a new mouse recently you might like oh jesus the johns no i really oh my god what what that's that's not fair he can jump and then dart back that was frankly that was impressive the control he has over his body to contort himself and adjust his momentum like that i mean that's nothing short of a freak of nature and you know we should study him oh you i am quite possibly the worst human being to ever play this game because i'm not a human being i'm a bot i mean and they put me on the the lowest difficult i'm a terrible buy nobody nobody even wants to have me on their team they train against these kind of bosses these are training i know i just fight against these bot to feel better about myself look point being i i bought i i went the whole full night well long story short i was streaming the other day i might have spilled an unsponsored drink onto the keyboard um after i had just recently got my medical license it was my first patient on on the table and we lost him we lost him yeah first patient and first death i'm already being sued for malpractice understandably so frankly and uh so i i didn't have a backup so i had to get a new keyboard while i was out i got a brand new mouse pad and mouse and the mouse specifically is like 50 grams it's really light and i'm going from like a 20 pound mouse so it's like rock lee taking off his training weights except broccoli then doesn't even know how to control his body he's going too fast he's like jesus christ that's essential what's going on here i'll okay all right what is it turn off the aim hack bro somebody like look at my helmet did somebody let me stick a magnet on there and he's just like i swear to god he's just snapping through it okay all right here we go nice little sniper dude not this time oh wait what he is worm husk of penis yes it's a brand new exotic and of course that was that was the internal name i've got connection they obviously had to change that on release uh wormhusker penis turns out yeah that didn't fly with uh investors really but okay i i can't i'm sorry buddy i'm i told you i'm a bot i'm a bot but you're you're not so great work i also have a super so uh but i don't have the i don't have the i have the sun spot super come on yep yep you fell for it stupid [Music] i would normally blame defective equipment like the gun i'm using oh there's just there's too much going on what the fudge man oh get absolutely if there's one thing i ain't i ain't cold i'm always warmed up with it's my death noises baby the one thing i'm good at i learned from the best sir blesius himself of house harambe dicks out oh my god he's got a weather horde freaking i think what do these really have proximity grenades bro cause i'm starting to think i got sold some some fake news fake weapons fake perks it's all fake what that's absurd and it's absurd enough that they're probably right i can't wait guys i i want to help wait yeah approximately grenade whatever i don't care we're here for the i'll jump palindrome mr fruit for your grandmaster spoils i can get are you dude this guy does not miss a headshot i don't know if i should be mad if i should be impressed maybe a little bit of both what would that be encompressed imprang and pangary empree it's a lord what do i do there's no winning over here they tell me go over there i go over there over here what do they want from me here's johnny that's wow that was some why did why did i have so much was i doing 84 to the head that doesn't feel normal but i'm fine with that becoming the normal i i just i can't hit a thing okay well now i can hit a couple things there we go look that assist that's that's the headshot machine run he prints headshots you think you would need resources for that rob was right all along we can 3d print cool we can 3d print any resource out of thin air because he just he just prints headshots hey step aside step aside problem was come on me uh uh an objective player hilarious but no remember is what is this is are these six stacks i just don't it's not important what is important i'm reading here it says kill that that's an objective i can do the other one's objective cat capture flags and kill can't do that actually i didn't capture and i didn't kill maybe i just can't do anything maybe just maybe hear me out here uh you know the world marks works in mysterious ways perhaps i was burned with a quirk that only allows me to do the opposite of what i'm needed to do which frankly would make a lot of sense i'm i'm probably the best procrastinator out of there because i'm like hey you tell me to do something i'm like perfect i ain't you know it's like hey go to bed it's your bedtime perfect i'm staying up all night hey we we we need you to get kills i i'm going i'm goosing i i'm getting a kill hey we need you to do laundry hey well what if i just uh burn all the clothes after they smelled for so long just buy a completely new wardrobe huh that's what i'm saying so new objective get zero kills don't frag me don't stop now that is an objective i'm in for not killing let's get it step one don't get a kill right here step one grenade won't weaken somebody for me to then kill step one don't get a kill it's already going exceptionally frankly every everything hurts jesus yeah okay how did i not even oh my god i didn't even touch i'm out of here i'm out of here but i mean perfect uh don't kill i i didn't yo yo i got you i got you buddy i didn't kill don't worry he is merely taking a breather i i am i'm in dire straits friends i'm i can't sugarcoat this let's go i didn't kill anyone yes and i won't avenge you i didn't i i actually didn't i tr i'll be honest i tried there okay i didn't kill this this is i mean this is terrible this is terrible it's all it's all wrong everything's backwards everything's backwards everything's not awesome i'm the worst oh my god why do you watch my videos because they're so bad guys remember it's i'm saying opposite things why are you agreeing stop that from behind yeah oh my god my proximity mates did not do something they didn't do any i did not just catch them off spot oh and i did not i did not do it i did not hurt her i did have to reload that was okay i'm not feeling it mr krabs i'm just not gonna make a slip up here and everything is oh speaking of slip up no you don't no you don't which is rishi remember sound effects actually they might as well be banned they're like performance enhancing drugs you get tested for peds and you get tested for making sound effects because they're both just as effective what did i do they're they're not effective how many times we gotta go with this okay you guys have fun with that let me duh no thank you unless we hit him with the razzle dazzle i'm not doing it i'm not doing it i am not on a 10 kill streak this is not incredible oh come on now you guys are just teasing me you're being mean it just freaking angels the angels all right well it's a good thing i'm not killing them because otherwise i would be doing a terrible job yeah guys hey guys it's me all up in your above uh using the uh little red's assist uh get out play oh it's a little salty yeah yeah i am i am a little salty for no particular reason though because i'm trying to not get kills and it's going exceptionally well but you know we we we can change the objective on the fl i can't believe i didn't get that double kill wink wink you guys starting to pick up what i'm putting down here hopefully so because i can't put it down more anymore obviously oh my god if only i was able to get multi kills imagine what could happen if i if i could the possibilities the three taps but alas i'm so bad is this empowering rift it's a healing imagine that would have been cool and imagine this comey okay that was see opposite day that was obviously not in the name of kobe the palindrome adept is not nice with it let's not get it i'm starting to not get better at this opposite thing you're like oh my god i can't i can't keep track anymore good good yeah that's the idea not nice if only you survive i'm gonna be honest i'm starting to put more brain power into trying to say opposite things than frag because i'm not supposed i can't do this i popped that way too early but that's because i don't want kills with it zip [Music] one last one for the rest of our lives dang it i will take this though any good jolly horners outplayed outskilled out matched what's the opposite of the sheesh i know it's very confusing oh i'm so sorry i had to do you like that but sometimes you know it just do be like that all right now i'm hiding i never realized there was actually somewhere i could see right here this is this feels so dirty and i quite like it oh come on oh come on you ran right he's weak nice i'm gonna i'm gonna get suppressed uh what am i trying to do come on oh it's a good thing i didn't kill him because that that would have been terrible yeah yeah yes i told you guys tell me to do the opposite and i'm there wait what i was on top of the team to be fair though you guys got longer streaks okay but i was hanging with the big boys lots of um [Music] look at the damn i i didn't die much okay and that is also playing i i killed a lot i didn't die a lot yeah there were a couple people higher than me okay but i made them look good that's why i set them up for success which is just as important as the opposite wait what just as important as not setting them up for success well that that would be important but in a bad way that's not what i'm i don't i don't know anymore man well like if it were opposite day i would tell you that this thing does not slap get it guys because it's but it slaps okay it's sick reload speed was me but the actual like look at the range that the damage gonna be honest we these don't need i'm essentially running with no extra perks here if you really think about it that way so imagine if i had other things adapt palindrome is my baby don't say a word just hit that subscribe button thank you a lot come back to my other uploads please and thank you thoughts and prayers [Music] you
