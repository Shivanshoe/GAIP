hi eddie hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to spellbreak i did some videos on this way back in closed access but it's now an early release it's on pc the switch ps4 and xbox one it's cross play cross progression and i wanted to try it out with the boys so myself robin shark hopped into it and i gotta tell ya it's addicting it's super fun it's a battle royale except the twist is your mages you you fight with magic and spells obviously so i hope you all enjoy the video now i'm gonna say this okay i've played three games and since this launched with randoms i've won two out of the three games if we can't win it's gonna look real bad you know what i'm saying we'll have to see if i'm able to win some games with the boys but you know what does count as a win no matter what rage shadow legends i don't know about you but i grew up collecting pokemon it was my jam since then nothing has really scratched that itch for me until now with almost 500 champions to collect and upgrade endless artifacts to find and billions of different teams to try out rage shadow legends has years of content let's go ahead and open up some shards the thing about raid is that no matter if you get a good or bad champion they're still useful i received the infamous gaelic coincidentally the character i started raid with if we go over to reviews you can see that well everybody seems to rank him rather highly if they're good you can level them up and use them if they're bad you can sacrifice them in order to level up your good champions and appease the gods i made that last part out next up on the list we got an epic cineskull i probably said that wrong but i'm already in love with him or the king another epic knight errant i love the banner lords look at that arena offense rating i'm gonna be honest with you my favorite part of the game is just looking at all the champions in the game look at this lady i'd let her stab me with her spear anytime not only that but i am a sucker for pvp and within the last couple of weeks they've added a load of new updates they've just added champion fragments which lets you collect pieces of champions that you can use to summon specific awesome champions there's also a new bazaar where you can load up on high value items with the gold bars you win in tag arena and they just extended the daily login rewards up to 270 days that means you can get free champions for just logging in you can find me in-game under the name greatest raid player ever that one was taken though it's my mr fruit go to the video description and click on the special link if you're a new player you'll get a hundred thousand silver energy refill 10 mystery shards and a free champion slasher all this treasure will be waiting for you here slasher
