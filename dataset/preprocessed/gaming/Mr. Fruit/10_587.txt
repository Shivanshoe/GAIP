hi ad everyone my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny too and in today's video we'll be looking at another new iron banner weapon and this go-around it's an auto rifle and you know me I'm an auto rifle stand baby the forward path now I'm excited about this because we rolled a certain perk you got FC on the side arm and now we get to see how it is on the auto rifle yeah but Royce was really the Queen shot is and the hit marker is I know it's is but I just want to trigger some people Acura's rounds porch steadied back guru a robber don't actually do that it's not very kosher and iron grip which we saw on the sidearm massively improves weapons to build a that cost of reload speed so for giggles also throw in a counter balance stock I don't know how these played together I have no idea I would really just got this roll but it certainly has me excited I mean what do we have here one an auto rifle to a laser beam and you got some content we'll try our hand at some more iron banana and hope that this go-around fares way better than the last time you guys ever just wake up and want a belt come on I lean into the heavens nope just me okay oh come on if the cauldron now this is a throwback excuse me sir you're showing some wire it's too risky don't you know there are kids watching I'll take it just seems like some maps are in rotation or not sometimes I don't actually know how any of that works I should have just tested the fire oh wow hello enemy team alright yeah don't do that again anyway let's check this out I'm not gonna I'm not gonna control the recoil that's not too bad and the reload honestly isn't that bad now watch me control it and I'm barely pulling down the iron grip is Jeff okay he he got first shot that doesn't count I don't know if there are other perks that can roll aside from iron grip but like do I really care iein grip just kind of alright well I'm just getting pooped on ironically it's all from other auto rifles everyone else is just trying to complete the the quest for auto rifles and sidearms and uh where did you ah there you are you little rascal ye olde rascal ever since I can remember you've always been a rascal born a rascal always stayed one you never go back you hello I'll leave that now you know if they're not moving you just hit their head every single time it's insane and that armor off spot is pretty insane but you're still not gonna get me vindication I have no idea what that means oh I can get this kill I can get this assist I love assist oh my god give them all to me okay you know you know how I get sometimes and a skirt that's a kill there you are oh Jesus dude the linear actuators are severely underrated wait wait ah [ __ ] yeah see I go from using one iron banana weapon to the other a simple swap I'm a swinger if you will but with weapons oh you kidding me your your your lame little friend refuses to die doing its twenty20 who even like you even uses blink anymore you know what I'm saying sure though they're so weak and if you didn't have your little friend helping you out there what is this dude chunk of me with by the way what the fudge was that oh what a nade what a nade what it made what a nerd did you see that need another guy off spawn you love to see it okay well you have that recoil control Buster fruit you're insane how do you do it it's like wrasslin some Cowboys did you just try and handheld supernova me you little rascal so many Rascals on the enemy team just did just a faulty marasco's it's alright thankfully I've had a lot of dealings with Rascals before this is nothing new to me and they're pushing with supers I don't quite like it I have one shot with a rocket I'm gonna waste it on this guy who's a thank you for playing you won the lottery but unfortunate wasn't like that great lottery I don't know many people that would want to win this specific lottery wait had no one captured see this entire game is that what I'm is that what I'm picking up on Skoosh Skoosh wait what Skoosh wait what how are these people not dying oh that one dead Hyrule and then another kill wait you know what let's get let's go for another let's go maybe not got all these blinkin they're just they're going everywhere oh nice super bow should have paid attention to me Oh the hunt is on oh that's why right we're playing iron banana and you can you can lock it out and then the points reset ah yes of course video games I know I know I too am a gamer now I don't have accuracy while you're born so I don't really know why I okay we got a kill and now I hide yeah try and break my beer it's working then actually break my beer I'm a dip-dip dip-dip I don't want to fight dude do you up dip dip I'm a pacifist by Nature oh that's such a blatant lie I couldn't even keep it up for more than a second Yeah right mr. fruit you have violence you thirst for it alright well I don't know about Thursdays for its very strong word we are getting chased by a nova warp so I'm a judge well in the words of my own song dip dip Oh linear actuators dude almost helped me up there they're sick yeah but notice we had a little we had a little slow start but I'm Michael locomotive you know yeah it takes a little while for me to get going but once I have then there's practically no stopping me you know what I'm saying a first place on my team in the game actually little foot of a random nade well played I don't know what your true intentions were but I hope you open this door and you did unfortunately you out what the where did you come from you a little well oh my god I love you teammate pretty sure you just died for my for my cause though so thank you come on try me buffs try me yes thank you wait we're losing again ah fudge I mean to be fair I haven't kept like it I've kept like a zone or two okay sir I just so this is a win DS and I just spawned bike back flash I don't want to bite back I don't wanna fight back I just want to live can I do that oh nice Nova well it still got me rip what's the man got to do oh well we did pretty good and that means it's time for the rumble test we at least didn't get mercy ruled an iron banner and we had a solid performance ooh look at this shader though imma likin this Oh would you leave that it's retribution again we use the sidearm on this map and Rumble and one so can I use the auto rifle on this map in Rumble again some say man I feel like I only plan like two Maps you ever which is why I was like whoa that moon map which name I already forgot a child check chariot something what the fudge is a crucible I don't know oh my god what the WHA wait I'm actually detriment but he was like hiding you know I had to go in there and it's in it can I find anyone yeah oh there you are and what what are you using there you'll all react cool is that some sort of a good day is that the mountaintop probably is and I respect the Alton I don't respect it in fact it sickens me now was it your grenade launcher or breakfast I'm not really sure although it can't be breakfast because I'm fasting and I don't eat breakfast so I'm gay yep it's the doesn't settle very well on the old stomach you know what I mean that's actually what kills people it's not the massive payload being shot at your face it just doesn't just doesn't really agree with your digestive system what do you know it was the mountain tops so brave so bold how do you Gilly do these guys only fighting in the same spot every time and that's another grenade launcher we almost outgunned him okay wait okay I might be actually finding a gunfight here okay I got a kill he was coming in for that that shotgun I know it was and that's the yotan but not this time I said not you Jay I don't know I tried to say not today with geodon but that didn't really work that's a kill I'm weak they smell blood you're what you didn't hit my shield oh okay well I guess it doesn't matter I'm I'm weak I'm weak yeah let me reach in my hell let me read you my how oh Jesus I'm in first place you don't see Jesus I hate grenade launchers it's just like [ __ ] Tong and then switch to whatever else you have it's a super I mean it's a very viable strategy very effective either have two oh I ran right into that mister fruit don't sprint everywhere yeah rascal generally curious sound off in the section if you actually play Rumble and if you would consider yourself really oh my I'm gonna run right into this grenade launcher so stupid I mean yeah I was chasing like a BK but like a sub just ran away he didn't face his death oh my god and there is again I hate you and your grenade launchers but at least we got them this time this time God I can't finish anyone what is my heavy oh it's a rocket launcher yeah what the fudge that's a bit overkill I'd say and there's mr. Kurt and I'm out of ammo alright you know I was trying to say I feel like the only people that play Rumble are pretty sweaty most of the time I feel like there's not many Joe schmo's like casuals that play Rumble which is fine and I can understand it you know unless you're whoa yeah yotan love it almost as much as I love mountain top you have the fire rate on this thing is you're telling me okay I at least got one of those cuz you're telling you oh my god the best part too about them is you don't even need to aim just jump and hit the ground below them somewhere Chunkin four three fours and you just need to slap you're having the kill oh heavens oh I'll take that wait how did you just you want mate oh he's got the yotan not you okay alright he didn't kill me this time I have my super I kind of want to save it last minute over some of these use shadow shot it's pretty big for us I can't shut my down I can't oppress me hello people help wait okay I'm just gonna have come this guy real quick perfect and it's gonna be wait what that's spawn though were you at oh it's him it is him you're disgusting I don't have much time time is of the essence dude fudge I'm not I'm gonna get it kill it this stupid thing am i good wait what looks like they're like trading kills or something oh no we close we were close I did more damage so egad we were close to first my apologies I couldn't bring it together my apologies I just get salty when I play Rumble the forward path Oh gets a pass still of this iron grip tray that's it for me here and the booth thank everybody for watching coming out that reel is a fantastic day I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] [Music]
