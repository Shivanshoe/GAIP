hi they have everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and i have done it i've done the impossible okay it wasn't really that impossible also forgive me we have a apparently a dj hopping in on this session here fine dude i'm not i'm not recording anything you know it's like this whatever okay that was a terrible hawk impression that is yikes okay well i have the hawkman stalk thy prey and let loose thy talons upon the darkness that's right is back and better than ever actually debatable in fact i'd argue it's it's never going to be quite as good as it was before and they fixed that it's completely new in the fact that it doesn't just like it can't one shot essentially from destiny one you know what i'm saying well i mean it can't okay listen it's intrinsic trait paracausal shot final blows and precision hits with hawkmoon grant stacks of para causal charge the funnel around the magazine deals bonus damage based on the number of stacks stowing hawkman on the final round removes this bonus so hub it's not like luck in the chamber and all that stuff i had before where it could like get three bonus damage shots in one shot that's it just can't do that anymore now if you did you know stacking a pair of causal shots and headshot somebody in pvp you probably could one shot them i i don't know but they still wanted to bring back the random factor which is why it now has transformative future drops of this weapon will have random roles this is the only exotic that has such a thing and that's kind of to be in the same spirit of the randomness the hawkmoon used to have well now you can get random traits of course the the intrinsic trait won't change but you got questions whatever who cares it's the hawkman and it has new ornaments leave that thing on ocean wings that looks dope and then feeling lucky uh it's yeah it exists uh this one's dope though but we're gonna hop into a crucible match with a default hawkmoon first and see just how it stacks up to its previous counterpart spoilers i don't think it's going to be as cool now that's just rude mr fruit you haven't used this how do you know it wouldn't be as cool well because it doesn't have the same perks i will say though if it still makes like distant hawk noises every now and then then i take it all back and i'll forget bungie it's fantastic i'm back with the hot glows the italians okay great we got one stack of parochial charge this is nuts this is huge this is huge and it's knots huge nuts yep no regrets there paracausal charge times two that was a kill good it's all coming together i have five more shots all i need to make sure is that the last shot five okay so we had like four or five stacks and it did 127 damage now i don't it so i don't know if that was a headshot i don't think i had a headshot if it was a headshot with like five stacks over that is well quite frankly that's pretty disappointing so i'm just gonna choose to believe that that's not the case oh look at it look at it and all of its d1 glory isn't it great okay now we swap it up wow yeah it's like ooh looking around oh yeah it's got like things on it cool i have a way with words i know you wouldn't be the first one to tell me i don't like how that shoots this one has a more traditional look i'm gonna be honest i guess you can't really tell many of the differences when um when using it but that's you know that's not important it's still cool nonetheless could have gone with them like the wild styles with the ornaments i wish the ornaments would take a little bit more creative freedom you know kind of get gonna get crazy with it you know like crazy effects on it okay okay para causal charge times five give me a head shot i need to hit a head shot give me a second give me a second i need to line this up this needs to be perfect for that what oh hello there fudge god wait what who did i just kill what just how did i i wanted to go flying what happened hey hey calm down calm down okay two charges not great but not terrible they're they're charged ah fudge i'm dead man imagine getting to actually proc the exotic perk couldn't be me you know nope could not be me ah god everything hurts wait don't reload don't reload oh i swapped though fudge well there goes all their charges screw me yo where's the super guy oh well i'll get destroyed get the story get destroyed who's next who's next uh i actually have no idea what that oh my god oh my god what am i doing right now which fight am i doing oh this is going terribly i am actually the worst everybody said it in the comment section for years but i never believed them but now i see they were right god okay so that was like four stacks or something and it did 85 body damage and it didn't show yellow numbers so now i know that when we did hit it with those charges before that actually was headshot damage uh which does not bode well i know people be like but like how often is that gonna happen you know it's gotta feel exotic somehow right like i don't know what does this do anything good like is is the dps actually meaningful oh i had to reload on the worst and in pve like is that extra damage actually gonna do something or so i just you know i have a lot of questions oh no mercy rule i need to use my charges i need to use my charges somebody let me let thy talons lose sir whatever okay come on come on come on no no no no i i just need to shoot somebody i just need to shoot some i hate my life well killing it out there mr fruit you got to uh what use the pair of causal shot like twice sick dude i'm telling you it's this ulster man it's not fair okay it hurts it's different may the best talk moon user win so if i'm the only one here uh easy i already went it wouldn't surprise me though if a lot of the people here are currently on the step although i feel like most sane people just killed champions honestly is probably easier and quicker but like that just that's just not as fun you know i'd still rather pl bro it it it hits different i'm not kidding you it shoots differently it feels different like i i can't really put in the words why that is but just trust me it is okay we have four charges we might hit five and then we'll have our para console shot so let me see what i'm cooking up here oh god give me time and he's using a hawk moon if you think i'm sexy and you want my body oh you were you were mine you were mine kid all right that's three nice nice nice noise noise okay oh wait how much damage does that do i'm gonna be honest i didn't see fudge that was the pericardial shot yeah okay oh my god what i do it's the i'm sorry but the ornament you gotta go it's not working it's not working we're going naked we're going back to naked it feels like it shoots different i can't explain it and maybe there's nothing really to it but with the way the sights look in the other it hits different bro just like this ulster man it's even worse than yesterday's video looks so talented i bet you've won all the talent shows in elementary school middle school and even high school huh i bet i bet i hate everything see man if i was this was d1 i'd just be like whoops accidentally one shot somebody you know that would be funny but instead i'm nervous when i get down to one shot because i'm like if i don't hit this then this gun is literally it has it doesn't do anything i wasted some of my bullets it's very important for my pair of causal i can't be doing that okay that's two charges wait that's dude that's bad that's big i'm going i'm gonna get i'm i'm procking pero causal this time baby i'm starting to become a little less confident i'm gonna be real with you all oh my dude what is my what is my [Music] i'm in my head you know i'm in my head right now i gotta get out i gotta get up trust me my brains oh my god that is horrible timing wow oh my god but somehow i didn't it said i was frozen but then like i wasn't limo skirt okay okay all right well at least i know how to throw some flame right now for me baby remember the good old days we used to call all the time oh my god i'm i'm just the worst okay that was 91 damage that was i i think two stacks not entirely sure okay that's three where are the other guys no don't sweat oh my god and then as soon as i start reloading accidentally i go to switch weapons to stop the reload but then i lose my stacks ah i'm a mess right now i i like literally can't even right now existence is pain my friends take it from me you know we've always i felt like we've always been at a flag deficit and yet somehow you know what i'll i'll help look at me look at me team because god knows i can't shoot so at this point if i'm i'm not taking the objectives well quite frankly i'm not assisting the team in any way possible because i suck that's right i just say that to fire myself up and i'm like wait a second i don't suck i'm the best ow and then i'm like wait no i really i'm just lying to myself aren't i come on mr fruit how'd you hear that i actually slapped myself but i slipped and i slapped where my ulcer is oh okay well at least the hawkman can't hurt hurt me more than that did you know gotta look at the positives i hurt myself so that the hawkman didn't have to i didn't even check what rpm is this thing i don't know is it the same as it was before because i'll be honest i also don't remember what that was okay that gets okay oh you're so weak come back here god gotcha don't fall off okay all right i got three charges i got two shots so headshot gives me four and then i can proc it it's in the perfect world let's see i missed okay let's get start 102 let's go three stacks 102 damage we take those we take those we take those oh hold up 178 damage how many stacks did i have that time because that's um well that was way better than i thought hold up and i think i missed one stack so if i had had the other one i could have very well actually oh my god i'm only spawn camping kids i ca but i can't hit a thing nice grenade me do this oh my god clutch save myself watch this he's going to chase me oh my god oh my god i can't be stopped right now i'm on a chair no you let it be known it took two full games but at one point i finally realized what the hawkman is capable of so i take it back if you have all max stacks before your final shot i think you might just be able to one shot somebody god that was the para causal shot of all the ones to miss like just just not the last shot man it's not the last shot we lost okay but i think i won because i landed that one shot and i got to see that wait a second not all despair in this world then i'm reminded very quickly how much my ulcer hurts whoa let loose thy talents mission now available whoa guys i can get the hawk room maybe i should do that my sweet sweet prince i loved you dearly in d1 in fact i taunted xbox players of many when they didn't have it but we did and now we all have it in d2 is everything just slowly being brought back from d1 we're not gonna but that's not the point it's good to have you back although you're not the same self you're not quite as fun because what was fun was the randomness however i don't know maybe um i really can't see you being useful in pve though to take up an exotic slot uh maybe i'm wrong i'd like to be wrong one day i'll get a one shot in pvp that'll be cool it'll be very rare it's okay it's definitely not as lp as it was before the hawkmoon ladies and gentlemen [Music] you
