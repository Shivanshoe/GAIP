heidi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to sn snickers snakers i don't really know um you can decide how you want to pronounce it it's a really cool interesting basic but complicated game that i think some of you will enjoy feels a little niche personally for me checks a lot of my boxes so i can't wait to show it to you all let's get into it the music is very interesting it's like royalty free early 2000's rock strange anyway i think this is the best place to put my face i know maybe you all don't want to see my face well too bad for you but here's how it works in fact it has a little bit of a guide so here's the premise you control snake in multiple heroes that auto attack nearby enemies thus auto battler i can steer the snake and like an auto battler or an auto chess any of those if you've played them combining heroes levels them up so get three levels ones turn to two level two get three level twos it turns into a level three each time they level up their stats increase and if you get to level three they unlock a new effect as you can see here the swordsman unlocks the level effect cleave each hero is also a part of some kind of class or origin or whatever you want to call it so for instance warrior if i own three of them i'd get 25 defense to allied warriors if i owned six of them 50 percent defense valid warriors or plus 50 whatever and then you gain interest per gold you have up to a maximum of five which means saving over 25 gold doesn't yield any extra interest like an auto battle if you've kind of played one so we have three gold i'm probably gonna buy everybody we're gonna get the vagrant who is a psycher ranger warrior a lot of things going on here shoots a projectile that deals damage so if i buy one and then i buy another you see it stacks so we currently have one in the party but there's one waiting to combine and then i'll buy the miner who's a part of the mercenary class picking up gold releases four homing projectiles that each deal 10 damage because the mercenary class if i get another one enemies have a chance to drop gold on death so the miner actually doesn't i don't think he does any damage because i'm not gonna be picking up any gold so interesting anyway that's how we're gonna start this off level one out of twenty five i played the fudge turn that way the heck down okay so here all it is so this is the interesting part right it's a little snake it's very minimalistic there are the enemies and here i am and you can see the person in front is attacking that's our cleric or whatever it was the minor is absolutely useless go figure like i said we're not picking up gold so they all just attack on their own you have to figure out which what each one does and then you know work around it but perfect wave one done wave two and then there are different kind of enemies as you go along it gets harder like i said i played one round to just see if i like the game and it was a blast and i think i got to round 22 before i got absolutely pooped on and honestly getting that far seemed like a bit of a miracle so i'm gonna kind of kamikaze here yeah screw it it's gonna do some damage just get this over with arena clear obviously it's about as easy as it gets we get two gold now i can choose to pick up any of these we could get a swordsman add to our warrior or dual gunner which would add to our ranger class none of those unlocks anything for us but it can be bad this shoots two parallel projectiles each dealing damage and deals 11 damage in an area deals extra damage per unit hit um i don't know we can kind of decide what class we might want to go like do we want to go for like six warriors or maybe six rangers um that kind of sounds fun screw it we'll get a dueled gunner oh and i just realized you can actually change the position of your party oh that's fun so i'm going to put the miner in the front because if i'm going to ram people at least that way he can do something we're out of gold so we continue full off the farther you go and obviously the more interest you have the more gold you'll be getting um okay i i'm stupid i did the completely wrong order i put the miner in the back heard it er but i think we're fine we're just gonna ram so there's a green fella some of these now if they hit a certain thresh health threshold as you'll see they start to change colors which means they briefly speed up for a little while arena clear like i said early levels are easy if we were having trouble i would be sad frankly all right we're gonna get another miner just in case we find a mercenary here soon we could get a cleric to try we don't even have healers though no screw that could get a scout and work our way to a rogue why not let's put the miner at the front of the party now that i understand how this works rogue will go in the middle and you know vagrant will be at the back perfect we don't have any level three hard oh we don't have any class synergies yet but we'll work in there so here we go dilly dilly i'm gonna ramp blah blah now they're so fast it's a terrible idea especially since i have no healer um and the later the stage is like hitting one ramming like that oh they're so fast will just spell immediate death you'll just start getting one shot and everything it kind of gets crazy and it's ironic because like you can build a maximum of seven people per train which you'd be like all right well i need seven right to make it as powerful as possible and it's true but it also means it's harder to control and and make sure your snake is staying out of danger because the more people you have the more likely it's all going to fall apart heading against the wall too will uh ricochet you sometimes it's a good thing sometimes it's a bad thing but now we get a bonus so i could increase knockback force extra critter health i'm assuming that's for some specific synergy which we don't have or extra damage to all allies whenever an enchanter is hit i don't know if we have any of those i don't know what i'm doing at all what am i doing plus five damage all allies whenever in the chain maybe i can do plus two critter health sure now what are these critters um do we see knock back force to all allies oh well that would have been a good idea defense to do i have anything what is um ooh we get an assassin that gives us three rogue right which means rogues have a 50 chance to crit dealing four times damage ooh like that um i don't have enough gold for you i think we'll just hold off although we're using everybody but the miner i'm really hoping we find a mercenary here gonna go gamba um but i wish there was a way to view all the classes so i could figure out what this critter thing is i'm assuming there's like summoner or something like that i don't know i guess we'll find out later for now our rogues will carry us hopefully there are rarity of heroes as well as your shop slowly levels up with each round you can also pay to level it up there's four tiers so like tier one tier two tier three tier four obviously the higher tier usually the better or more unique thing the uh the i don't even know like the warrior but the part of the snake i don't know what i would call them arena clear okay get absolutely pooped on like i said early on it's easy but trust me it ramps oh i think we can level up our vagrant but uh so i think that doubles their damage so now it shoots production out of deals 26.4 which before it was 13.2 if i'm not mistaken then if we go again he would then get the effect of champion extra damage and attack speed per active set so that would be pretty cool uh we're at five gold though so i'm actually just gonna get wait let me okay yeah that's not a summoner thing okay so i'm still just gonna wait to figure out this critter thing um maybe that's just we completely wasted our first passive and those are very important and rare those are like your really big power spikes okay see this white thing in the distance i hate it if you're too far just shoots a big old volley actually if you get too close it'll just charge you and it hurts believe me but this dual gunner right now this rogue too okay kind of raw let's go this miner is still absolutely useless purely there for sure we're gonna ram i'm screwed screw it last one oh we lost somebody we lost the miner though okay see that's fine forget about him we don't need a man arena clear let's get it see the blue one there like explodes on death oh i can level up the miner how fun uh he now does more damage but still negative there are no damage because we still can't pick up gold where are these mercenaries so i could spend xp to get to the next level and the percentage of what we can find will get better but we're at nine gold i am tempted to sell somebody but i shouldn't we're pretty solid so i'll just i'll buy another vagrant whatever we're not gonna hit the um you know what i'm talking about income passive income anyway so i'm also just gonna throw in a magician i can sell him for the same amount of gold later but this way we have one more dude fighting for us you know one more blob circle oh we gotta kill the elite so that's the elite so this level will go on practically practically forever unless we kill him and we did i kamikazed for it arena clear see the first time i did that i was like this level never ends and then i realize it's because i never killed yeah all enemies take extra damage not bad damage to rangers and rogues we have both of those rotating around yourself to the left grants 25 defense to all units well these are both pretty let's go just extra damage because i want to go this critter build this is cool and we could do rangers and rogues but i'm all in on this stupid critter idea whether or not it pans out is to be seen but look at that we now have three rangers okay well screw me never mind we have a ranger and rogue maybe i should have just gone with that said script um we have another vagrant we could get voider damage over time to allied voters okay we'll get rid of the mage then and then this activates voider because the assassin is also voider sure nearby enemies take damage per second okay yeah sure why not let's go go forth can't believe we haven't seen one dude that summons but you can see here this is who we just bought the crime ants whatever so only going to do damage to people that are in the blue circle so it's kind of dicey you got to get a little close but what i noticed when i played earlier is like if we get them to level two like the width of that doubles making it a lot easier so sometimes it's not really worth it to try and damage until you get that level up because you usually have to get so close that it could just you know wind up biting you in the butt but who cares we're pooping the rogue ranger combo is wrong give me that interest okay okay i found another mercenary oh my god tier four though what are the odds of that five percent okay what what are you source for enforcer oh great i don't have any of that sick uh no thanks okay i'm gonna buy the merchant but that means i have to get rid of somebody and they're all kind of playing a part he's only playing the part for ranger though um sorcerer gives us void but honestly i don't think that's that big of a deal so instead we're gonna grab the merchant pog now enemies may drop gold and what does mercenary do gain plus one interest for every 10 gold that's so strange so like none of them are there for it's really gamba they're not going to help you combat wise it's just greedy you know i'm kind of down we could get a better ranger like this is super default archer chad barrager i think so what does he do shoots a bras of three arrows each dealing damage and pushing enemies fantastic let's do it we've all hit max income so that's fine now let's just hope um yeah we can find some gold on the ground this is fine i've never used these guys before so far absolutely no gold but it's a 10 chance so i think statistically we should have seen one gold any second though one gold one gold in the second now oh i see a gold oh it's super tiny oh i got one that is the first and only shot our miner has has done and it did like negative damage so that's that's pretty cool okay oh i found a coin though i don't know why they're so hard to they couldn't make them a little bit bigger couldn't even tell for the longest time that there was gold well we got two extra gold i think so huge oh corrupter sage bro swarmer we found one plus hits to critters oh my god this is incredible okay who do we replace though oh my god we got 40 gold holy jesus merchants kind of popping off here what the punch it's currently giving us plus oh what is this your first item reroll is always free dang i don't want to say farewell you're giving us our rogue bonus too you're giving us ranger bonus to screw you get the corrupter gives us ranger and then i need to work on swimmer so was a spawns three small critters if the corrupter kills an enemy we just need to find other swarmers this is great we're gonna put you like right in the middle i want you to survive now let's just go ahead i went ahead and just leveled up our shop to three not gonna buy anything we're at max income passive income aside from the addition to our with our merchant or whatever but overall very nice and i don't think our swarmer has oh they were oh look at him oh they're so cute yes swarm them kill them grab the gold pug everything hurts oh jesus oh get away see suddenly it's already getting pretty dicey i see gold over there i'm a simple man i see gold i take gold go my swarmers yes and it looks like they'll stay on the field until they actually get their headsets and that's nice they'll always be useful oh we're getting machine gun oh jesus retreat retreat oh we lost somebody go my swarmer who'd we lose i don't know but not one of our gold people which is unfortunate i actually think we lost her swarmer oh jesus not oh god we gotta fudge we gotta take out the white guys no wait what we're about to lose oh my god this is embarrassing grab the gold wow that okay i might need to get some actual units now what is this extra aoe damage hitting walls has a 34 chance of releasing two projectiles all warriors i don't have any warriors let's just go wall echo sure 45 gold that's a lot of gold no swarmers but that's okay i think i got to get rid of the miners i'm going to be honest yeah i'm just gonna get rid of those guys i'm sorry for now i could get for sure i'll just buy him whatever we don't need them all right gamba we could get oh we already have you duh i'll just get the archer to fill possibly six rangers uh we don't want any of you we don't want any of you sage i already have one oh you're a nuker for sure right i don't think i'm gonna keep you but we got a scout which i do have and a dual gunner not even level that this is going terribly where are the everything where is the everything i might get rid of the the rogues here what does saboteur do cause two saboteurs to seek targets and deal um well what else could i sell get rid of you okay all right we leveled up the dual gunner oh we could almost get six rogue wait a second maybe i ditched the archers rogue voider nuker for sure ranger for sure nuke okay sage you're out let's get the spellblade um god where are the swarmers man you gotta be kidding me i'm i'm throwing is this a joke oh we found one oh my god this is incredible okay who do i get rid of uh oh my god wait he's rogue two we get hit six rogue two swarmer okay so who's not rogue or swarmer you your ranger for sure get out of here pog okay six rogue two swarmer okay let's put you guys in the middle shoots projectiles throws a knife there's a knife throws piercing everybody's throwing knives i love it spawn two small critters of the beastmaster crits oh shoot let's not put you in the media back okay that was everything i had so i don't know if this is a good build i don't know but that's the fun of it you know experimenting we're going the classic swarmer rogue you guys don't know it it's great look at all my little swarmers go oh my god there's so many of them they're gonna start popping off oh my god we're gonna be unkillable oh my god look at this oh this is incredible oh don't i have wall mounts too isn't that what i got oh fudge oh my god wait why are we dying arena clear of course yes cyber tour oh this is going to level him up [Music] okay i think we sit on the rest of our gold for now we just can't get hit is the problem yeah we do have wall echo um we're just so squishy because the team i had it was all sorcerers and healers we have no form of sustain like any damage we take is that's it you know sorcerers were kind of p they just had like tons of aoe damage and stuff okay i don't like what what's going on there we go projectiles projectiles projectiles whack whack whack whack just keep hitting the wall keep hitting the wall whack whack this is ingenious boost okay i don't know where this damage is coming from but you guys are doing great and the lord said let them crit and so they did look at all my little swarmers i don't have to do anything go be free arena clear okay and if you didn't notice down bottom left it shows you all like the health and stuff spellblade all right we have max gold um hunter would give us extra bonuses but here's the thing you can only have a party of seven and literally we have six for rogue like if we take one out we lose our bonuses so i don't like it to see the 30 chance to crit two on the swarmer is big brain because where is he yeah if he crits he spawns critters so is the odds of him quitting are high i know this build is just i'll kill the elite oh you're so done for stupid so done go my critters absolutely destroy this pleb if we're glass cannons yes all right we just gotta finish this last wave see we can't sustain any damage but we can dish it baby what do we got when enemies hit walls they take damage according to knockback force i don't have any of that extra damage defense and attack speed to all allies with at least one enchanter i don't think i have that 25 aoe damage i don't think i have a choice do i have an enchanter i don't know i guess extra aoe damage let me check do it no we don't have any enchanters okay scout level up you now do 26 damage with your things so that's cool i could level up the shop yeah why not now we're level four might as well re-roll ooh another corrupter a level two corrupter i mean he's currently spawning three small critics would he spawn like six and then if we got in level three spawn three small critters if the corrupter hits an enemy oh wow holy heckers okay let's hope we can get somebody to a tier three it's obviously not easy but i'll keep saving my gold and if we can keep going further and further we should be i.e i think honestly i don't know all their attack range some of them need to be kind of close but as long as i keep my distance and spawn a few critters really they uh they kind of make my job really easy but see it's nice too because like it's an auto battle but you still have some autonomy but overall i i don't know it's just really nice relaxing has all the parts of all the battles i like which is like you know cheering up people getting traits uh and synergies combining them to get even better ones i gotta kill those white ones i don't know why he's exploding is that a bomb one i don't know boom cleared next the assassin doesn't level him up but that's okay so we could go for the next shop which would give us 50 tier 4. holy hackers but for now let's reroll because we have quite a few yeah that um did that just level him up no where's beastmaster no it did not level him up i need if we got four swarmer but then we lose a rogue i don't know it's a tough call let's i'm just looking out for oh what is this post periodically spawn one small critter oh my god you just it's just always and you get extra hits to critters but we lose the crit so i don't know it's tough we [Music] we could sell some rogues and then get some other synergies but what would some of those even be [Music] i feel like the crit right now is kind of worth it that's tough because what plus two critter health you know plus three hits critters would just be whacking all the time and it means we have even more critters i think i'm going to do it so which rogue do i want to get rid of dual gunner it's doing some decent damage um this does dot but i think i'm going to get rid of you sorry friend so we'll throw in a host level two corrupter spawns three small critters if the corrupter okay so he doesn't spawn more but he's gonna do more damage which means he has a higher chance of activating it um so then i need to figure out two if we get four swarmer what's another trait we want to go for it would help if i knew what the what the other swarmer was gonna roll down a little bit all right i'm gonna stop unlucky all right let's just hope we get the uh fourth swarmer next turn because we're actually now a lot weaker losing out on all the rogue damage but look at all the craters see and then if we make it better we're literally just going to let the critters do everything for us screw it look at that they're literally a critter's shield too they can't get past them this is incredible this isn't crazy no i need to start whacking the walmart on my projectiles bonk bonk bonk go through my critter shield bonk ah get off me we lost somebody it was a good one but get him critters you'll stand no you stand no chance i'm gonna clear okay give me that fourth swarmer baby uh it's a host again i got really excited what's this summon damage and duration who's our current conjurer saboteur i guess i could get rid of you you're not really giving us much to work with are you or maybe the mage rogue you're not doing much are you all right yeah i'll get rid of you for now i know i had an assassin just by you until i find something better um the blade throws multiple blades of deal damage sure just by you for now was the nuclear area damage and size to allied nukers so who could we get rid of your ranger rogue i'm gonna get rid of you we'll have nuker bonus for now all right give me okay beastmaster is now stronger oh we found it the investor curses eight nearby enemies for six seconds they're all these two critters on death yes so who am i getting rid of i guess i gotta get rid of our nuker bonus now do i wanna get rid of the nuker yeah because the rogue what are you right now you're a swarmer i gotta keep you i'm gonna keep the the nuker bonus because or uh sorry the rogue bonus because of the crit so i'm gonna get rid of rogue conjuring nuker warrior nuker i have to keep you because you're rogue yeah so get rid of you boom we got omega critters we got the rogue bonus and then i'll hold on to our gold well because let's see swarm so your tier four tier two tier three tier three oh actually current shop level gives us the best chance of finding tier three so maybe i should use all my gold on this one to try and i'll roll some more next time to try and get our best odds of three star one of them whoa look at this thing i think this is the curse thing ow ow ow go my swarm curse them all it's hard to tell when he's going to curse him oh what the fudge i think that was it [Music] look at all of them go do my bidding oh my god there's so many of them yes yes swarmed them all i'm just gonna stay in the middle of them like what are they gonna do you are my shield coal my i think i i think i broke it i think i broke the game projectiles deal 100 damage up close and down to 50 damage far away [Music] extra curse duration repeatedly deal damage to all enemies based on how many majors or sorcerers we don't have any of those so i guess i'll go with curse duration we only have one of those but why not uh let's start rerolling i think this is the team oh pog we're gonna get a second host periodically spawn one small critter still the same so they don't gain bonuses they just gain bonus damage and health but if we get level three they all get yeah look at this 100 critter spawn rate so doubles the time he spawns them and he spawns two instead we need those there's another host speak of the devil there's another saboteur i guess i'm just rolling down okay fudge man our luck is butts though i want a level three man it could be the game changer if if we don't make it far enough i think it's probably gonna because we didn't get a tier three i'm not saying it's gonna be the only reason but i think that would make a huge difference the power spike with a level three is actually nuts oh to spawn right on top of us keep swarming them stay vigilant oh they have their own swarmers now that's not fair the fudge no but we're pooping on them my swarm fight their swarm yeah their swarms are little purple dudes those are not as great as ours you stand no chance hope they destroyed before they could even really spawn oh run away all right i need to run to there we go oh we're not done yet yes we are well even losing a couple we're fine [Music] oh another host another scout that's not a big deal all right that's it i should prob i feel like maybe like maybe the investor should go in the middle i'm trying to think of best way to position him well he kind of needs to be on the end because of his aoe nearby enemies take damage periodically spawn you need to need to be in the middle we need you to crit so i'll put you up in the front you call saboteurs whatever spawn three critters throws a knife okay i think that's good still no luck on our units i might just save all of our gold until the very last round before shop levels again uh and then just pray we find something just trying to spawn projectiles off the wall punk bunk bunk bunk bunk bunk punk bunk bunk that's right spawn the critters [Music] see i need to get closer though to curse more people otherwise we're not getting nearly as many critters there we go and if we leveled him up he'd probably curse more often that'd be big i'd like that come on then last wave easiest game of my life you can't beat the craters dude [Music] another scout not that important okay we'll save up we got a couple more rounds before we'll hit five so i just have to okay it's an elite level i just have to hope we survive i just need to swarm him as fast as possible and do as much damage to him as we can okay he literally won shots if it touches oh sweet moses oh oh oh this is not good they have too many critters of their own go my critters oh no i i can't tell who's dying but i'm sure they're all rather important i can't even get to the i can't get to the elite get off me no yes get him critters come on oh he's so weak we're so close all my critters are heroes they're in the back line they got him let's go we lost somebody though oh god all their critters run our critters are better than yours okay that was a little dicey that was a little nice we lost a lot of good soldiers there arrows fired by no attacks by mages nukers or voters enemy spawn with less health perfect i'll take it we have a lot of gold okay so i just have to roll down to 25 every time come on okay a pirate but that's not that's something we have but okay i'm sure i'll take a level two there we go okay one more or three more rather hosts and we'll get a level three um so we upped pyromancer though that's fun i think his aoe should get bigger or maybe not kind of looks the same i guess he just does more damage give it away give it away give it away now back it away back it away get away from me continue to curse them all good yeah see if we get a big curse that's what i'm talking about oh yeah oh yeah they just like replenish all of my critters it's fantastic oh my god there's so many ah but we ran into one so that's what i'm saying if we just touch one now it's one shot not even a chance oh jesus [Music] no they're gonna spawn on us fudge it's starting to get a little too wild a little too frisky for me all right we're still going though let's keep it going baby i don't have any of those and then faster pog wouldn't mind the level up then okay corrupter nice pyro not bad we're not even close to level three though man and we're at level 20. oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know how much longer i'm gonna survive i need all the critters all of them give them all to me we don't have a chance i have to get close enough so we can curse them all these yellow ones don't die oh oh oh oh oh oh oh sheep if we can keep most of our people alive though i'm feeling pretty good yeah give us those critters perfect our critters are so ready oh my god pooped on okay this is manageable oof kamikazes watch for the comet causers oh but my shield wall of critters said nay nay you shall not get through here oh my god get absolutely pooped on go my critters didn't have a chance oh my god this is it i'm feeling it uh level 21 hard i'm not ready firemancer still not what i'm looking for punch me okay we got two two pyromancers but that i'm finna just roll it down another pyro another beastmaster another saboteur yeah i don't know if i can make it without the level threes come on oranges praise be to thee now give me what i need it's not a one-way relationship i don't know what you're talking about it's not a give and take it's a give and give you just keep hitting wall more tongue punk punk but see the problem about hovering around these walls exponentially increases the chances that we are next to the people that spawn oh no oh no oh what oh jesus it's the kamikaze um we're down to three and it's barely half oh jesus these swarmers need to come in huge we we can't spawn enough oh we're boned oh we're so boned oh jesus the the no it's the kamikazes bro no no fudge who's left you're so slow there's no way there's absolutely no way run away friend i'm telling you i think that's where i died last time it gets insane ah why couldn't we find the level three ah you know what's funny though i'm immediately like we go again because honestly i've only really seen two builds the first one i did sorceress that one i did swarmers and you just keep going from there it's so it's so simple and yet so addicting and at first glance you're like what the fudge what is this this is stupid but then you like play and you understand you're like wait it's much more nuanced than it might look and it's freaking addicting so let me know if you guys want to see some more with that said thank you very much for watching happy super fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
