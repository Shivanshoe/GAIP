today well ironically it certainly was not according to bungie's script hi oh because we're doing a 12-man raid if you didn't know there's been a pretty big bug exploit whatever you want to call it where you can do 12 people in like literally any activity nightfall 12 people raid 12 people other other things 12 people and so i figured right before it got patched or fixed or whatever i was like i gotta try with myself i want to do it with some of my boys and girls so that's exactly what we did did that with them and my clan which if you're curious we have some open spots there'll be a link down in the description box below uh somehow go to our discord it's super dope uh really cool people they've they're very helpful very helpful gonna make like a whole twitter and stuff house fruit's gonna blossom okay we're reviving the destiny clan and on top of that the clan's doing like some tournaments we have a 3v3 tourney coming up inside the clan that'll be fun that uh you can also look information and stuff will be down below but the main part is enjoy the 12-minute raid oh we're actually loading in oh oh [ __ ] okay i have to ask uh-huh has anyone here actually done 12 main ring yeah this is actually my first one this is never actually been around for for uh when groups are forming this is this needs to go down in history i am doing a first in destiny at the same time dad always that's big hell yeah that's great it's beautiful i heard a noise i heard a noise we hear the music yo wait hold on arnold before you go does someone in your group can they be a divinity [ __ ] for us no i'll be divinity [ __ ] don't worry thank you wait really yeah because otherwise i'm not useful so i didn't see you as a boss that works too you have the lament no i don't oh my gosh you don't have the lament mr fruit that's pretty lament if i say so much oh no i meant to get it but this is how it goes when i day one raid and we don't do it i get frustrated and that means i'm not playing destiny for like two months okay poop a little bit so i was like level 72 you have played well this season yeah i know but i haven't bothered to do all that because like blue was like oh just use cloud strike i was like don't have it he's like oh just yeah also i didn't realize we could just yeah you can sparrow this yeah this is part this is a bearish sparrows don't mind my boat dude the the the lore stuff related to it's actually super dope okay so if you guys need the glitch uh just no i [Music] i will say i am the one that figured out this bye mr fruit i did figure out this encounter from my group through we're gonna hop on the pike over here and jump off on the other side okay okay but you have to hammer inside the fire auditioning for uh datto's day one rate group uh and scene what the i would like to get isaac tomorrow just because then people will be upset at me let's see how many people that would be content that would be kind of that would definitely be mr fruit pisses off his entire fan base in 20 seconds i also don't have it so yeah let's go i think the odds of one person getting it are with 12 somewhat well i just know it's like i'm on my like 70th clear and people be like i'm 200 clears in and the fact that he got it pisses me off if it makes do you feel any better i got mine on my second view i'm lost i will say i have a few clears since day
