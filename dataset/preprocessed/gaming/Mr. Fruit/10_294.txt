hi eddie hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the last spell you guys that watched it seemed to really enjoy the last one almost as much as i did and i wanted to make another one so we're doing it and we might even continue it depends on how well uh in game this goes and uh where i think we can take it yeah so you're like okay that's great and all why do you have a cobra around your head it's actually a migraine i don't know like a headband thing i don't know what it's called but claire got it for me it's great because uh as some of you know uh well kind of a headache and i also get hot and nauseous a lot so you're like well then just don't record just wait well you see the problem is that's my life it's practically all the time so i have to push through so it's uh like all these frozen little packs around here and it like compresses and if i have a migraine i can put it over and cover my it's fantastic i love it so we're gonna put it on until i can kind of cool down so you know you never know what you're gonna get with me i won't be able to hear game audio which shouldn't be that big of a deal i'm only just missing the banging ost but aside from that uh looks like i get to grab some favors so that's what we're gonna do there's no point in saving these things i might as well get it while i'm going into the run right so blah blah blah blah blah exposition that's cool okay we have 1100 here we can uh still unlock the armor maker we can unlock new magic weapons a lot of different magic weapons or short a lot of different well ranged weapons a lot of different melees wow um i kind of think i just go with that we're so close to this i might as well finish that we got the armor maker then we can go for wands bows or swords a sword sounds pretty rad but so do bows and so do wands um ah what do we go with the short bows are pretty the swords screw it dude imma go the swords i'm a knight after all well in another life perhaps on all levels except physical i'm a knight the miss gets closer every two days instead of every day wait the mist gets close wait so the actual miss contracts what the fudge huh oh that doesn't seem great yeah we almost got some new weapons though okay well you know i'm totally down to grab slower mist i'm down for that still not entirely sure what all that entails but that's all right that's okay doesn't matter anyway let me go ahead and level this up oh some people pointed out i'm stupid and apparently this is just some eastern way or something to say julia i'm not mistaken not what did i even say before julia uh who julia so i guess we'll just call you that you let me just record okay yeah you're you're a brawler move points here are actually huge like i cannot downplay how big this is because she needs to get in and get out so we're actually absolutely getting more move points isolated we don't have any of that no daily man poison damage we don't i'm gonna actually try and reroll huh well that didn't go very well um just go for gamba okay five percent extra stun chance honestly that's it could have been worse we can get a new perk here so what do we want standing next to building an extra defense might be really good for her um we don't really need that leapfrog might not be bad being able to jump over enemies but it probably takes so much movement that it might not be worth it i don't know um we definitely don't want that we don't want that uh debuff not really we're definitely moving let me change the regenerating okay this is kind of big i'm gonna take this so five percent chance we're generating one move point for each enemy damaged during an attack so that means when we use our alt or whatever that big aoe that has what like eight targets so rolling the five percent chance on eight people every then every time to possibly get some more movement sick now is there something giving us minus one move speed or oh is it one of her traits smoker minus one move points minus thursday healing received god that sucks sucks a lot and as somebody pointed out technically when you start the new game you can move the the the weapons around i didn't even think about that like depending on you know their traits what they it seems like they would be best suited for definitely something i can do moving forward she's a little weak though uh so i'm a little worried about that but we'll go on to geralt of rivia uh a crack shot um who frankly has some pretty poopy attributes here we're gonna roll again oh eight percent extra range damage that's big extra accuracy uh yes please thank you very much let's go for perks here um uh if the hero didn't count probably we don't have propagation that would be probably better for a a wizard a sorceress whatever um i actually reliability on isolated enemies maybe um maybe increasing critical hit could be good maybe increased experience great why not i don't know i don't really like any of these for archer maybe i'm just being dumb then we have our sorceress yes carry me to victory oh 10 extra magic damage yes please that is quite literally huge um daily health regen and there's a lot um but daily mana regen we might need to bump that up because uh we're gonna re-roll yeah i'm just going to go up manor again all right now perks we already got all right we're going to give you the propagation that makes sense um as long as the hero didn't move extra accuracy and skill i don't think accuracy matters like at all for us the skill range might but i think that's about it [Music] so hmm yeah what's what's the play here armor is increased jenny robertson is curious help the region what's your health regen at is there a way to see uh i don't know it's a good question it's got to be somewhere right uh so i don't know we don't do poison i'm just going to go with extra crib why not find it okay we got a good amount of gold we could possibly build some new structures we could build the armor maker aha creates a defensive item when the production is complete production increases passively during production phase and can be accelerated with the help of workers you're going to put this down just to see what it does um could also just do more houses scavengers camp for some passive stuff uh i'm i'm gonna try an armor maker oh that is a big building what the fudge okay wait wait all right slap that sucker right here what the fudge is it doing um i don't know but it was like beep beep beep beep boop it's a defensive item of the production is complete two uses per ads plus fine production improves passive i don't want that but like i don't even okay i'm gonna finish it and see what happens so this is gonna take two workers what did we get oh i already have two whoops okay whatever okay should we just straight up get a choose some armor okay white armor plus two seems better than everything else right okay so we probably want to upgrade it and get better yeah tier of gear minus one move points but plus one skill range hold up that could be good that could be pretty good bob who would we want that on like the archer probably pull up your character sheet what are your boots currently doing what are your booties up to um do you not have boots i guess not okay well then great this gives extra dodge but you're not i think of everyone you've taken the least amount of damage right i want to give it to you you baby i can't stop the music or music sounds better with you i probably need to refill your mana that's going to take one worker rip um i guess i could upgrade it for one free one what else do we want to do any other structures we want we got 75 gold i should probably see what the shop has right oh a blue helmet gives extra health extra isolation which no one does and extra daily health regen i mean it's not bad but do we need it not really this gives extra magic damage which is great uh i'm actually gonna buy that because i think that i'm gonna sell this i think this can go in her slot a little jewelry slot and it can extra damage heck yeah brother [Music] um okay so do i want new structures uh you know i think some more workers is never a bad idea we're gonna go with that i'm out of gold but we got more workers we got five of them hi oh hi do uh and then build some defunces do i want to get more gold i don't think we want gold right now let's just get more resources so how many workers do i have five we're gonna knock this down for a whole bunch of resources and we're gonna knock this down for you more whatever yeah screw gold you know what i'm saying we got to protect we already have a little bit here not it's not the best defenses but their defenses nonetheless i'm going to create a gate here we already got a gate here um do i bother with reinforced walls maybe on each side of the fence and that's so expensive though and then yeah that's a lot chief uh budge okay well i guess just screw us right oof yeah okay maybe not my best idea oh you're also so weak can i buy a health potion um how much does this heal for plus 25 that's not much it's really not that much uh that right layer for you go ahead and heal you up flip it in wait only plus 18 what the fudge i must have some negative perk rehab okay we're finally starting to get ourselves situated here i spent way too much money on this wall this one is suffering so i might need to put a few more people here um all right you melee fiend julia where do you want to go i think first off geralt um we'll put geralt uh over here because he's the one that's gonna be hanging back the most right so then ed lin i'm going to have flex here but can easily go over here and then um julia i don't know if i want to put you at the fence yet i'm i'm we're you're going to chill right there because no there's no way they could make it that far right what if i'm wrong i really don't want to take that damage um okay yeah screw us in this and this pray to jesus we can make it through night 4. uh looks like they would have hit us not mistaken yeah they would have holy jesus well the fence is practically broken it stands with one health that's all okay there's not many people yet but that's just what they want me to think it's probably eight bajillion i see a winked bat or something out there that's great um all right yeah screw all of you guys uh we're just gonna go for the omega close damage [Music] you're dead uh freaking bop you're uh all right how much damage we doing not enough to kill you but that'll do pig that'll do then we have to decide what do we want to do here you are blocking me off from going anywhere and i don't like that so boosh you survived now that sounds great that's quite a few of our action points taken out thanks for nothing oh we got a runner oh i don't like that how much movement we'll have three left oh okay wait we don't have to let's see here can we hit this oh we oh requires on this thing you can't be kidding me you've got to be kidding me all right this should give me a line of sight like everything i think i guess you're committed to this uh we are not going to use any of our uh magic yet well aren't you a bit tanky okay we got the kill um does everyone on their mom have armor now what the apparently get you here you there and that's all we can really do come back here hide away and pray and then the masses come yes oh we dodged get destroyed oh okay yeah well there goes like our entire wall not that we really have a wall there but you know okay this uh not cool i'm not i'm not gonna have this happen can i not rotate this thing because i kind of wanted to do it the other way but i guess not there any way i can hit them all no i don't think so ah well that sucks oh i see like this lets me lets me do it here i i don't know i don't i don't think i can rotate it all right well uh requires like i said you go you won't mind okay we're playing that kind of game are we this hits three of them this hits well that's pretty good we'll do that does do some nasty damage a bit of a rascal okay i should have line of sight on these guys if i don't have a line on set oh guys you can see if i don't have lines okay we're in trouble all right you're doing okay it appears we do have most of them coming this way so that's the goodness so i want to go for a lightning strike or i think we go lightning strike all right let's pray uh let's start with you [Music] get that magic damage though okay okay just don't see good way well we just whack how much movement you got six freaking black um i don't think that i don't think i can get closer hold on let's see we can do here um fireball's not bound but i think we shave we can just finish off you and then i think i kind of need to come over here and take out those runner before they get too too deep combine here panic armor yourself just in case okay all right the walls are holding for now we've got the spawns of hell oh wait they're already hitting our building fudge yeah the city's panicking these guys are all gonna mess up my property the fudge man oh and i can't see them are you the wall's kind of bone in me now man is water really well i don't have a choice go here we're gonna omega this dude as far as long side of course it does uh okay omega that dude normal that guy normal that guy and oh my goodness all right you're killing it over there guy absolutely kill him what a stun okay now we're gonna go with a freaking escape that's good damage and it looks like i might have recovered one of our move points uh i could also just be making that up i'm gonna come over here whack both you we got the wait dodge okay we got them wait it survived are you kidding me it's a joke we're gonna have you sit right here unfortunately we have to waste that on you kind of want to take this thing out okay you saucy minks here uh i feel like we're gonna have to tap you yup all right but at least you guys are stunned we're just gonna chill here and that'll do that hey yeah yeah holy i thought we were kind of getting through it and then just eight million more things showed up silly of me to think oh where did you come from oh my god there's so many of them no you fiend okay at least i can kill these guys now okay apparently i can't are you kidding me um i'll have to use two on them anyway so i might able to shoot it normally um and then i don't have anything left so what about this guy we just have to hold this down omega boosh he's not even killing them anymore oh shack oh this is going terribly okay i gotta kill you you guys want a sec there you go now i have to freaking pray with this thunderstorm um let's see we'll go over here i'll hit you probably not the highest priority but then i need best odds of propagation but i don't know so it's good damage but just not quite enough um all these guys are which movement i'm gonna have after this too not good chief i'm not good at all um you guys have to go down the line like one by one oh my god you survived screw me all right that could have gone better but thanks to the like one hp in a dream on their side okay we're definitely going to be taking city damage holy jesus oh yeah this might be the night that bones us my friends i'll fight back against hell best i can but uh hell appears to be winning here um that's some saucy damage still not enough to kill everything holy all right well everything in their mom's gonna be hitting us here i have to lightning storm this and pray um best dogs decent uh we only have two magic left um screw you okay then i gotta go here and just whack yeah pray we stun as many as we can we did something you're dead uh yeah we can't stop all the damages so uh stem the bleeding best we can uh i'll try and take you out hopefully i too tapping okay we do i feel like all things considered like our gear isn't that bad but man it's not enough is it um okay that's rc4 and you've got to retreat my friend one here didn't move that's all right let's hope julia doesn't get absolutely pooped on here he's in the thick of it okay okay it could be worse it could be worse she could be dead she could be dead gotta remember that um the fact that that's the bright side is telling you not a good way um all right i gotta whack both of these guys that was miserable okay and now you're stuck here all right i think you're dead thank you for your service fireball tear that's all of our mana oh my god have you been uh kill you i think nope of course not all right we're gonna keep uh slowly walking back here look at a decent amount of man over here check out what you can buddy please kill that okay yeah our damage just isn't scaling well enough you're gonna stay right there hold the fort my friends farewell julia unless unless oh my god didn't even break her armor julia you're nuts the city's in full panic at this point but what you can do weakening touch here is probably the only hope we have let's see reduce resistance over here and just boosh wow that was it huh well i kind of just got to do it again right all right and once again you're stranded and by everybody so just keep doing what you're doing you're so inspirational the troops are so moved by your sacrifice uh what do i even go after here i don't know i guess take you out and uh you can't even take you can't take you out i don't want to kill my friend you want my friend to kill that guy boosh okay hopefully kill all those guys okay we're getting geralt over here as an animal i don't want to lose him he's been so good to us god but like it's night four and freaking everybody with their armor bro look at this the grandma like come on come on y'all the heroes didn't know honestly doesn't really matter um i'll move him just in case i'm right there that's really about it all right julia come on stay focused stay alive all right i think everything we see on the screen though is the last of them julia is dead say i'll be my friend okay without her this is gonna be difficult to say the least uh i know i'm not making it past night fight but if we can at least make it past this this gives us you know more progress towards upgrades it is a roguelike you know so we want to make all that upgrade in progress we can uh that's pretty kill him right oh you're just built different brother um now what do i got after i guess this guy it's gonna take a little bit but we got the cow this will probably take the rest of my stuff oh we one shot that one okay i don't know why but was that a crit i don't know okay they're both dead that's incredible you have a little bit left i don't think you'll one shot nope but you still did a great job we're gonna back you up a little bit all right 17 left almost no more i don't know if gerald even has enough to throw out another spell i don't know he needs at least two looks like he might only have one well there goes our shop that's unfortunate um oh and my puppy's just upsetting spaghetti we're gonna take you out i'm just gonna get kills where i can right now so i can feel good about myself um oh i was like why why isn't it okay uh can i kill you mr bat of course not it's fine all right we still have a little bit of mana left let's i guess eat it over there didn't kill anyone sir out of range oh oh mega damage boosh omega damage boosh god i'm gonna miss you geralt so good with the best of us now hide away my friend oh heavens heavens to betsy if we could just get through night four you know big morale boost for future fruit and future knightsburg whatever the fudge this place is called oh one more hit of that that's it okay i don't know if i can clear all those in time let's see omega boost omega boost okay how far away all right i gotta kill you killing you now i might have to physically block this with my body might be the play here um over here can i see you oh i need nope don't have one on this side unfortunate do i have mine okay okay oh my god wait he just he just flew through the building is that even legal ref don't you dare one shot this oh he hit that okay stupid we're good all right omega damage you um i'm actually going to walk you over here finish you finish here you have any more movement oh okay maybe it was my best plan um we should be able to kill this guy oh big maybe another one shot oof we're close though all right that's the last guy let's go we made it through night four wait someone had an action point left oh man whatever i think that wall's gonna be the game changer let's be real you have to how many nights 15 jesus man all right we won another night survived we lost julia gone so soon a b rating i don't know how that's some great experience though great stuff yeah we uh that's a fat d on the old uh oh but see look at the tainted essence we love that gave me that tainted essence we barely made it we really yeah really oh i hate to see it but look at that we made some upward and so shinier blah blah blah blah blah blah blah okay let's get those swords what is this magic armor stag armor and other things hmm almost do we have okay i can pretty much get in this let's go with the the short bones because kind of a fan maybe armor is the play here though i don't know that's great we'll just go we'll go for the exciting stuff the weapons and then i'm going to go into the i'm just going to kind of unlock it in the order they're giving it to me because odds are that's probably the best way right by kind of the way they plan the progression i don't know uh what is this walk 500 tiles the item warp crystal a trinket sure don't mind if i do i think those are those upgrades at this point i don't think this matters at all but hey what do you do while at full health extra reliability you are at full health the potential move point penalty from wearing a body armor is reduced by one oh i don't think you even have a penalty oh gear minus one you do anything upon dying this hero will return from the grave during the next day's production phase what it'll then expire but that would have been nice dead eye less damage but extra critical power magic damage has increased by 50 of the hero's current mana what the fudge that's gonna be huge the first man consuming skill used during the turn cost minus one mana what that's huge can store a few unused action points one and move points two for the next any trap around the hero at the end of their term regenerates one use i haven't even gotten to the traps okay we're definitely doing thrifty what the fudge that's nuts um i would do play dead but we're just not surviving at all uh i guess well the movement penalty doesn't matter at all because of i mean i don't even move him in the first place um we get four rerolls okay i'm gonna gamble a bit here unlucky okay i gotta pick something we'll just go armor unfortunate big range damage so we like that wait what oh shoot daily main origin reliability do another one experience again whatever he's not even going to live to see that be helpful at all accuracy increase sure why not all right great stuff um okay wait wait first off i'm giving you thrifty and then uh magic fuel like what the fudge man that's nuts and then we'll give you extra mana why not and uh even more mana why not and that's increasing our magic damage daily mana regen would be important if you're going to survive ah yellow resistant okay that sucks um propagation damage it's not a big increase but we'll take it thank you for your service my friend i'm gonna build stuff because again i don't know what's gonna survive but i do know at the very least this will help us towards some sort of progress thing probably right we'll make tool camps for some passive production that's big um how do i even do this when you add 10 production uh scavengers came so what do we get here 20 material hey i guess that's good too especially if you destroy all the buildings for workers to just like passively destroy you know um kind of it for the structure i guess uh sign workers blah blah oh i don't even have a shop anymore right that's not good uh you know let's destroy this for gold i still can't upgrade anything okay how many workers do i have not that much all right uh upgrades help armormaker use this per production improves passive production right now increases the level of available items see that's what i need but it's a hundred gold so like what the fudge so i'm just gonna whatever i'll upgrade that just do that and then we unlock oh sure i'll take the shield i'll see a prowess has been what did i tell you that's why we didn't just go into the night and die have your production buildings craft three items the blacksmith's building crafting some melee weapons for your heroes the bowler building crafting some ranged weapons or the magic shop now i can decide specifically if i want some freaking joke and then i mean i think that's about it build some defenses it's a really good amount i mean maybe they give me bonus points for like building things you know i'm just gonna throw something over there take some things yeah perfect okay in the phase we're gonna put the archer here we're gonna put the sorcerers here all right just try and get some kills i'm just trying to get some kills i put you right behind a wall you can't see past uh hey what the fudge is this okay the new a new enemy type why not of course a lancer stun resistance just pp freaking poo poo i don't know well whatever okay so decreased mana on our first attack here is kind of soft bossy let me tell you look at that look at that okay wait can i not target you why is that i can't i don't know this game is being stupid okay let me come over here and just snipe this stupid runner why is it keep doing that what oh i'm at action points wait okay well then just undo that you need to just omega what that was only enough to take out his armor not me let me run that one by me unomash times what the  take out the rhino hey what now the armor runners are armored or at least this one is oh this is a crawler it's all right bring it on i ain't scared i'm deathly afraid ooh lanced right up the butt okay yeah things are escalating real fast yo i can do this for free though it's kind of crazy nobody died it's kind of dumb all right we gotta kill um you're out of mana right okay kill you lose uh propagate all over you guys sounds weird but you're gonna kill him you're nuts back it all up girl back it on perfect we're getting some kills you know we're getting some kills we're not gonna go silently into the night okay not if i have something to say about it screw you stupid i probably have to omega you yeah it's ridiculous but do what you can do uh i think i'm gonna hit my own walls and why not right you're at ap okay thank you for your service holy suck man throw everything you got over there fireball out only you're at ap the two heroes didn't move yeah they're fine oh okay you are you've already made it to the i don't know why they center it's so weird when they like pan like this uh is he hitting the base 14 health well this is our last turn so let's make it count to do as much damage as possible or get as many kills as possible oh i should have done it great job buddy proud of you proud of you all the legends will live on i'll be sure of it very well omega bush just just get to the destroying the really you're gonna make me just just hit the hit just hit the thing really really there we go okay and the last spell does not live on but we made it to the fifth night friends progress the magic circle is destroyed to be fair gerald and evelyn didn't have to die but let's be honest we just they died off-screen lakeberg number one was a failure uh i don't know if i have any upgrades instagram here but because i don't know if i got any souls for that nope definitely did not uh did i unlock any prowess here yes i did see killed 500 enemies haha we get a new body armor and pants the wildling set uh resonates with me in my wild heart i don't like burger number two because the first one didn't go so well yikes well the good news is i'm feeling much less nauseous so that's good all right lakeberg two what do you got here standard difficulty you know it i will not give in i won't let this game win i won't you hear me all right we got some new plebs but best of all if you remember our last one we locked it now everybody has five action points might not seem big but that's freaking huge okay so yeah let's see what we're working with here we have kalb who has extra mana extra region and actual experience see that's really good so maybe we give him the wand instead of the sword bless experience gain that's unfortunate he's an idiot chubby health but less movement points so we probably don't want to give him the sword right we would rather give him the other thing i think all the armor everyone wears is the same this gives extra mana okay what are we working here with durand an extra bag slot wow extra hell extra resistance less move points though extra resistance and daily health regen oh shoot but also less resistance what are you like negative one resistance yeah that's strange uh so we're definitely not going to give you the wand so far you're the best candidate for the sword wait you have a shield did the others not oh yeah oh so this gives armor and accuracy you probably don't need the accuracy but let's see what we're working with here oh this person has a crossbow instead of a short bow extra physical magic and range damage okay so you can do whatever extra stun chance one minus one move point well you're looking a little bit better than everyone else this gives you armor and accuracy okay yeah so we'll just keep it as is i don't think i've used a crossbow it's like multi-hits poison um ignores armor and what is this blaze so can hit multiple it propagates um i don't know what it propagates i mean it just propagates damage i don't think he has any effects but yes monica you stay crossbow flop sets wait i can give you like a second set oh i don't know when that'll come in handy but good to know i guess oh yeah you got the shield too that's freaking sick i don't know if i gave you the wand it's probably yeah i should probably give you the one all right then would you look at that where are they coming from from here good oh yeah the really does come in huh i didn't even realize that wow okay uh so we'll have you up a little bit more in the front we'll have wand over here we'll have crossbow over here and sword maybe we don't need to go that far something like that roughly how much more points do you have six everybody has sex like everybody gets some sort of a penalty okay oh you have a sword though i have not used a sword either kills the hero to the tile of a k moves the hero to the title kill target okay and momentum deals bonus damage per tile traveled that's a bit okay dash fiscal damage deals 20 damage to armor that moves to designate tile blade rush lose it here at the destination three targets though i guess that's it okay pretty self-explanatory let night one begin you stand no chance devils you didn't come as close as i thought you would though all right what are we working with here how far can we shoot not as far as i'd like uh multi hits one out of two there you go let's see okay first one's a dodge sick second one's a dodge finally hit him okay so not exceptional damage um so let's just go for poison i guess and then the poison will kill him that was not a great showing to start but leave the magic missiles and the transfer and the sort of the all right we don't want to get you too close yet uh as i say that okay again how do i bring in wait in the maneuver what huh what is this moves to here to destiny i tile know why that's about okay whatever i killed him killed him envelope maneuver about what am i missing here who's here to the designated tile oh so so he like pushes oh no he goes through oh interesting oh that's cool you can do like a little leapfrog oh okay kind of make like a puzzle with that so i wasted the poison but whatever uh i'm not even gonna i'm gonna try and not use any magic words at least especially not early on i don't need to boos boos boos um oh fudge i don't even have um i can't even use my main attack anymore so i'll give them extra energy and then with this i'm gonna use this it will pierce his armor but no one has armor okay maybe i won't i'll just poison somebody wait is that that's just gonna one shot him wait let's see how good poison is oh not quite but it look oh jesus but it looks like it um oh my god what you guys got close enough to already hit him what am i doing jesus man ah i forgot it just doesn't even you would think like oh okay well like first wave it can't be that but it's that bad does make it really dicey like who do i have like omega think think that through maybe now is a good time to see how blaze works wait i can only hit two targets what uh what i'm the stupidest i practically just killed cobb yo who says we just fresh restart oh my god what in the dickens i'm so papaka jesus that's like that's so bad let's just hope he passively regens a lot of that good lord god this thing like doesn't kill anything i'm upset about it uh you're out of moves okay of course now you my friend sorry about that uh how many targets can we do with this we'll be cast multiple times but how many times four times to be exact well then do some of that and then take out the trash i'm gonna move you back a little bit i want you to get hit what do we do about this what do we do about this can't do that i kind of need them to get closer i don't want them to get closer though okay we gotta kill we're popping off with the resets man i'll get a reset there and i could reset there the problem is oh i can't even use that anymore okay screw it i'll kill you and then i'm running like a coward that's not even gonna be good enough we might get hit but i think our armor will survive it poison killed you oh no he's just gonna attack the defenses so many of them i just don't have a great wave clear whatever let's see what happens when i don't hit my teammate with it throw it like that oh it propagates pretty well if i just waited on that i don't know uh yeah we're just gonna have to use some some magic here but nothing ever dies well you know megan move you back already which is sad but what you gotta do huge kills you're not i'm gonna poison you because i hate you in particular apparently always making this so difficult um how do i shish kebab my way through this [Music] um oh no we go any closer than i'm just trying to bone myself all right the poison will kill him armor myself up but i think we'll get out and wait one action point all right it's just time all right poison kill them okay they went way far than i thought they would and we got a hand okay it's fine freaking boosh well now if i could just set that up more often that'd be great okay whack you here friggin how much how many move points you have you have all six we can we can make something work here right right i'm gonna go here slice through you and run back here you know you what's your mana regen i don't know this will be the last one i try and use go here and here okay not great but not terrible let's see what we can clean up here all right take care of business in the front i'm just trying to target people who are gonna get closest okay poison you at you you and back it on up all right the poison will slowly like yo what the fudge what what is this dude doing hey get out of my town brother what do you think you're doing um big brain time though this is okay it's hard to kind of pull some of this stuff off and have it actually work but when it does work it's pretty slick i'm not gonna lie can i hit you from here yes i can all right i have to try and stop using magic so that i have some for the nights ahead so which you can do no damage because it's stupid crossbow but they they both dodge what the fudge this thing sucks penis oh my god gotta poison something let you slowly die i guess uh yep here uh come here oh my god i ran out of moves okay didn't realize that you can't really do anything well cheated at the very least poison something if we wanted to why not there you go get poisoned stupid my walls my cabbages target you and you oh wait sing loose boosh wait what you didn't die what the heck oh my god you're nuts i love the sword growing on me needs a line of sight my anus oh my god now we're out of range then come over here oh you know that would have been pretty clean had i not practically killed my own dude that's so bad and see because of all the damage freaking a b score the city protection was fine but i would certainly hope so you know it was it was night one okay let's not get too out of ourselves you get a weapon which is nice we do get some tainted editions yeah it's very good only an a oh that's because of that whatever screw you guys i don't need you we have enough to finish the tainted essence thing though i do like too that the unlocks you get like are immediate we'll get wands i reckon oh what do we get here more armor items manufactured by production buildings have five percent chance to be uncommon that's pretty good euros are generated with plus five mana new havens will not have plus one mage in canton at the magic circle wait what does that mean does that mean it'll take less nights or does that mean it'll have more health i don't know but i i almost feel like the best ones are just to increase starting things right i don't know what this warrior said is but apparently it's super dope because it's 3 000. this is good but the man up i mean maybe i should do like this armor stuff but i'm just gonna go for the mana for now seems pretty good to me all right this is our mage so perks for mage what do we like the skill range isn't bad i i think i'm just gonna greet it and get the xp so mage let's not get too gambo let's just get you some bonus mana for the get go and daily mana region we like that that's nice so now we can be a little bit liberal with your mana usage who's up next our crossbower uh i hate everything about in fact hold on what can i get a new bow that would be great oh wow a green short bow but there's also blue helmet which will give dodge armor and block as well as resistance and nobody has a helmet so i mean like i think that would be better on a front line but anything just a better bow right now i hate that crossbow i don't know i don't know what that is you know i just i ain't about it i don't want it just get me out of there thank you granted i guess it's one-handed so maybe we could you know the perk is i don't know we're just going to go steady maybe i should have done xp to start i don't know we're going to give you some extra range damage and daily mana region or experience game you know let's give you daily mail region why not that way we can kind of throw out your spells as well the sword which is just sick i'm thinking we just go with i don't know let's just go with the xp extra dodge isn't bad but maybe just some extra physical edemage we oh flat reduction applied to the resistance of target enemies cannot decrease okay critical power just eight percent flat damage that's not bad why not feeling crazy we got decent amount of stuff buy some new gear what do we got this is dodge momentum do you use momentum i don't remember i feel like he might i feel like he does momentum deals bonus spam is per tile traveled by the cash including follows and maneuvers um i guess that doesn't make that terrible this gives reliability skill range i mean maybe this what is this steel sword same thing except it comes with extra momentum and better base damage that worth 23 gold right now though uh that's a good question magic crystal gives minus nine percent damage what but it gives a plus seven mana interesting so you can just pump out spells but also reduce damage that's that's interesting what is this extra action points i think we're gonna buy the helmet we'll chill with the rest for now put on your helmet my friend all right now let's buy some new structures oh well look at all these new buildings we got oh yeah the blacksmith the bowyer bower i don't know how they want me to say that magic shop just free melee range to magic items that's pretty good but i feel like just getting some materials and health and mana i mean let's go with go with materials first not the worst thing you've heard of how many workers do we have let's go for some gold right now and kind of greet the materials good bit and let's buy another house oh wait no i hadn't bought a house what a scavenger's camp yeah let's go with another scam just kidding why not get those passive materials so then i can focus on my warriors and getting gold or my workers not warriors okay well we didn't sign up for that i know i know my bad and that's enough gold to not do anything with build some defenses where are they coming from i will toss just a little bit right around that probably a little too expensive but that's fine and then we head to the second night in the next episode ladies and gentlemen i hope you all enjoyed i scuffed this run immediately by just  over call what the fudge was i thinking just ah but you know what you'll learn as you go feeling a little bit better we're getting those upgrades that's what i'm saying it's a rogue it's really cool because you can do decent like i know i i'm not going to beat it but seeing all the updates to in real time like almost every upgrade is like a godsend like you notice it almost immediately some of these that i'm getting that's like oh new gear showing up and stuff we haven't seen any of that yet um but for the most part it's really cool especially like upgrading the default characters you get man imagine if you get like four heroes to start yo that's going to be a game changer i assume that will happen eventually right because there's just no way because i feel like at some point like waves will be like every single spot like and if they didn't give you four heroes like what would you do i don't know anyway yeah i'm really enjoying this game appreciate you guys watching and giving me your support with that said thank you for watching i'll talk to you guys in the next one very well [Music] so you
