i'm going to steal my treasure eh pasta damn they got a way cooler name than hustlers trouble boys yeah wait i didn't choose ellwood i do i like it either sheesh man you guys are really harsh on me man what are the best garden toys hey we all know who is the number one we're like family feuding yes the most okay the audience does not know best we're good they have a high five they're you know that whole like mob mentality they're going to go towards the wrong thing but we mentally we can't really discuss can we because then they're just gonna uh really we can discuss when it's our turn oh okay build your perfect swiss army knife that's cool so it's already build your own swiss purse right now yeah they also get to choose but see if we're discussing them like you gotta pick the number one first like whichever one you think is the most important yeah like all right okay okay so what are we choosing no no no no no no no you don't need to discuss here yeah okay okay i think i got a good i i think i did yeah i got a good army knife ladies and gentlemen that's a lot of spiders this amount of spiders is making me nervous listen to podcasts without headphones unbelievable oh god find the top three answers while avoiding the rest for every correct answer oh so we get pulled on our ends then they guess and they do the pull on their end and we guess i think so yeah okay i think they're stupid and it shows the worst ones that's true one but enough chitchat don't put even that don't even put that into their head the first door awaits you all right the door is safe decide amongst yours all right like let's be real knife right yeah knife it's in the title yeah yeah really though i think is and a nail file you know for when i'm cutting my nails because like first of all scissors are overrated who needs to use scissors on their nails when they can just pile them down right [Music] all right all right let's be real here screwdriver yeah i agree yup i think you're joking we're good we're good we're good we're good see there you go that's right are you audience imagine picking scissors couldn't be me oh what is important you got to cut down some saplings or something yeah you guys remember dominated the audience doesn't know what a sewing eye is granted neither do i but what uh four four things scissors oh damn not going not going not going okay this is gonna be hard you're doing them in order of worst to okay yeah like okay like sure i'll go there bad dj knight at an empty dance club does that not empty dance i mean yeah that just sounds awful what that sounds amazing that like they're trying way too hard like so what we are figuring out is this is going to be a very hard round yeah it's gonna be tough so because it's very subjective i mean for you guys i can see into the minds of papers i i think there's a pretty obvious first choice here i agree i know which one that's like the worst though but yeah pollen pollen they're all based on like allergies so the next one must be overwatch oh personally i think number two would have to be chi-chi's it's cheap between hickeys now the empty dance club massachusetts first home for bart bob mouth you and hurley bar and girl manny cloud sports our cigarette diner i'm torn the whole experience [Music] lung cancer is my second favorite thing hey nice try hey all right all right all right we're at second place can i make all of you and hurley barn grill who names your child bartholomew that sounds like a safe choice in spanish yeah chichi sounds fun and they're like yes we should click that one i don't think they thought it through wow oh and it's just uh a bad rap by that my logic was too good crowd be flying oh it's only one second loud so okay mannequin loud i'm thinking road mansion because that sucks that's cool why would that be yeah hickey pub sounds like a trashy dive bar that i do not want to go to so many about bartholomew i'm going with barcelona yeah because like that sounds like a place that like you'll just get don't you it's a bear i got a place in bartholomew shark you have to pick one four seconds are you kidding me for the record i think it's the sport no no no no he made the right choice oh he did it you're the only one that said that yeah when we started this shark was saying that they all seemed like good places clearly he was the wrong person to have in charge of this oh good lord i don't think they're gonna get number four i'd like no way i feel like they will they will know we talked about the right answer look at those spiders they know what's going on no they don't they're done watching cheeks wouldn't they technically happen no no no they picked wrong yeah watch out for the the bar and grill guys careful wow hickeys was seventh yeah wow yeah i'm sure i sure would hate to take my girl to food and oh no someone just walked in on you changing oh this is a nearby item to hide your shoes [Laughter] so i i feel like size has got to go into it unless you're yeah like a toothbrush is enough for you wait it's not speak for yourself yeah so let's just assume it's the average size is one inch all right josh i'm curious what's the precious moments figurine it's a figure that has been around for a long time their eyes look like they're about to cry and it's usually of like a little kid or an angel and it's about something i like to play in front of my junk it's about the size of your hand it's so not quite as big because are they like changing rooms are usually pretty cold yeah i was gonna say we may be shriveled up a bit yeah some of these things we might be a little it might work so we have to go for whatever the least people chose okay i already know it don't say watch i'm gonna do one and done okay when it starts i'm gonna tell you're gonna click it we're getting eight okay got it got it okay that's not a democracy trust that sounds like three differences but you can bet you'll still lose oh great oh this is gonna be close torch and you answer incorrectly the game is not immediately over uh oh another team will need to provide a correct answer to eliminate a team wins when either their opponent runs out of torches or if they complete the round with the most torches remaining nice i like it we win easy ready too small no i'm not ready two small toy cards are you sure yep i'm thinking large one if you're covering [Music] oh my do you think they will choose light bulb yeah you got to pick the worst one right now and i mean i think there's only one other worst one okay i think i think they're probably gonna pick it down below i know that was i think it's obviously the apple who would choose something not see-through and bigger than some of the other objects right you got it bryce apple would be so loud this is this is what i was thinking i don't want i think it's light bulb i can't be wrong i think light bulb is definitely higher [Music] do you know how dangerous that is to just be swinging that near your junk it's interesting this is fun games with friends namaste shut up bless don't worry i'm sure they also picked chefs there's no way that they get this i think okay oh is that good we know what it is that's what you would have had we know what it is i said the other one was figurine go figuring rob i trust you buddy oh he was light bulb why would somebody just give it to us you want that i think figurine has to just be low because no one really knows what that is that seems pretty solid it's largely high up i'm thinking two small towns yeah what about that joey and mirror is going to be high up joey that's right you trust the team you and your knife swinging all right he's definitely going to be up high definitely it's a good choice i know what they're going to pick it seems it seems like they're picking chef's knife yeah i think i think so holding that makes me feel better yeah chef knife i think would be kind of low like lunch might be next time there it's the middle i think i'd go apple apple would be like number two or number three honestly think of all the different things of adam and eve all they need is an apple yeah okay that was the thing for sure you're thinking fig leaf i don't want to get come on little turtle come on little turtle [ __ ] oh he has a chef knife it's trying to cover see that's pretty big okay if they get it right then we lose no but we don't lose because they won't get it right that was that was a tough toss-up that was a toss-up correct answer in the game four i think a hand mirror would suck for covering yourself for sure i'm gonna be ready i don't know it's hot the wax why would the hand here suck for covering yourself it would suck so bad oh i think they should pick the hand mirror for number four because it wouldn't be so bad for them everyone chose the chef this is not like a stab the person who walked in i put it up there as a power move like get out of here oh my god i would have gotten knife or pressure i think they're right i think damn screwed us dude i do not know yeah let's blame we just lost the worst rpg party i've ever seen paladins [Music] [Music] you
