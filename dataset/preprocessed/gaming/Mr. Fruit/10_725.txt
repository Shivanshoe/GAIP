these days listen I'm just gonna swing my sword like I said when in doubt swing it out I can't take any of that credit apparently that's all ding-dong way to go my friend I wish more people played battle right though the reason I always want to play though is because the combat is so clean I love this kind of style obviously it's not very popular which is unfortunate but like a MOBA style but really focused on that combat clearly I shouldn't make games because all the ones I like die that's my taste clearly I shouldn't make something because the market will be like yeah not really feeling it I'm just jumping in skirt skirt okay oh I'm panicking right now I'm hyperventilating I'm throwing a rock though that's gotta hurt if I can get some charges here that would can I not hit anything oh my god sure ah what what is going on I don't actually know I'm gonna empower my basic attack so I can try and heal you kill the healer there we go that seems like a Huey I don't know if it actually is so I'm a pair of you skirt boom boom boom now watch this I'm gonna hit him into a wall go to him for extra damage you do that oh my god this guy's actually getting destroyed okay but he altered me now it's no it's no longer fun I'm no longer having fun okay how's it going team up 1v2 looks like I held down the fort - come on noobs twelve seconds late go oh my god we're gonna lose we're good guys can somebody explain to me what just happened you know I'm not gonna take any blame here I thought I'd performed pretty well I'm gonna jump on these guys so hard though just show me where the fire do this show me actually I'm still just gonna go for the healer first got that skirt okay completely missed incredible okay I can't even get in close enough to hit something man oh I'll parry you while you counter me yeah - shake yeah oh oh fudge dude this guy's insane why does he do so much damage right I'm just gonna I'm just gonna I'm just gonna walk I'm gonna walk away from this engagement slowly think about what you've done I knocked him into the air you're welcome we won The Orb sick okay okay can we stay live is there others healing I can't even get into attack people I know okay well I'm just gonna skirt okay they got knocked down at oh my look at this look at this look at this damage dude okay I'm gonna hit this yes ultimate ready all right I'm just good old you it's all I can't do really where did they go I don't know okay this this is not good Wow I have no idea why it's going so poorly now kill ash cow that's that fire dude right bro I want to but he escapes and I can't hit anything with my pig giant sword because they all just evade and then freakin heels and stuff they're not about to see this coming oh he's camouflaging I love this get immediately onto the back line look at him all running away skirt look at them all running away skirt I'm in I'm in goosh goosh goosh goosh ah uh-huh immediately on there we go there we go mr. fruit this is I'm trying to swing you skirt skirt okay I think I'm healing oh my God look at my damage will get my damage right now okay I came to play now yes sir skirt that didn't work I'm gonna save you my friend because it's not looking great for you right now imma be if I'm being honest with you I got I got to do this so I can slowly heal a little bit okay okay okay ally has been slain that's not good I'm gonna get this thing no they got that really that's incredible I'm covered yeah Oh what she did that at just perfect timing Wow oh my god oh my Wow well I'll get up late oh there goes my first ranked game clearly it's just a character crisis this guy's a bow and arrow let's do it alright they have another viewer we don't that seems to be a common thread here that we're missing but I'm not too worried about alright glhf team and we have a good fight but but also can we win that's what I mean that's kind of I think I care more about that thing is that it looks like Mucha macaws are from Starcraft that's funny all right I'm just gonna hail some arrows down or something I'm not really sure but things seem to be going well I think I mean I haven't gotten hit so I'm having a great time you know I've said boom oh my god okay well it's not looking good for him but I do have my old gosh did I miss all that there's no way right there's no way I could have possibly messed all of that yeah all right let me charge this up Coosh and then hit him again goosh and then ah ah and the charge melt you okay Wow okay this is my character turns out yeah who knew um skirt oh wait okay there's a cool down on that okay tonight tonight I'm trying to do stuff but for some reason it G oh I guess I spoke too soon I thought I was doing well oh but you're so close all but he's Alton you you just you just took it up the butt dude oh my god yeah look I had like the best everything in that match and then there's that dude all right we found the weak link in our team it's you brow okay so let's try this again who do you guys want to folk oh my god okay well I didn't like that alright this guy was doing a lot it okay he just counters everything I don't really understand how how he works I'm just gonna throw some traps around there I don't know if they can see those I wouldn't be surprised if they could well now I'm just doing no damage that's it that's fun that's fun we won the orb heck yeah we did all right charge that up Bop oh you took a licking right there didn't ya I'm gonna run over you okay or my friend will just block the way that's that's you're already dead this isn't good you run away from that buddy this is this is not a good look for us I'm gonna keep it real with you I'm just gonna keep shooting down there hoping I'm hit alright I'm all on one we three this is fine yeah I changed my mind we don't need to win how about we just have it we just don't lose 300 three whatever I need to go for this guy over here he seems to be a problem he does like all the damage and everything it's pretty impressive God he always hurts me man yeah yeah yeah oh no you don't boom you you the oh look at this dude's damaged who thought that this was okay back up buddy back up yo you know what I'm going in you all know why cuz I got my ultimate I can't see did did did I hit something I really hope I did okay she's so weak though and I think she's the healer so it would be advantageous for us to kill her okay I think we did I think we did we did it we did it we did it okay skirt all right I'm gonna do that and then that uh-huh and then come over here and if I hit him there we go I heal a little bit that's good that's good that's good he just healed a bunch though this yep how is this character get allowed in this game so much damage all the time oh god you're doing great you're doing great honey yeah oh they won't know where that's that's fine though that's fine gee okay I kind of jumped into him for some reason I don't know I thought that would be a good idea okay I barely avoided I barely know you I need the health oh well you know I left my heart out on the field what else can you ask for play battle ride he said it'll be fun he said we lost every match but hey I hope you guys enjoyed
