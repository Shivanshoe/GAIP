michael schumacher up in the front you're lucky there's no tornadoes okay we put a barricade on the track no what oh wait what i flew off the map because i was so fast that literally just happened to me i was oh sad oh wait oh my where am i going oh i'm throwing i'm going too fast oh my that was so funny oh oh jesus that was hilarious oh no there we go barricades three three oh yeah all right we got a rolling lap in now this is my this is my lap copium all right i might be in last but you know what they say the guy in last on the first is the one first and the last somebody said that why do i have 20 seconds why is it why is it counting down i don't know oh there's only one lap oh what the easy game drift distance uh 885 inches okay so about the same it's because you like how about you stop using your your crutch of a car huh my bumper car yeah all right fine fine all right you want me to switch it up i'll put it on the el camino good i'll throw on the little el camino yeah you will i'll throw it on eat level playing field okay el camino v el camino yeah and then brian's little thing i don't know i don't have an el camino don't get this with twisted metal i need some track hazards for you to hit this time yo chill if you want to download the game and hop in our private lobby dude you're more than welcome to yeah now that you got a code yeah now that you got a code you see if i win you get a code and you get to play with us so i just have to win oh we're on the tongue come on el camino these tracks are coaster dude why not get the boost how did i not get the boost and you're already that far ahead i'm starting to think you you hacked the game they gave you like a special maybe i'm just all that valet experience is paid off yeah because this is what it looked like when you did it what go on el camino i'm literally going there like negative miles per hour what do you have in the trunk of your bed i don't know the truck i guess truck your bed ah oh i almost flipped you this is what we're talking about i'm so slow i swear the longer i go the slower i get going it doesn't matter how is there something wrong my controller maybe what do it feels like i'm fighting myself only the controllers feels like i'm fighting myself man well i mean the el camino i'm going really slow that doesn't you're still so far because i'm just a better driver zooming [Music] zooming partial one zooming party one you're so funny ryan is pretty close actually i'm in for you i'm right there too guys i thought i saw you but it was just a little speck on my monitor i'm serious easy game are you kidding me i can't dress more to get boost when i'm already going zero miles per hour i mean then accelerate comes off right i'll give you a head start how about that i'll give you a head start or do you want to go skyscrapers i'm like i'm not bad at racing games and then i get on and then i i play with like you and i'm like oh my god well it just worked because i'm losing to you you know well no okay well yes i get that i would feel probably the same if you were owning me and like not just like owning like destroying like the point where it's like not even content like i would be upset too yeah all right i'll give you a 10 second head start here all right now we're going you don't want a 10 second if i win i want it i don't because then it's it's marred like it it might as well not count all right here we go let's go i never get the boost i swim in them like what we're in the same car and you're already so far ahead and nothing changed i i i swear i'm just i'm just slower the green lines are the boost why did i hit that wall man oh that was a mistake come on batch i can't keep up don't make any sense no watch oh i was gonna say don't you dare when will you wear oh my of course i missed that fudge that was nice okay hold up oh get away from me come on see ya oh it's a close one here folks i'm right on you see you no yeah what are you kidding me my adaes all right now i got brian in my sights oh that's so dumb that's so dumb [Applause] didn't scrape way in too many walls though should have been way cleaner of a race if you're using an xbox elite controller make sure the trigger stops aren't engaged they are is that a problem oh maybe maybe you're not going all the way down oh monka you got to be kidding me well i guess we'll find out you seem to be keeping up like with me at the end there you want me to give you a 10 second head start this time no you almost won that time without a 10 second yeah exactly so i don't want it okay so you don't want it 10 seconds no all right do we do long oh we haven't done garage yo yo long yeah i've been willingly handicapping myself i'm rocking dropping the weights bro you're done for all right boys i don't understand the boost man i really don't you do that two seconds yeah i do and then it's like and then it starts and i never get it dude i never get boost oh this place is sick i think this place is really sick i'm not gonna lie i think the triggers were actually affecting me really yeah it feels like i'm playing a new game uh-oh uh-huh uh-huh oh my god okay what are you doing he's grinding the rail get off man get up okay oh yeah uh-huh now i'm zooming dude this is a three lap race so better stay consistent three laps to beat you in hey let's go i'm feeling gassed literally and figuratively oh god oh jesus okay i don't have enough boost oh my god i can't ah gravity no no oh no gravity oh my god oh i just landed i literally don't have enough i just didn't even have boost i don't have a choice see what what the fudge i literally don't i don't have enough boost to do that you just had to choose the the map your car is good on i get it yeah uh home field advantage oh i turned the wrong way i turned the i thought it i turned the wrong way yeah i was like i couldn't tell and i was like okay i just think it's right it kind of saved me no i had to restart me come on oh i didn't have any boost there oh brian's got the drift on lock now i wish i did ah hey hey get off me keep it clean keep it clean oh you like that i ain't playing by no rules thanks for the boost no yeah sick booze bro i'm staying right now a lot of value on that come on try me oh no see you oh you said whoa you better hope you have enough boost i don't oh no here we go my car literally just doesn't have enough come on [Music] yes uh-oh you're playing my race now yeah see how's it feel it's all right i know which way to turn now too all right not worried there's still a lot things gonna happen like me continuing to stay in first place you know the use don't get nervous up there oh it's easier it's easier real nice it's easier to be the hunter than it is to be the hunted can you keep the pace that i'm on right now let's go coincidence the first game my triggers are working i win i mean i did give you a 10 second head start here like i did last race and you beat me by 15 seconds okay 15 seconds yep so what about that 10 second head start huh yup co-pm let's go all right now we'll start and i will actually that's a dub one i never get in a racing game let's go never betting against fruit again that's right uh after this next game i'll pick another person too i'll get another code sent out so next game we'll get huntress in and hopefully the next one after that we'll get someone in oh what up joey all right we're playing through so now if brian gets to win rob that's a win for salt nation okay if you win it's a win for salt nation okay i want to win for house fruit if shae haro wins it's a win for house fruit okay so it's like hot wheeled banner beds yeah almost something like that all right well i just have to target the two of you then and let rob just race normally no you have to finish high on the points too you need to finish above shane all times i'll focus on mr fruit you get destroyed dude shea's about to destroy you guys he has like the dominic spinozy car what is that i don't know what's dangerous yeti pick the uh medium one because i did the yeti look it has a [ __ ] jump starters i used to make hot wheels cars go head on i'd make like loops and then at the end they just right i wish for the boost like a hand would come in and just oh [ __ ] oh no that's how you know it's serious what is that boost sheesh wait are we both in last brian let's go shae first game first win for shea they're natural just like me hopefully they're not like me that'd be bad oh they just hit the barrier so they're just like you yeah no that's because they've been watching my stream no this is how you do it right oh no hey i passed shea so just leave mr fruit to me all right the lack of whereas here makes me a little nervous come on lads you're way ahead i don't even see you what okay i see you not for long oh what the i don't know how to go about that no satch don't make the jump optimal optimal no no you gotta froze my wheels man oh what my wheels yeah you guys went over ice no i hit the ice let's go that's big like my baby toe hit big dub for house fruit right there come on lads let's go oh i just went off the map what was that that's a new move rob damn i mean if we're going based off of like team rankings you got two dnfs so we wouldn't be finished farther yep they dnf's the dnf and that was shae's first warm-up so understandable wait let me see if i can buy some new cars wait you're gonna buy cars well no like with coins you can buy like coin cases yeah oh i can oh who's going first let me watch your unboxing i'm gonna pull up your stream okay you feel really excited [Music] taking forever oh i actually already had this oh watch yeah not great okay all right well let me pull up yours factory new butterfly emerald all right let me ready are you ready all right oh what oh sorry i was like wait i'm poor so let's sit down here [Laughter] i already had this get destroyed what is that look at this look at this i already got the el camino we got disrespected oh i do have two of them oh you can't dismantle i can dismantle for gears or sell it for more gold oh i dismantled it for gears i'm a noob i should have sold it oh what is it what are we going to do here oh snakes we can try that oh yeah scorpion i mean crossroads seems like actually kind of sick though you jump under you jump over people that looks kind of cool yeah sure let's do a short you know it's been it's we took a little hiatus let's get warm again like you jump over people you'll be seeing people going over you and stuff that's cool [Music] i can do a little dance with my car why are they putting me in the back dude it's like they already want me to lose the best that they already want me to lose bro oh [ __ ] we are in here with some freaking gamers you know what the fudge i just gave him the game too i don't understand man well he did say he beat the tutor like he got first i got last in the tutorial well what were your bots medium oh no and i guess i had trigger issues so skirt yo house fruit in the league let's go this is a this is a cumulative win for us just a couple of fraggers here we're just vying for the league because that's how raw we are right behind you guys can't why i can't hear you shut up god if i got a dollar for everyone jesus i can't take control captain oh no oh what is that i don't want to talk about it ah it's a throw it's what we call it i've just been riding the wall this whole lap oh i thought that was the last flap oh i'm throwing again ah fudge oh that was a hard-earned second man like we got some gamers in here now let's go house fruit i just get second every time man no i hate control oh my god they get back on to the far right there's creator maps oh which one you want to do well it just depends if you think they're actually better than the actual ones well i guess we'll find do sticks and yeah yeah i thought it was just like three maps and then we'll add five later because like they were that makes sense yeah that's why i was like i wonder what these ones are yeah forever and that's like can you make a track oh we're in the bat we're bruce wayne's bat room oh god that room where him and alfred figure out who did stuff we oh wow all right oh my god i saw somebody else yeah brian just went off to jesus christ this methods this map is [Applause] dude like if you get any speed you're gone i fall off three times i don't learn oh no oh i oh oh that is so sick dude when you like actually have just enough speed to get over the loop and you fall off oh okay everyone's falling off they're gonna yell about it can't wait to hear about it i've already fallen three times at the start you're gonna make it more here in a second i'm sure i will lord have mercy oh come on oh we make those now now no are you kidding me i guarantee you you're not having as bad as the time as i am trust yeah that's four i think i i think i figured out nope oh my god it spawns me back all the way here whoever made this is this sadistic son of a gun sheesh hurry up oh this is just insane hey i'm ahead of somebody because i flipped i got turned off like five times [Applause] oh you gotta be kidding me [Music] you gotta even when i slow it down right there man if i finish it's a miracle ah that's p3 rob p3 uh tough race today boys but we'll take it podium finish hey house fruit is killing it i recruited the right people all right i fell off rookie it was supposed to be a giveaway yeah um fell off six times so the fact that even finished pretty happy about that we have to pick the we are picking the only the user once now they are so ridiculous i messed up my key ah whatever how do i hold on to this i don't know i'm afraid to click boost where am i going right nope oh [Laughter] how are you guys even like going through this [Laughter] oh i'm so five head dude you better do the same thing christian did oh just fall off the map and land on the other side yeah are they the only ones actually trying to stay on the course i'm trying to it just so happens i'm doing a really good job at just getting some shortcuts can't like if it's in the map it's not an exploit i'm not using something abusive like it's just this is just yeah don't be like sammy now right i'm literally in last because i'm trying to stay on the course well there's your mistake and i jump onto that one what is that turn oh come on come on what nuts let's go [ __ ] how are you on like 80 hot wheels unleashed yeah guys i'm totally dnfing because mr cause this guy who makes this map puts no checkpoints mr fruit isn't even staying on the track he's just trying to fly himself onto other parts of the map it's pretty funny it's worth it dude it's just like it's like a roulette or like a pinko you just kind of like fall off and like where am i gonna land it could be good it could be bad we'll find out today like how does this guy not put at least like one checkpoint on his map jesus christ ah oh my god wait i haven't even done the third lap in there i thought i was on the back of skipping wait what i just finished my second lap how do i know how he did it yeah king ripper didn't omega skip he oh my gosh skipped oh that sneaky bastard what do you do well i mean i can't i was just literally pulling off the map and landing right before yikes rob fifth what was that what am i supposed to do freaking car too you embrace it you just yourself yeah what that looks insane how is that medium i guess we'll find out [Laughter] seeing how'd you jump that far i braked a little too much i'm focused oh okay and i somehow did a 360 screw i see why it's called wind tunnel okay great all right well gz rob on first so come on oh well thank you i got can i hold it is another question you left up pretty hard i'll say that i'm gonna do the loop it wasn't worth it but i did it that probably threw the race for me but i'm a man of my word i came back it 100 through the race for me oh my god that turn was nice oh my god so sketch i'm just full of good turns good oh god oh keep it together p1 rob that's p1 mate good job mate oh thank you guys for the team everybody at the factory i'm just so happy we could do that for the team get in there boys actually house fruit wins yeah well i won the champions league i finished like second every race i won the driver's championship give me that goal thank you i'm for sure this is a this is a team race not an individual no you might have won like the team race but i won the championships which people care about more than no no no no i definitely won like oh this is a team it was house fruit or assault nation not rob versus everyone else you know yeah but i'm talking like championship points the greatest motorsport does that with their races so i would assume hot wheels follows the same regulations nope yeah well in my world it does gg good sir oggs uh brian and thanks for playing jay and reaper rowdy wall how does one get in
