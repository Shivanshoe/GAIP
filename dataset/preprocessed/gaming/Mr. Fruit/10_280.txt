misspell if i can't read it i don't know how to read all right let's see what wonderful prompt i okay what the [ __ ] oh if i didn't press the button okay this is interesting this is interesting wait if i didn't press done does it go through who the hell wrote a novel i'm going to fight you okay i hope mine went through it i like this this was this was good shout out to whoever did this one you know i appreciate you this is fun i do this every day anyway so jokes on them i'll have um somebody here and then they're face palming um yeah with just their eyes like this i guess this is their hand okay i don't need to do that it makes it weirder okay and then there's an easel back here uh an easel has like this crazy and it's like not whatever like that skeleton anyway uh and then of course let's draw an among this character this is exactly what my thumbnail is going to be let's be honest i think i just butchered someone's props i feel like that's very likely that we're all doing that currently but hey that's okay that's that's part of the [ __ ] but i butchered it oh shoot oh shoot um oh god i'm panicking um panicking to fix it oh god i i don't know if i've made it better sure it's beautiful all right we're working on it guys i am horrible at drawing people you guys gotta forgive me oh god it's ungodly how bad i am all i know is at drawing i appreciate this prompt original and wholesome i'm so sorry oh i like how you you're like it's good it must be rhea um i i don't even i don't know um i don't know who the other person is dude uh i don't want to write it but i have to because it's what i see oh this is confusing i'm really hoping i don't get a novel again i'm gonna be very upset if i do cute okay i like it um i have a little scale your big toe little pinky toe little toenails then they're on the scale and the scale obviously has a little readout 169 lounge and then of course little parts where you should like put your feet you know um that's beautiful let's give him some cankles or something i want to make it weird we could even do like a slight little reflection here right the person's looking down [Music] it's very subtle i doubt anyone will notice it but i think it's funny uh perfect all right i just made the best piece of art in my life i'm i'm not too proud of my drawings you guys gotta that's never a good thing god so detailed oh no wait jigsaw what the fudge is um [Music] you know sometimes i type something out i'm pretty proud of it this is not one of those times this is interesting i like it i still don't understand why i'm half the prompts i'm flattered i guess but although if you put if you put feet on my uh wait what the fudge um i don't even i don't remember john clark i can't remember what he looks like though and it's like it's like that's his shark teeth right this is him as a shark clearly [Music] and then i don't know how i'm supposed to i'll do little gills and i'll do it over here sure and then this guy is this guy [Music] well if you don't know how to draw then leave nothing to the imagination perfect and then and this is shark tooth clearly i have now learned that animals are also not my strong suits animals and people drawing in general so so what are you good at exactly uh i guess talking good luck good luck whoever gets this you are so screwed what the [ __ ] you have to write that though it doesn't
