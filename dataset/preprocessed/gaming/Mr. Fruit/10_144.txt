i'm ready ah okay grenade but you can't go wide i was going wide feeling good feeling good i figured it out guys just aim for the head heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to call of duty vanguard except it's the full release i gotta preface it i don't think i've ever been this disinterested in a call of duty release we'll see maybe it will exceed my expectations or just hop into quick play they did add a cool filter i'll give it to him you can choose tactical for less players in a match assault for usual or blitz for extra people for chaos aka camo grinding let's be honest but i'm just gonna play assault first i have nothing unlocked around hotel royal i did play this once in the beta so i think i know what i'm doing okay well if i look on the map oh it's because we have a uav never mind all right this is a little more my pace i do appreciate the fact that the game did release with an ample amount of maps which is something recent cods have not been doing so it does not go unnoticed appreciate it now come to me i'm ready uh what okay that's a great start okay take it from top who's this thing hello what the fudge now the sensitivity's too low i wish i can still keep making excuses it's my sense bro is someone flanking us okay okay lad yeah yeah what a reactive map we gotta kill first kill baby let's get it it's just getting started folks i can't see a thing wait i killed somebody what jesus oh okay all right all right what was that is the map maybe a little too small i mean i guess that's again nice change of pace you know recent oh my god what is the 80s sensitivity i'm pulling out all the excuses but seriously what the fudge okay all right feeling good feeling good see first kill with sense changes coincidence i think not what is this thing oh my goodness there you go i gotta reload to my little friend huh where are my friends though uh just hold w oh my god oh my god i am overwhelmed love the cave buddy this is so overwhelming the recall is kind of nuts frankly really nuts i forgot you can double time i'm on the go we're sorry boy oh no no i'm in the bathroom powder in my nose gee i don't know what i'm doing but i'm over here people got 20 different games on each map apparently it's also cross platform some people always say pc should be pooping on mouse no i'm ass mouse and keeper should be pooping on controllers so i really need to step this up oh my god i got a uav i got a uav oh my god look at the map but oh okay i'm fine how do i lay prone uh i don't know i don't know oh okay all right no shame in my game oh my suddenly i'm back glide bomb here we go just need one good kill screw you in particular uh oh somebody's down here never monday's dead incredible oh my god now they're behind me what is going on folks ladies and gentlemen it's sassy i got one i'm looking for more how close i want a flamethrower gonna be honest with you i want that to be a thing that happens this game oh i can't see jesus ah come on then i'm playing more careful because i'm not get a flame thrower oh wait a second ah i'm at ammo are you kidding i need ammo wait i have an ammo box hey what do you know isn't that handy if i had the ammo box on me that would am i really out of ammo why would it tell me i'm out of ammo oh okay one more uno mas yeah let's go it's time to light some on fire it's nice to meet you it's a bit hot outside what is hurting me oh oh you're a little cold let me fix that uh it is winter you need to on but no epic music i don't require it but thank you i don't know i have to talk like arnold with my flamethrower now oh you burning girl okay yeah well that come on i died a little easier than i thought but that's okay great start but you know what's not a great start the skill based matchmaking that's going to kick in right after this they are going to be pissed at me okay with the skirt like that little skirt skirt i still got it i still got it shoes yeah i can't see anything yeah yeah when i had the flamethrower i was gonna say ice to meet you but i was like wait that just cannot that's not canon that does not make any sense we always make a little bit faster and i mean i don't know it just feels like everything's faster than usual and that's saying a lot for call of duty but it is what it is through the bush all right how do i where do i go what do i do who am i where am i whoa i'm gonna pull out the pistol that was a different person okay yeah yeah good here we go pistol time nailed it and it was nice and silent oh they never knew aussie wait okay i thought i knew the map and well here i am oh do i have a grenade uh grenade grenade grenade that is a flash i think i don't know what my frag button is ah god but he does is it is it is it is it four is it five it's i i frankly i don't know but i picked up his gun what is going on here okay so what the fudge is the keyboard sprint blah blah blah fire weapon [Music] how's it going over here fellas not good i see until yay oh don't mind if i do a popcorn well i'm not a fan of popcorn gonna be honest i don't like the texture i don't like the way after you chew it it just sits i i have a problem swallowing it i know it sounds weird but it's true i just don't like it okay oh i was gonna say yeah i guess that was a head shot because i don't know how i killed him so quickly i figured out guys just aim for the head why didn't i think of this sooner okay well i did yeah is this game ever going in oh well it's kind of close all right i've got something up in the air careful lads how about another popcorn hurry up yeah hey look at that oh and we can mount of course we can but let him let me out him let me um oh that's just bad timing isn't it come on come on you sassy little backer wait what oh there's an out oh i didn't no you could go on the roof that is embarrassed jesus ah stop it oh my god oh gee you take a break from call of duty and you forget just how panic frenzy cocaine induced freaking jesus i'm am freaking i'm shaking the recoil is a nutty in this game is it just this gun like oh very nice play of the game comrade wow give it up for nico nico nice nice team mvp wait what oh oh this is cool most multi kills most captures most kill streaks called in way to go guys um i like your sh your play the game is weak great job with the kill streaks okay rob what tactical pacing 6v6 i literally queued to not get tactical ah lord what the fudge happened oh that was blitz that makes sense that did feel kind of but that was only 6v6 that really blitz doesn't mean i literally filtered for just assault fine whatever we'll just go blast yellow okay this is going to be crazy welcome to dim young skull oh a sniper don't mind if i do i think i'm gonna try to oh i see you that's a good start there's another one somebody was looking at me where you at huh where you at come on peek back out here oh god i can't see penis guys i don't i don't feel so good i shot you in your dirty little face you and i both know it you should be dead i'm just going to say it just going to say it because it needs to be said because it's true okay sir sir what part of me shooting you're in the el gafescus is getting lost in translation what part of that do does the game and you and i not come to an understanding of that there we go that was a headshot oh there we go okay i don't even know this map but i know this one corner i think we're doing pretty well in this one corner oh god well it doesn't help they just keep putting me here i don't have a choice they don't really have to figure out like oh i wonder where they're spawning and by the same stupid tree ah jesus throw back well i tried once i get down i'm covering you what the [ __ ] what the tickets okay maybe the sniper and blitz not the best play not the best play that was a nice try okay you're already dead i'm going in we're quick scoping how's it look i can't i can't see what okay quick scoping is not alive and well apparently they're right here oh no scope worked just fine that didn't no you don't okay all right all right how about we change it up to anything but that marksman rifle okay m1 okay i already regret bullets what the fudge is impeccable hey master for oh god i need to get warmed up on well death noises again call of duty uh now who makes me want to make sure i'm well practiced right screw that let's run around mp40 i'll start okay okay okay hey guys can we cap a different i'm going to a or something i'm really tired of dying in the same place eight oh you can sit up there that's a thing still spawning in the same exact spot but check this yeet what okay apparently i don't have an arm i can't throw for the life in there you kidding me that's pathetic try a little harder okay self-preservation it's what i advocate for uh okay just throw that over there i don't know happy birthday i think that was a hit marker oh oh i'm tracking something i'm on the hunt and i'm dead not going well i don't know how else to lie to you it's just ah sure sure here we go ready come on it didn't even reach the house well back in world war ii they just couldn't throw the throwing arm wasn't invented yet i guess did i not oh i did kill him uh okay like i'm blind fire kinda sounds tempting wow um not gonna lie he looks a lot like that bush i could not make a distinction between him and that bush my nemesis what am i shooting what am i saying uh jesus crack did you hear that i can literally feel the recoil like oh my god sure okay all right we're going in we're going come at me okay maybe maybe chaos you know bear with me is a little too chaotic i know i know what kind of heresy is this jesus god okay maybe we should learn the maps and stuff first well to be fair it's making me learn the map real fast i wouldn't really say that's the issue what are they dropping by what is this what is this thing what is that what are these things what oh scavenger pouches i think except scavenger on i do have ninja though that's nice that's back in call of duty thank god don't mind me don't mind you can mind me ah you're friendly let's try the other way double double i'm out of damage don't mind me skirt don't ma jesus christ buddy you can't go wide i was going wide guys nice i'm scared you're dead sorry just wanted to make sure you're my friend you are my friend oh oh my god check this hello that's a kill minimum nice capture me now let's see what all the hubbubs about uh up here this is lovely you don't happen to want to die to give me a long-range weapon do you what what what dude these guys just freaking jumping moving going see i can do that too yeah god that ah you're friendly what is this thing automaton preacher ah yes this is my favorite site they used in the world war it's kind of crazy the historically accuracy i'm surprised they included this one it wasn't as well known but you know that doesn't stop there what is this is this a gas grenade or something that's not what i'm looking for that's all i know check it i'm gonna mount this sucker ah that was a mistake i thought it was a machine gun i think it was an smg as you can tell i really know my guns oh okay um let's go back to the sno oh perfect back to the sniper in the sniper's perch come on ow okay everything hurts pretty sure i have a sniper glenn so uh yeah oh you're done for stupid well you freaking bolt the chamber the freaking bullet a little bit no nice we won never fly ice didn't i just play with this person did i i don't know it wouldn't surprise me that day one the skill based matchmaking is already so strong that i'm be matched with the same people but sounds good bless let's see uh most headshots uh-huh i'm probably not on here but it won't hurt me most multi-kills and most captures okay yep can't help but notice i'm not up there but that's okay 22 multi kills what this is a scoreboard ooh i joined the game late oh my 46 elements wait did i i don't want oh we unlocked blown out so let's go oh key weird i know the gunsmith all right it was cool two years ago all right make do something to yourself sorry recoil control all of that less ads speed uh-uh could not be me initial accuracy and recoil yolo i like sprint to fire speed camos all right here we go completionist gold is okay diamond all right okay now here's the new damascus do we bother atomic it is animated in fact it looks very similar to damascus but animated all right well i'm gonna have to decide if i like this game enough to grind for this i'm a mess let's see we got eliminations okay head shots okay are you kid you're not even gonna show me what i have to do at least tell me i suffer for something cosmetic because uh i'm a freak like that [Music] [Music] you
