hidey-ho moon my name's mr. fruit and welcome to the GG over-easy podcast Kaskaskia episode 13 in today's episode you know it yell love it destiny - drama destinies back at it again did your sipping some tea mm-hm we're sipping some tea hey whoa drama on top of that a four-year-old game somehow gets a new review and is rated perfect sure yeah Nani kind of like and then it goes on to bring us more to the fact of video game reviews in general do they mean anything should they mean anything do we believe them do we not what do we look for beyond that we got some more entertainment talk movie shows some more games patron questions life what does it mean did you guys real quick did you guys see the story about the parallel universe up in the air that was one of the questions on the patreon things and I thought that was a joke so I skipped over oh that's real yeah they're like so they discovered in like 2016 or something so apparently up I believe it's like north of the Arctic or something they were they were scanning and they were able to identify and observe I forget the word of exactly the particle it is whatever but normally you would see this whatever it is particle going into the earth but they're actually observing it going like leaving which is absolutely contrary to everything we know which is essentially like if things were going in Reverse and so for the last like three four years they've been essentially hypothesizing and testing everything they know to try and figure out what it is and so far they still haven't been able to figure out what it is or debug or debunk the theory that is an alternate universe but it runs in Reverse time so it's us but everything's playing backwards it's pretty sick dude it's kind of like sci-fi or whatever but unstated but like that's that I mean I'll believe it even if it's not I know I don't know what any of that means and how that proves anything but like but that's the thing like why it was more recently cuz they came out with another like find him like hey we've been trying everything like everyone's like they don't believe us it could be this and we've tried everything and we still don't have an answer so currently it's it's not the answer but it's the running theory and that would be pretty sick so we'd be interesting well what a way to start the podcast hey anyway you guys do it let's get into it [Music] welcome back to this episode of GG overeasy episode 38 that's two away from 40 quick c'mon old whatever it's probably not focusing because it can't contact your eyes because you're wearing white wrong I'm wearing my snowboarding goggles because I have pinkeye he's kind of embarrassed no nobody farted on said pillow lay there but like what if she did is a joke I don't think Cindy would do that I don't at war max I don't think max wouldn't do that to me as I would be quite upset because I this is the first time I've ever had pinkeye and it's awful it is terrible I woke up no I woke up this morning dude and like so like two days ago like the top of my eye just like started itching so I just kept going like this all day like just going just kept going and I didn't think of anything of it and then yesterday I had like a bump there like a bump on my eyelid and then everyone and then I was streaming and then everyone was like it's a sister ah it's just like a sty or something like that it's a periscope I went yeah so I went to go get like some droplets from the Walgreens and all of a sudden I got really scared and was like am I gonna lose my eyeball like because I started losing vision I'm like am I my like that's all I want to know doc is she's like I'm a cashier all right I don't know so listen I heard you for minimum wage like what do you want yeah it's like I woke up this morning at like 5:00 a.m. because that's what max wants his food and I kid you not do like I woke up and it still felt like I was asleep cuz my left I've would just not open and I go to like the mirror and that's when I like I took a picture of it I literally had like a clean glass of like orange goo like pus that had just like like glued over dude and I literally had to like okay we don't need details we can stop it we get it you got pinkeye all right great no I was like I'm good oh it's not that bad that's what's making me sick I don't want I just wanna hear about is that how you wanted to start your morning seeing that picture though have you ever said thanks man I don't think I have go get something with my aside from you know being blind but I don't know speaking live I have well I don't really know why but I haven't gotten an eye exam in a couple years which from me I suck yeah for the regular person it's like okay yeah that's me but if you have people obviously you know the have vision problems you go at least once a year but we blegh we can't move in and you I'm look terrible at that kind of stuff but now I've been getting all these migraines and I'm worried that it might have to do with like it might have to do with like my prescription because I mean usually every year I'm changing my prescription it might be a little gradual uh-huh but I'm thinking like you know add that gradual change over a couple years and then I've been using these same ones so gonna be getting that checked it but I called too by the way called like a week ago and I was like hey like yeah I exam whatever like I've been here before and they're like yeah as soon as we get to his like June 20th like with 20th is according to me like look at pictures and go like that's blue yeah was everyone going blind like what do you mean you don't have an opening till it's uh I don't know we're you don't wear glasses blue do you oh just sometimes wait when you talk you're discord thing like moves that's interesting that's really cool yeah you like that yeah that's very nice Rob joints I will say that I think I'm gonna try and get some new frames though like you know like a new mean like you know rediscover do you mean reinvent myself like my glasses what what they're just normal frames like what else well no I mean I've had bands or something like actually I was looking at them yeah oh now that you specifically said hip lean array band but something because I've these are the same glasses I've worn for the past what five years I think I would I got them because you haven't changed your glasses in five years no because it was I remember in a real dodge ball dodge ball sophomore year of college dude pegs me in the face breaks my glasses into and I was like the quintus like it would early sprit on the bridge of my nose so I was like the quintessential dude that was my only pair so I would early ran around with a taped like in the middle I wouldn't look like that guy yeah so that's when I got these glasses and I've had him ever since so you haven't had like a test in five years and I like fine but he knows or well I think I went in for and they were like well you could change a prescription but like it's pretty like minimal we'll just like check on in like six months and maybe change them in it well here we are four and a half years later whatever so my bad but I'm hoping that's part of the problem but then it has to be migraine episode yeah I've had a couple and the thing to is what sucks is like it's not a one-time thing it when they come it's like three four days of just like waves I just wanna die ya know I want to hopefully figure out whatever the fudge it is well you get a mind great does your vision go or like what are you like cuz when I when I get a migraine my vision gets super blurry and like I just I need us in the dark yeah well I'm definitely photosensitive I mean they like it I can feel specifically I'm like once part of spotted like my forehead when it starts I get like really sharp pain they're pulsating I get really dizzy nauseous like light-sensitive I can't look at screens I can't do anything that's the worst part too it's like if I'm not able to sleep I just lay there like that's my life come with me that's fine anyway let's get into today's episode swinging of Y let's talk about the lie that was yes it'll stretch but I like I wanna hang I literally like wake up and I see Blues tweet about something about the quest and then Kristen says like this is gonna be good and then with our own emoji and I'm just sitting there like hey guys look what what's going on [Laughter] bungees back at it again the answer's no testis not hot right now no and and that's the thing rob des she's not back at it they have been at this for a while now but waiting a few months of terrible bugs it's got some drama hold on hold on oh we do yeah well I have to interrupt you because I we need to call our destiny drama guy and then we need like a bum ba-bum ba-bum or something like here comes the dirty drama a strange penguin uh thank you for joining us our desk my trauma I need my drama lenses for these are destiny - drama guy you're our guy well what's wrong with oh I didn't know there was any drama this week that's all that's a la hi hey because they would have set me up for that one I didn't even see until I like walked in on well in this week's session of [ __ ] that Bungie does which is kind of POG but also sometimes not POG but sometimes it's pretty Park but this week was not Pau recently is this hog in Bunji Bunji decided hey let's have the remember last week Rob we were like hey let's let's form a pvp gun and if yeah and you guys had to like turn in stuff yeah I saw a really funny meme and it was like Toy Story when the kid has like a like a short little thing with any turns and it's like really long like a little short gift and it was really funny and it was looting to that little quest bar so how long it was it's funny thank you for that thank you Thank You future Rob yes Ken does look like you're from the future you look I look like a player like I had the marathon halo is this how you stream today you yeah I did I'm just really self-conscious about it you look sick in it though I it looks kind of a new wave did yeah thank you weave so you disrespect - well I look like it was really funny cuz like I was wearing these does it oh wait I could just wear my oculus rift headset and then I put it on and then I was like can't see wait I can't see the game as soon as my foot was like always anyways so the like quest completed and people wow we get that winter's line now No yes what it the gun quest itself was made available that step the community step was completed on Sunday night right I think something like that yeah people couldn't get the gun until today Sunday the 60 so Sunday the 17th yeah today we're recording this the 21st is when the community event finished and people started going on their merry way to get the felwinter's lie and they probably thought wow I can't wait to get this cool piece of nostalgia weapon from destiny one it's finally put it into my god - your guardian our soul Wow the vanguard is gonna be so proud of me guess what no less was bug yo what are the hidden projects when you started the quest it would take you to eros instead of starting the quest in the bunker so you couldn't do the quest and it was pretty funny because people started thinking it was a secret like Oh to get this fellow shotgun we have to do like there has to be something when you play oh yeah yeah yeah that we haven't figured out it's ya know start streaming - where should be he was like Oh secret yes follow know they're like whoa what's happening is it for turn something out of the bunker is they were screen I wonder oh maybe it's the pyramids and then it's bungee tweeds hey guys so we kind of [ __ ] up and the quest is bugged we're gonna do hotfix one of these days one of these days well I mean to be fair they're like we need to figure out what the problem is and then once we figure out the problem we need your certification so that we don't release it and then it just causes more bugs understand stream where he then realizes oh the quest is just bugged so for about 30 minutes everyone actually thought wow there must be secret to getting this gun but I wish I was watching that now we've been hilarious but it quickly devolved into oh right I guess so I'll wake up tomorrow and then tomorrow it didn't happen and then in the next I guess my wink up tomorrow and then it didn't happen and then they said I guess I'll wake up tomorrow and guess what tomorrow is today cuz we're recording this on yeah yeah and people got the shotgun that is marginally better than all the other behavior shows that was like the door was I kept seeing intestines that's more like I notice Twitter accounts that I follow literally like all they post their destiny to memes and I just can't do it anymore all I saw that [ __ ] was just my timeline full of like the door the door like these memes and I'm over it dude the gun so I don't have to see this easy solution did unmute dork that'll fix your timeline won't be so many destiny memes I mean if that's your problem I rather risky click buddy you know it looks weird this looks like my forehead right here and it looks like these are like small sunglasses I'm wearing right here like just from this little angle that's weird anyway thanks again right that's this weekend Bungie how would you guys do this week ok fine news of so people have the gun now yeah is it try it by the way oh go for your best dusty gets another gun that we've already had job guys was this all worth it from what I have what's the word from what I have deduced from all of the testing people have done the gun is in fact a little better than all the other shotguns we already have apparently it's just like hey did you grind a Gaudreau my madness ambition well here's a fellow hunters line which is great that's gonna not be usable in a year poke yeah we uh we we got this pug as blue was mentioning like you know I got the sake Arsenal for the like the Vanguard they're gonna love this can't wait for them to retire half of this though to bring it back later they look in the 12 today they showed some of the guns that would be in season 11 and lo and behold like it's like this laundry list of guns we already have it's like wow thanks for you can little I think there are more guns that we've had than our new point well it was kind of weird cuz they talked about how they were putting like a universal Engram where they have his vanguard gambit and crucible stuff and I'm just kind of like what why so it has all these old guns from the previous seasons that would that'll useable in season 11 it's like okay cool but like why I want to thing girl why is Ingram not world drops and why is it like just a random like hey pick out a little pick out from one of the it's one of those cheap like carnival like claw box like the one where you claw to get the toy out accept like it's all old toys it's like I'm really no nerd ones that's what it feels like yeah nobody really wants the toys but they they're well I have a token so might as well before we move on fruit how do you feel about the whole Sun setting thing so Phil does that welcome precursor for people who don't know Sun setting basically means that the weapons we have have a time limit from when they're introduced so like say like your guns from the start of shadow key if they're not gonna be brought into the next expansion because they're gonna have their light level cap so fruit how do you feel about this boy I don't even know what that means well it's done it's like retired explain to me like I'm five okay so remember Indy one where you got a gun from vog and then in crotas end the next deal see those guns were [ __ ] because you can't bring them to the next level mm-hmm it's kind of like that but instead of like the next expansion making them obsolete they just have like a year timer on them now essentially before they stopped going to hammer in light level so eventually whatever weapons they decide new season starts or a year from whenever it releases suddenly you can no longer infuse it it's gonna stay behind so you could you could still use it Tecna like really the only place you could use it is in regular PvP that's not light level Mabel yeah but here's the way I see Sun setting I could see it to some degree one though I think a big part of Sun setting is actually a band-aid fix to a bigger issue which is you don't know how to balance her game so instead you're like oh we have these broken guns we don't know do just just take him away they're problems like and it's like well we can't like there's too many damage and reload perks they're so strong and it's like well maybe before primaries didn't hit like pellet guns we would want to have damage boosting remember when like a hand cannon would once have like an acolyte loaf those days are listed in about four years four years back with a cafe hand cannon killer acolyte in most games like you tap an acolyte of all things but yeah so that's what I mean like that and then perk diversity like one like why does everybody use these was because all the other ones either suck or like like the one where it's like crouching gives you boosted accuracy after your shorter manage that's like or like filled whatever that like that or there's some of them where it's like what am I ever gonna use this or it's just hey this does more damage or like hey do more damage and reload faster it was like make more interesting perks to contest with those but anyway the whole sunset anything I think yeah that's a big issue it's like one if you get down to it it seems like that's part of the issue they're like hey we don't know what to do but then it became even more evident which is when I like walled or I had like a popcorn tweed the Blues tweet cuz I didn't read the table yet I think when I saw boys tree is like you gotta be kidding me and turns out that they essentially said hey we're sunset him some guns so we can take them away from you but then like a year reintroduce him and you can get in for him again it's just and I'm not against it if they can introduce cool guns to go along with it but the way it's awarded it just kind of seems like we're just gonna be going through the cycle of weapons we've already had like at this point they're like yeah we instead of coming up with new stuff we're just gonna take away your current stuff and then bring it back later it's even worse than what they're doing with d1 guns it's like imagine it's like if they we didn't have the d1 gun the Breathitt do you want gone back but then they're like hey we're sunsetting this d1 gun again wait there's and now we're gonna reintroduce it guns oh well we don't know specifically but like what I'm saying is like instead of making new interesting gear they're just taking away some of your current ones to then reintroduce them later I'm saying the same doubt because hopefully they do introduce weapons in a time like you know in a quantity enough and a timely enough manner that people are like oh there's enough guns for me to use but we don't even get that now so I'm yeah there's nothing to say we're not getting that now but you think that you're gonna get that later so I'm a little apprehensive obviously but the other problem is like why is Armour getting sunset oh yeah that's stupid wait I thought your armor is getting transmog like you can transmog armor it's gonna get smog but you still have bro you and I both dude I don't know I don't understand why armor is getting sunset when armor is already basically fashion game like every piece of armor turns into the same thing ultimately like I'm gonna re-roll to void and make sure like have all the sniper and hand cannon perks on my gun right so it just kind of seems like an artificial way like making you spend your ascendant and enhance with prisms which is like okay nobody has those right now anyways if you don't play the game yeah so it's like all right weird I don't know why you want to do that like it's like people like get armor because they want the perks on the armor because those don't exist anymore they want the armor cuz it looks good so I me transmog makes this hurt a little less I don't know how their transmog system is gonna roll out because I don't even know what's gonna come out with the expansion I don't use any gear right from your one your two to make it look like but letting like use the stats from another thing yeah right okay well no you can't use that such as pure appearance not what I'm saying is like the pure pearance it's the way ornaments work Leah now pretty much okay yeah so they've been blending away where you could turn any piece of armor into an ornament which is tight a long time coming this makes armor sunsetting not her thing when d2 came out a step forward and three four five steps back yeah my main problem with sunsetting is one that I've talked about a lot and it's probably the core issue most people have when people like refer to like well this is how it works and mmo's don't you know that it's like okay false equivalence one because most most web most gear in MMOs are just at sticks like like oh plus this intelligence plus kill speed they don't actually change the core fundamentals of what your character does which is based on like I level up I get new skills these skills are with me forever right unless they're balanced or they're changing future updates or they're upgraded blah blah blah blah the problem is in destiny our gear is our character like we don't have our weapon our weapons increase our damage we deal our weapons make [ __ ] explode exotics themselves do all kinds of different things it's a good thing exotics are being sunset but our legendary gear defines our character so imagine you are rolling in an MMO and then the next expansion you have to like start leveling up abilities you had the previous expansion that would be ridiculous you'd be dumb like know every like why kill trees why am i regrinding the skill tree I already grinded from the last expansion that that's the closest to true comparison of what is happening because most mmo's have bought Rondon and most animals have more content and most MMO Street little stat sticks better than destiny treats their guns because I can transmog my stat stick like in Final Fantasy I have this sick [ __ ] level 66 like Dome and steel gun blade of course I can't like bring it stats to level 80 but I can transmog it on to my current gun blade and blow and behold I have this sick [ __ ] dome and steel gun blade on my back I could take that [ __ ] with me forever if I wanted to and that's tight because I'm connected to that gun so it's just kind of weird to me that Bungie is like and a lot of community is like you know man like as a game to have like I hate seeing people love their loot like that's just bad player engagement you know so I don't know we'll see what happens I'm very skeptical stop augers I don't give him any benefit of that anymore yes Rob oh thank gosh I was wondering mr. West slow is there anything I was about to ask you've been getting back into final fantasy lately Final Fantasy Final Fantasy is Thai is there anything you would like to see from Final Fantasy 14 everything but you move into destiny - pretty much everything like what specifically what like what is your biggest thing you wish Bungie would take from Final Fantasy in put it in scope so one of the biggest things for me and Final Fantasy is there's all this old content I could do and the game respects my time because all that old stuff is relevant to my endgame because most of that stuff can all that stuff can be transmog so if I see something cool I get a really old onion I'm like oh sick like that would be like cool fashion like I can put that on my glam plates which are like like just pure cosmetic look like yeah you don't want to go do that dungeon because you can make your current gear look like that because it looks yeah exactly and then there's there's this entire mount grand which hopefully destiny has is moving the direction of where all these old dungeons you can do like extreme versions of trials and they'll give you mounts you can grind out like these factions which give you like unique armor unique gear unique mounts unique [ __ ] everything honestly there's so many different vendors that give you so many different things and when I'm playing like I'm like I got dead orbit Sparrow if you got to like level faction 100 or something like that even if there was dead orbit so the biggest thing for me in Final Fantasy is everything's an investment so no matter what you're doing you're always working toward something that is like a progression system so you sign up for your alliance you're like the storm [ __ ] faction and I could get like currency from that for that faction just by doing like my daily roulette stuff which is like you know like normal dailies when I do normal daily as I get like bonus xp for a club for my classes so if I won't have multiple classes I want to level up i just do my dailies and i have a reason to log in every day to level up like get extra xp for leveling classes or there is um like if you want to get to like the max level that's like not rate here then you can grind those dailies as well to get like cool little what's the word basically there's always something for you to do that has a theory that's behind it there's so much to the economy that when you do one thing you're doing multiple things for other things and then there's also really specific things like there's like relic weapons you could do to get like really unique weapons that you don't get anywhere else you can you can like right now there's an event with mughal tome stones where they bring back mounts that maybe you couldn't get before and you grind out like certain dungeons they have listed like oh this dungeon gives you cool mughal tome stones you could and you could use those tom stone so by these cool mounts maybe you didn't get [ __ ] yeah it's show it's so exhaustive like there's just so much the game and this is how it is it every other MMO is they still respect what the previous expansions did they don't make them totally irrelevant and it kind of feels like Bungie has never figured out how to do that so when someone new comes in 99% of the time until they get to like level whatever level we are right now you play like the brand new expansion you're playing that and it's like you know that matters none of that matters none of that matters no that matters yeah you don't care about that oh you finally got to last wish okay now you could start doing stuff yeah so I don't know if there's just so much I mean there's there's a reason every bows are called mmo's right they're massively multiplayer online there's ridiculous amount of content but if but there's just no complexity to like destiny is like okay there's Vanguard gambit and then cryptarch has like them some some cool engrams for you okay what else is there there's some planetary vendors Oh what do they give some armor oh cool do they give any cool weapons or anything or sparrows no oh oh no that's been updated since vanilla by the way that's been updated ah yeah no not really so when do I get to start playing the game oh when he gets around Forsaken except those guns are gonna be retired so hopefully one last which yeah so it's um I split on Tuesday actually I still play destiny right it's just I just been playing Final Fantasy more I wasn't so much Final Fantasy dude um I don't know why I didn't grab me it's it's super fun man every time I saw my Simo if he should say blue Wessel playing destiny to my heart would like you're better than him blue finger better well speaking of better King oof gaming moments over watch IGN's for ye is a four-year like overwatch retrospective review or something so god only knows what guess there's nothing else to do so they're like hey it's been four years since overwatch came out let's review it and then they reira view it and give it a perfect score they get a 10 out of a 10 what do they love them now it's a perfect game Rob feels about this as rob was the overwatch guru I don't know every ranked season Rob would be in there in the trenches firsthand with fair up in the day sure but like oh my let's just say it was like three years ago two and a half years ago yeah there's a play played that in so long now I know way amazing there's no way they give it a perfect now and they actually played it it has to be Li rose-tinted glasses back in the day I would have been like oh I got it for when it first came out I've got a nine point four on its first review and now somehow just liked and it got a perfect tenth it's a masterpiece it says over watches a masterpiece a dizzying amalgam of unique characters a stunning style and compelling a dynamic action that's literally all it says and then ten never mind the fact that they keep adding new characters that completely break their game and then they have to figure out how in the world to fix their game and they can't ruin Genji and they never make ng relevant again and blue never comes back because then they change Hanzo skit completely and now blue doesn't want to play any of the weeb classes are now gone the bereaved I'm over watches a one-of-a-kind hero sheer that is far and away the best of its genre Team Fortress 2 still exists I mean that is true though I wish we had more hero shooters you think but you you think overwatch is the best hero shooter out right now I'm an I have more funds with Pendleton's that's and people say that's budget at this point you're coming up and probably more power than overwatch videos that's true I mean recently like I would if I had to choose right now make overwatch content for the rest of my life or palaces paladins I would I would lose my mind the power channel I just you know I mean we kind of like briefly touched on and there was a whole drama when we did that one video but like to come back four years later and give it a better rating than it had it launched to say it's perfect when it's been on a downward trend like is insane it just makes and it offers variety depth and a style that very few come too close to matching see I would argue the variety the part too there's not much right I mean costumes yeah like there's one art style too as far as it and the lore is cool I like the lore of overall I do like the character there's like two paragraphs per character Ematic like nobody nobody does it like Blizzard does and the art style is super sick but man it's like overwatch was like a game that I started playing and I was like dude this game was gonna be sick and then like they developed it like it was an early access title like everything changed constantly and at that point like you come back two years later and it's like wow this is nothing like what I remembered did I think this is the funniest line in this whole thing it's four year old Foundation has been lovingly crafted into an unparalleled multiplayer experience that it offers today they really think that overwatch has been like been like like love didn't like taking care of it like if anything it has been beaten tortured yeah run through the ringer kicked out made combat layoffs so bad from now it's now cherished characters and expertly crafted maps to to outstanding sound design and dynamic action it's a masterpiece of competitive gameplay most importantly of all though it's never stopped being ridiculously fun after all these years that it has to be like an IGN overwatch Stan Stan yeah you're like yeah some guy who's like puts in 200 hours every week still there like hey write a review he's like yes good for them but like I mean I can't argue with a lot of that stuff like audio of course great graphics great like Maps like so much of the stuff is great and yet somehow you put it all together and you jump in again you go I hate my life I hate like everything is here why is it not clicking like that's honestly what it feels like like for some reason it clicked a little bit more like three years ago but now I go in and like what what is this yeah it's just a clown fiesta of just a mess that doesn't know what it wants to be it's just I hate it I hate it I mean literally the only problem is like the sandbox because I can't even complain like as far as I've always you know played like input lag latency hit registration I can't be like freaking Blizzard servers they suck like no they're pretty solid they've always been solid like a little I like the comp rating system when I played that's a lot of it the characters do have interesting kits and stuff like that's not but like for some reason you just go in and it sucks I think a big problem like that is like it's just slowly been refined gameplay wise more and more and more into just death ball like group as five less skill intensive because like that's the problem is like a lot of the big old DPS players used to love to watch like macri's widows ginji's Hanzo is all set like irrelevant now I can't just get jumped on auto-away and thank the other DPS are very low like Reaper where you just hold left click and this I stand in front of things q right so yeah maybe that's part of it again we tied about maybe you know just chain they back it up with this all of these factors combine to make overwatch a singular a singular special shooter and one that I would recommend to anyone without hesitation would you recommend overwatch ah if they've never honestly if they've never played it I would say probably and they've been good fun out of it yeah and then just staying low you all just like had that game you learn if you're learning PC gaming like have that maybe be the game you learn it on I mean that's that's really not a bad game to introduction to PC Mackay that's what I learned on yeah and there's always there's interesting characters people can grab a day too and like so I mean like I would but like at the same time but then it's like would you like what would your guys's video what would you guys give overwatch today if you guys were the IGN reviewer and you did a review good man if it would be a little rough that was four years ago I would've given over I was like a nine and a half to attend yeah original scores at nine point six came out with that very like when it launched I would have probably given it a 10 just because it was I mean like just an evolution of hero shooters and then man like now I would probably give the game like a six and a half seven yeah like I think at launch I wouldn't have given it a perfect until because I think it took him like two weeks or something - only to uh to put out comp yeah because like after a week week and a half it felt like okay like quick place fun but like I naive yeah like indeed there needs to be something else and when comp came out then it was perfect you have this for like casual yup this for competitive I think that's where was it at its peak but then yeah like now I mean that's the hard part is like fundamentally you look at the game you'll get everything that's got going for it you like dude it's good he's 40 yeah like this but for some reason you can't even pay me to play like a game cuz I just don't have fun and I don't know what that factor is whatever is going on there but yeah for that fact alone I give it like a 5 or 6 which I don't think it's fair like that's why I said like don't get me to review it but like for me like I'd put that a guy doing it dude and no point am I ever like you know what I'm gonna hop on some overwatch yes I haven't felt that in two and a half three years like I don't even know hey you know what's fire it off time yeah let's play some a Hanzo right and then you hop in you just get jumped on by Winston's left you all right I'm out what about you blue what's your score for overwatch he said like 6-7 yeah I'd be like six six and a half just like I'd be [ __ ] all over the game I'm yeah I'm just I'm bitter don't listen to me like a bitter old lady you know what you should listen to this yeah you're still using one

the most honest things at the most perfect most perfect destiny the right time you know four years later did you know what the world needs o an overwatch review so I took it upon myself boilers I wrote that article Oh overwatch guys trust me I'll do customs again come back somebody had to have written it like a year ago and they're just saving it like all right it's a real slow day alright just throw it up fries and they like change it from like three-year review to like for you just put every minute for like all right put it up but that leads us to and blue is gonna lead us into video game reviews in general yeah so I mean obviously we don't agree with that video game review in any way shape or form and over the years especially over the past five years or so it kind of seems like video game reviews have become less and less relevant toward the consumer perspective so I'm wondering if you guys or pretty much any of us actually still take video game reviews seriously because I remember back in the day I would look at review scores and I'd be like all this game oh yeah 95 out of a hundred arey bro yeah when games like that it's like pro game GameSpot gave it a 10 bro Nintendo Power 9 and a half or just get it Nintendo Power reviewing the newest Mario game yes and I didn't have no bias there definitely but uh I mean how much do video game reviews matter you guys now can I in terms of like like a big like medium art like an IGN or like a GameSpot spot most of those places are like paid like hey if you like I get I'm not sure if it's like public but like it fits I got under the table hey like give us a good review like we'll hook it up a little bit or like it was clearly like clearly like that guy who loves overwatch too is clearly like can't take his bias out of that opinion at all so you also have like take into account who the reviewer is and smokes the time the reviewers just some random like I'm looking up at this what this guy's reviewed in the past this guy and the only other games he's ever reviewed our other FIFA games like I'm not gonna take advice from a guy who's only ever reviewed a FIFA game which is the same [ __ ] game for the past 20 years and gives it a 9.2 every single year my innovation this year is insane yeah pulls on anything I get my I get my like game reviews from like you guys or the angry Joe show or something like that I watch him or I'll come to you guys and if there's something like a game that you genuinely like I know you guys are gamers so I normally just go to my gamer friends if I have like any kind of review on my yeah you guys are gamers I would say I gave up caring not only on those reviews but reviews entertainment reviews in general like a couple years Oh even like movie reviews you don't like rotten tomatoes like you don't really that's the only one I kind of hold my metrics to cuz here's the thing as far as reviews go now first off I think we've talked about this rating scales are garbage and they don't give any good indication because you could get like the worst video game ever know but 6 out of 10 let's go fingernail to pigtail Oh score like you'll never find some well like 6 out of 10 like it muddies the score like I think that's a name that's a 9 and it's eight point two seven point five they all hover around the same it's like what okay give me a breakdown what exactly is like factoring in the score I still believe review should would early like for video games let's say it's what I really like don't purchase like borrow your friends account get it yourself must buy like something like that we're truly just like essentially skip it may be a one-time play or like this is this is the game at least that gives some a little more of a metric but I think the rating system in general is garbage it doesn't get me anything and the only time I pay attention to reviews is when it's a big game and it's flopping is then that's usually more indicative because like well and then that's usually okay like that okay this is probably a sign of something let me look into it but otherwise every review a da did out of ten eight and a half out of ten every game now it's eight eight eight and a half nine asleep yeah okay I don't really know the difference anymore so for me I it's usually like is this and it interests me and what do I have fun with it it doesn't have to be a perfect game but do I have fun with it and so that's the same way for me with movies I'll find that some not critically acclaimed movies or like even some movies that are like rated rotten or whatever I still go huh yeah knows knows entertaining I'm mad I Pro and watched again I don't watch like anything in but I like yeah like I don't regret watching that once and then I go like I wonder what it got like 12% like oh okay yeah like that's the same way like some videogames it's like it's just the reviews are so skewed the scales don't make any sense and like Rob was saying mais a conspiracy ten-four thing but it seems like majority of the time there is something going there isn't underlining something with a lot of these reviews yeah I mean there are big media conglomerate that gets a lot of readers and clicks man of course they want like cuz like to the normies you see IGN like because we're we're woke guys we're well yeah gamers bring out we're woke alright so we don't look ideas in the gaming community like is not whoa they're asleep yeah they sleep and read IGN we're out of the matrix we took the red pill [Music] everyone keep it on every podcast if I said any guy forever do you take any review seriously though I used to for sure but as time went on its kind of become like most of the games I'm into you know like aren't even like reviewed well on from reviewers in general like what pub G was didn't even get reviewed until like way late in the game like fortnight didn't even actually reviewed cuz all everything like really access now most of the time to what I look for is like you give me the TLDR like bullet points like con yeah like pro con pro calling a general overview - so I can get a feeling for their rating but then aside from that it's like I'll play it for myself or ask somebody I know yeah um sorry I didn't mean to interrupt but just talking man it's pretty much it I mean it's kind of just gotten to the point where I don't even get my information from neat like gaming websites anymore it's all through like Twitter if you like Reddit yeah people play they get like you could literally watch people like if you're interested in the game and you're not sure it's good or not you could literally watch which anybody on YouTube or twitch nowadays to get like a direct like what you're looking for whereas on gaming reviews science it's always like bits and snippets and yeah oh yeah well this was pretty cool as opposed to like I could lure just watch this dude do exactly what I'm looking for to see if I want this game or not yeah I do that too even me I look up other creators like have they made someone this was it like yeah so I just looked it up I looked up the the 10 the only 10 out of 10 zài jiàn has ever given okay so I guess throw overwatch on this list now these are all depends modern games that IGN has ever given a tenant attentive what is modern like 10 20 years like you don't know prison it just says modern whatever that means persona 5 Royal never played how does my current a halflife Alex they gave that a ten out of ten weeds nom red red dead redemption to that got a ten out it said God of War the newest and most reasonable got a ten out of ten Celeste received the ten out of ten Mario Super Mario Odyssey got a ten out of ten undertale still need to play that game The Legend of Zelda breath of the wild I got a ten out of ten um a game called inside I don't know what that is it looks kind of spooky the witness that's that puzzle game that I still won't need to beat that got a ten out of ten Metal Gear Solid 5 the phantom pain I know blue played that a lot that game was tight GTA 5 got a ten out of ten The Last of Us which I blew I read the leaks and let me tell you Wow The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword I never play this guy works for our time I thought the I thought the Wiimote was wack I was like that stupid I don't want to do I gotta respect that I gotta respect uncharted 3 drake's Deception i've never played an uncharted game i played the multiplayer at opponent as I missed the first two because we I had 360 pac-man championship edition um Red Dead Redemption undead nightmare that was like the zombie DLC oh she had my little brother played that a lot Super Mario Galaxy 2 I think the Super Mario galaxy's are wack gta4 I never really played GTA I don't know if you guys did that one at least in my household nice ma'am probably another blue Westall game here Metal Gear Solid 4 guns - really one of the best games of all time this is not disputable really that would not use me as ten ever IG I got it right pokemon red/blue it's mean obviously huh like what and then The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is the last one I had a 10 out of 10 and now overwatch four years later 10 out then okay I pulled the list up let me break down roughly at least the games I can like speak to I'm not gonna be like I didn't play that game that game sucks I can't do that right half-life Alex though I will stay from what I've seen and stuff as far as like a VR game from what at least from a viewer perspective that looks very like yeah I like that looks like at least for what we currently have like that if you're gonna play VR like that right now is the game so I would say again I haven't played it but just from a viewer point like especially for being like well for a VR game I definitely think that would make sense well sim Red Dead Redemption - we have to know that this is not taken in the multiplayer this is the story and off that I would say yes I agree stories Fanta I mean like everything you did the immersion characters storytelling open-world I mean like when you get dirty like your clothes eventually get dirty like that's cool I mean I just yeah it was very close to like I mean it's arguably like the best cowboys simulator we have right God of War I mean that might be my game of all-time so I would say 100% yeah the decade like best game ever for me Wow I was super impressed that game so that's up there Celeste oh the Valkyrie Queen check how long did that take you took me about our 15 hours I think well so he was doing it on like Valkyrie difficulty whatever like literally like the hardest I was doing it on my god yeah I was like I think regular difficulty but I remember when I fought it my gear level is like three levels below which was like bare minimum to fight so if I had had the right gear oh it would have been over yeah way over personally I love I love fights like that because I was actually thinking about this I like the shower didn't maybe it was today I don't know I think it's I think it's my OCD because I love pattern recognition like that like I like things to make sense and I like fighting bosses like that things because yeah because then I can I can identify and I know okay I see this this is what's gonna happen and then I like to learn the entire fight and then I know every like quote-unquote pattern I don't know because I was thinking back to like I love the Valkyrie fight it was like frustrating but there's that thing about that and like those games like the souls games and stuff it's like identifying patterns and then nailing it like check your own all kind of stuff so I loved that final boss fight Celeste I've only heard one good things about the story and it apparently does a really good job just you know I'm well I haven't beat it but I made a video on it but it does a really good job apparently touching on like some social aspects especially like depression and whatnot and then the platforming itself super impressed with hmm and some people say it's like the snappiest best feeling platformer out there and even the bits I played I was like this I like we really want exactly everything like literally when I was done I wanted to play more just because the gameplay felt that satisfying it's strange but they did a super good job of that so I'd agree with that Super Mario Odyssey I can't say I played it I know most people pretty much every Super Mario game is tight just because Nintendo puts a lot of effort into it i watch donkeys right and I was like no I guess they stop Donkin a video yeah I'm down perfect game they're like okay see like there is a good example of a quote unquote review I like like when donkey does the reading trust it somebody I trust but also on top of that one while he doesn't have like any underlying motives like for instance like we're sitting you're like are they paid just the fact alone that like it raises those questions already kind of yeah like if donkeys is either because he hates her loves it and there's no reason behind it so when he makes a video like that not only that but like he goes into why he goes into the the like that's the intricate part and the gameplay specifics and he'll relate it to other things if he can or or if it does something well what exactly does it do well and why does it do well compared to what it doesn't do well we're like when he does review it's very in-depth and it doesn't mince words and it's like I understand like I watch that as like I've played Super Mario she I watch dunk dunk YZ video undertale again have not I know it took the world by storm a little bit the little thing where you move the heart it's pretty fun I see a lot of cuphead I know it's I mean I'm cooperating out of ten dude I love Kappa that's cheese that's one of my favorite games yeah so undertale again can't speak much to it but i know especially as far as like indie games i feel like that one and like star do and i guess you could go back further to like braid and fez and stuff but i feel like those are some of those ones that like when people think like yeah like think any games it's like those are the indie games like the ones that really took off especially undertale is more recent says you're august 15 2017 so like any crazy I would say it was more like 2011 2012 and that's when everyone's like wait a minute you can like actually survive making a video game by yourself or with a couple people but I think what they did was really cool Legend of Zelda breath of the wild I will say I have played didn't finish but it lost me so for me I wouldn't I wouldn't give it a perfect I still think was a great game I'd give like a nine but a perfect I don't know I think you both have played it so feel free to disagree with me oh I didn't bee I'd like ocarina of time better I can't get are you kidding for me I can't give more Zelda games in a series of ten like there can only be one ten at his other series that's all Carina time blue what are you what are you standing on breath and well I think breath of all is the best Zelda game of all time Oh while also being one of the best video games of all time but I will gives at this though the breath the wall is the most drastically different from any other Zelda instruments it's so different from a given that it's very different and that's why I liked it so much yeah that's why I don't like it as much I've never I don't know if I'm ever going to get to like there's been so many open-world games right and with breath of the wild it was like it's like the first time you you how do I describe it it's like the first time you watched like uh like a crazy computer-generated flick right like you really saw something that was uncanny and you're like wow like dude this is crazy like like how people felt when they smell like that Avatar movie the first Jurassic Park yeah yeah drastic park yeah that's another good example and there's plenty of movies that are back in the day there's plenty of movies too already did that stuff but when they did it it was like whoa like this is nuts and that's how I feel about the wild where there's so many open-world games but when breath the wall did it was like holy [ __ ] like I'm never gonna experience a game like this I might not ever experience a game like I just did ever again what map is bigger GTA 5 or Bethel of well I also don't think that's quite I don't know the size but it is quite fair kitchen sir yeah I don't know which ones bigger and that really doesn't matter because they do density yeah they both do completely different things like a breadth of wall I can appreciate scenery but at the same time like when I go over a hill I'm like man like legit I was like man I wonder what's gonna be over that [ __ ] hill like what's good what's gonna be there for me to explore and like literally on lunch back when I was at my old job literally I brought my switch in and I had one of those stupid like commercial moments was like what did you do over your lunch break and they were like oh I hate some sushi and then I'm like over here about a Hobgoblin yeah well I went to a secret shrine at the top of a hidden mountain and slayed a dragon to free from its mortal coil what did you do like I just had a leftover tuna sandwich well I would say to I think the problem was like from when I did play it I did enjoy it but I think for me I was also fatigued just on open-world games because that was around the time and I mean I feel like it's starting to make a bit of a resurgence too but there's just so many open-world games and for me I needed something more linear at the time so again like I I don't really have anything bad to say about the game it's my play I had fun it was just I would just give it a 9 just because like I I didn't finish it but again I think like like like I said I don't have anything knock it on and like you said like your opinion on that game isn't the first one I've heard of that like people who play that game like almost everyone's like I loved it and even for a lot of people who didn't hardcore game like that too with like a switch tried breath of the wild they're like yeah I have like 200 hours in it that's more than my candy crush like so I do think he did something really cool and I do appreciate - like you said like that's pretty drastic compared to like what we would have expected from a Legend of Zelda yeah so I can understand why I made the list I guess just on my personal list it wouldn't make it just cuz I should go back and give it no chance or maybe I will the second one but but it seems like aside from nostalgia unlike Ocarina of Time most people seem to think that this is now the best Legend of Zelda I know you hate to hear wrong but then there is inside which i haven't played but I know it's the like a spiritual successor to limbo which is another one of those andy games I put on that list of like kind of spearheaded like the indie game movement any game boom never played it but again like the limbo it appeared to be amazing so the witness that's that puzzle game dude that it's actually pretty sick I actually really like it I've I've gone back to it every now and then it's pretty fun I like my ankles my only experience with the witness his launch day there'd been all this weird talk about his weird bizarre game it's like let me check it out lyrics streaming it I check it out and I've never felt more like twitch at that day sitting here watching and try to do a puzzle that is like to me I was like well is what it I like this is the tutorial dude like it's really like oh my god I was literally bad like type in chat like I'm like I'm that guy right now and I just got so infuriated that yeah that like that was my experience that was all my experience I was just so upset and then I was also like wow I'm too invested in this like I need to stop watching those like pets I'm I'm that guy in chat right now cusp there's only two times that's happened that one and then one time I was watching summit and see a thieves and he had a treasure map sweet Jesus he could not find the X and what early chat - I wasn't typing but chat was with me and they're like would it like dude laughed and he's like ignoring he's like I can find it guys it took him like two hours and it's a sea of thieves chest like it's not rocket science it's like an island and it's only so big poof I got heated that he at that time but yeah as far as the actual game the witness I don't know that's my experience [Music] I don't think I don't think you put it heavy blue witness no I have not I could I would not stop hearing about that game though and I was always interested but he's never I should cuz I do like puzzle games I just like that's a game they like I wouldn't probably do a video or stream on cuz for the city that same reason there's always somebody that's like well I would have figured that out earlier like I saw the soldier I've played through the game three times and I can't believe you don't already know how to do everything it's like that Jesus Metal Gear Solid 5 the phantom pain we got blue over here who's the stand i only ever used it to like make a little funny montage video so i don't really have much i just knew it was fun to like parachute people up did enjoy that of course all the tweets about quiet she's like that girl in the story that has like the weird eye shadow and she's only wearing like it a bra or something she has like torn leggings it like yes yes yeah you'll know when you li yeah it took Twitter grandtheft out of five doesn't surprise me I mean same thing is like oh yeah as far as Red Dead Redemption like what they tried to accomplish the scale and what they did not only that but the multiplayer like in the story too like everything about that game like they really delivered on can't really argue that one the Last of Us I haven't played it but again I've only heard great stuff Legend of Zelda no I am I need to before the second one Skyward Sword I'll be honest I don't remember the name that name it's the one where the Wiimote was the first thing I think right Twilight Princess was right after right before I sold my wii so I never had Skyward Sword earned him because that's when I sold it to get halo 3 uncharted 3 I can't and I can't say much about that one I did hear good things but yeah they came out in 2011 so the first three uncharted I couldn't even play because I had Xbox home Oh um these other ones pokemon red/blue let's go I would say about we're Pokemon games haven't gotten a ten out of ten though I'm not like heartgold needs a ten out of ten that one's up there but I still found a card because I think the reason poem unwritten you put red and blue up there is because it's the first pretty much well one game of its kind like Pokemon like there's a reason you know you'll say like oh this is a Pokemon like game right like Pokemon pretty much made that genre of monster catching and voila or at the very least you know mega popularized it yeah they made there with a formula and on top of that because it's the first one like it's not like well they could have added this quality like this was the the start like the framework and because of what they did and at the time everything like they're pushing boundaries I you it was pretty groundbreaking and it mean it's the reason why Pokemon is what it is today if it wasn't for red and blue now as for like more recent games it's because like this is pokemon red and blue but twelve years later and they just added a keychain pokemon poison they just don't they're not changing the formula they're not like pushing boundaries like like Legend of Zelda breath of the wild like that's pushing banner like yo why I did not expect that there hasn't been a Pokemon game where I'm like wow I did not expect that Korona it was like Coronas not gonna last that long and it was like diamond it was like pokemon diamond and pearl underneath it it was like Corona yeah I think that's the reason you would have the originals up there but then yeah kind of same story with the recent ones when we've touched on blue and I play with the whole Pokemon bit but it's just game day just played to to safe they have a formula they know it works I really do and then Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time yeah which Rob I know you disagree with that shouldn't be up there like a whole new rating system aiming that game taught me how to do puzzles plain as I will say I came from me more than elementary school I agree with most of those are like literally the ones that I've played at least I can be like yeah I understand that so for the most part I agree or maybe it's a good now we throw over watching their now right yeah but to see then it's like no no no Butte about yeah I mean that's that's a tough sell though those a lot of at least overview of perfect scores I agree with most of those but again also those those are ones are easier like it's a lot easier though to look at a game that great and just be like wowzers but then you get like like when you know Ubisoft was like cranking out Assassin's Creed every year it's like 9 no no I don't actually know what the ratings were but like it wasn't even like oh they couldn't like this is great or they'd be like you know what a little same same not much changed graphically wasn't great it had some stuttering performance issues glitches story didn't really sell me honestly it didn't really add upon anything in the Assassin's Creed 8.7 like what I feel like that's where review so often to it I don't I don't get it hopefully you know we will understand what this angry how welcome back ladies and gentlemen the GG over easy we talked we we have so far stayed on brand for a good bit of video game talk I don't know if that's good clear been pretty good three topics died for us so I feel like most of the listeners are right they're actually staying on topic did three oh wait speaking of which hey while I work us into the next topic somebody want to get us a review let me see a podcast before we do that I'll sauce you up like Zack Snyder's trying to sauce up the Zack Snyder comics justice oh my god how could it be that much better like what I'm only interested because if I were gonna turn out s tear or it's gonna be like The Big Chill just a giant was still [ __ ] what's-his-face in the movie like that does it change I mean that's still one of the worst yeah of course maybe in the Zack Snyder cut Lex Luthor is just not in it well I think oh there's a lot of problems with that and we'll have to see how he cuts it I have no idea but I do remember like even that release this there was that all this talk like Zack Snyder had a cut but Warner Brothers or DC or whatever's like no and then they did and Zacks in I didn't agree or whatever in blah blah blah and then it hits the movie theaters and then it like bombs so we've been waiting for this for a while and I I'm with blue I'm here I'm interested because it's either gonna be like wow DC messed up like they wouldn't be a joke right now if they actually did this or it's like well now Zack Snyder you like nice one like nice to me that's probably the play right I mean uh he's got a tall order ahead of him because it's Mott it's gonna be way easier for it to go poorly then it is to go well and while people so we'll see if you guess guess me what rotten tomato gave Justice League and I'll say the fans the fans what are the fans give Justice League uh 53 blue 40 the fans gave it a 71 you know actually not bad they were a lot nicer than I'd be I actually didn't hate eight what else who didn't like now I will say again I hate the filter I like batfleck right I thought bad [ __ ] was pretty good man all right yeah I am really upset they didn't go further with them do you think they are end of the resolution and the conflict is because they have the same mother's name in Zack Snyder's version I hope not but I think that's gonna be that's gonna be pretty hard to work out that were like that's exact center watching that happening he's like exactly because unless they have an alternate like footage of that pin a pinnacle moment there's no other way for you to realize other on the same team so we'll see okay no we have it I am from outlet for ties now for 20 stars I've been watching mr. fruit and the dream team for a long time in fact you could say that they've even helped me a lot in my tween years with their destiny videos now that I'm in high school I watched mr. fruit and still play destiny to wring out regrettably this podcast is great to listen to while I sit back and relax it also keeps you engaged with insightful conversations and amazing chemistry it truly feels like a grid like a group of longtime friends and I'm really happy I've gotten to watch them for so long love you rob blue and fruit thanks outfit was very nice and wholesome and I really just need a random one and usually should we be worried that he admits he has poor judgement with destiny too so does that mean his poor judgment and content no no I was expecting him to be like you helping my twins but then I grew up and realized wait a minute there was a stupid reddit post only find it on the mr. freak separate what's called it's called what happened and essentially like I've been subscribed miss true since the summer of the end of taking King been a huge fan blah-blah-blah-blah-blah I haven't watched a video of his and actually enjoyed it in almost six months I'm definitely not saying that his videos have become bad have you not watched just that they've changed but I can't really put my finger in how how they've changed does anyone else feel similar and then like you're changing and you're just becoming somebody different and you can watch other content without making people feel shitty about it that's just what it is there's nothing about us that's change is something about you that is changing and there's still nothing wrong with that worst part is is like I'm putting more editing more effort and editing here and it's six months like suck I mean someone does have a good point like part of it might be the fact that like games pretty dry right now like we don't have a like a channel and us we don't really have a main game right now there hasn't been one I mean not even destiny anymore does that's just a mean mm-hmm I think that's probably part of it but I mean at least for me yeah but I still just isn't when I make a video I'm like this is a Bhangra dude and then it's like I still have fun recording Hey all right Nelson I'll send that 20 to your paypal later things speaking of television I know Christian is a big Stan of this series or I guess franchise snowpiercer did you watch premiere i I'ma be honest until like a week ago I think it was a thing me either I saw I was like I saw an ad on like Twitter like scroll through like snowpiercer you're appearing on like TNT there's something like TV shows like wait what you're about this so yeah there's like a new snowpiercer show on TNT that is based on the books in the movie and obviously I mean even just in the first episode you see some of like how they've taken some creative freedoms or like some of the plot twists if you've seen like the movie and stuff that like a twist to what you would normally think but I already think it's just a super interesting concepts they're like I'm gonna watch two anyway because in this one like the trains like a thousand and one carts long or something like that yeah it's like omegle long and so it's just like I'm there literally even if it's not the most interesting I'm just gonna enjoy seeing how they like imagine this world and these cars and how they would like actually survive like this like that was the most interesting part to me is like this like yeah like this fake scenario and the first a lot of promising what was funny is like you like I didn't know this was coming out I was watching like it was like a Hulu show and then like the advertisement started and like it was like we live on this train for hundreds of years and I was like oh that's cool oh that kind of like sounds like snowpiercer and I was like this is ripping off snow pretty soon and I was like why is nobody upset that this is snowpiercer that it's like watch Snow piercer I said oh that's really yeah I was like oh okay very cool no Chris Evans but that's okay I know yeah I feel like right now he's probably a pretty explosive also yeah I was gonna say also Snow piercer is pre Captain America Chris Evans yeah yeah I'm sure his rates are Lou wish I'd actually just seen him for the first time I saw Scott Pilgrim vs. the world the other night I don't know if you guys have seen that before I never stop people never stop reminded me of how I sound like Michael Cera from Scott Pilgrim I think it's a very overrated movie I think it's very you're an overrated movie boom roasted yep mic dude it's cool I like the mic when he jumps up and it like still has like the comic book kind of s kind of things to it that's cool but I don't know it's just so you told me your nerd ass and you didn't feel anything when you want Scott Pilgrim not really and probably because when it came out I was like cool high school guy and so I was like yeah I I guess I haven't seen maybe so loser watch Scott Pilgrim probably 2011 I think I was like all these big names and it's kind of the same thing like Chris Evans was there brie Larson she's only 19 um obviously Michael Cera I remember all the people Blake some big names I'm like jeez it reminds me when I watch band of brothers I'm like oh my god he's in this oh my god he he was in there for like three seconds and now he's like the big like yeah it's like it's so weird seeing people before like you know like they really hit off but I really liked it you know especially some of the humor some of the imprints uh I had quite a couple chuckles like at first I wasn't super solid I'll give us more time but then once the movie started get going and American ultra has like the guy sound super familiar in it and the girl from Twilight oh yeah yeah that movie's dope I love that movie there was some parts during Scott Pilgrim whereas mainly him and like the can't remember her name but like the different colored hair chick like the major of love interest winner and they were like snow and it's like a weird dream sequence there's a door and it made me just want to re-watch Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind that's the title I've never seen that that is so good yeah yeah if you know in the movie they can like you can choose to your race memories right yeah yeah I mean if you haven't seen that you are doing a disservice to yourself it is fantastic yeah well maybe I'll watch that Cassini and I we've been watching a lot of movies again and yesterday we watched a Slumdog Millionaire wasn't my first time but like is great just a good movie aside from that I guess quickly we can talk on crucible not that crucible the Amazon one won't button believe you put it I don't really have an interesting it I've seen so many people on Twitter be like hey this kinda looks like Paragon and my response is always thanks buddy it's like the 80th game people have said it's kind of like Paragon I mean it does like playing like ground it looks like it sometimes do not do this but that's about I'm what I'm gonna tell you like don't bother I'm done I'm out bro it's not worth it I'm not telling you play okay what do you gotta play it's like I play this I mean it came out of nowhere really like I hadn't know much about it and then they had the trailer like three weeks ago or something right like three two weeks ago and just like yo this is our game it's coming out like two weeks I'm like oh I was like all right I'll give it a shot and we did and it was like all right but it tries to beat so many different things at once it doesn't really do any one thing well like that will that's it I don't know how to explain it myself well because there's like two different modes one's about oral and one's not the battle royale mode a hundred percent feels like they threw it in the last second this is it man yeah like the game does not because it's like it the battery I was technically like ten teen they're like nine teams of two like two teams of nine wait yeah no nine teams of two and it just nothing about it says like yep this is how the game was supposed to be played then the other mode is 44 and the best way I could describe it is it's like the cycle with heroes or like like hero shooter characters and MOBA esque leveling but you don't level abilities you don't have an ultimate though and the objective is you you fight over this hive thing that spawns every couple minutes and when you kill it it drops a heart and you have to capture that heart but you can't do it if you're taking damage so like obviously you're supposed to fight over it first team to capture three hearts wins except what we also found out is a pretty dumb mechanic is if you destroy that hive which isn't exactly it's not like it's usually not easy to do you'll take a lot of damage then the heart spawns you you get nothing it's just whoever captures the heart so for all you want you know enemy team could just be like yeah I just wait for them to kill it oh they killed it alright cool let's just roll up now and that's kind of what happened no like there's nothing for it like you have to capture the heart and the capture itself takes like 15 seconds so it essentially just becomes we killed the hive oh great we're getting ganked oh we're all dead are they capture the heart some of the character designs some of them are good some of them are like what and that's what I'm saying like I want to like it and I did not have fun but I don't know if I'd ever vlog back in and so it's just strange because at moments it felt like battleborn or it could have been like battleborn and I might blue he wants Paragon back I want battle back why don't we just get a battle born Paragon baby you know somebody make that please but no so that was my at first people like yo you got to play this dude it's like battle boy I was like yes and I got on I was like no I know that's one of the few because like as far as like game releases in the next couple months we know about most of them so like when there's a surprise announcement like that like that was like oh like a hero shooter like yes yeah my okay okay surprise me I'm not surprised so still waiting fruit you know that announcement to come out of left field just be like sick but it's not there yet and I'm sad so really all it did was make me sad it's free-to-play though so please shots pay money yeah well David right let's pretty much that patreon questions room yeah I have some pulled up right here let's see we have a question from a cosmic if you had to live with anyone in the extended dream team of who would it be and why so extended dream team that means that would exclude you too right yeah I assume it would have to be like we have to choose outside this blue would be my choice originally yeah clean in the aspect of you don't clean like your room your room like you don't keep that clean but like that's your space I ain't going in there so like whatever like you could do that good luck and then one of an area I feel like you would keep that like clean because you don't because you have that anxiety of oh [ __ ] I don't want these people to think I'm like a like a like a not a clean person so I got to be like overly clean so now you're like overly clean in my common area spaces but when it comes to your own space you seem like me that it just is kind of messy uh Maxie totally loves it I keep my space like ridiculous oh oh I kind of slack at keeping common areas faces clean oh so we're the opposite see I keep my my space that's probably why we would work that's my boy we work out you're right oh [ __ ] dude it's the slam dunk let's go I guess we're gonna extend it dream team uh mm I guess dad Oh cuz he seems the most cleansiness that I can think of like like sammy shark and bless our automatically thrown out because they snore like that's you're out like that I'm sorry so probably just dad oh off the back he doesn't snore even if they're in different rooms and stuff yeah dude Sammy when he I'm not kidding you dude it woke me up from Claire's office like it too and he was at the main living room floor that [ __ ] was echoing that like you don't a cartoon window so much snoring really loud and like pulls in the house and in the head it was like it was like that and I was like I'm gonna kill this kid I'd probably go bless oh that's a good choice no he seems nice he was certainly always trying to keep things clean at the fruit Summit and I feel like he could serenade me or uh funny guy give me some stuff yeah karaoke he'd always be about that and you know what if I'm ever down a bit bless you I bless scary YouTube videos show me some ghost stories on YouTube he's like I got you did is this place huh he's like I hope you don't have anything scheduled for next like seven hours I have to think about this oh you deliver dork Kesey if I lived with dork that'd be way too many memes like we would probably like blow up house that's probably like a bad just probably a cosmic pulls in from the memes she would be gamer has like all the wallpaper yeah we straight mira house like you walk in if you like a clown house just like with a lot of titties would be weird that would see that kid i couldn't do that with door yeah man I couldn't do Aereo's because he would go somewhere and not tell me and he'd be gone for like days and I feel like are you dead eros is way easy honestly I would probably pick Aereo's really I would pick areas cuz eros is super independent and on his own and like monstrous he'll just be gone and you know what I would be like tight that's doing this thing I'm really like to myself especially like in my living space so if I'm gonna have a roommate it's like my roommates never seen me you're like a shadow you're like no it's a middle my even exist in your same living space or not honestly dorms were rough dude in college never have just like truly your space I mean you picked you bet you chose to live in the dorms I mean to you well no I hide in rameters but that's different yeah I think yeah I think I would pick Aereo's I feel like everyone else would want to be like oh I'm with my friend let's be social all the time and I'd be like dude I just don't I'm level 80 gun breaking I'm trying to do my duty rillettes to master my continuation combo I need you to get the [ __ ] out of my room like this is totally I'm getting ready for savage rain buddy okay great yeah I'm perfect heiresses because he's I feel like arias does something all the time and I'm doing my own thing all the time and upside the arrow some blasts we're just like on two parallel planes and then like everyone always gonna be like gonna go Chipotle and be like [ __ ] yeah watch pole' and then the parallel planes will intersect I get shaken in and think about that sounds tight well there are some or bless we could be pump buddies so that's one thing this is from Brandon when did you guys realize that you had an impact like the impact you guys have on people's lives is there a moment that like you kind of realized that and realized it was bigger than video games I guess oh yeah I definitely have one it was um our first st. Jude stream for Guardian Con was when I really realized like oh [ __ ] we raised like $100,000 that's not from like I remember that that's real people I went and got Mac donating so pretty hell yeah that's so tired it's like I want mac and cheese we did a good thing it was and it's those charity streams are so stressful and so like oh just after it I was like man like this kind of crazy you like this isn't like yeah this is real [ __ ] Nevison this isn't a meme house as I know it like what you said blue I think when when I went to the st. Jude hospital for like the st. Jude event like that is probably like when I really realize like the kind of impact that we can have on somebody's life and then Guardian con too because a lot of people always come up to Christian and I and tell us their stories and stuff and it's really humbling and I have like a lot of stuff that like people sign and like letters they sign it's really cool for me it was probably it's probably a year and a half in the making videos but someone emailed me or at least like doing mr. fruitful time and someone just emailed me or it was either an email or in my PA box I forget which it was some sort of a letter where a guy pretty much just talked about how he'd been struggling and he was like about to take his life when he randomly happened to Polly with my videos I'm laughter like the first time and like you know he said like a year or something and said like that was the one thing that stopped him from taking his own life and then ever since he's like gotten his life together but that was like the one that just hit me like Bing like me doing being stupid somehow randomly at the right time right place helps some guy like keep going and they're like in there like biggest moment of like need like to have somebody and especially I felt like that because I had that in high school like I said like um I used to watch a lot of creators back then they were like my rock so that was my realization okay we'll move to a slightly more upbeat topic uh Most Wanted smash ultimate DLC character oh Jesus Christ I'm saying answer okay I mean it's never gonna happen I would say Goku but I mean at this point cut realistic somebody got a realistic I would say sword but then Sora they did want him but like Square should not pay up the [ __ ] [ __ ] for him [ __ ] like novel okay okay gosh like there's so many you know I think we would actually be kind of cool now that like I kind of think about it Goldeneye James Bond that'd be kind of cool print what yeah like Goldeneye James Bond like when we go he does karate Chennai James Bond or do I need to say yes Goldeneye James Bond do you offer me your conquer conquer would be really cool comedy sing I would really like to see conquer at some point conquer would be really cool alright now say Kratos so sick but he they'd have to like PG him down hard to do it but he just has like to form his where he either 'he's like he either has his axe or his uh chains different combat styles be sick that's a good one and then it'll be a little a little oh dude to keep you was like his smash attack when he gets the ball could be a Spartan rage you know do-do-do-do-do-do yeah anyway okay cratis too tight um yeah I am gonna have to go with an off-brand pic here like mini from Disgaea oh the the the guy that's based off of his avatar little penguin I used to use the pretty as my mascot before I rebranded to my pic my full penguin dear evolution but how its like a mega pretty evolution how would what would his attacks and stuff be so he has this entirely separate game called pretty can it really be the hero or he has like err slashes he's got two knives - like mini blades they're tight he has his hero for me to do a whole bunch of different things they're whole things that they explode so it could be like a fun gimmick where every time like you're pretty gets defeated like a new one pops out from out of nowhere as opposed to like the same one coming down from the recent stage because the because the lore behind pretties is that they're basically souls of sinners and they can't do anything on their own so like that game pretty clearly the hero you have like a hundred lives and it's like a hundred prinnies every single time one dies it's a new printing you're playing so be it we cool concept but I mean yeah this guy's an RPG printings have all these different moves so the hero prinnies times book whoa I actually have said announcer from Sakurai he actually texted me on my phone here he is saying the next fighter is actually another Fire Emblem character you heard here yeah should my number one pick let's go dude come on that's my realistic pick another Fire Emblem character I'm over it or tastes like because I think wait so firing bombs like the most wrapped and then I think in Pokemon is the next one I think Pokemon second right honestly I think adding more Pokemon though isn't bad because there's so much more you can do with that one of the starters cuz that's I well they usually do what they didn't need to big Lucario and then they just did greninja greninja was so popular they had and so but that's like probably third your current trajectory is putting in all didn't like one of the new starters so ow that would been sick what a day Saint chose not to put him in yeah I actually at first I was pissed but then I grew to like in swimmer yeah you picked realistically they would pick another starter and the starter would probably be real boom that'd be pretty sick I do not see them pick an Italian mostly cuz god that's a terrible design yeah and they already picked what if it was dragging a pig dude Tony would sodium player spins okay pretty tight but if it was dragged for but how would they translate Drago pole into a character I know his dodge he like goes into the ground right like he goes twin but he's never he's never on the ground he's always floating I mean I guess his tail could be his or like he makes like a little like stealth bomber and like stealth bomber Pokemon is his neutral please easily dude if it was rings like down bust might not like live on stream like I would my god I would love a pole but that's I just feel like it's not realistic because he's such a hard it's such a hard just form to to fit into smash but real a boom I just can't help but feel like he'd be like a scuffed DK yeah I could see that but I mean they've already done a water starter which is good engine they did the fire starter in sinner are and I feel like I feel like the most it would either pick the new legendary which they're just reels which yeah okay word they are dude or would be real boom I think what about a Gen 1 though maybe get like the gen waters kind of already have a already a pokemon trainer they have squirtle Ivysaur Charizard and Jigglypuff yeah they've never like dibs previous into like a previous the only time they ever did that was when they made pokemon trainer and brawl we also have to think to like with every DLC they do it's usually somehow tied to promotion and if they're gonna do Pokemon they want to promote you know their new game sword and shield or like I could see like blue saying like DLC like oh this new DLC is about to come out but guess what the new legendary is like a new fight or two and it's about something like that where is it's like here's Eevee oh god man things I would do for Drago Paul it's just not realistic man I didn't mean to do it to you somehow managed to translate him into smash I would pee my pants I was I would support dude I'd be there for it because I want to cry just thinking about it that would be like my I'm gonna cry just thinking about how we have to end this podcast I was gonna segue that Spotify Congrats dude that's a day Joe we're proud of you i GG or easier Hey wait does that give us more land we're taking Joe as viewers hey Joe okay his audience they you if you're not careful we're leaving too hey I read his comment section they're like Joe I love your show but like where's the Destiny to drama well we got you guys come on over Spotify sign us blue where can people find you on the Internet hey guys you can find me everywhere at blue Westlaw can find me everywhere at Robby V you can find me everywhere more or less at mr. fruit but I said thank very much for listening to this episode of the GG overeasy podcast we appreciate all you stands listen and or watching leaving reviews commenting doing in other you do but making sure that you're still here to listen and then we can keep doing this with I said have yourselves a fan -
