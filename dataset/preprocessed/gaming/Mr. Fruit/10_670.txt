hidey-ho everyone my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to Calgary modern warfare and in today's video we're gonna be checking out the second brand new weapon in season three and it's a handgun the Wren a tee now I have a blueprint for it so despite the fact that I have not used the gun we have some attachments we have the desperado pro compensated for recoil control mk3 burst mod for increased rate of fire and a three-round burst at the cost of recoil control lightweight trigger for increased firing 27 round Mangrum erm well shots in the mag and the xrk program for additional recoil control all in all the three burst sounds pretty fun we're gonna try one core match and then one hardcore because I've been told it's nutty and hardcore we'll see how it does in regular I'll play though also screw me apparently a new master weapon camo will be coming in the middle of season 3 Infinity Ward dev says and I quote it will take a long time bro I just got Damascus what do you mean there's a master at a hundred bucks it's gonna be so much cooler than Damascus so why didn't we have this in the first place why did I grind the Damascus I'm gonna have to grind the stupid master camo I gotta

on Petra guards so they're just trying my page today I appreciate that and I love the way you kind of kind of handle this liking a little tilted you know I'm Sarah kind of like me right now hearing about the master game oh oh this is gonna be interesting ideally you know you want to use pistols on the closer quarter Maps and Here I am on petrol guards so I'd say this is going famously already cool Wow holy hackers this three bursts comes out quick oh wow what that I was not expecting that Lee this thing ready no this might just mean I slap this on as my secondary for war zone oh and that way I get to use ghosts cuz normally I'm using overkill that means off to get rid of my sniper I don't know what I want today bro I'm trying my hardest okay I know why I've been on this whole brother thing lately on full whole Cogan no hope for me left boys now unfortunately yes the range is absolute Bubba Bubba lots as you could see there it took approximately 8 million burst and yes I counted all the way from 1 now the real strat here is desolace they're trying to snipe me Swiss why I like the smaller maps every time the smaller maps are out of rotation I realize I hate just about every map in this game and I think that I mean we tie badly and the maps are a hundred percent holding this game back for the most part poor map design that promotes just the slowest possible play just molasses like this guy mounted up in the most random corner of the map American modern call duty people run again not me mo he had to have been weak I have a hard time believing that this one burst upper chest if it dies well what do we have here no ok well I mean probably headshots yeah but like not not too just because I mean unless I'm oh you oh Jesus I hope I just killed you I am so sorry I definitely fought alright so we get two bursts into him let's see what happened here Bob what yeah it is most definitely still a pistol in regards to the track I have to stuff 10 to 15 bullets in your mouth in order for you to die and all you have to do is slap me with your peepee you like for one or two bullets and that's it but close quarters like that way upper chest we have it I only have a chance to bursts upper chest should be you what look at these people they are so fun they are so fine look bro this ain't Val rent alright you don't need to hold angles like that come on now run a gun bring it back to the roots roots it's quite a movie isn't it your name is Toby boy not exactly the most flattering Oh long shot headshot Tater Tot now this guy probably knows that I am on doing he does so I'm going to flank him not the day sir Oh God you ah forgetting dragged help me help me Tom Cruise where are you and your Scientology now I need you comfort me with your sweet lies well let's just go ahead and swap it over to hardcore and see how this goes see if it treats us any better treat me like what if you're French goes yeah so how you treat your french girls with a map like this oh no I probably should have found a new map but you know what we're gonna persevere now why would I want to back out of this map well because essentially the outside is just lined with buildings where you can see the entire rest of the map so the middle is just no-man's land I don't want to talk about it oh hey there buddy ol pal no we're gonna rush their spawn ballsy undoubtably necessary oh for sure I saw this guy moving and grooving equipment there he is come here come here call me he's not sprinting so he's probably gonna uh he tried to hear me but I said no oh oh one shot one kill Oh a tap has stopped see the burst is necessary here you might be like well that seems like overkill well counterpoint you shoot out more bullets at once and with a little spread and burst means you're more likely to hit something not guaranteed but it helps I'm just walking in circles and I'm not walking on sunshine whoa not walking on sunshine look at me mount it up yeah I can play this game mounted up with a pistol nobody ever said it was a good idea but I'm full of bad ideas oh are you or you might only go on then breath I'll play the obj you're not my friends they either come to the right and I kill them or they come to the left and I die or secret option see they don't come at all nice personally I'm quite fond of that option guarantees that uh I stay alive a little bit longer my life longevity in this game has never been very high now look at this I can use the pistol on the ladder oh not me oh I heard you yell at all rascal that's right for once in my life I stopped I was gonna say I stopped talking so I could actually hear something in this game crazy right gonna use this meat sube sheet to kill you I have no idea what are we looking at here ah yes a walk swaggin my favorite it's a comparison photo a Volkswagen and walks wagon and then you know the caption the guy your girl says not to worry about oh shoot look at me leave me playing passive holding like signs of Lights opinion I thought you'll die let's go mr. fruit oh there's another one I'll take that triple almost a colada this thing is nice with it in hardcore wasn't feeling it too much in core because I granted you know it's it's a handgun by George I have no idea where I got shot from I don't know if it was up down I know it's forward just like that right mr. fruit hold w old w like your life depends on it because more often than not it that is a long shot indeed now look at me I am that daddy nobody likes uh-huh Wow sitting in this little corner little cubby no go on you're safe it's fine no one's here alright I'm bored see I can't do it other people think wait there forever for me oh no no no no no action now or action never give me liberty or give me death give me ape or give me nothing I have will hear this though see normally it wouldn't be doing this but wait how did I just like how did I just proc a flak jacket normally I would just be running a gun in and getting frustrated because I'd be dying over and over because it's hardcore I'm using a handgun just like that but Valeria is teaching me patience that's right I thought an ape like me could never learn what it is to actually beep I'm shocked yeah Jesus well I mean we just we should never pick a fight like that you know I'm saying he has an actual gun with actual range he can first off just see me that helps and I think I Walt I got a collab but unfortunately one of those was my teammate so slight problem there was almost popping boys oh I had another person rater I never used uh I see these little boners come here loud and clear several boners in the vicinity over and out boner boner I don't think I don't ask because I can't tell I don't know where my aim went but I certainly went to poop I'll tell you that much now look they're going to assume that I am gonna be in this right little little lane uh-huh but check it anyway what's going on but I'm hearing them everywhere do I have my headphones on backwards maybe I do maybe I don't I don't know but it is a working out for us so far we're in a personal radar and UAV I'm insane I'm crate I'm cracked bro come here where you at hey wait quit shooting my stuff bro we are we dancing are we dancing by the moon why everybody s feel and Bob and Rockets such a fine natural side I forget I have dead silence cuz it's hardcore and I never see it boo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo to them to do them bad at about I'll talk to in Maranello heart is there pass you have the voice of an angel an angel of death because my ears are bleeding very funny very funny but what does that say that I'm the one I mean I'm pretending to be you guys because I assume you're making fun of me but that still means I'm making fun of mice I'm sorry you were removing the red bar on B but I thought you yeah fair enough yep that is totally deserved I thought you I thought the bar was going up not down so I was like ah it must be the enemy it was not I've made a grave mistake long shot I can only imagine what the stupid master cameras gonna be dude cuz the pointed Damascus and apparently really to even begin said master camera you have to have gold online which obviously for me not a problem you know I obviously have Damascus but it means on all the new weapons I would have to get gold on those two even then start the master camo and I'm gonna be honest with you I've got I've done enough gold that I never want to do those again I thought my like longshot mounted days are over but evidently nah they've just begun gee I wish there would have been like well in comparison to Damascus this is how long it would take old rascal oh jeez wow it's a bloodbath you yep creature of habit always run back to familiar territory wait for it watch this no no you're gonna die you're gonna die or you're gonna take my kills either way it's not cool bro not cool at all to ding it gonna go in for B huh we're losing it this time I can confirm that the red bar is going up not down it is increasing not decreasing and I will you killed me not purposefully but I'll still blame you because otherwise I have to blame myself I obviously can't take take a credibility for anything that I dunno okay I can't blame him for that one he's the one that set the ban see buddy off that is not even remotely I mean I could have laid prone I tried I did not do it in time I'm trying bro I'm trying but I can't even with the recoil control I shoot him once and then I lose what I'm what I see I can't see the target no more at that range Oh buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy I'll help you Oh sounds almost really cool I know I know Wow we ended actually as top Fragger let's go there you have it people the vanetti in core it's okay hardcore though especially with the burst it's a menace in fact I still think I'm gonna make a loadout for war zone with this as my secondary so I can use ghost instead of overkill because I think yeah this is not bad to swap to close quarters that's it but having a ground master camo not nice ooh that's the real takeaway from this video thanks again to Skyforge for sponsoring this video be sure to click the link down in the description box below to check it out and their fifth anniversary remember it's free-to-play so with that said I want to thank you all very much for watching happy cells a fantastic day I'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] [Music]
