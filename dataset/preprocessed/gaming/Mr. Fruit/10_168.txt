oh somebody just grabbed those rockets oh i'm dead god you would have thought i've never played a halo game they have our flag oh my god i don't eat lugs hi the hell everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to hawo infinite the technical fight multiplayer test whatever you know shenanigans it's the legality of it we're hopping back into multiplayer excited for next week's test where big team battle will be a thing but until then i am excited to hop back in and probably struggle you know i don't understand why they don't put like the map right here so i know what i'm playing um okay blitz looking hot ooh killer yes uh there's me uh oh what'd we do okay i guess screw the fourth guy wait what happened to the first guy wait what's happening i don't know run run run rushing oh wait no plasma pistol what the am i doing this is garbage give me the battle rifle nobody's grabbing those rockets right somebody just grabbed those rockets oh i'm dead yeah oh i'm so dead there's another one i'll be still my heart all right careful the bloom uh and the rockets all right let's take this one from the top you don't need oh okay what happened to this fella jesus christ how are you not out what the mr stark i don't i don't feel so kind i'm gonna take the needler you know i prefer the the sidearm but everybody tells me look at that what's skill everybody says they don't like it you know and they're more of an assault rifle guy and how okay that was loud i get it you see a target oh there's a heat wave thing somewhere around here be on the lookout yarg i'm here ooh sorry about that ooh don't mind if i do i'm gonna take this little battle rifle whenever that guy loses that that gun that would be great okay really hoping he would fall into that grenade you know what i noticed and someone pointed this out on the old tweeter uh reticle doesn't turn red when looking at people anymore okay what the fudge wait what what what there's no power items off the graph where the fudge is my rocket launcher am i getting wait how'd you get it when did all this occur i swear you also got the overshield ah you're like me poor pouring off all the oh wait you're okay jesus christ yeah apparently reticule doesn't turn red on pc when somebody is close because and i quote it's too easy to write a a hack or a cheat where once x part of screen turns red how would you spawn back here um start shooting you know for like an aimbot so instead of just working on an anti-cheat my reticule won't turn red is essentially what i'm getting at here like ready what i'm so used to having my radical turn right it literally feels wrong okay where is this thing oh wait a second how am i not okay well i mean guardian angel oh wait he said guardian i thought that was a good oh wait a second that person has the heatwave thing what does this do dude creeping around for a while i'm at ammo okay there is um there are some cool guns up here holy okay that is uh not how i wanted that to go a panicking it's a beta but man i am sweating like you don't you get oh my god i never get to have fun okay is this coming up now oh my god it is it is this is my moment yes yeah i was oh that's that's an overshoot and that is an enemy spartan whom evidently i cannot kill never mind we got him holy i saw him last second freaking screw you mr russell hey yeah yeah fighting for my life out here okay i think he didn't pick up my gun he didn't nerd uh he's these cable my life yeah getting used to the keybinds um i i don't know what happened there i really don't i want you to know too i've played like five games of this beta and these are the matches i'm placed in like okay he's weak and he's upset he's spaghetti and i'm getting in on this okay see i keep dropping my assault rifle but apparently that's what i should keep because that's everyone says it's so overpowered so they gotta be onto something right what am i getting shot by hello rockets and 20. see and like now i notice it yeah my reticle doesn't turn red it it just doesn't feel right frankly oh my god speaking of feeling right what the fudge bruh yo somebody get this man let me get this man's nobody got this man nobody's weak up there wait you didn't even weaken him i'm for him alive man the only reason the guy at top has 14 kills is because he takes every single rocket launcher how's it brother i found overshield i wonder too if i should work on my momentum movement oh that's just that was a solid nade everyone says auto rifle is good so i'm just gonna start using auto rifle you're dead and i'm down we're all dead you know why not my one problem is i don't really know where to pick up the armor abilities like i think they come up at certain like right there on the map but that's all i really know i hate everything i just need to be using more grenades and that feels like the brunt of it there's a kill assist okay great yep just eat that over there eat that in there eat that in there oh that's nice oh that's real nice that's some good damage that's a that's a solid assist i can never get oh what the fudge frag obtained oh my that's quite a few grenadines we've got there uh i need this overshield chief yo i see that man hiding over there can't hide from me yeah oh my i freaking harpooned them he multiplied i don't know how well well i do know how but uh that's uh you're not old enough you know uh wait until your parents tell you about that you're dead you're dead you're so dead that's a rocket to my face but i got the grenade kill it's all about the frags all about the frags all about the mini nukes aka grenades oof yikes that's a solid nade it didn't it didn't check this out check this out yeah you like that yeah i get harp and he still killed me okay we won but let me reword that my team won i don't feel like i won is is that going to like punish me even more in the skill basement like is that how that is that how that works it's just funny because it's social arena and you know when you think halo and social you know not skill-based matchmaking it's a variety of skills i don't know maybe if they're just testing it out in the flight but i might as well be playing the mlg playlist down here oh wait i didn't realize they were testing other game oh shoot capture the flag okay this is interesting i thought it was only slayer hey guys the first day on the town here hey that's our flag right there what do you know go screw my friends i'm here to frag and only for myself they know i'm here you have the of course they have our flag oh my god let me grab these weapons first oh thanks sweet jesus thanks sweet jesus what you heard me all right oh what the fudge are you why does it take so long to swap your weapons and well how long was he just crouching there jokes on you stupid you only get one one rocket shot so you better make it count for that guys okay i'm gonna say by crisis cake because he's getting ow why where okay that's not good okay give me give me my commander rifle oh my god and i have to re then there's no god you would have thought i've never played a halo game in my life that's what it feels like right now they don't know oh fudge they got the score though i'm here friend yeah i'm returning it grab the flag nice you're on your own though i feel like it is okay i should just go it ran out anyway wait maybe i but i should also probably help my friend ah decisions decisions okay it looks like he's fine so there's just people in our spot no there's not sure okay we're vibing we're absolutely vibing oh my god you're gonna score this buddy not on my watch no don't worry friend oh my god i didn't get that killed duke my needs they were paramount in destroying that man and now you dare say oh get destroyed whoa what the f wait what grenade do i have right now i don't know but it's doing work i quite like it actually what they've taken yeah we'll see how long that lasts fudge who gave this man a shield and i was absolutely fragging i think i had like two kills at life i'm not joking yo you've got a commando rifle and i'm out gunning you with my pistol oh my that is not sprint why do i keep what game do i have that my grenade button is sprint like what what am i doing frankly i don't i don't know oh they catch their flag what okay wait oh they're like brah he was right here yeah i was go go go go my friend i'm
