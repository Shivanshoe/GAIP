hi everyone my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to the GG over-easy podcast and in today's video we talk about a whole bunch of stuff I'm anecdotes but I feel like we did a pretty good job at talking about whatever we wanted to talk about which was our cousin we had some car trouble it's snowing justic rat hunt out right now winter wonderland destiny is has song back at and you can invest or stay and our hot money here expert your financial adviser blogs investor cell blue real quick so they know there you go everybody I'll get rid of it I'm buying get rid of it well I'm run stone that's not the point that's why I did it Rob had some soccer issues yeah I come clean about some angry issues that I have in my life maybe I just needed to get them looked at and blue and I try to save the world as animals so oh that is a good one yeah all that and more in this episode I 80 homes ruin my name is mr. root and welcome back to this episode of the gg over easy normally we have a bit of a warm-up but I didn't give them any any warning yeah I kind of like that yeah I just jumped right into it we're hopping into it yeah 25 quarter of the way there dude we're 25 this is episode 25 and the audio is caught up is it I have actually no idea there are still so I can see outside and all looking at me oh no I was at the stairs right now looking at me all sad she'll make I love you but be nice okay puppy oh really I'm lucky I'm a gut you boy you know episode 25 so glad to have you all here we're still having some audio issues on audio platform though we are you know we're trying to figure out what the fudge is going on but at the very least if you're it's working for you the episodes are there and this one should be up to episode 25 excited to hop into this one we didn't think this we were gonna record this today you said do not have him because of the snow so fun story dick the puppies out last night before I was going to bed and it was snowing a little bit it's probably at 6:30 that's your bedtime sister he said like 9:30 and I'm not taking them out we'll get to that too the way we're taking them out or I'm taking them out it's like a light little flurry it's actually kind of beautiful it's like kind of misty in the sense that you can't see too far like it's a nice light fluffy and that's always you know silent because you know how like snow I think I capture sound it's like that kind of cool like and the only think here's like the crunch it was like still mm-hmm and it's like oh so peaceful ah but then I wake up and realized it hasn't stopped snowing since and I underestimated how much snow it had apparently had fallen so before this podcast AB and I were gonna go to the gym forget my new car did you pump we're gonna get the pump head out of the driveway just put that thing reversed we're going down ba ba ba but you should state you've got a new car we do not have the minivan anymore it means you know did I not I don't think so no maybe I haven't so I the minivan I had to take her out to the pasture actually she's officially left moss like I didn't see stone out in my spot she's gone oh wow that's kind of hard I had to take her out in the back she had a look at the flowers and you know so did you get anything no no it was tough but I had to let her go did you cry like I said it to you yeah I mean it's weird I only car I've ever driven that's like when I have to get rid of my car it's only a car I've ever driven she was good to me oh it is good but you got a new car what I did I got a Toyota Camry Hybrid it's like you're gonna be like a new brand new pool yeah so I was looking and uh the the elite sports luxury class and I'm like mmm I could go with this maybe a Ferrari or a Lamborghini that's what they call them yeah yeah and so now I'm gonna the Toyota Camry Hybrid incredibly smart economical choice gas mileage I say on the highway silent as well it is well until the engine kicks in because it is high well I mean I guess you're like an old sedan mostly hybrids I've heard well the weird thing about hybrids is or like an actual true electric hybrid is when you start it you don't hear anything you just put it really freaked me I'm M BER like starting one because I used to work at a valet thing and I just put started and I was sit there dick the battery's dead there's been several times I've left the car like going to the gym and the cards like beep it's like why you yell it at me and I realize I never turned it off because I couldn't even tell just making no noise yeah so I have to go in and turn off um but we got that on the highway gets fifty two miles to the gallon yeah and the cool thing too is a common misconception is that you have to like plug-in hybrids like an electric mm-hmm but you don't hybrid charge themselves so that's the cool part but anyway got that I actually didn't know that yeah that's my oh yeah for sure idiots listen so got that we're pulling out and we get to the bottom of the driveway start to to like come out of the driveway backwards on the boshi you got like onto the driveway I thought you couldn't get out of the garage no so we're going down the driveway I get right off the curb and then nothing [Music] like it would early it would it was kind of like and then it just it was like kind of swirling around and then just sat there and it didn't I was like let's put it in Drive let's maybe get back a little more and we're not even going forward I'm just thinking myself maybe scraping off their driveway like actually there was a guy right behind us so thoughtful of him he never did anything I looked our way didn't even bother the guy yeah what a guy that's not my problem honey I think the kids the kid next door can't get out anymore oh that's an idiot with the rabid dog Karen told us her crazy what a dick apparently yeah so he just didn't do anything that I would have done at least something I think but like what like never even looked just stone cold he doesn't even care bad guys like [ __ ] it's cold yeah it's like listen I'm here to do my thing and get out and yeah so we're stuck and okay some of the road like the street itself some people have gone through so is like if we can probably make it to the street once we get out of the thicker snow we're by fines I didn't realize it was over a foot yeah it was pretty it's pretty thick up and I was like I didn't realize it was this bad a doobie doe so all right well what now so Claire tries to like clear some snow around the tires and stuff behind us Oh Claire's out there helping now yeah and okay that's not working we're still moving nowhere and so like I get out start clearing some more forward up the driveway behind us creating as much space because I'm thinking like alright if we can just get up the driveway I didn't realize this time I'm going right yet out of my little patches I'm like we'll just get some and then once we get a mil of Street we're probably fine hmm and as this is going and we're continuously stuck over and over again I realize I might make it into the middle of the street but then I'm gonna be stuck in or like I might make it it's for sure too mmm Oh your car's not four-wheel-drive oh yeah the the sedans like that Camry is front-wheel I believe which the minivan was - uh-huh never had problems I was like it's probably exasperated like you're exaggerated exacerbated is a word but I don't think it's the correct definition of looking for here exaggerated like van was always fine except it's a little bit bigger more it's heavier something in that probably landed some held and it also had some more kick to it to get up and go which is probably what would help so I'm sitting there shuffling all the way up the driveway and still you can't get it because it's stuck the worst part too is it's stuck right at that the gutter yeah like the gutter of the the road so if you want to get up yes I can't get out that little just a little slope and if you wants get back it's spinning on the little slope oh my god so I get all this done so then Claire gets in a band I get in the back and we try and well first we get in the front it's not curl it yeah we get in the front she puts in reverse and ham and I yeah like try and push it back so they can get some momentum yeah didn't get backed up on the driveway and then we get in the back and then she puts in Drive and then it gets like a third no not even like a fourth of the way before hits it like it's skirting they can't handle and it drives into a pile of snow oh my god he's serious yes then we had to get out and then just would I just shovel the entire driveway at this point it's like okay we just have to and then we had to push it back and then push it forward and eventually got in the garage i'ma get no we're not yeah I'm not doing because we might get a street over but then this exact me was gonna happen and then we're gonna be stuck in the middle of the road and it's gonna be absolutely the worst thing ever for a second I thought I was like we're just gonna have to leave this Camry in the middle of the street like I can't do anything I know so now I'm like by finding a new car and now we have no cars I can handle suppose I didn't get four-wheel drive I thought that was four-wheel drive didn't have the option ambitious but that's what I was like well the band never had problems it was like the same I freaked I forget if it was front or rear but I wanted see I was like and plus I misjudged how much snow there was there's a lot there's a lot like once we get in the street and then I look at I step in like yeah and I like it I like my meat and like like halfway up the shin and I'm like oh yeah whoops and so yeah we spent like an hour and a half getting that car back in the garage well yeah it's like 10 o'clock like wake up look at my like Twitter and Christians in there like just got my car back in the garage no way we could do the podcast today I was like sorry for looking out for you Rob I'll be fine I really like it in my car like scrape it off I'm like in shorts and like I was in one of the thing too is this whole time I'm doing it I'm in my workout clothes yeah I was freezing well I'm like planning on going to the gym after that's like I'm in mine and my dad's like Robert put on some like pants you're gonna get stuck no not watch this so I got like get in my car and like Christian said he's like if I knew how much snow there was I would have just I literally just put it in reverse look behind me no one's coming life is so funny man and for those audio listeners I jumped up as if I hit a bunch of snow ah thank you yeah but yeah it was fine the highways were fine so I mean because you I knew if I could get to like working streets nice neighborhood streets odds are it can be better it's been paved some some bit but there's no way I was making it so now I have to figure out what the fudge we're gonna do like I'm literally under house arrest I can't go to jail I was all the way here's like we used to like gonna get food I think I can get you guys food on the way if you need anything we got like crackers to like I need some I you know it'd be great right now those frozen MREs oh and someone told me the acronym it's meals ready to eat meals ready to eat yeah they're microwave meals wait a minute so I can get MREs like like the five minute microwavable meals those are MREs technically yeah kuzey I love kid cuisine some tells me they don't last quite as long but they classify as MRE so I mean it kind of seems like they did they'd be in the same category I literally lived on like TV dinners when my parents are going through divorce this is all we ever my my dad was like what do you want know like the hungry man cake cuisines might last that long because it's probably 99% made of inedible stuff looking back at that stuff like those all the brownies the best part I mean yeah oh this isn't that bad but like looking at it and the consistency yeah you're like I shouldn't be able to eat this but I am I also like the hungry man that had like the cinnamon apples it's like a syrupy thing I was really going to love it I liked hungry man's a lot hunger is a hungry man or hungry man's is all remain even still a thing I'll see this commercial hello microphone I've been a hungry mother they are I haven't seen any though so and then dunkaroos are coming back absolutely still around I don't know if you guys know about dunkaroos but back to very late I like dunkaroos dunker yeah that has been taking our best export for too long weren't you the one for us to take it back weren't you the one where blue mentioned dunkaroos and then you're like don't go Roos he was but that's how he knows and that's why he's excited now yeah yeah but you're like I love dunkaroos the dunker is I like the thing you scoop in the art you don't get keep dunkaroos mystic it seemed like Rob that had never had dunkers no it's like a cream yeah but now he's explained in I should read the review almost other than I was like pause like say don't say add say did it again don't say add review say add lead I'm trying okay yeah but for the record I've never had dunkaroos and I'm probably never going to this is a crew he's absolutely not gonna let you not never tried uncle ruse I'm good no those are like snacks order in Jordan like if he asked if you don't like a cookie into cream it's basically that I just said no but it's so good like elementary snacks I'm amazing we had dunkaroos in some way shape or form it might not have been called a dunkaroo but you had some jeans like celery sticks for the closest thing I've ever had that would be like the Ritz cracker with the cheese those are good to match that but with with like frosting instead I didn't like those either though what the [ __ ] I know I like the best of the cosmic Browning he's saying you hate fun Oh like they had it was like special things on no no no I had like the little dots yeah that's why I'm a little like is like chocolate it almost looked like nerds yeah yeah there's like chocolate those are fire those are my favorite school snack I would get pack those but my mom when she packed my lunch so sweet she'd always leave me a note always a handwritten note like I love you Pooh Bear like sign my mom or she would just like draw like an eye and a heart and you you know like I love you and then you'd give that Texan shake was that like yes and so she'd packed the lunch she packed like a sandwich she would usually do like just like a ham sandwich with like some lettuce and tomato yeah but then she believed in a little jar she would pack me some vinegar she knew I like to dip the sandwich in the vinegar and so she would leave me little cider vinegar and then a little little ziploc bag she'd get like some lays chips or something and then if I ever got like a snack or whatever would be like half like the cosmic brownie thing is half you know get the young get Doug know to usually like had to split it yeah she uh she packed that and then I remember every time I'd like and then like a capri-sun or something and I'd open up my my lunchbox every time and people would see them don't be like loser and I'm like now this is sweet like My Mind's loving you get it you didn't get enough did you cuz I did I never understood that when kids made fun like is that no elementary school yeah okay like um you get dropped off at school and mom give me a kiss and so I give her a kiss and if you like loser and I'm like what now I love my mom I never understood that I but some kids would be like no mom like people are gonna see I was like yeah I never said like I love my mama no shame I mean in the privacy of our home yeah sure but like don't be kissing me from my friend's mom I'm cool I'm a cool kid I will say the plus side of living in Texas that's very normal for us here yeah see Mexicans are very affectionate when it comes to people mothers if you don't kiss your mother back you're a bad son you're a bad kid you're in it if I ever and if my mother was like okay mijo give me kiss and I didn't kiss her back everyone be like damn he's like throwing some hey your mom or something do you hate your mom that's [ __ ] up fool that's yeah man blues Elementary over here we very sad for that too like middle school okay but people here would be like loser like what oh my god that's so embarrassing I mean while blue doesn't and I was like go back and kiss for weather look guys your mom like I had to make my own lunches and then was just too lazy to not make them so I didn't make anything so I wouldn't eat anything for lunch and then I wouldn't eat anything till dinner and then Here I am 10 years later doing the exact same yeah sounds very similar bug didn't my whole life now the dangerous thing was high school where they'd had those cookies like three cookies for a dollar oh yeah those were fired cookies do you know this is so good and the weird thing too is like they were always a little undercooked it seemed they were and I'd be like I'm only gonna get one pack today and then I'd walk away with like nine cookies I'm like I shouldn't you know walking bad even all of us yeah and that's when everybody made fun of me for the way I eat cookies that eat those in our yeah first like the rim and then I keep eating in a smaller circle smaller size don't waffle no I would see people watch that it would really give me like a guttural reaction yeah did you ever go off campus when off campus lunch was a thing that's easy when you're like high school all I could think was del Taco cuz that was literally all I ever went to like four dollars I could buy like half the menu and then because in order to go off campus during lunch it was like go immediately get there come back it's time for class I'm sure that's too much no that's true you faster and then you get a tardy pass and then you get Saturday school and then it's awful see I was a good student you were a good noodle I was I was a good noodle - I never did I never did in high school ever because my parents were my step mom worked at the high school so if I did so it would also say like you get a call from like the school or whatever and it'd be like your son like Robert was not in fifth period today like why because like it if you weren't excused for it it would like call your parents or something so it was impossible to ditch but I never understood how all my friends always ditch cuz I never did now did I pay attention now I don't know about that but bailable but I never ditched at these power weights though cuz that's just I was tired and genocide we have a review okay an ad read as oh because apparently we paid for all these room yes according to rob five by eagle eye but the a is a four oh whoa yeah Wow you mean you play bottom warfare we got an eight star rating here of course actually wait what do you mean what do you mean oh okay I start okay that is eight starts yeah what do you mean don't mind the little ones under it yeah no that's actually I mean you might say with 13 stars okay yeah I would like that one better the one and only eight star podcast from printing coal to gaming - what color is my poop - tumbleweeds - nuclear apocalypse with Rob trapped outside - Reese's or Reese's with topics ranging from LS Gunda and back this podcast was that one more time yep I'm not sure what he's trying I don't know if it's supposed to be the same word el segundo El Segundo because it's all one word it's very confused again I think it's supposed to be - it's right yeah this podcast is hilarious entertaining and fulfills everything a podcast should and more I recommend everyone including all aliens animal Smurfs elves even to the trees I love y'all I am an audio listener a yeah I just said I just said he's like I'm an audio listener and I just pointed to the cameras like a but okay that's a bad taste I am an audio listener and still give you all 5 stars you're doing ironically I don't KITT yeah yeah I don't care what they say I still have y'all even though sometimes the audio is not working keep feeding us Nick did that's what it's working this week apparently hopefully so Thank You Eli for the eight star review you know it's like our podcasts on audio is like 99.9% like it'll kill 99.9% of germs but so that pointers one point zero one there's always that points everyone that could get nice so well no isn't it point one because point nine ninety-nine point nine percent is actually ninety nine point ninety right it's not ninety nine point nine nine so it would be one no point one would be ten percent yeah so ninety-nine point nine percent that's still night ninety-nine point nine percent out of a hundred means there's 0.01% left No there means there's 0.1% because one person is 10% it would be 90% but that it is that you percent because I said no it's 99.9% but ok to put 99.9 percent into a decimal point yes it would be point nine nine nine so actually be point zero zero one but when they says it kills 99% of germs it says ninety-nine okay that's the that's the real number and then that point that nine is in the tenths column correct because they're they're showing it not as the actual percentage of a fraction they have the percentage next to it if you put it in the decimal form one point zero is 100 right yes so then if you want ninety-nine point nine it would be zero point nine ninety-nine that's what it's saying you have to move the decimal over twice from the ninety-nine point nine you just give it one no then it would be nine point nine nine what does that even no I was thinking no I was thinking you so when he had 99 so 99.9% of germs are killed right yeah so now that's saying that there's point 1 left of those germs of that fraction yes but then if you put it into an actual point fraction its point zero zero one okay see I was thinking of it just like in that sort of term I wasn't putting it into that I don't think it was because there would be what one out of a thousand left that you didn't kill that's what you're saying so you're telling me 25 goes into all four times and then four goes into 100 25 times okay so four times 25 is 100 but do you understand the math they're not really written there's a kind of a green it's like math okay this point let me draw it in this imaginary or space okay you have been 99 yes 0.9 yes percent yes that's the importance then you want to make it a percentage in decimal form though okay okay obviously if you have anything past decimal point that's more than zero yes over a hundred percent yes in order to do that yeah take the decimal point two spaces to the left uh-huh then everything is behind the decimal point yes which leaves you at point nine nine now oh my god you know what else is point nine nine percent dope is this a dream and welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the GG over-easy podcast and because I was gonna forget otherwise yeah we're gonna start hey this is for you eagle eye you audio listener because clearly you can see you can't that's the joke when we went to pack South these are sweet there was some dice people and I caved and got some dice but not any dice like some nice those nice I'm not saying your regular run-of-the-mill a done dire dice cuz it's plural you existed die yeah I guess die but this is a set of die but I got dice I don't know I think you're right but I dice just said a die or a set of dice maybe Ivor's yeah but I think you're I don't romantically you are right yeah dramatically I'm right but they both son I don't know whenever we try and do something this we're gonna sound stupid and someone's gonna prove us wrong I'm sure someone's gonna prove my decimal points wrong so anyway mmm I might be a little hard to see here I got some obsidian dice there so city and I sent so oh I just figured out what okay keep going I said I need topic by the way but so it's like this black dice but then on top of it it has some raised engraving of the the letters or the numbers rather with some fancy engraving around them in black as well so it's black on black murdered-out is what I like to call that uh-huh and it is selec they feel real nice it's kinda like they do it's like not quite matte no it's but like I don't know how to explain it it's it's like it's certainly not made out of some cheap plants it's like a geode like when you feel like a G oh they're pretty hefty - oh for sure got a good roll and seventeen I have to display them but I'm very happy about them and I got a cool little thing to hold them in or very expensive damage counters mr. fruit they are have you used it yet no shame and then that's isn't that a conundrum I got him and they're so nice it's like but not don't use them but oh that's a dado said dad I bought dice like that I would never want to use them because they're too nice I think I'll have well so the problem is well Claire also bought I don't know like a million dice and a cup now the problem is they're all different kinds of die so I mean some of them like you couldn't even really use for like a card game for instance if you want it to it because like normally you just use a d6 hmm but this one comes with every kind you have d4 or whatever yeah I've never seen i-80 deep I don't know what that one is where you bet I know this is a 12 mm-hmm and a 20 the standard and then it just come to look cool okay anyway I guess now this really matters but I thought I'd bring it up anyway maybe we'd show in town playthrough at some point or something visceral it's a podcast show and tell you know I also got some Japanese Pokemon cards yeah that's what he's been by accident I was supposed to get English ones and some package came from word and shield pack yeah kidding me yeah well I thought it was like the trainer elite box but it was the Japanese one and so I got this package just like from Kyoto I was like as like sick with what who sent me something from Japan I open up and like pokemon cards oh I need it but why would it be sent and I opened I'm like oh no oh and the reason is unbeknownst to me at first as a Oh sick okay cool whatever because I can still use these and I think the Japanese Pokemon cards are way cool a cooler oh absolutely they've cool it borders and all this kind of stuff anyway I was like I'll just use these but you have to bring like a translation if you like wanted to officially use them but apparently since I've played which to be fair it's been one but they've changed it to where now you can only have English cards no matter what so swag green now again that's in the US like obviously if you're in Japan yeah you can use these no I know you got to get in English yeah I got like some sick ones and I can't you so did you not order anything very powerful East yeah they are play did you order any booster packs no I love the new ones now I would love to is that your night you know what's your new topic blue what was this oh yeah from the dice okay so did you guys know about this new Minecraft Update that's coming out they wait they're adding hey or obviously Roberts up like Minecraft creeping over there I don't know if it's come out already or if it's coming out I just member seeing this on Twitter apparently they're adding a new tier of like hardness of like your armor and your swords and stuff and weapons that's stronger than diamond and more durable than diamond its pair like an obsidian rarity and you can only mine this in the nether like in nether caves so you have to know they're mine it and then you have to like refine it in a really specific way and it's bad you can basically use obsidian to make armor and weapons now and you have to find the forge Queen because this is the way like that and they she makes you some DeLoreans steel that sounds pretty dope exactly what we're doing except you guys are probably just gonna spawn it in and then the server in like five seconds and then just fly around with it I don't do that no I'm not saying you I've said him in thorn I said you guys I met him in I only do that after the in your server because we have admin powers and I can't help myself don't give me because I can shoot at it for that obsidian [ __ ] I would too I'm gonna I mean I still do and but I mean I haven't played minecraft in a minute though when is that update is my kingdom gonna be done I mean it is like it's done like it's a hollow no it's not ya know it's not the most part no it's not that thing is late okay dad off the truck it is 100% done the cavern the oh so it's already here actually it's called nether right that's it cuz it's sick I brought it up cuz first I was like an obsidian dice it's all straight black armor it's all blacked out wow so dad I'm gonna have to go they're all blacked out it's dope oh sorry for the Kingdom Hearts dreams back to Minecraft fans see that's good here well blue not only can you are you are thank you alright and blue not only are you the resident minecraft expert you are also the minecraft destiny expert what tell me you set the Minecraft destiny what is this donating thing in the stocks like you can donate stocks to the pyramids now and then we're talking for those unaware we're talking about definitely - they came out with some empyrion foundation thing and using your fractal line garbage where do you get fragile on sin something ok blues been grinding obviously seems pretty hyped about it I don't know the Nick Franklin something so so there's this things called fractal in we particularly been gathering them over the course of this whole past season and use them to upgrade your obelisks upgrading your obelisk gives you a bunch of perks depending on the location so like you get like playing in this playlist can give you fractal in or check this out you get a cool new mod by upgrading your obelisk and look at these these are weapon frames you could you could cry in doubt and get cool random roles for these guns you usually couldn't before and over the course the season we were doing this with all the obelisks but they've told us since we can get season there's gonna be this empyrion foundation thing which is going on right now where you have to as a community donate and a fractal in to the Imperium foundation to unlock some super secret thing that we haven't found out yet everyone is assuming we're like building the trials lighthouse right now or some [ __ ] so it's actually pretty cool cuz like you can see like in the director like how many tears were like we've complete and by wheeling like the Destiny community yeah this is already a lot cooler than the pub already feels a lot more like a community effort than the last I mean this is a good yeah yeah as it was happening the puzzle was well yes that was an interesting command unquote community effort but this already is a lot cooler as far as like seeing that the community can actually see like a like an actual progress meter basically there's a cool thing going around to or all these weapon frames you can go to the tower and buy them and turning into the Imperium foundation will actually progress these bounties so you could like just super farm weapon rolls like really quickly and then there's this new consumable see fruit and robber like this is simple to wear you could turn it in you could buy it with glimmer and stuff and auto like level up your obelisk so you can speed up the process and this all matters because I think at the end of every week depending on how much you've invested in the obelisks how much you get back is dependent on how much you've invested so you can either just go balls deep and like grind rolls and just donate immediately the foundation uh-huh or you could like super invest for the future and get that's a smart idea yeah and get and get obelisk stuff like and refund it to you later so oh so it's kind of like what's the world looking for when you put money into a bank and you get interest it's an investing versus spending about what have you have you done more investing or have you done much it investing I wanted my black scorpion rolls I try to get this [ __ ] gun on a god roll for so long I'm absolutely turning in all my [ __ ] fractal and they get the world what is it what is this Reaper thing what is it or the gun you're trying to get bikes I know it's been around forever a black score it's very hard to farm for because it's only fronts Panem so you either like spend a bunch of weapon materials to get it or you could just spam your fractal in and hopefully get it mmm well from one of the from the from the black scorpion body I haven't got a guy over yet so pit bans here's my advice because I do it the same way I do in video games in real life I invest I save did you invest in Tesla No probably been better out right now it's kind of going insane Tesla stocks is it going down right now what's up is it over a thousand it was something crazy because watch well I've had the bubble burst as I thought that's recently yeah I haven't I didn't see about a person but I know yeah yeah very reason I think so but I mean compared to what they were doing the other day yes it literally since the dawn of video games that I played it's I have that problem where I never spend I just saved because I think one day I'll need this or I'll say for something I don't know about yet but then I'll want it and then it's it becomes full circle because then I finish the game and realize I never spent anything and now I don't need it well it's like that with that that ramen coupon as I kept that in my inventory because I said what if I need this yeah I'm a hoarder in that sense but it's a good principle to bring in life be frugal save and unlike video games it well it will eventually end but hopefully you get the like 55 or whatever they have you pull it all out and then you got your good so what happens when what how many tears are we at and then you die about three I mean they oh I'm gonna tear you guys that I'm gonna say ready go was like 400 million or something and I think right now we're at couple billion right one point oh my god that was like 7 billion like 1.2 billion right how many billion I thought but maybe I was maybe 200 million yeah or at 1.2 billion right now the stage for goal which everyone is working toward right now is 2.2 billion it that many people play destiny to get that number that high how many have you donated blue or is it like you've donated yourself like 100 million you myself mad I'm not mad just like it was million it's just like right so I've donated that much total I'm only doing it for like 7,000 oh my god but but that's also because a lot of people who play the game who wasted their time no me saving up fractal in because like literally there's a consumable you can just buy to like spam and the upgrade jarabulus now they saved up a lot of fractal and to like be like the on the you know there's always those people who are like yeah I'm trying to be like the number one fractal and donator leaderboard is there one no just some of the Majan anything no there is there's actually so people actually made a site or and you could see the and I mean you could always see it it like you log in and care enough to go to the site but yeah you can see who has donated the most Franklin to all like 12 people who are like oh my god I've donated 0 I have you donated oh I haven't touched destiny since once I see me I thought you whatever my last video like as video though like what everybody's you're like let me donate so I don't know man until something changes and I'm just I've played a lot of destiny I I'm in last like five years and right now I'm dealing with other games do we know what happens blew in we reached the goals or you guys reach the goals so everyone is assuming it's like at ease of trials next season and everyone is assuming that we're we're typically building the lighthouse right now because one you see the like the progress meter like in games in the crucible playlist really so does that mean it's coming what's so what I was submitting gonna happen I feel like at this point it's not a very well kept secret is that we're gonna finish building this whole thing up huh and the crews will play us it's gonna be like wow you've successfully managed to rebuild the lighthouse blah blah blah the lighthouse the trials yeah and then that's that's the tease and everyone's like oh my god travel sorry and then in about six months everyone's not gonna be a [ __ ] hate [ __ ] about it and I'll give it that's all I'm saying like a week and a half two weeks and so people are like the balance is out of whack I hate skill based matchmaking in this cuz you gotta think the doing skill based matchmaking instead of where your card is at probably that's the problem people are having when Charles the nine where around then can I don't see that being any different with trials and then I can't I can't wait for all the tweets that are saying I was one win away with no more boon and I ran into a cheater like I hate you Bungie and that's even worse because there's still so many rampant cheaters indeed officers trials is gonna be especially like hi like we get for coming the trials it's gonna be so bad dude it's gonna suck so as much as I'm happy for people the trials coming back and I'm like oh yeah I mean it will make a big hit like that trials dope I hope you have fun but then also like a week like but then also I do it's gonna last like a month and then we're gonna go back to being like oh trials in the game oh forgot about that yeah I'd I'm not about it like yeah if trials came back I would see this like cool we get to make like a video for a week and then I would maybe play it I don't know maybe I'd do it with javi once a week that would be kind of fun kind of like goodness all to throw back for a little bit I'll say that I wouldn't do it for like more than my life you know be doing that big guy I'm I think he's living his best life doing variety right now well I mean in the sense of like we wouldn't like I respect that me and Hobie would just do like I don't know just a card or something I mean I play more destiny than hope he does technically I was a fun video we were talking about that means triple the other day the the dream team off of video oh yeah yeah the way back in the day as you get one square you noscope triple Rach when I destroyed them and then well it was so funny like seeing our side yeah we're all freaking out we're at plan we're like tie and having fun and then you go to their point of view and they're like nitro time oh yeah okay I got him yeah there one nice there's one over there oh good shot did he just use his super no he didn't he's one I thought I thought we can't use supers that was after like I no scope somebody like it quick like quick scope with my knowing beyond yeah and then we're just like get that trap off so I didn't even care we weren't supposed to you snoopers but I mean we were gonna lose anyway yeah so like slam for the trip went freaking out and they're like I thought we couldn't use supers yeah I don't think we can oh okay I guess we can use it now but that that was him and then you cut the art perspective and that's funny the good times let them full of spunk you know who else is full spunk this ad read no Rob oh oh it's not quite time for an and read oh I am yeah yeah oh you want me to talk about it yeah okay okay fine it's fine you know immediately what I was talking about but yeah that's right like boom like alright so what was this Wednesday so what's today Friday yeah so I know it's my immersion it's a Sunday so on Wednesday on Wednesday I play in a co-ed soccer team and I play with like a bunch of husbands I played with like Chris at the local rec center but yes at a local like yeah the only people that care about this or the people playing no one else outside of the game no way dude it's the biggest deal within I wild the world i watch the games and everyone in there it's like this is life or death it is is it's a dog-eat-dog world out and that just like a whole bunch like middle aged people who were never quite good enough to ever take it anywhere yeah I have to like out this is it yes and play me so I played a very high level of soccer throughout my whole life so I'm a very competitive person no and and that stems to like other things like video games and just life in general I'm just a very competitive person and I do not like to lose so we had a game on Wednesday playoffs is this playoffs mind you so we're in the cores or this is like the round of 16 I don't know so we play some scrubs we beat a long game super tiring and then we have to go back to back so we beat this one team just stomp them it was like 9 to 3 we move on to the next team the next team is like pretty good so the game starts and I'm like running really fast I'm owning and this is like mind you maybe two minutes into the game I'm running and I'm through the goal it's just me and the goalie at this point and the kid just pushes me and so I'm a Zoomer dude you know I'm pretty fast so like I'm trying to catch my balance and I land like on my shoulder here her so bad yesterday I like landed on it just kind of all the pressure went to the top of my shoulder and it just killed so bad and then so I was kind of like heated after that I was alright like we gonna play like that huh oh yeah exactly as I do it's like it's like two minutes in a game and the goo got a yellow card so I was like alright so and then not a red if me in the goalie one-on-one do that should be a red get him out of here but it gives him a yellow so I'm like looking at the ref I'm like that should be a red card he's like no you were kind of like on the side you weren't like completely in the center so it's a yellow like you know what you're talking about so like and he's like the fact you know you think that it's a red card that shows that you don't know anything and I was like dude don't get snippy with me like I literally says I don't you snip you with me man so I put though I don't doubt it you're actually put there I put the ball down I take a freak a terrible free cake dude come on Taryn I'm Way better than that there's terrible shot I was very upset so now I'm like tilted so like the goalie now picks up the ball and like rolls it and he rolls it and it's going to this chick and I was like standing behind the girl so I'm like I'm gonna make her protect I do this all time I was I'm gonna say leave it so she thinks I'm a team a of hers and like gives it to me I say this to everybody I say in the last game I've said it in every game this whole season so I'm like yet leave it and like the girl like doesn't leave it clearly because I'm not on her seeming like passes it up the field cuz she's not stupid and the ref also under like burn like blows his whistle and he goes you can't like say that because that's unsportsmanlike cuz trying to trick her gives me a yellow card like soldiers pops every time I like pick it up he goes that's a yellow card like the band bro yeah I was like what I was like not no warning no yeah like you just give me a card and he was like yeah I was like dude that is literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard and I'm like just like looking at him he's like well now you gotta go in the box and I was like yeah I get that but I just so I'm like walking off mic and I'm like on the other side of the field and when I'm like on this side of the field I literally just walk like I'm like not jogging off I'm walking off [ __ ] like I'm taking my sweet last time is that so stupid so I like walk to the hotbox or whatever they call it so I'm like staying in there basically just like yelling just that not I'd like the wrath but like just in the game and stuff it they had this shot and your brother kind of like tugs on the dudes arm a little bit just kind of a little tug did a little throw him off and the dude still gets a shot off we save it and the ref calls a foul and the dudes wearing glasses mind you I was like the ref and I was like dude those clearly aren't healthy like and he goes one more sarcastic thing out of you and you're out of here and I was like asking for the referees card so I could like [ __ ] to the people at the field house who like run this that this ref is terrible so I get get his thing I was like what's his name it was Mike and I go okay does like nice fuel so it was one more sarcastic thing out of you and you're out of here oh it okay Mike that's it tanner sitting right next to me and I was your tentacle god damn it Robert it's like I'm just standing there like gives me a red card and like kicks me out and basically it's like you're out of here you're out and I was like okay Mike like thanks Mike they just caught him Mike now the entire time because I obviously tilted him so so he's like kicking me out and I like put on oh no the lady walks out to me and goes ah you actually have to like leave the facility because you got a red card and if you don't leave in five minutes it's actually a team forfeit I was like oh my god first of all get away from me and second of all I'm already like doing that so I was like getting up and I was like leaving and I'm just like shaking my head and like I get to my car and it's like five degrees outside and like we all agreed to go get drinks and stuff and I'm just sitting in my car and I was like man I'm stupid cuz like I didn't want my team to be mad at me because then like when I got my red card your brother got a blue card would you see that was that it's like it it's like a yellow card but if they have to offer two minutes but if like the team scores on that two minutes then he gets to go back in so he doesn't have to wait the whole two minutes so when I got the red card we were like playing a to v6 I felt really bad because like we were supposed to get drinks afterwards and I was like they're gonna [ __ ] hate I was like my team is gonna really really hate me cuz they count on me this they want me to be out on that field but I wasn't cuz I'd ran my mouth the entire time that felt so bad about it and then very hot-headed I didn't think I was it tell us if I brought that like [ __ ] it I get in the car hold on yeah wait you don't have to tell it because I know what you're gonna say this is what I even called me about no you don't know this yet but you're suspended you're gonna get an email Monday and official email really yeah but the lady didn't realize those were guys this last game uh-huh so you're not suspended exactly yeah but this is why my brother called me yesterday because he called me because he got a call robbed the rec center because he liked the team captain or like did he like create the team yeah okay I feel like we should I was embarrassed as I was gonna tell this part because I was like when I did after I did this I was like that was the stupidest thing I ever could have done you dumb idiot well I wasn't gonna mention it but since really you know what I'm gonna minute yeah this is yeah so I should have saw you think Ethan Cosby he's like I just got off the phone I have to tell you this so you got a call from the rec center apparently that girl that told you like like you got to leave the premise or whatever so evidently what happens is Rob then leaves the facility gets in his car and immediately calls the rec center and you immediately did you even for a light I guess yeah yeah so did now the funny part is Ethan was just laughing cuz he said during this call he had like try and take it seriously because she had to transcribe back exactly everything you said like I was so mad he's like I obviously can't repeat this stuff you said but uh something like I you want me to try and like recall it yeah but imagine because the funny thing to him was like she has to like trying like say it without like yeah like like really like something there's something like and then he said Mike as a referee is as useful as a deaf and blind man and Mike is a I just remember explaining the situation against you matter and matter as I'm on the phone about it and I'm just getting so mad oh and by the way Mike's a [ __ ] [ __ ] sounds like you are so [ __ ] stupid like cuz I started out with like hi my name is Robert Venegas like given literally everything and then I just thought yeah 30 seconds later God's eyes mortified I did that and I was like I was like I'm gonna get a call or something or well so Ethan gets it but what happens is so she like goes through all this and then she actually says like yeah I was just gonna let it go but then I listen to my voice mails this morning and found this one and they're like we weren't gonna call him because we didn't know how he was gonna react oh my god like I would freak out actually so embarrassed and apologized so badly because I so embarrassed but so she uh yeah she just called Ethan the let him now so I'm suspended for again yeah and like he's suspended and like there'll be a like an official thing coming out Ethan said he didn't care he's like yeah whatever they're cool yeah he wasn't mad he would I just told me cuz he's like you should have a phone call where he's like so your teammate robberies man and I was just sitting like this is such a rough night and I it was like after I did that voicemail I was like dude you're so dumb Oh what I heard that as a [ __ ] yeah I wonder why Ethan like called you but that's hilarious they told you about that I'm gonna find thing to his you've been rise and yeah yeah the fact that you knew about it was maybe even more embarrassed though I only have to ever turn that red ever mistress whole areas cuz like that's that's you you're ahead understand not bad unlike the week before I got in a fight with my dad at the game yeah he comes off he's like Robert it's just a game like cuz we like we were up like two goals we're up like two with like 30 seconds left tie we somehow throw it away and we tie I'm so pissed and my dad's like Robert it's just like wreck like you don't need to be upset about it and I was like no my therapist dad and he's just like I mean you think I'm a high head to see my [ __ ] dad I'm sorry who was like [Laughter] soccer just is a big old vice in my life it's like a great thing but it's also a terrible thing and then like my poor teammates probably think I'm some crazy crazy person all the time to be fair I think that too like I'm very like hot-headed and very raging and very like mean on the soccer field but like right after that or like after a video some like that on the next one what's like you think like you like oh I remember Rob salty d1 peak days but like you should see playing soccer yes that is a whole nudist watching your games I see you feel frustrated all time I'm like come on you're always yelling I wish I was that passionate about something here's an ad read and welcome back to the Gigi overeasy podcast I guess this is a good time to segue and ask blue-blue did you I think we asked this did you play sports when you were younger oh my god I was younger really did football is in there right I played a lot of well that's nice you guys remember soccer played a lot of football now a little bit of basketball there's mostly football and I hate a long wait so why'd you play someone did you grow to hate football because you played it so I absolutely grown to hate football I played so much football I played probably like five or six years of football up until high school and that's when I just realized wow I've I'm literally only playing this because my parents want me to play it because I play to acquire kid I played sports pretty much my whole life I played up until yeah high school my sister was super athletic and she was incredible at sports so they put me in because they're like oh you know clearly we have some some athletic genes in the family I do not have athletic genes an athlete by the way so I played played a lot of soccer played some basketball basketball is my favorite but I only got to play like one year so that kind of made me upset once I played a lot of played a lot of baseball well I think it's just because my school like it was basketball for us was like over the summer or something so I never really got a chance to like because we didn't really have school over the summer you know it was weird I I didn't go to like most of my by the top so by the time I kind of was like I really like basketball is it the point where is like okay well we're not gonna be doing every single sport all year yeah like we ain't got that kind of money so it was mostly soccer and then eventually it turned into football when you thought like he just loves football and I never liked I only played football because what like it like you said like if you want to do 3/4 sports it's so expensive so expensive that she doesn't pay for itself dad they're like we don't want oh we we don't want to be money from these kids parents to please sports yes that works where you got to pay money mmm so football was the sport that I play the most and I hated that [ __ ] it was the worst I never liked it now we say it when we say football we're talking like American food we're talking American football like we're tackling it was the worst I was admittedly I was probably really I was pretty good at it right and like I suck I was on usually on either tackle on offense or like some [ __ ] on defense mm-hmm that's my favorite rule so [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] though I hated that [ __ ] it was like a line but I don't want to do it I don't [ __ ] care and literally one year I was like hey I really don't want to play football can I like no I my parents were like oh no like you oh you just there's just a bad game like last you're doing fine like oh don't worry about and I was like no I I really tell what to play football I know you don't get it wasn't a sport two years later they're like oh so how you feel about football you know with high school everything I'm just like I'm not playing football I'm gonna play any sport I'm done with that [ __ ] I don't wanna do that anymore that's my prime I can't play other game play other sports now either because I'm too far gone because all of my investment was in football no there's no reason for me to try other sports now in high school cause everyone's way ahead of me and I would just look stupid I would look like a 12 year old and everyone's and everyone's popping off I'm done no more sports we're done and that was the end of it I probably why I don't watch or care about football at all because as a kid I would watch it all the time and now I I think I have like PTSD from playing football that's why I don't watch anything football eh I don't care about it you guys were like oh yeah bro that's Super Bowl I'm like oh yeah sick [ __ ] mind and Sundays let's get it baby nut commercial brah let's get it you can't even just like watch it like it like you hated it that much like even watching it I can't even watch it wow I mean I hate I mean there's a part time I hated soccer but like I still like like watching it but so you probably is don't let up your parents force you truths you wanna do truths through that so you probably never then got very passionate about it did you cuz he just didn't care or maybe early on you were I I was yeah I don't I can't say I was ever like ever actually passion about football I was passionate about like soccer I really like playing soccer and then basketball I love playing basketball as a kid but it's like it's like when like you're a kid and everyone's like oh wow you're really good at this you should do this and as a kid you're like a poo poo pee pee I love crayons you still you're still like that hold on oh you should absolutely do this you're really talented at it who might pee pee yeah poo poo pee pee crayons doogie go yum Hey it was tie thing he took the right yeah I think you chose the right on so if you're so into soccer you said you stopped that right before you start a football I mean is it so it's like you play all these sports and like your parents which kind of see which one sticks based on like what everyone oh yeah so soccer I was okay at soccer I wasn't exactly the fastest kid but a few yeah and when everyone was like oh he should definitely play football he's great at it Here I am drawing yugioh concept cards in the corner way what do I do totally okay so you would have kept playing soccer had your parents not kind of swayed you in the football I probably would have fallen out of love with soccer to you I think the only one I would have stayed invested in was basketball cuz I loved playing basketball yeah I still love playing basketball but I suppose super fun that's like boy in a bird whenever we have Persis here but like every other year before that we still we still we like the Spurs that our boy Derek I almost actually wear that Jersey on the podcast today but we should move on to the patreon questions um part of the podcast thank you again to our stands and our sponsors thank you staiin sponsors so we have our first question from saber saber asks pretty easy question here not gonna give you guys a tough one here what's your favorite movie genre that's not that's an easy answer I think all of us are answering the same thing oh really I don't think so I'm kind of my favorite type of movies is like a very mysterious like thriller kind of movie like something I don't know what's going on oh oh okay so you have thriller yes roller blue pretty much anything sci-fi related will be I mean because easy it's just a good catch-all I mean so if you like sci-fi so much mm-hmm I don't know if I mention it um have you seen the expanse I really want to watch it because I keep seeing the trailers for it it looks so good but I have not watched it was expense so it was a it was on the Syfy network mm-hmm and it's based off some novels I don't know if novels were also called the expanse probably or one of them but it did three seasons and then sci-fi just cancelled it for some reason yeah so Amazon picked it up and just made a new season Claire and I are watching it right now we just finished the third season just watch the first episode of Amazon's new fourth season is this like a like sci-fi so it's like a story it's not just like a drama basically yeah like space politics kind of okay because you have Earth Mars and they're called belters people who are like born and raised on asteroid belts and stuff super sick hmm I can't recommend it enough like it has no right it doesn't know right being this good has no right yeah suit like I'm and then I watch it and we would finish the third season I was like why would they cancel this like this is awesome yeah well because the sci-fi dedh like who's really watching the sci-fi channel honestly that's why I'm surprised too because like it has some good animate like they must have put money into it hmm I don't know why they just ditched it so because no one's watching the sci-fi channel I guess so because sci-fi has actually gotten so much better quality wise over the past several years for sure but I feel like that stigma of ooh this sci-fi Network yeah like same like discovery planet at once I feel like that had some sort of prestige yeah and now it's Andrea and then plan earth happened and people are like damn discover you well and then but then discovery does all this weird stuff now and like like everything that the gold rush that in like history planet turning into just weird alien planet yeah like ancient aliens it's super cheap weird stuff but anyway see I would recommend that blue I definitely want to watch it yeah I like it's like one of those shows to where you just can't watch one I'm like I got time for one I got to make time for another did you finish your noble then no I but I've been stuck on expand watch your noble like I start I could not stop but now I sit down and it's like Chernobyl or expanse and I gotta finish it why isn't it like Chernobyl poor expense wise turn oval just here what I'm afraid once I start a show I have to stick with that show exclusively until I finish it or else I don't feel satisfied yeah like cuz um like last night I'm supposed to watch with Claire and she was doing something I'll watch something else I shopped it for 30 minutes like I just want to watch the expanse I watch anything else yeah like nothing else sounds good right now until I can finish this show yeah so yeah I would recommend that blue um your favorite genre mine would also probably throwing okay I like sci-fi and I like I mean I like a lot of movies but I think a the ones I 5 thrillers I mean yeah if it's a thriller it doesn't even matter the setting if it's a thriller where it's like some weird suspenseful story where you don't know where it's going you don't know how it's gonna end yeah twists turns that's my favorite because I feel like those are the movies that keep you the most engaged to him to like I get out like I think that movies is so good I love that movie if it always has like some eerie feeling to like something's not what it seems I feel uneasy yeah those are always good yeah not straight-up scary that's probably my least favorite movie no let's talk about Lee's favorite I scary movies a scary thriller can be growing yeah I blue I don't I don't see scary movies I don't see him like I I will cease I will see spiral though because that looks like a scary thriller like the new saw movies viral yeah the with the Chris Rock he's like an executive producer oh I don't know yeah it's gonna be so we've never seen any two songs I mean they're pretty the first two are okay and then in like the next like seven they're like how gory can we get while we also kind of this story along the only reason I wanted to watch it is because it sounds like an interesting premise I just want to see how they pull it off the first two are good then in three five three four five six seven and then eight but seven is like cutting the two that's just how gory can we get while also kind of expanding the lore side of it like the back kind of thing it is cool but like then it stops making sense but that's the the same way and with like there was that Ryan Reynolds movie buried alive or whatever or buried I could never this is what getting buried alive or something well so like the whole movies essentially him just just him in a coffin so like for me nothing else aside I want to see it because it's like how did they do that like I want to know how they made a movie out of just that guy in a coffin yeah because that's water like the whole movie I wouldn't be able to watch that I get claustrophobia like the cube I talked about that I told you yeah like are they the best movies no but sometimes concept alone is enough to interest me to watch it and get past certain stuff just cuz I want to see yeah it's an interesting I want to know how they were able to tell this story that's why I like light knives out cuz I thought I knew where knives out was going but then it didn't go that way no I like that and they announced a sequel oh really you know like two days ago some official I don't support Rian Johnson but I do like that movie you you can dislike and like some people's things in the portfolio it's not like I like that I like nothing like that yeah but that's like Star Wars it's very important to me yeah I mean I understand so it takes over his whole portfolio well bye you blew your fleece favorite movie genre least favorite movie drama comes I mean there's definitely plays for rom-coms Rob you can't just that you know Jesus Rob I can't say there's like a least favorite genre for me it's probably bad movies there isn't there isn't get suited to John or I specifically hey like I'm not gonna watch or is Gary okay well then look at it this way like let's say you had all of them laid out or like you you had all the theater in theater you see all the movies you had a catalog yeah and there's one that like you just the least likely oh yeah like maybe it's not that you just immediately turned off but it's the one you're at least likely to go see probably musicals I guess oh yeah it's a good one I may hate me that's a good one I hate I hate musicals see but like I've out two high school musical but like I do love grease the grease is one of my favorite but like I have to be honest with you there's like maybe like three or four musicals I'm like this is tight and then the rest are like this is trash I was surprised by the greatest showmen Oh easy skip for me we'll see I was a huge Ackman right yeah yeah I wouldn't have gone if it wasn't for Claire she wanted to is it one of those I can't do the musicals where it's the whole time they're singing like there's like babe can you please pick up some milk she's like oh god those seats or something stupid I just can't that's good you had me enthralled please where does that list or ego know I was thinking she didn't actually go to grocery store she cheated on him that's why she doesn't have the melon that's why now take a stork gun nasi okay that's something they're blue this one is from Joel Johnson what is your go-to weapon for a zombie apocalypse a gun so I can shoot myself come on no we're surviving no I'm not we got that on there if it's slow zombies we're literally still doing our current career because nothing's changing okay let's say it's like walkers like they're there okay there man not like white walkers these are manageable nowadays if we're thinking Walking Dead yes my first question is how does anyone let it get there in the first place exactly they're that slow what do you mean like maybe like one or two small suburban cities not even suburban no like weird backwater that's it exactly watch it in season one they are kind of Opie's aaahm be I think it's because they get so long and they decay that's why they start getting slower but I think they started off Opie and then as the years went on they just got decayed and that kind of made me we'll see if that's the case and they started that way I'm just gonna shoot myself okay they didn't even start that gun you know my go-to you got to think like smart here's something that you can use and always have ammo right I'm just whacking with the gun okay this is gonna sound weird can I have a 3d printer so I can always tell oh my god okay first off you're gonna need a power source to consistently print these right thanks so you don't want a gun because then you guys think ammo I probably liked your katana sword if I'm gonna just grab that and probably do work I'll see that that sounds fun and dandy but we don't really know how hard it's gonna be first off to get a clean cut through a zombie because if you don't it's now lodged inside the zombie so now you're like give me a back right then on top of that let's say it can stay super sharp and stay intact me and the entire skirmish or whatever you're doing then you have to keep it sharp keep it maintained you got a you you get just saying it's not as easy as it looks like the same way people make it like in the zombie movies they make it look really easy to just stab someone in the head like yeah right you like like yeah I put everything into that okay they don't like a baseball bat with like spikes like the seal mmm maybe a little that's more understand okay that's better that's better you're gonna throw out your shoulder soon but I mean what about you blue go to go to I mean like like practically it'd be some type of life or blade or [ __ ] katana the person is over okay see but that is very ammo hungry that would run out immediately where do you go for a flamethrower starters gas like that just let me just go fill up at this local Exxon we're gonna go fill up my flame to it yeah go on I figured out you know so you know how you siphon gas yeah so if you put a thing like you put my urges you put like a like a rope or not a rope but like a tube yes a tube of some sorts and then you suck it right uh-huh I always thought you had to suck it and then I get it in your mouth and then like spit it out and then keep doing it like that I didn't realize like gravity like took over and I just did it all out I thought you had to just slowly filling up the bucket yeah so like people would like I'll let siphon gas but that takes forever like why would you ever do that and then you get like gas in your mouth like that's bad so now I know yes Rob that is bad so anyway thanks for that ending though blue you were saying thanks buddy I would probably go for C I'm thinking about reusable resources here so like if we're going slow zombies right there's gonna be a limited amount we could probably have time to go pick up a resource oh I'm thinking like a crossbow bow and arrows barrel action with with some prefer I probably prefer bow and arrow or the best well faster reloads you know I'm saying yeah but the tongue with a bow and arrow though is there's a lot more like you have to be good with it is good with it look at them well I'll be gone with it I'm from blurry I'll Erie absolutely bring in Hawkeye's bow look at those eyes dude those things that you blinked in 25 episodes I mean if I guess you if you find the right like compound bow but I think cross recurve buddy compounds death sentence but if you go recurve then it's gonna be even harder how's it gonna be even harder compound you literally have to take like eight years to take a shot I don't know the difference between the two so recurve is just so compound is is designed for you to be able to hold an arrow like and really like take a long time to aim it recurve is about as simple as you can get its recurve bow you fired just like stereotypies but it's obviously you know it's very it's more there's a lot more room for human error and recurves is designed for you to swamp and straight shots as possible when French or whatever are way lighter when the French got their crossbows you know who won the French yeah like once they went to crossbows I mean yeah it takes a little bit long to reload but also in the way it's faster also going against fast moving targets and also slow everyone I also want to I don't know if it's the French but I know somewhere in medieval times like someone went to the hospital humans absolutely crossbows the pig against slow-moving vibing zombie vibin I mean yeah maybe of a good point okay doesn't know thanks Siri yeah you might have a good point but I'm just thinking like your arms gonna get tired or like studying your aim I don't know I mean no different than holding a gun for hours what you just pop and then you put it that start for those audio listeners he just shot a crossbow I just got robbed my head I don't know plus like you got to think like if the bolt doesn't go all the way clean through then you might have problem yeah you're right to go to see or something because I don't want this now I'm going out there going Rob here's the garnet the corner I think of it every time anything I ever bring up you get your you get your katana blue gets his recurve bow and I'll be dead okay not last one not blue wheat loaf with that's pretty funny without see that this is blue what's this question if you had to choose to be one animal but you can speak to humans which animal would you be in other words literally we're still normally talking just we've now gained the lives of one specific no no we are an animal but we're a man yes we are the animal and we can talk to humans I've got a thing of something that like wouldn't freak out a human you know like if if you guys met a talking animal which would be the least to freak you out and ideally you can protect yourself because I the first reaction us humans would probably kill it because we're stupid stab it in the face yeah I have a good I have the back way to that I would be a bald eagle because you can't kill me because I'm a bald as soon as they realize you're talking about you go though that's illegal you can't kill and then is that stop throws Patriot patriotic thing in the world going on the cop America everybody be like they like me president do not own mr. bald eagle yes what should we do nothing let me go fly in this guy and think about it they can't catch me here lightning strikes you done right no God yeah bald eagle I think that would be pretty sweet even like regardless if they're trying to get away around I want to be something that can fly and like get around and be like very more like cuz if I could have any power to be teleportation so flying and teleportation that's as close to the game yeah blue do you have them give a good answer cuz I don't if I'm trying to live a comfortable life as an animal because the animals have that [ __ ] hard but it still vibe with humans I am absolutely being a galapagos tortoise oh I have a lot but this tortoise you ask well the oldest recorded Galapagos tortoise lived 177 years not only that you suckers are 500 pounds the only thing killing me is a human but guess what like talk to humans like me and we like turtles why would we kill turtles and Shikoh South bro I just chill my she's got a 500 pound shell just watch out for like plastics and trash in the ocean it's okay I'll have my own apartment as a Galapagus tortoise because the humans you like Snorlax and the Giga max form you just have a big island on your back easy stuff my life that's a good one I like that one what do you did also okay who's immortal and wear our sunglasses and has antlers and wear scarf yeah I was gonna say you can also use a firearm if you could also like take your dude blue had a good point animals do have it hard hmm so I think the first place to start I googled it what animal has no natural predators or is an apex predator a max means like the top of the food chain there's no one else ice above them well this says here arguably humans it includes but it's not living the tune we got Lions yeah grizzly bears crocodiles giant constrictor snakes wolves sharks a talking snake that's an easy way to get killed electric eels enough I hate yields giant jellyfish killer whales and polar bears either way it would be actually see so now from that list somewheres would be a pretty easy vibe yeah yeah bears get hunted Lions get hunted everything this way we hunt everything that's the problem that's why we like if the lines talking [ __ ] I don't wanna go forward I gotta go you're not well because I got barely in your homeland yeah are you gonna do that Chris I think that's all propaganda by the Chinese man lions steal all the poachers I feel like see if I if I wanted to do like a political statement and like save the world I would be gone and I'd be like hey guys it's me I have to evolve to become a penguin please stop killing people times an inner layer whoa we can't kill pangolins this one can talk and then it would actually get the Pangolin crisis fixed also hey it's penguin no I mean it's a different type of oh it is I thought you're like wow there's an entire problem we're penguins pangolins are being hunted to extinction and if I wanted to like actually like make some political [ __ ] and like sex change something by being a talking animal talking penguin lose a good point I'll be a polar bear and then just be like oh you stop destroying my ecosystem everybody's and then I'll drink a coke and I'll be making fast stacks no I'm saying I got I got that I got that big brand money thank you I'm gonna be paying you now like don't kill the ecosystem and then they're like we made a mistake the US government assassin is you with coke but polar bears themselves if I'm able to do my thing they messed you up oh yeah what is I don't see any humans like ever so anything that they see they kill right and even if you like did you ever see that video for instance of the guy that was like in this like class case they're like this contraption to like try and watch polar bears whatever and the polar bear like practically opened it up oh my god cuz they're like a couple hundred pounds good on you idiot I hope that polar bear gets you I'm saying polar bears like or anyway don't you know they're going terrifying they also tell penguin so in character mr. fruit so thanks for that yeah we will be sitting there like please do and I'll come up like oh geez don't kill the environment I think that yeah blue and I have gone save the world crap thanks blue I think that wraps it up for episode 25 of the GG overeasy podcast I believe unless we are missing something hmm I got PE but that's about it okay I got a pee blue
