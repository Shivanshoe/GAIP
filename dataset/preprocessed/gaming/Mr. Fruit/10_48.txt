cool about a disciple aesthetic though still like it and i i'm nowhere even close to being able to craft this but one of the most noteworthy things about it is it's a kinetic slot fusion rifle and stasis at that now i'm going to be rocking ranged masterwork don't mind if i do small boy for increased range of stability accelerated coils it decreases damage but faster charge rate i'm not sure if the trade-off is worth it i still think it's going to poop on kids not that pooping on kids is like it's it's freezing look let's just move on perpetual motion grants bonus stability handling rail at speed while i'm in motion and increased damage and handling for finals of grenades or this weapon ninja has vowed to disciple origin trait soul drinker gain health based on the number of hits before reloading and like all about the disciple rage takes shaders so well it's the best you know that's a lot of red probably too much red which is why i went with it into the crucible we go ah hunter what does the scanner say about their power level dragon ball z scouter helmet hunters always get the cool stuff man look at this they think they're going to grab a off the bat not if i can do something about it a quick kill however i'm weak and disrupted and suppressed wow throwing all the debuffs at me come on bro it's 20 22. okay honestly the red kind of hot okay it looks a lot cooler in person especially the red twisty bits right there there's definitely a better way to title those than red twisty bits here i go okay and there there we go oh ah oof do i have hold on let me see my main ingredient 740 charge time okay so it's the same as my made ingredient i didn't realize that so don't i don't know i'm not supposed to be using my scout rifle but also okay it kind of looked like it might have probably killed in a normal world but maybe my decreased impact okay here my decreased impact is coming in handy little too much increased mag does nothing in pvp but it doesn't decrease our damage wait what's my charge time now seven for wait am i getting troll charge time 740 charge time 740 what is that a visual glitch is it is it changing is it not is my whole life been a lie oof you know my main ingredient probably kills there and i didn't kill either of you oh that's fun wait he used deliverance well that's not fair that's like this is my video dude this is my video guy we're trying to steal the spotlight okay it's not a good look on you ah there we go and he didn't have any ammo so i can't do anything except use this please kill me thank you i know what mister fruit why forfeit your life so easily it's good i didn't have anyone bro and i'm here to why yes i'm here to wow you guys you guys aren't oh yeah go right into that for me please you stole my energy you that was my kill dude to the killer the spoils okay well killer makes it sound a little more psychopathic and less infatuating not infatuating what the fudge fla flattering that's the word the to the slayer go to the spawns yeah see kind of makes it seem like i'm justified was on my side in this kill ah i do know it can have some pretty cool perk combos and again like most things in this dlc the appeal ah my is not that so you can craft it and make your own god roll and enhance some of the perks while you're at it ah but good luck getting that much you guys are making this extremely difficult just let me get some kills my deliverance dude like it's okay i did not realize you're right taking care of business not in any way taking care of this and smoking over time there we go there's a classic fusion rifle kill i'd be pissed about it let me get another one oh he's weak oh that's a kill that's a kill are you kidding me i hate everything you hate not as much but i'm just full of hate they stop it your shotgun's winning at close range which does not fit my narrative fusion rifle is better than anything they always win all the time so stop it yeah oh he's weak nice it took all my ammo but we slayed the base and again with the help of others but teamwork makes the dream work there's my ah a perfect yeah yes yes i was out of ammo all according to plan every time i die i mean to die wow you must mean to die a lot you have to say like that but uh yes yes i do ah there's a kill is this our bubble because i don't think it is oh well your bubble's gone where is your car no i feel that dude i usually place a bubble i walk out like two feet and every time i immediately die what it's like they were waiting for this exact moment oh head chat tater tot give me this ammo i need this ammo yes all things considered that went pretty well you know what else is going to go well now oh i actually got somebody oh this does not give me an overshield uh yeah though we only have five teammates and yet we are well i don't think we're gonna win but we're kind of hold of our own and i'm top of the team so let me rephrase that about let me let me recap the things that are important i'm top of the team yep that's it that's that's all i got to recap selective memory is is a great thing guys if you're if you're going to want to watch my content trust me it it it'll increase your enjoyment of the content tenfold i that's not going to like you know there's certain ways to like enhance your viewing experience yeah just forget all the bad things that happened to me and you're gonna be like this is insane this dude is cracked see like wow i can't believe he killed him with his first shot how did how does he do that this scout rifle is something let me tell you so slow and clunky probably because i've never really used these kind of scout rifles before or scout rifles all right well you know it's not my fault this game was rigged from the beginning okay i'm just i'm just uh um papaya that's that's yeah that's just what i am i'm just a victim of circumstance pulling out the v card but not that v card the victim card everyone's favorite card ah let's just let's just what about clash any clashers but but uh oh mike wait what how was i not top of the team it's so much more kills than all of you yeah i'm trying zones captured same if not more power play same if not more zone advantage more opponents defeated more how was i not top of the team wait wait quick quick uh where's the app come on load load load yeah oh god clock stick it could you take longer please come on there acquire ah yeah [Music] yeah [Music] i got some repeatable vanities all trash what melee kills super kills grenade kills art kills i ain't using arcs three grenade kills is like trying to go unbroken like what super final blows maybe melees probably not all right let's have a good fight a clean fight a fight fight let's get ready to rumble you know the guy that does that's like 89 seven years old i don't think he's quite that old but he's pretty old i think he's like his 70s or something man made a living out of just saying are you ready to rumble you know good for him that hurts so much what did you use on me aside from your black magic sorceress sorcerer whatever you might be burn you at the stake nice clay wait wait i need that ammo did i get it i don't know this is some that was some ambitious range maybe a little too ambitious what yeah i would think i mean my range is pretty high okay fine so like my main ingredient practically is max when i'm adsing but that it felt like i would've done a little more than that i didn't expect that guy kill kill but something dude what is this like rpm a couple dicks a minute apparently 150 jesus it's it's you know i guess it's kind of like a 140 hand cannon but the 140 hand cannon feels exponentially better than 150 that you're well 150 cat rifle nice austin street share my name share my name no moanings or raju say baby i love you [Applause] all right all right pre-fire pre-fire free fire any pre-fires oh see now that was a nice kill it felt right and that didn't really i really really i really really really really wouldn't want to make it oh didn't i meant to cancel that before that yeah what how did you hit me my there's no way there's no way there's nothing you can do to convince me that there is some way you hit me around that corner like that just not i refuse to believe see that turn oh the movement wait what how'd you not die [ __ ] oh he's gonna die he's gonna die yes oh two grenade kills by the graveyards i might as well have gone unbroken i might get three grenade kills here wow you know what i'm gonna get heavy thank you let me actually 130 above oh only damaged them it's a parachute that's a water dawn too what's the water dawn doing what oh okay fight a grenade that would have been a grenade kill but i didn't it's the end of my ted talk thanks for coming i'm not going in that bubble i'm not gonna fall for it ow you either stand for something or fall for nothing give me this ammo thank you okay i'm just hearing super super super duper but none of my super i'm not even close oh there's a nice scale though be delivered from evil you heathens oh no thank you no what is this oh this is good this is good this is what this is hot movement deck i'm gonna charge it there's a kill i'm gonna charge it there's not a kill hey give me that ammo give me that ammo hold up yes yes we're on quite a town we and i still have ammo to spare no i don't know what i was doing it's just choice paralysis guy spawn over there over here there's another one over there just the worst just the two of us found just the two of us oh wait you know what they suppose supposedly fixed where is it where is it where is it is it aha i can finally re-equip my mmxxi all that grinding was for naught you weren't aware the past couple weeks if you took that title off it could be glitched and you couldn't put it back on which was my case so i grinded all that to not be able to wear it but whatever oh nice one buddy oh that's a grenade kill that's a grenade kill that might be a grenade kill ah it's not a grenade kill i was i was burning three of them started me a backyard bbq be still my bbq you know ah you're no match i can't blame you nah ah what's this guy using and the gun sounds cool stars and shadows ah who could forget that is so off unfortunate but i killed him so i'm top of my i'm top of my team and i'm like handicap myself by only using this fusion rifle it just shows how good the fusion is baby you are gonna die friend oh what he jumped above well played i don't know how that kind of happened but oh that felt nice wait what the unfortunately i do have my super now though this is my moment no no this is not my moment give me give me another moment one more moment stop dude you hurt so much you found demon stop what a team shot jesus i just need to get somewhere where i can pop my super around the corner and kill six of you i'm not asking for much you're all being toxic here we go whatever i'm just popping it because never gonna happen otherwise you gotta be kidding you've gotta be am i not gonna get a single super i'm not gonna get a single super kill you've gotta be kidding me that's why i don't just pop em god frickin yo wait i've never looked back

back there kind of hard to say oh you wait in order to hey rude yeah i'm i'm gonna get a frappu frappa kappa gene um heat uh hurry up i'm just naming pokemon to be fair that's that's kind of what i think when i just see some coffee menus what's what's this foreign language that i do not speak i'm better oh i'm so much better there's the deliverance i don't have ammo anymore though all i have is this absolutely we're behind two kills guys two kills that's all we need is that what am i i can't see like what what what is this goodness gracious two more kills guys two three more okay someone died okay that's it huh oof okay well i'll have the last word and i'm not talking about the hand cannon okay they'll have the last word on me never mind all right peep the deets peep the deets boom top of the team it's that easy the deliverance will deliver us from evil if you get it from the raid nice use it it's pretty cool if you can craft it great i'll probably at least in pvp my main ingredient's still a little more cracked so we'll see when i get a god roll well then it'll probably compete frankly but i'm not quite there yet so don't delay become what you and everyone else hates in the crucible today [Music] you
