hidey-ho John Mon Eames mr. fruit and welcome Bank - destiny - and I'm here to tell you about destiny twos biggest lie let me explain so it all started off with a community event that I took absolutely no part in once that was finally done after nearly a week the quest itself to get felwinter's lie unlocked sick right well you gotta get like 600 or something PvE kill so here I am loving life and killing thralls baby boom done sick what's next well hell turns out next part of the quest was bugged and all the work everybody did was a rendered it useless because we couldn't even get the gun and we had to wait for a bug-fix fast forward four days ish and they finally fix it we learned that fell winter has some daddy issues and then one thing leads to another and there's a shotgun what a beautiful story and here we are with felwinter's lie in hand that's right this isn't destiny twos biggest lie because the quest was called the lie it's not even destinies whose biggest lie because after completing the insane amount of public events the quest became bugged and no one could get the gun for four days it's destiny twos biggest lie because it's Belle winters lie sorry about that anyway felwinter's lies back tell me if the good news is I'm never gonna have to grind for another PvP shotgun so that's you know that's something ya shot package aggressive frame Shrike and modified that more uniform palette spread full choke Titan barrel juices projectile spread when aiming down sights the gas precision damage accurized rounds for increased range slide shot or quick draw opening shot for vorpal weapon and when G knowit fully masterworks range so now obviously myself and my pet pet Guardian are headed into PvP to use the gun sounds great let's go and now we play the waiting game how long will it take for me to find a match that one clocked in about 5 minutes and 20 seconds that's a new pace where Haven huh why can't I get anomaly the one time I wouldn't mind anomaly well I'm mr. fruit like that preschool teacher Ollie said you get what you get you don't throw a fit but I'm not throwing a fit with the fell one's got a Saudi I'll give it this much it looks cooler than a dead in d1 as far as I can tell hey all that work for d1 gun dude sign me up facetious what me no never I'm gonna use my in taste Ward's to activate slide shot and reflect in projectile Boosh okay well oh my god wait what Oh taking my time to line up my shop but then it disoriented me and does that mess up your sensitivity because I straight up it was like and then I'd beid point being don't miss your first shot mr. fruit you don't have to worry about hitting your second oh my look at this dude oh the sad thing is that was probably just scratching the surface on the range the shot gonna have this saying is a deadly weapon and you were dead it was quite literally a death throw its it let's try this goosh goosh okay wow that actually kind of butts okay well that kind of gives me some hope I'm sure it still gets some ridiculous stuff but I'm thinking we missed some pellets in the spread I don't really know I'm ignoring the objective I'm so sorry goes goes yes that is not as egregious as I thought it would be to be fair I mean I mean that's like point-blank like what else is a shotgun do you know I'm saying I do want to aim down sights frankly that's yeah reducer projectile sparing aiming down sights comes at the cost of reduced precision damage but I feel like that's that's now important but again you don't really need a great shotgun when you have Antaeus words your gosh I really killed no one with that really stupid I saw red on my screen I panicked I clicked the super button and I guess it didn't work the in taste words are disgusting with a shotgun slide shot Antaeus words words that could make even the mightiest of men shake immediately do boo boo could be me what the fudge another one oh nice another one and another yeah just like it appears to be an ark staff out there captain you know if I'd've Orpah weapon on right now we'd be mounting these supers even more bop gotcha oh you thought you were slick huh thought I wouldn't see this coming huh you oh my god I'm kind of surprised is it me or does like it's not shooting nearly as far as you think is there a way to use this incorrectly maybe I it feels like I am like okay we're not gonna sprint we're gonna do this as evenly as possible okay I'm just gonna I'm just gonna leave that like nothing ah so I guess this doesn't have as good of range as you would think at the cost of more you know it might am I missing something I feel like I'm missing doing I don't know I mean I'm more consistently one shotting closer like maybe that's it but I mean I used to call this thing the felwinter's sniper for a reason I mean do I really have to tell you what it does it says shotgun but it's a sniper this thing would map you from so far away but now it feels like there are a lot of shotguns that do it better which is strange because yeah if they were gonna bring it back you would think that's the way they would bring it back you know with insane range but here we are no we got em on ammo right now though girl I'll tell you what what's she doing up in the air leave that I can't him for alive for me Bob stay focused stay alive oh my god no I didn't do die didn't really do either wasn't focused when I'm dead when I thought I saw some like some like crazy clips of like felwinter's like going in you know interesting interesting I mean obviously like we like really like with that with slide shot by the way that didn't kill very interesting very interesting indeed I mean perhaps this is better right because literally everyone and their mom now has the founders lie so if everybody now could run around with the most mathius shotgun of them all then that would you know that would be a bit of a problem if it would early every perk every intrinsic frame everything has going for is like yeah dude range but then I'm like nah I really have a way with words sometimes incredible does this guy have a super Oh he'd uh you know I've been holding on to my super for a while here maybe it's time I use it sure yeah opposed oh my god I got like hung up on the wall I get funky I feel like you I got kick shot because I gotta be like a sniper please Scott I'm sucking on another icebreaker dude screw this my mouth could use the refreshing scent not sponsored by the way we are sponsored by water or that's right hydrate everybody the two shots in the mag it's all I need oh he has a sniper I'll challenge this well that's how challenging that went I'm here to eight eight eight I won that ape off on the bed or eight eight eight look at me ape out I'm dad is it better without a diecen seems incredibly counterintuitive but maybe it is I mean like specifically has a thing that's like hey like in China pounce Brown if you aim down science but maybe the precision damage reduction is important enough that's like nah dude oh my uh Howard good to see ya so you have yourself a fantastic day there our in the meantime I'm gonna try and capture me some content god I respect the hustle was this guy doing all up in what's the fudge where did you even oh my god get destroyed I'll rip why do I always turn into the gingerbread man look like he was looking at me - alright everything does a lot maybe my peripheral vision failed me very likely as well there's always an explanation nice wide shot what the fudge dude I don't get it everyone's like oh yeah finally no one has to get a god role like PvP shotgun like this is the end I'll be off but range wise I feel like I could be doing so much better here I don't maybe I'm wrong like I said I'll sit I don't really shotgun so all I know is the receiving end stuff I die a lot and it always seems like it's greater range but I don't know maybe that's like some bias on my part or something okay I didn't know fear me and my thunder crash crash Thunder crash unites you aggression can't hit me can't hurt me oh [Music] my god that was so worth it that was was rich was rich indeed my friends thank you for saving me my friend this will not go unnoticed I will remember this Here I am and here I go Oh like what with slide shot and I feel like you know right on center mass we don't even hit like half the pellet I mean it speaks to like some of the problem but I mean it feels like there's so much more than that  yeah just very strange I thought I would just come up here and bail you guys look at me I'm killing people for a my couple football fields away but now it's like guys I can't kill him they're like right next to me okay well that's not true like I said close quarters I mean there maybe that like you're trading range for that consistency you know what I mean although right there I don't know how to in one shot I feel like I'm the receiving and I died a half these shots that I don't normally kill like I'm not killing with these shots but the enemy always kills one of these shots you know that's kind of what it feels like right now I mean that one yeah half the thing hit the stairs like no way around that but later honorable but your boy is about to pop it off it Oh only half health on that that's kind of insane I mean like up close yeah tight on target but like why alright well now for science let me use a slide shot I don't know I know oh we're getting like a crazy comeback right now though so cooky what a grenade toss and by that I mean how did I mess it up bad here I go ready ah fudge but I've got my super back it was not completely useless give me my baby sock we lost man I slaughtered all those thralls for this at the end of the day it's a shotgun I don't use them very often but it seems like you sacrifice range even though it wants to make you believe it has range for this uniform pattern that is more consistent and yet because of that I hit nothing so get to massacring some thralls it's yourself the felwinter's lie today [Music] [Music]
