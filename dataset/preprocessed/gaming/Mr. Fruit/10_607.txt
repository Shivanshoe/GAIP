hi ATO v1 my name's mr. fruit and welcome to among trees a brand new early access game that I actually remember vaguely seen this game it feels like a year year and a half ago I don't know I remember writing it down somewhere and then during the PC gaming show surprise so yo it's here you can play early access so I'm like yes please I know very little but this is what I do know stylistically it looks beautiful and apparently it's a sandbox survival game I'm there so we're going to embark on this journey together so we can play in standard or Zen mode no dangerous animals if you don't deal well with tangling bear encounters this mode is for you oh but I love them dingleman bear encounters common Leonardo DiCaprio yep the problem won't win an Oscar so we're gonna go with standard there are a few dangerous animals for the best all-around gaming experience seems like there will be a harder mode later on but for now we'll go standard most of the animals are friendly bears are not one of them nonsense nonsense you know that movie Jaws I don't know why I just you know the movie Jaws you know that created mass hysteria about sharks you know hunting humans that's not true and I feel like bears are just misunderstood the same way oh it's so pretty look at it oh I believe this this alone is what an originally had me interested this art style like it's beautiful the sensitivity is so low but that's okay oh my got a fur plank yes please let's open up our backpack we this thing these beautiful planks smell of the fur they were cut from in a durable flexible and rot resistant use them to repair and expand your cabin that's right we can make our own cabin apparently you can make like tons of stuff to like furnishings right I'm telling you it's it's gonna be nice it's gonna be Zen it's gonna be a little bit different from the typical mr. fruit you know yeah mr. fruit where's the the what the fudge is in and you know the quick edits in the in the screaming and the killing well not here I I don't know what I'm doing this is what I do in every survival game I just well I just pick up everything I see although I should probably head to the thing the game literally pointed me to as soon as I spawned and there appears to be some sort of a way markers I'm done here and soon I should probably do that yeah this looks a little important what do we have here repair the cabin note items Oh take a mental note I need some more fur playing some some sticks see I was already ahead of the game I knew what we had to do because I am a survivalist a little known fact I've never I've never been camping actually ya know I would be screwed in the wilderness right I'm a city boy I'm a city slicker so I am currently out of my element but that's not gonna stop me from doing my gosh darn Oh hi bird from doing my best I'm gonna give it a Boy Scouts best I was a boy scout it didn't last very long but I was a boy scout at one point can't remember a darn thing they taught me all I remember is they took my fingerprint and that's when I learned that your fingerprint never changes despite your age which is why well at the time they used it to identify so many so many people I think now there's like an even better way they can identify you so I don't really know it's really irrelevant here cuz I'm just blabbering about when there's this nice peaceful world around us and the most exciting thing is I have no idea what awaits us it's kind of beautiful really oh I'm gonna build oh wow I work fast we unlocked asleep the saving and storage we got a cooking room crafting room and a storage addict oh let's open this up all this place is cozy hello we got a storage box a cooking room oh shoot okay so I need to I need to build it obviously can't sleep until nighttime storage addict need to built that and a crafting room so we need to we need to get a whole bunch of stuff let's go ahead and save our progress as for the storage box well I don't really I'm not too worried about us running out of storage yet now let me see oh yeah can I close the door I was gonna say I don't want no bears sneaking into my room well I guess we set on an adventure I just tried to pull up a map well obviously I don't know where I am I don't know how I got here or why I'm here but I do know I found some hoof fungus my favorite the sounds of nature though mm I the only one I was thinking about this the other day you know what I'm really sick the thing I crave the most which is so strange it's fresh air and just like the wilderness and outside fresh air I guess like you know I've talked to some people they don't feel that same way but for me I don't know it almost feels like this primitive thing I don't know like subconscious part of my brain that just I mean obviously you know like we we all started out like this gatherers and hunters and I mean obviously we're a little more set and we already know how to make cabins and stuff we're not trying to make fire for the first time and discover the wheel and whatnot I like to think I'm a little brighter than that but granted if I never had education you know I was just dropped off in the middle of the woods as a boy where would I be you know something to think about something to think about I guess that's kind of the Jungle Book so I guess I just learned to oh it's a bunny I guess I would just learn to the friend Apes and orangutangs and speak their language because why wouldn't I in bears and my thing another jungle book I am and I'm mixing it with Tarzan it's irrelevant what a nice stump what happened to your beautiful log oh you poor thing once we get a crafting table we like get an axe I saw this fishing off the fishing look so relaxing if I like that fish in minecraft something tells me I'm gonna like to fish in this game we're gonna be able to get an axe to chop down some trees get some more lumber I don't know what else you know other tools those are the only two I can think of for some reason again which is why I wouldn't last very long out or but at least I'm honest about it you know I really should watch more Discovery Channel shows or something you know I'm saying because that's the thing too it's like well I'm preparing for if I ever somehow land in the middle of Siberia with no equipment okay well if I'm ever even put in that position in the first place odds are I made a wrong turn in my life somewhere and I'm screwed anyway I mean some people do that willingly though and they have some equipment and stuff I don't I really should embrace the outdoors more though I'm gonna be going on a hike soon it's gonna be pleasant Colorado in the summer is beautiful not quite as beautiful as this this is picturesque and I don't even know what I'm doing and I don't care I'm just going around grabbing stuff oh I should have taken note of all the stuff I need to get all so I can sprint I'm just kind of taking in the scenery you know I'm not rushing oh well I heard some sticks breaking look I don't know which dangerous animals are out there but again Oh what is that thing that looks like something important I know there were Birds stars a bar I don't really feel like up shutting it however we're gonna see what that is because I know we needed like some wire stuff I'm assuming we're gonna have to find some loot spots find out where they're hiding all the good stuff now I appeared it oh I am getting hungry well I don't have the cooking station what is this an old radio tower watch tower electrical wire thing you don't I'm talking about me and they're like I don't know why I can't think of the name of that but well we can't do anything with it but at the very least it serves as a landmark which thankfully it's gonna be pretty hard to get lost because they've Oh a path Oh some wood oh wait I can't fire okay okay wait a second I you I can use this too oh wait search Oh what am I gonna find Oh nails oh yeah now we're talking ah I need a hatchet to break that oh yeah never mind this is the place to go I need a lockpick bodge but I need to find a lockpick okay we might just a steel pipe aim into a full okay can't be eaten raw dodge why it only helps a little bit can't be eaten raw can be eaten mmm okay I you know I don't really have the luxury of choosing but look at that Wow okay I'm numb nothing up yo those shrooms hit that spot and I'm not talking about those kind of shrooms okay I'm trying to survive I need my wits about me I need to mentally be here present you know I'm saying so remember this giant what I don't have to remember I mean hopefully I would remember to come back here when we get a hatchet and some lock picks I don't know if maybe we craft lock picks or we have to fine lock picks I don't know old rags oh my favorite how did they know oh I guess I could have gotten these berries this this Ruby beach seems kind of important but the who fungus I mean I am gonna discard that those don't seem as rare as this kind of stuff the naturally occurring stuff i I will rid of in favor of this stuff another steel pipe yes what am I gonna do with that undecided undecided Allah let my survival guide which is of course this all comes from memory you know it's up here in game they're showing it to me because I'm a pleb but my character in game um what you would call a smarty pant not smarty pants because I only wear one actually why is it foggy the little bunny out there why is it called pants why is it portal I guess they have two openings for the legs but like you know I'm only wearing a pant that just doesn't sound right though it's got to be some reason it's called pants I don't know I guess this is what I think of when I oh Jesus oh oh the game was so peaceful until say God not got a little goosebumps honey would poop myself whose either that bird scaring me at the Chipotle undecided oh oh oh those are bees oh I don't need a survival degree to know I want to avoid getting stung yeah that's not something I want to do it's also getting a little dark okay so where are these bees I don't know quite frankly I'm not gonna go find out myself Oh sticks my favorite God now I'm just worried of random sounds only the little bird I love you it's just knowing that there are our berries out there now it's just you know it's kind of kind of unnerving house having such a peaceful time dude now I'm kind of on edge I just want it oh well there's some bees oh but it's a beehive you could probably get some stuff from it just run past them okay we're good bro have you have you seen the news about those like huge Japanese Hornets whatever they're like death Hornets oh I forget what they're called but they might as well be called death Hornets or human killer Hornets freaking massive they're like 2 inches or something or even bigger up to like four or five I don't know but I remember hearing they're in Japan I'm like well it's a good thing I don't live in Japan except apparently now they've been spotted on the East Coast in America we're all done for okay I'm missing a lot of planks and some nails I have no stump Moss for the crafting room what about the kitchen not looking good there either okay well I think it's time to go sleep wake up in the morning and we'll go from there I'll find some more stuff I need to forget which one we're trying to build first not entirely sure wouldn't mind any of them though okay I'm back I had to take a short break turns out it was the Chipotle okay so which one are we closest to maybe storge but that one I want the crafting room okay so let's try and figure that out but I should probably store some stuff huh I'm just gonna go ahead and chance of poisonous oh that's not good okay let's eat berries yum yum yum yum yum okay screw this poisonous stuff I'll wait to cook that I store the hat store that I mean well I mean might as well store everything right I mean what's really though no point in hanging on well pretty sure I can eat some of that so I might hang on to that and get rid of that and yes okay so I can't eat those raw let's hope I don't need them otherwise yeah boy I might be in trouble but see they knew I would go that way which is why now I go actually wait a second I should follow the water right I would probably find driftwood near the water at I'm I'm fairly confident about that I don't know plus if you know if you follow a water source that's one thing I do know about surviving if you're lost find a water source and follow it down he'll eventually you'll come across some sort of civilization because everyone builds around water you know sustains life and other cool I'm right oh my big brain but unfortunately not even building that one for what that needs the driftwood I just thought about that but stop moss stump moss that's got to be near water too right and I fight the current yeah I can I don't know why I have to be a pirate to say that but it'd just be that way Yahoo there's got to be two more driftwood right you would think right and and the moss is yeah I gotta be near water I thought you know I'm trying to use my common sense here and I think it's evident yeah boy ain't got none I got said I wouldn't cut it out here oh what a nice jump oh wow the distance on that you can tell kind of been my knees you know I'm saying that's good Oh driftwood I think I only need one more for whatever it was that needed driftwood but now I think I follow it the other way up river was this Oh another Ruby beef which I can't eat wrong sick okay one more driftwood ooh that's yep that's a little too big not quite well we're looking for I kind of need this right now you know just chill we're just in this pretty little place the sounds of nature running water looking for stuff all right now keep an eye out on driftwood what is this oh yes yellow ash leaves mmm I know that those are good for insulation while building cabin extensions ah yes that's exactly what I was gonna say impeccable oh I can probably make a bow that already you'd think right shoot the bunny rabbits I know I know mr. fruit don't do it but you know life's life do be like that sometimes okay we grab the driftwood we have enough now technically I believe for whatever needed a camera I don't know I might be the cooking station Oh more of it well I'm not gonna oh wait oh yes oh but it's like in the rocks it's it's been there a long time evidently how it hasn't petrified don't ask me and how I managed to get it out from the middle of a rock don't question it just believe in it oh and now we're just finding driftwood up the yin-yang I should be looking for Oh something like that I was gonna say just landmarks or something sure why not right oh I love blueberries I actually do that quite delicious but I saw a picture the other day of what most vegetables look like before we you know kind of read them and you know made them hybrid whatever they are today Oh No thank you and seeing what like a rich oh wait no that's just a giant looking wrong thing I'd been jebaited oh I was gonna say why is there a castle well spoilers there's not I've been jebaited and I fell for it oh no I don't know what this is kind of like sauce kinda looks like a I'm no expert but a meeting lady's site for bears you can tell by the open space and the dirt because they've they've upset the ground you know when they're you know I'm saying it makes sense oh there's something else over here stay hidden from wait why is it tell me to stay hidden from dangerous animals well that's not good clearly this game knows something that I don't this is fine Oh [Music] I've just come to check out oh that is one giant bear oh my god it's way more terrifying than I thought you kind of forget just how big they are okay but if he's here he's gotta be protecting something real nice so you know we're just gonna use oh it's okay the wind's coming okay so the wind is blowing my scent away from the bear so that's a good start please don't tell me the loop the loop is watch watch he sounds pissed oh my god he's so fast i bleeding out of fudge oh there's bees oh my turns out the the wind I'm yeah if my scent was going towards him oh my god how do I stop the bleeding I don't know if I can doesn't does anything oh heavens oh boy I think I'm just gonna bleed out honestly I don't know how to fix that we had some raw cloth or rags which I assume combined with a crafting station you could make bandages but I can't do that okay but here's a big brain okay I might have nearly killed myself but we drove him away from the good stuff yeah wouldn't idiot he is giant though and he's scary and he is so much faster Clara I should have never turned my back Jesus do within like a second the boys on me sure knows how to hustle give it to him really wish I had an axe cuz I'm missing out on a lot of stuff evidently oh yeah give me that wire please don't see me please don't see me I just want the loot I just have a simple I just want oh yeah okay thanks don't mind if I do more old rags okay but I'm still bleeding so wouldn't really count this as a win but the good news is he's alerted to the other side so he's not looking towards us right and I'm crouching I'm making as little noise as possible thankfully my in-game mics turned off my immersion okay like no space in the inventory what I want to get rid of fudge okay just eat all these oh my god I'm about to die hold on oh wait shoot yeah oh boy a blueprint lockpick blueprint that's that's so big but I'm probably gonna Oh seats yeah this is incredible but too bad I'm gonna die before I'm ever able to use any of it fudge well I figured out lockpicks that's pretty big now we run all boy yeah I don't know what happens when I die is that edge do I reincarnate as another bear and perhaps I romance that one make a family have a wonderful peaceful life together but it's a giant ruse and when we're old and he's not strong enough I'll kill him in his sleep no I'll wake him in his sleep and now I'll make sure he knows who it is and what I'm doing I'll break his heart Oh be brutal never get to see his kids grow up the perfect plan okay but seriously like I'm trying to run back as fast as I can because I imagine I might just drop all my loot so if I could just peel a little I don't know I want to die in the middle of a river and I cross the river in time I hope so I died and you have to load the last save or a new game what did we learn don't go near a beer well ladies and gentlemen that is among trees we didn't get very far and
