hi everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to among us no that's oh oh no oh what ah how's the turn has tabled buggy what do you mean what do you mean all right what are you doing he's wrong i'll tell you what i am not trolling okay that is a that is a sour loss my dude we have two collaborators the last game imposters that i caught red-handed from first round are saying that but i don't know why you would kill someone right outside whenever you want to fix lights where's the body shark it is in the hallway of electrical the top hallway like that's a longer fixed flight on the left weird kill i have no one i saw sharks tiny ass legs and i just it's why are your legs so tiny i'm honestly trusting shark 100 shovel me yeah i don't know what to believe i don't think he's lying i don't think he's lying dude dude again with my european stupid ping it's not me i'm way lower than you think i am remember last game when you threw me out and i wasn't an imposter literally the same thing i don't remember that i'm way lower i fixed like take it out it's hard to think for myself so i'm going to let someone else do it for me i believe in shark oh my god they are american okay if i'm wrong i feel bad it's the meta i just realized it was dark green and i saw lime green so this is weird all right i'm sorry oh my god i'm pretty sure it was shark oh my god all right so maybe it's champion what the [ __ ] shark this is why we can't have nice things god that is a creepy looking stat kill okay here's what i'm doing i'm headed into specimen bay do it home do it get away from work look i got i just got super unlucky bro i got every freaking task in the stupid actually i think i didn't get no i think i got every single one i'm being honest oh no because there's also the simon says so i got three out of the four all right screw me oh oh oh oh so i come out of decontamination and see a body white was right next to it with me yeah yeah that's that's all i saw right next to med bay right below it so all right so let me let me fill you guys in on something interesting here fruit i just saw you and decontam right mm-hmm where did you go from there i'm doing my attacking specimen room oh you're still in there okay yeah so i go up i open d contam i see chamby like chambi you were like just coming in i was already in yeah it was decontaminating yeah so tell me how a body appears right outside the door where you were coming you were trying to come down to specimen how how does a kill happen there smooshed against the door without you seeing a name i did not see when i went into deca and decontamination when the doors i should have been right next to you because that body is smushed in the door i was hugging the bottom door and i did not see it damn so as either a smooth killer you can you can vote me off but it was not me i think the more important thing is the fact that shark doesn't know what shade of green it was oh yeah i was going to actually i think i'm comfortable it was buggy i think i'm telling you look because who else was whispering i didn't i did not see a body through the door i was hugging the door i did not see a so the bottom door of dick and tam i did not see chambi when i walk in champions and decontam and then he tries to go to the left that's where the body was smooshed on the left door the door champion i think it's check back hold on before you vote i still think boogie was not the killer i'm going to throw that out there right now yeah well yeah wait so if you found that why did he report home and you didn't did he like go back what happened oh my god the door literally just opened he he like panicked reported because he knew the body was there no i saw it once it opened because he's a crewmate vision uh what the fudge oh yeah that for my i didn't get to finish my stupid specimen task gosh thanks cuz stupid down we can't just wait to kill and report oh look at the task bro we barely got any done i want to say it's not home because i mean like if i'm imposter and i'm alone like that specimen bro like i'm taking the shot you know what i'm saying so i don't know maybe he did that just get me on the side but i believe it on top of the fact that dork was like i don't know what shade of green maybe it was boogie and maybe this chammi and maybe that's just a happy quin oh jesus it's shady shady it's shady wait han why um you just ran out of electrical what no i didn't you're oh you're gonna stick to that you're gonna stick to that wait did did you talk to him about electrical yes i'm i didn't run out of electrical i just left med and i went down all the no i'm all the way down right now near water wheels like the the there's an electrical panel there and near the where you vent out the leaves and stuff that's where i am i don't know i'm not an electrical sorry i literally i i literally just brain blasted and probably just third impostered chambi ran out of electrical and sharks stayed in there yeah the lights literally i don't know i literally i need ice cream i mean after this game i'm going to leave all the time i saw dork shadow he was with shark yeah he was following me and i fixed the lights and he died so okay it's 100 shark because the way shark just backed out when i switched when i was saying ohm that was bait that was not a brain fart i threw it on ohm and then shark took his sus off of me immediately even though i'm the one that reported the body because i just saw shark standing in there and that was just bait to get it it was a very big branch super wrinkly i can't handle it i can't handle it dude come on give it to my wrinkles that was that's content give me my wrinkles you're very big and i and it's hard to convince other people that it's not me all right shark can be you i'm waiting 20 20 imposters let's go get him i'm voting let's move on i have nothing to do with this i'm voting you ran out of electrical champion you were next playing us right now this lobby's hella racist that is bro did shady bro i just thought he brain farted if he act did he that is so omega brain oh my god [Music] chambi yeah let's get him out you have been sentenced to death i'm telling you don't do it don't do it i still don't think boogie was one imposter so there's obviously still one out there it was definitely wrong uh and it was shark and chambi that's it and if and if it's not i don't know do it don't do it okay that's we're going to ignore shark's original accusation of shady that seemed pretty solid right from the beginning but i would say but not shady if it's not champion but no no it's champion well here's what happened immediately in my perspective lights went out i want to go fix lights i think shady was all nice already i could not see a body in there i fixed the lights someone else did i left right away and there was no dead body when i left the room so it was like an instant kill self-report or it was already there and i didn't see it but i i don't know i'm leaning towards the ladder i already voted elegal you're okay chambi what would you like for your final meal all i know is if it's not you i'm confused and i'm just gonna start pointing fingers wildly so be prepared what type of sauce you want sweet and sour okay [Music] that play was so big brain what the hell i don't lie yeah introducing some people to the tack welcome welcome welcome to the world of tech not like technology but technical very technical now if you want to get super technical what i usually do is you hold w and a you know so you kind of go down at an angle so you don't hit that wall that's the play you just kind of have to like hold it the entire time because you don't know exactly where you're going but then you're just like you're like past communications you're like oh sit cool guess that'll work okay let me see if shark's still here um that's shady where'd shark go oh chambi [Music] chambi champi chambi what why would you kill right there i didn't kill i went to go fix lights the lights were already coming back on when you killed somebody when the lights were fixed wait shark when i got there pulled up what who's there's two is there two dead or is it glitching there's two dogs yeah one of them yeah oh jesus so okay i didn't shark we there was one other person that showed up too but maybe they're the ones that are dead it simply was not me all i know is i saw a champion i saw a blood splatter a body fall over and then chambi running away uh um he was not going into lights he was trying to get the hell away from life okay i was i was leaving lights once they went on you're correct the lights went on i was dancing back and forth because i saw those 30 people there i didn't want to get stacked killed and then i started leaving and that's when the body was reported shark did you see anybody else besides me and chambi i didn't okay i did see you too but i didn't see who whoever died because it happened so fast because here's what i think oh yes i don't think it was you shark you were to the right i appreciate it i think it's you no i know i'm voting champion what's dude sure i'm not yes unless you were unless you just tell me your vote and i'm going with you i voted champion but shark if you vote against me you and champions don't do it don't i went for champion don't listen to him dude i saw you walking if we get another double kill then i'm on or something i don't know by all means it just happened so fast man so i don't know are you protecting sure christ i just didn't see it pretty serious dude [Music] i miss oh okay was that really nice really dude this [ __ ] bug is so annoying no i was surprised yeah i know you know everyone skips that we get out of it quickly unless we want to vote out shark for protecting his imposter buddy i'm down wait wait wait hold on hold on hold on shark has a report button that means he tried to report at the same time and he said he didn't see it no i reported the money that happened right now no yeah i had a report button too it's uh when you diamond animation yeah when you die mid animation it teleports all right it's a glitch that's good but also a shark shirt nobody could just leave it alone man my eyes are so itchy wait where'd she go he's the only one i can trust in this cruel cold world oh heavens hello dork we're all alone again except never mind faye is here with us get away from me get away from me don't leave me like hey [Music] okay so faye could have very well just chased after dork trying to figure out where dork went and now dork is 100 dead and i'm gonna oh well this is awkward i didn't think i would slip in like that that looks omega sauce but hopefully uh for all i know she's gonna kill me who really knows i'm just here dude simon says all right just leave me alone it's kind of sassy he freaking i don't know i shot door open i was like oh sweet it was time saver you know but nope oh fudge i actually forgot it no i didn't because i'm insane okay don is here don just went down that's kind of it's kind of weird shark just came out wait a second but wait what how'd you already open the door wait shark i'm gonna get killed or it's a double kill i need a report i need to report i need a report i need to report chart came back that's weird that's weird why would chart come back get away from me get away from me guys i'm pretty sure it's shark please fix the lights [Music] i'm hiding in the ship dude screw i don't know if he's following me bro if he is it's gonna be weird bro where is it i was about to do the meeting i have mad base cam by the way you're about to do the meeting yeah let's press the button yeah okay let's pretend you push a button hi what are we talking about so i saw that in vitals there's a dead body i saw fruit trying to press the button and i went to try to go lights but then he went lights and i was like all right i'll hold the button hostage to like push the meeting right away so you're putting fruit at lights no i'm not at lights i headed that way because the body is on lights it's like the door for lights this this was what was i found like really interesting i open the door and it immediately shuts on my face so i think a ghost is watching me and then i open it again and the body's right there now i didn't go in to check around but if you're saying that fruit ran off that is a little sus i am well i really yeah not only that but oh fudge you guys killed my innocent buddy anyway i'm literally hiding at keys because the lights were off and i thought shark was gonna try and kill me um so i was to run there and then hope he didn't see me and lights came on and if he was near me then i was like that's pretty simple i was on the button can you put shark on the button uh i mean that's the last place i saw him and then i left yeah because i thought it was gonna kill me yeah i was chasing dork it's not dork dork is ruled out he's innocent you were freaking me out trying why did you though go into specimen bay and then immediately come back out you like went in ran in then just immediately came back because i was going to go to med bay that way but but then you know okay that sounds weird as hell dude okay how's that weird i followed you guys because i didn't want to die i'm telling you my spidey senses uh huh yeah i mean my spidey sense was on him too what are the rocks what about fruit man uh okay what the fudge man it's let me go fix lights before i can die hopefully jesus it seems like it was champion though i think i mean i have to if it's not like where this is oh sharks here get away oh i actually have a task left in and [ __ ] wilmo i didn't realize yeah whatever arms just don't mega con in though i believe it [Music] i believe it he's just following me he's gonna kill me as soon as the cooldown's down what the [ __ ] i mean i gotta do me like this bro he's just following me menacingly i'm gonna dip i'm gonna try and lose my tail no i'm still following me god if he kills me in the ship too no one's gonna find me but i said i had a task here i did it okay i'm gonna go to the right i'm gonna go to the left oh oh nice who's on the left let's see on the left we had shark and the door dork's hiding up there okay i don't know om could just be buddy budding with me to just buddy buddy with me okay here's the thing shark doesn't think that i'm gonna come back here but check this out big brain know it i'm finished with the mind house yup yeah we did see shark go up there and i was like he's not gonna expect me to double back to the reactor after it's done and sure enough wait wait wait wait no this is a self-report no listen do you not remember at the start when i said i was holding the button and then fruit went out to fix the line okay if you're going to convince me anything tell me this what's up i'm following for i'm falling for it around and i was actually getting super sassy fruit because of like him trying to get me on the ship and all this but you went walking to left reactor and then we never saw you again even though we were at the window where did where are you saying that you are then shark i went to med bay like i said i had a test there oh no you didn't oh no no no no you didn't oh [Music] dude i know so like i'm playing right and i'm like i'm commenting at my own gameplay i'm like [ __ ] everything i'm doing is so suck what am i doing and then when you told me to defend myself i was like uh yeah i was in finals i muted and i yelled i was like why was i stuttering i was so angry at myself you still almost got through hey [Music] bye
