probably dead sorry ab i probably got you killed [ __ ] he's so weak man yeah sorry it's okay he had red shield i got rid of all his shield and everything i just get i was just too aggressive i just don't let us position and then start the fight because then we have to run into where they can see us you gotta be kidding me how these dudes play man there are two arc stars hitting them if there was an other team well if you can grab our stuff and resist right next to it that'd be there's no way to run no way oh yeah i don't think there is i mean there is there's nothing i have to wait until they start fighting is so blind i hate my life are they really not fighting anymore oh they are fighting they just hold this horizon think she's being so five him yeah because if i kill i want a beamer you just don't wait too long because they start resting after a fight i mean they start healing oh this is the time now they're killing well they just killed one of them she was debating her teammate oh shoot me your boners oh that was the team is she black hole herself i think so many how is she not dead what what is this yeah that's fun and interactive that's right mr fruit oh i hate losing to teams and like don't fight anyone until the very end you guys alright yeah we're just doing to a team a team has been doing us the past three games i'll find his teammates there he is he's on the top i'm running to blue shield broken he did he wasn't broken here we go oh wait anyone can use it now what you're a pathfinder not bloodhound anyone can use it i guess that's why you get the extra old charge now it's kind of cringe apparently only bloodhound pathfinder and crypto so they're like the recon people or whatever what did you put in there your hand yeah i know it's just not the same [Applause] what you got give me some attachments i should have killed you now i'm gonna do it anyway from your arm anymore betrayed me trusted you coming guys oh oh oh my oh [Music] you marked it and picked it up oh what wow uh it smells pretty good was there not no other white man what happened to barrel stabilizers little two and then i picked that up and and the energy map or the light bang uh

even dead as soon as i got him just leave me just leave me going are we fi we fighting that or no okay i got a shield up this is in a bit really bad position because they have way more cover than us i'm running towards you kinda i'm gonna try they're all right on me right on me hold it oh my god i gotta grab babs banner oh my god oh my god [Laughter] why would i assume there's a giant hole i just why would i assume that are they there um i'm dead yeah he's on my body i'm just yeah just for race if you want to try and save me after you raise them somehow sure but otherwise forget about it living is pain man that's hilarious i saw you jump and i was like i think there's a hole there uh this is god rob uh here's a crater coming in that way you want to take this prowler i think it's probably spreads bro make sure to turn the full out of them let me tell you yeah i almost just felt like legit only two more teams and there's one of them just go up there like try and create more distances oh they're across the bridge right here right here in the distance nice trigger discipline love it love the burst damage falloff is real um i don't like that we're just running away oh well there's only two other squads honestly try and just keep running until the the two teams fight they're fighting oh yeah yeah yeah make sure you have high ground before your third party oh god what the [ __ ] is happening wait for abs not there should we i want to go to them that's what he's doing but the right way out no you're going to be low ground on him oh okay that sucks oh they saw you place it you're fine as long as they don't break it purple shield's almost broken on skippy oh they're jumping rob watch out for the two people behind you now they're weak rob's trying to get covered you're all in the house behind you rob to your right yeah they're down there two of them just got your help just sit with him yeah abby's not pushing him let him shield uh one one has purple shields behind you rob he's like running right behind you i'll let the other team find him maybe i have no shields ab come here he's checking the body uh yo shotgun here uh peacekeeping if you want okay third here let's get in the circle it's just something here i think i saw someone jump right there you see him yeah they're going the long way around so you should go back the other way yeah before they take that house in the circle where should we go in the house in the circle on the other side in your orbital canyon they're gonna take that we should go gotta have nothing like no heels just try and hold that roof if you can the the guy oh what there's only one guy the bloodhound and pathfinder just died in the ring oh okay really yeah yeah he's probably stuck he has to be stuck if he didn't get through that side he's stuck i don't think he can come in like that way like it's impossible like unless he goes through a circle like the only way he can come through is this way you keep looking that way i'll look this way let's go this way is there anywhere else you can come from oh see him yeah there is behind that white box hold on i'm not gonna push him super hard i'm just good yeah you don't you don't have to worry he also he's out of the zone like he has to come to you guys stop him nice nades purple shield broken nice snake rob you guys go let's go that's such a bad there we go boys easy i can't believe we won then i killed myself and everything that was hilarious oh my god it's only funny because we won [Music] [Music] you
