hi everyone my name's mr. fruit and welcome at Gaul beauty modern warfare and the gold grind has made its way to the light machine guns the lighting is terrible but that's a gold PKM you can see it here not so much solid gold but sexy nonetheless now I made the LMG as AP as possible so this is what I'm using the monolithic suppressor eighteen point two inch compact barrel no stock stock the snatch grip and stipple grip tape we are optimizing aim-down-sight speed and sprint to fire speed because that's the only way I can really make this work with my play stop since season two is coming out the day after this video goes live they've had double battle pass XP double XP and mm and XP running unfortunately I didn't get it utilize it as much as I wanted to because if you follow me on Twitter or you might have seen my comment on the community tab on my youtube channel my back went poopoo yesterday woke up Saturday morning to intense pain where I couldn't move at all so I haven't been able to do much of anything really but I found a way to sit a certain way in my chair and with minimal movement it's it's bearable new our new order cool just kick ok mr. rocket launcher dude you having a good job having it what are you doing before you're gonna get those nice new clothes all dirty your mother just washed those don't make her wash them again son I can't see a darn thing because of all this smoke and I'll said did someone turn up my game volume real look at us just slaying we're just fraggin and ironically enough do you guys know where the term fragging comes from because i didn't and i just learned and it is horrific fudge so back in the vietnam war fragging was a term when US soldiers would toss a live frag grenade in their operators or commanding officer whoever was above them given the orders in their platoon yeah they'd throw it in their 10:00 at night in hopes that well they would frag them it was called fragging apparently over a hundred officers died this way 700 plus or injured and there's a lot of undocumented cases so they don't know the exact number isn't that just terrible it's horrifying and there was one officer who was so paranoid about this of evidently he changed the placement of his tent every night for over a year every single night trying to prevent his soldiers from being able to frag him in the Vietnam War I'm gonna be honest our worst enemy was ourselves because what the fudge were we doing there we didn't know nobody wanted really to be there or at least very quickly didn't want even that public support it's just like III so that's the meaning of fragging you're welcome but more specifically thank reddit I learned so much stuff from reddit I love you reddit there's a UAV in there I'll let somebody take that down if they need it because I have ghosts now I'm gonna do a good job of remembering what I'm trying to talk about because I am on some muscle relaxers right now because of my back it's even been a little while since I've taken one but my god does it stay in the system for a while this those things mess me up man the whole day I'm just out of it I can't I can't think I hate it like I hate the feeling but not much I can do about it I mean I would rather have that then my back just ceasing the entire time and for those curious a lot of people I go well if it's like a vertebrae issue some like that could be a big deal no it's Laurel I know exactly where it is gonna be going in to see a physical therapist this week hoping one day you do win hoping to find an answer and a way to either solve it through them or they can point me in the right direction who's trying to snipe me I've just been getting up there because I'm used to trying to get mad at long shots recently the LMG challenges are very manageable it's like 65 mountain kills 45 long shots but the reason it's kind of not manageable is because well LMGs are kind of do do I said it and I meant it they're just they're just not my cup of tea min I know there's a guy there's a guy in the window which I'll take him out first and then hope that his friend doesn't are we playing ring-around-the-rosie or did you kick these guys love holding their lines of sight it's pissing me off so anyway trying to do my best focus up here despite my medical handicap right now but it's I do not like the feeling I'll tell you that much okay we're just wrinkled bring the road the oh my dad sounds ran out now they know I'm coming I thought a guy laying prone what what AHA I was just surprised I didn't think they'd run back into my grenade but these Rascals they don't seem to care Vito is also on the way and I'm willing to bet too much money that it's gonna not kill me but he will report recently came out from Activision perhaps in in anticipation of season 2 coming out or something not entirely sure but season 1 or modern warfare so far whatever is actually performing better player wise and monetary wise then black ops for with its black market so in other words the battle past system and everything else that's come with it the blueprints whatever is performing better than loot crate's which is good news because hopefully then they'll follow that trend moving forward I know not everybody likes the current system either but here's the thing you get everybody ever you get everything gameplay wise foe free that you're not missing much blueprint wise and stuff either so we get all the maps free this is a system I can get behind and I'm interested to see what season 2 is gonna have for us apparently there are some leaks called it II accidentally said something I'm sure it was a PR stunt every time it it always says like oh so-and-so accidentally leaked something early I go hmm accidentally me think not I know he's right I see through your ploys the median news cycle I know they're just trying to get people to hide we started pretty hot I'm not gonna lie hey hot enough that we got the dub let's go you know what call me crazy but we're gonna do realism mode can't tell you the last time I played this but hey why not I know some people don't like to watch shipment so we'll exclude that from this gameplay and at least this video I know I know so you mean to tell me do our other maps in the game debt aren't you shooting house and shipment I thought the same myself okay so I at least gave us a site so I can see a little bit who you're my teammate could have had me fooled for a second realism mode though means that everyone will be listening real nice and toy um did I I did kill him okay doesn't mean let me know if I kill them so realistic my none oh no that's just a weird dead body or something I was gonna say one day yeah that one hurt Bob that one's gonna leave a mark okay so he's right around ah I've got it mate I think it's to be told all right fine no one else is gonna do this I'll do it myself you oh wait did I kill it I don't know it it doesn't show me XP but I'm going to a match I don't I didn't get a hit marker though does this mode even do hitmarker stuff at changi ki hey Gabby at least when you're that close it's pretty easy to tell if I got the kill or not oh there you are fudge me I had my reticule on him but I was looking to the left in my peripheral view the by the time yeah it's embarrassing like my thing was on him how many people are left it ah ah all right I'm gonna eat that over there and then he's gonna expect me where'd you come from where to confirm weird yo there's no radar no I'm on watch okay but see you look at the up oh you already killed him okay hold really did they spawn there I'm pretty sure they did that's unfortunate high personal red a down team you're welcome no need to thank me you can do that later I believe there's a guy never mind oh I'm going crazy ah got that killed oh now let me post up and get double cheeked up here in this building mm-hmm don't know what they're doing to him ah okay alright well yeah evidently expected that play got him now this is realism mode so head shots I'm pretty sure always just you know I'm saying like a I don't took about bow wow wow wow you got one oh Jesus got another oh good there's no got another there's another one coming throw that grenade hold on trying to not die here nice throw oh my god okay I'm actually fraggin right now give me a second give me a second no we got American sniper over here and only this fella come on ooh that's a positive hit oh he's trying to wallbang this sucker nice work buddy you got one kill and let them get the objective so we're just a soldier who's alive but it's done nothing is worse than a dead soldier who's at least done something that's kind of bad to say isn't it maybe that's why they don't put me in charge of anybody or anything ever in my life that's my go-to philosophy on everything and why wouldn't he look at me walking out in the open I don't fear death you shoot okay you know now that that just died I got to say I did have a little bit of fear show itself that's a kill and I don't really know what happened after it's cut out for interpretation really just like interpretive dancing okay now this guy's gonna rush my house thinking yep that I wouldn't know that he'd be there and then that guy right there was looking for me although I knew he was ripped I was trying to think like eight steps ahead but I only got seven I only got part of the way there you know in those movies when people can like see the future and they like walk through the steps like this is what's gonna happen after this and then as soon as that happens I'll get I'm kind of like that or night I in my hero but I can only see so far ahead it was just past my future vision my foresight through yeah foresight right because if yeah that's that's in the future because if I wanted to look in the past that would be hindsight right I don't know either way I think I'm making sense more or less all right people we need to team up on this piece of poop check it ready no no no come come come back come here guys it's right that's right there I'll keep marking it for you all don't worry you go friend oh I don't even think you got one kill yep I'm gonna die right here don't I don't like it I don't like it Bob I don't like it you know now that I'm looking at oh the gold is ooh I do like the top of the magazine latch has it but it opts for so much of the black gold part of the came out rather than the solid gold part and I don't really know how I they're capturing it okay there's no time for this mister of fruit stem up and get in there but I'm gonna go silently they won't see this coming and my friend is distracted but I put so much positive realism my heinous you'd be on the floor gargling in your own blood sorry does dart wasn't it I don't know I ended that as if it was like a question mark wasn't it now it was I know it was I don't need you to tell me that it was the clock is ticking lads wait they got the HQ or all let's finish this one in style boys what's the score okay we're down a little bit how much time is left 55 seconds this is doable I think I'm not gonna try and run the math cuz crunching numbers makes my brain hurt and I'll be honest like I said with these ol muscle relaxers ain't gonna happen you're lucky that I have enough motor functions right now to move the mass keyboard in fact I think my performance right now is nothing short of spectacular given the current circumstances not only that but only being able to move my mouse and keyboard so much I had to turn the sensitivity up because I can't move my mouse as much oh god it does kind of scare me because it happened once before and I was like okay yeah just a weird flare-up but now orderly randomly happened out of nowhere and it's put me out of commission for two days and if it becomes worse at all which it certainly could yeah yeah I don't know thinking about it makes me very anxious so let's not think about it instead what okay well played you need to make a pretty good stand here friend because um you don't we might lose the game so no pressure no pressure at all stay alive you didn't oh my god wait we got the lead though this is incredible what time 47 seconds oh yeah okay okay so it is still entirely possible that they can come back from this I'm just gonna have to hop on that next obj and do what I never do which is play the objective and at the very least contest to waste time 800 IQ what a noble sacrifice mr. fruit yeah I know I know not gonna get any medal for it either you know if I don't get a medal for it did it actually happen did I actually do a good deed because as far as I'm concerned no medal means sex you know I didn't do anything like I'm trying to get to the objective here but they got this thing on lock give me a second I'm doing my oh here we go I'm doing my best to infiltrate how copy I'm contesting half copy that's a nice double kill there mr. fruit I don't know if this is the only corner I can call I got a really just whacked him so many times with this thing screw you screw you too oh yeah just keep contesting mr. fruit are wait oh yeah not being on it is also good to just I just can't let them grab it Oh mr. fruit how do you do it you know what I think my back hurts because it has to support holding up this massive brain of mine it easily weighs a couple stone oh no actually how much that means because I'm not British or European whatever stone oh you're dead stone is that a hundred pounds something like the 100 killed keep kilos kill agree whatever let's go we did it Hey never mind that listen I was just double-checking to make sure he was dead also I got a killer it thought I was gonna say show both of them Brent come on now one light machine gun down three to go then I got a gold all the snipers for more assault rifles to level Gold's for those and the ride shield so I don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore thank very much for watching have easels fantastic day I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] [Music]
