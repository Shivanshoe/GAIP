sick how are we sinking i think it's just the rock i think it's just the waves the waves yeah jordan gunder is actually atreus's son yeah it's a trait like it's something he makes in the well what's his name loki makes it in like the mythology right yeah and he's loki and i think because they said they want they say they want to grab someone but they want to make it their own volunteer is actually yeah the future thing is like tear was actually kratos yeah so i think i think that they may change like maybe that's what they'll hint at but then of course kratos doing kratos things he changes in the future we're officially in the ocean i see land in front of us yeah i'm praying we make it there it's odin looking over us really like it if we could get a little bit closer i'd feel a little bit better because you know they say this be a bad time to mention i'm a cannibal they say like a captain goes down with a ship well hey i ain't claiming captain you already did you kiss you said ab was your second mate that means the only way you have a second mate is by being the captain i don't remember that no my brain so how do you anchor this thing no whole ad farm yeah farm that skill from the sprint oh don't fall off it works why don't i get like level up for sailing trouble oh how'd you get back up i just spam the on the bladder e e oh wait wait you guys are gonna have to kill those guys immediately so they're gonna kill our belt no meme no we'll land on the left side then there's no none on the left side yeah there are there's even more on the left side oh my god they're huge we're stopping here this is it boys new land we claim it as our own yeah that's the wow that's a one stop oh it's a one star good oh we got a brute cover there's a brute coming we gotta get rid of this one oh uh we gotta hurry we gotta hurry got him nice problem is is we can't die here we have no bed like if we die here that's it oh yeah no don't die oh wait distract real quick i need the pings that are we remember where our boat is so close to dying nice ab run up okay i got one it's just the brute left hey oh bro what happened no what happened he's the one who said dope we can't die oh i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming all right it's just the door or brute left i'm gonna start using arrows better safe than sorry oh yeah i'll just bait him stupid oh nice oh ah okay okay that's all i got that's all i got dilly dilly nice i wish rob was here let's make a chest for him yeah we will ooh a 10 deposit let me get this do you need wood you want me to start chopping down the wood 10 um i got 36 let's see what we can make all right i'll need a workbench let me just chop down with while we wait anyway and it needs shelter oh it works now hog all right we gotta let rob know we we saved the stuff here he rests oh there's even more 10 deposits oh i think it's one of those spawners that we saw last time yeah oh really okay one second oh boy you ready boy i'm running all there's a shaman here too yeah we'll have to get him first i'll aggro the brute then it too blue okay i broke it i gotta eat ah fudge get away from me don't be warming mate come here call me don't run stupid stupid there's another one oh he's a one star oh i'm coming i'm getting my stamina back i go to eat [Music] destroy them i can open the chest it had two amber and three feathers is amber good i know it seems rare the only place i found it isn't chest in these houses so that'd be pretty good right if you want we can almost try and like see if we can trace back to our place i think we can if like uh trying to think i think if we go west from here i think we should be able to get there no problem yeah because it looks like it connects to that place where we fought the deer god so if we just this way we can kind of see what's in the middle oh level two board [Music] oh did it drop stretching at i think like six leather scraps i'll take it that'd be cool like like can we make like some sort of stove like something to cook food there is yeah i know you can't make like stews and stuff and they'll give you even better like healing and stamina stuff i'm all about that i almost want to go back to that black forest and find another dungeon but it's greedy did you die no oh i only see ab in the middle of the ocean oh you guys couldn't see it but when i respawned i was glitched in my bed so i had to punch my way out and it took and everything with all your stuff yeah if you go back to where he marked it your stuff is there okay let me just build a ship real quick and let me get one but we're walking back we're finding a pathway yeah if you go if you go south you go south and meet us you can see it that where we're going but i should also know i looked at your body and everything you had can be like gotten back like 10 minutes we put the important stuff in the chest everything can be remade in 10 minutes no it can't for the voyage is long and the winds don't blow and it's time for us to leave her let's get it right yeah i mean just have your weapons everything out ready and let's pray yeah keep the torch on you ready let's go the burial chambers i'll pick up yellow mushrooms so you don't like worry about everything we see well yeah we slight problem is i'm 295 out of 300. oh god i'm 180. what do you have we so we can split something maybe i have nine points you wanna give me all the coins uh okay i got that stack um problem is i have 9 10 or which is 72. okay i'll just i'll start picking stuff up you know i'll just get rid of like the stone we don't need that right now and i'll i'll split this wood i don't need all that i have enough water over here trophy we both did at the same time oh okay we got three amber okay here's some gold for you yeah i'll just leave it in the chest arrows oh i got flint head arrows and then just some feathers nice yeah i'm just gonna keep my shield up here okay okay steady oh you're the shield he's probably in front get him stupid take the bone fragments too since i already have some if you pick some up just oh what is that oh oh it's just oh that [ __ ] was certainly so we gonna make a furnace so we can make a charcoal kiln or a smelter with that oh oh that's perfect okay so yeah that's perfect we can keep going but if we get close to dying at this point i don't care we're dipping yeah we gotta go we'll just we'll tread lightly oh wait wait i'm gonna close things behind us too okay so we know where we came from so the middle we're good let's try the other door old nothing oh skeleton stupid nice oh here's bone fragments let me get him here we go hello nothing bridgeman i'll close the door all right last one oh i hear skeletons behind this one or maybe the other door i heard him oh i hear him nothing i'm just trying to close that sorry oh my god back back okay is there a lot of them there's four right around the corner there was one to our left too jesus all right i'm gonna get my arrow out oh okay well no that probably won't help because they're boney so i'll just wait are you maybe i shouldn't use my spear i can't tell if it's good again maybe i tried the spirit it wasn't as much let's see if i can get like one in or something oh god seriously i think five or six um meet him through the door like right there can you hit him through that oh my god they both okay okay okay we got one we got one nice okay one down all right i'll i'll try wait let me let me eat me okay i'll see if i i'll try and guard the arrows yo come in here shoot babe just let him come in let him come in easy easy bait easy bait stupid all right next oh he's one star oh close the door okay he might be a little bit tougher and he has a shield is that me ow he actually pierces through my shield i got him oh he lost his shield get up let's get the sword guy in here come on there we go oh get out played we got the strats boys i can stack the ruby one start [Music] another one okay the chest has gold i'm taking the gold taking the arrows you can have the amber and there's a feather we're open for business oh try to slam it yeah get on in here black a little bit closer there we go oh okay a little bit more than we wanted that's okay though [Music] all right let's see if there's any more nope another ruby there's points in here for you i hear them oh yeah yeah let's bring them in here oh they have one they have an archery one too oh boo oh there he is oh get in here get in here nice jump them jump and jump them what a development let's go this place is huge all right here's bone fragments by the way okay oh there's a pathway up here there's two doors oh nothing uh a ghost uh i don't want to fight that i don't i think we should take our go let's check out the other place downstairs take our gems and we'll come back here later yeah that's a good idea because i don't know what to do and if one taps on us i'll be really sad yeah and just see some ethereal form and i'm like you know what yeah that's a purple glowing i'm good on that one we'll come back nice rubies in here and i got fragments yeah we're rich with rubies baby oh no oh no okay all right we'll come back later once we have better armor or something i just don't know what to expect if we sit here we'll come back here with a bigger group also we can't breathe in the smoke i'm losing health breathing in the smoke oh really i'm not this this campfire is a really bad idea now wait have we gone this we did go this way right yeah we went through every other way that was the only way we hadn't gone right yep i'm getting greedy i'm getting greedy maybe okay um here you get your arrow let's see if we can shoot it okay wait where'd it go i don't know they're all right there i'm not sure oh here let's get yeah let's get the skeletons first oh my god what is that ranted remaining i don't want to i don't want to block that because i feel like he'll go through whatever i do get the small one yep go go go oh go go oh god bone fragments did you get anything both fragments oh my god okay but that wasn't the purple thing that was a random oh yeah maybe it's just oh i think it's a spawner yeah yeah we gotta go we gotta push him in why'd you light him on fire you did we gotta we gotta punch it beat it up beat the spawner up go go punch it punch and punch it there's more oh yeah they just keep spotted i got it guys okay we're not scared over here what's this coins what does this say oh my another one amber pearl amber pearl of that elder oh that's a boss right that's 100 boss there's amber pearl right here we're one we're one core away from being able to apparently make like the best smelter which is unfortunate but well we still got it upstairs to look the search do we yeah upstairs remember oh that's right that's why i said that a skeleton trophy you want that yeah all right you know what let's let's do it yep wait right it's okay it's not scary it's just a spawner we just have to run to it break the spawner and we're chilling well no no that one like it it literally said ghost oh it did yeah that one actually it actually is it goes so i'll open it you use your arrows we'll improvise yup see uh oh can you hit it oh you guys uh okay wait wait wait hold on we can maybe try and cheese this here draw your arrow i'll open you're gonna close it go okay i'll just block up like you keep shooting okay you're doing great yeah he definitely was gonna hurt a lot so he did like it's at 23 on your shield yeah and i couldn't even tell when he was attacking so did he drop anything i don't think so oh yes we got we got five let's go that was probably the boss of this place yes sir we search everything in here let's go nice it was actually just a friendly ghost he's like why hog yo first dungeon clear little celebratory bag let's go celebratory yell now throw back before we lose our stuff yeah please okay this is big pog now let's see what we can make oh so yeah we can make a smelter or a charcoal kiln oh they both take five cores we want to start with a smelter because the smelter is what actually gets us ore okay but it requires charcoal or coal or whatever which obviously we get very slowly so the charcoal kiln you put fire in or wood in and you get coal back really quick so first we'll make smelter and then the next five chords we get we'll want to make a charcoal kiln but i need some stone ice destroying our beehive what happened what happened once there's our hole in my house oh wait you built a furnace what what the heck what's going on all right welcome to the cabin boys all right fruit let's go oh my god he's right there run boy oh god this poison hurts [Music] you
