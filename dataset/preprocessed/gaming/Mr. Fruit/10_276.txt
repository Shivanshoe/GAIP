hey hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to dead by daylight now i say welcome back but most of you don't remember the last time we played it because it was actually a little over five years ago it does not feel like it was that long ago it was actually one of the first videos where i recorded and played with dork but that's beside the point for whatever reason a lot of my friends have been grinding it recently which you know good for them but they somehow roped me into it and i say wrote me into it because again the only time i've ever played the game was five years ago i have an hour of play time bryce has 1500 and abs also been grinding it recently and abs a god gamer so we all know how that goes 10 nudes um okay so do you know my brother corpse oh i just realized they have steve so the way this game works is each character has unique abilities but at certain levels you can unlock those abilities for every character but since we're in a custom game it's already like that holy cow okay so like what item should i take so you can take a med kit which is good for healing yourself and healing others you can take a tool box which is good for getting generators done faster or even sabotaging hooks um flashlights are like higher level play so flashlights you only use those on killers when they're like breaking pallet or something add-ons pretty much um add like extra perks to your item so for example you could bring a med kit and make it so the med kit lasts longer or heals faster kindred and spine chill uh i'm gonna make sure i run stuff that's not horribly sweaty oh my loadout got reset got it then i have this and i am good actually don't go easy on me i need to get i want to get good oh dude i'm not taking it easy you better watch out dude i'm going to stay away from him i already know how i'm titling this video it's going to be dead by daylight but i have one hour and he has 1500. okay is this some kind of personal attack said radio mr fruit i have a picture of bryce with a drawing pad okay really quickly i just want to say i only have 1490 hours 1500 is obviously only okay so what's popping up are little offerings they can slightly change how the game plays but it doesn't really mean much you should have brought amory versus i've never done the mori's i should have i guess we'll do it next game here's the here's the important thing who am i running from what what like who are you playing oh lord wait so wait ab can hear calms manka yes don't just don't tell me what you're doing guys don't tell him that i'm right here doing this oh hi
