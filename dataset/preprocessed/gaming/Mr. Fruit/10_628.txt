hidey-ho everyone my name is miss root and welcome to our minecraft hardcore world that's right if you watched our day 100 video we have now since made it today 200 a very exciting so this is the entrance to the kingdom if you saw de 100 this wallet familiar ignore the block we had a little creeper incident recently I haven't replaced it not important this Kurt oh Jesus house the kingdom lives on and a day 100 we didn't have a house but from day 100 to 200 I made sure to rectify said problem now we do have a house and not just some small silly little house now if I was gonna wait this one not have a house and then finally build one well then we'd have to build a house or a real house a decent house we're not gonna skimp on it and ladies and gentlemen skimp on it we did not welcome to the pagoda not a pagoda it's the POG Oh death also you like a little spruce forest as you can tell we needed a lot of spruce so I went out found some spruce came back planted a little forest we got going on here I love this biome and the leaves so I'm actually really excited about this I think I'm gonna make straight-up like a little mini biome forest around me in this what would normally just be regular ol Plains you know what I'm saying I mean it just looks sick and you can't you can't argue me check out the roof though that thing practically the death of me jaysus Oh God new new new uh new dirt net commence that Newark erected nighttime here bad approaching sleeping commence I'm gonna have one two three you gotta go down sir one further but I can't we'll work on that later Jarrett net needs to be extended copy this entire house was president death of me in fact we've come closer to dying building this house than we have any other way so far in this hardcore series so yeah maybe not my best idea because I am a smartypants and didn't have any feather falling the entire time we built this and you're gonna see when you go up there like oh yeah wow this is high this is you will die if you fall from here hi and it's just because I spent pretty much day 100 to 200 literally building yeah boy didn't have any enchanting levels I had like no XP so I couldn't really roll and it's we took we rolled the dice several times it nearly killed us several times look at this thing I'm so happy about it I know what you think of wait like he has like a medieval kingdom but now you got like feudal Japan going on here like what's going where it makes in some things you know what I'm saying and I think because of that we're gonna throw in some well we got to make the walls higher I think but then also throw in some spruce into the walls to match it all tie it all together you so much Bruce like replace all this oak wood wherever it is with some spruce I made some of it a little too intricate like this roof design that's what almost ended up killing us in fact we did fall once and I nearly pooped myself because we were high enough well high enough to die and this is that moment I can't oh yes I thought that was it so I put myself figuratively not quite literally but I was darn near close this is the paco2 my friends so we've got that going for ourselves I haven't decided if I want to do these lanterns on each corner going up pretty sure I do but we're gonna need a lot more clothes stone so I got to go back to the nether soon which I'm gonna be doing because I finally got a looting sword so we're gonna go to the nether trying to find some wither skulls and some of the wither here soon you fight that bad boy we've enrolled where we combined it with smite too so when we do fight wither skeletons and the wither boss I will be doing extra damage so that's gonna be a lot of fun anyway here we have our cows chickens the usual farm stayed the same this was originally where I have my scaffold even while we built and a pond at the bottom in case I fell from the scaffolding which I did several times Wow I need to die a lot of the sheep I have one green sheep wanting to die them all and then I eventually want to make like an automatic wool farmer bamboo here this isn't where it's gonna stay but I was growing bamboo for the scaffold and we needed which I didn't know scaffolding existed until I started building this so helpful its giant its massive it's unnecessary I wouldn't have it any other way so you're gonna come you're gonna see the first floor here we haven't done any interior decorating yet because it took us literally I think about 16 to 17 hours to finish this build so not easy and then if you include the basement which I'll show you soon over 20 hours was not easy and now you can understand why it took me from day 100 did you hundred to complete this build we threw glowstone in here because I'm a huge fan of glowstone I love the ambiance and when you look in between the slats at night oh no I don't know what we're gonna do with the first level but initially with some of these levels we're gonna need a bedroom we're gonna need an enchanting room brewing cooking smelting yeah I don't really know we're gonna find out though I still haven't moved the enchanting like I said that'll go up eventually the only remaining thing we had from our like template of a build of our house from day 100 are the wine cellars I like them they're probably not gonna stay but they're here for now but what I'm gonna do surrounding the pagoda is build a marketplace I'm gonna try and get villagers into my town apparently it's pretty difficult but I do have a village right over there that I'm gonna try and take all the villagers kidnapping myself then we'll have our own villager job farm and that'll be cool and we'll actually have like your villagers in our kingdom we have all the waterfall here double waterfall I really like this we're actually going to turn it in I haven't found kelp for source blocks but I was told you can make an actual like water elevator with soul sand at the bottom and if you make it a source block it'll lift you up and then opposite if we put a magnet block at the bottom at the bottom of the waterfall as a source block then it'll bring you down so have actual elevators here we have a farm level 3x3 we could have done 4x4 but I like to having a little bit of walkways here this is kind of unnecessary we already have farms and there's really nothing we need that much so it's going to be more for aesthetic purposes vanity as as most of this building but that's not the point vanity aesthetics it's all incredibly necessary you can go out on the roofs if you want you'll see higher up it's high up honestly makes me little queasy we have another floor just similar to the base floor or again we'll need to do some interior decorating not entirely sure what I want to do here guess what we go up again and you'll see like we have like planks here like this I have to fix this the higher we get though that's the village estar now the higher we get the floor my game runs it's like we're trapping dude I'm gonna you guessed it another one except this one's another farm level and we have more nether wart then a man could ever ever need but I think it looks pretty funny it's a bit over the top as is everything I've been doing in this hardcore series and I love it I'm really happy with it I'm kind of where it kind of sounds like we might have some mobs up in the roof and wouldn't you know it we got one more and another level right before the roof I think this is the last one before the roof and yeah you can see where it'll high here had to make another puddle as well and we were building up that saved my life a couple times now we're gonna come up here I don't know if mobs can spawn up here yet okay we seem to be alright for now this is the roof this is not completely done I love the little slope in here though we had to make it nice and steep death will antler looking things on the side all in all really people that I think the payoff is fantastic and I will say if I ever lose this hardcore world think I'll die IRL so that's all work in progress but this is the pagoda it took so long to make hopefully you guys think it was worth it I think it was worth it but we didn't finish there as soon as we finished the pagoda our work wasn't done because my inventory management storage compartments everything was atrocious we needed the storage room and originally as I go I'll just make one of those one of the levels you know above a storage room but now again we got to be extra so if you head down into the basement Oh welcome to the storage basement my friends our storage room you're gonna see here boom compartmentalised all itemized reasonably right so like this is iron ore blocks we don't have much though but this would be lighting so we have glowstone campfires lanterns torches if we need it this is all or diamonds emeralds gold this is sandstone so sandstone clay which you can get from sand sand bricks you know all that kind of stuff this is nature so flowers saplings this is mob drops so anything can get from mobs this would be logs this is building material so more specifically like scaffolding ladders this is all wool and dye this is miscellaneous crafting things so like furnaces crafting tables bells because that was kind of miscellaneous this is our enchanting this is our brewing this is our little nether corner that's fishing railroads miscellaneous come over here we got flint and all that good stuff redstone lapis coal this is just like stuff you get from farms food drops from animals seeds armor tools cobblestone we have way too much cobblestone planks this is stone this is building materials from wood this is dirt which is completely full I've way too much dirt windows sticks and then other mining blocks and then of course like I said you got to do everything a little bit extra a lava wall because why not and was the lava wall worth it I'm not really sure we almost lost our and time to building now I just need to get a whole bunch of sand oh never mind never mind ah no no no no and I'm not sure if the waterfall elevator will save it because if this gets on fire that would go straight up to our house which is also incredibly flammable so you might be paying yourself what if a thunderstorm comes we're screwed well over here we have our trash compactor down here we can throw stuff away if we needed to in the lava depths below we have to put it down far enough below as well because the little plumes or whatever that come out of lava also can set that on fire yeah real great idea working with a whole bunch of wood mr. crew totally don't see how that could backfire on us oh wait it does all the time but the patterns the the ceiling pattern all-in-all super proud it is super happy these chests all work too and you might build well how's that work so we have backwards stairs which allows it to because if this is a normal block chest won't open but we put backward stairs on it then put the item frames on it and now everything is stored everything makes sense when I need something that's no longer looking through every single chesley what the heck bada-bing bada-boom I know exactly everything is this also took quite a bit of time especially because we had to dig I wasn't originally gonna go down so far but the Royal bath house was conflicting so we had to dig way deeper than we originally needed to to be able to get under it but and lastly to round it out if that's what we've been up to within the kingdom walls but there's been something we've been up to outside of the kingdom walls you mad man well what are you talked about let me show you this is the reason why I am level 53 enchanting wise even though all I've been doing is building because most recently I have built a specific building a little ways outside of the kingdom one so we don't have to hear it or see it and you're gonna see right here I'm technically not done with it and I think it we're gonna have minecarts leading from the village here we'll wall the whole place it'll be our own little tunnel but I tunneled through the hill to head on over to our tower the tower of experience it's this is an XP grinder I made a automatic XP farmer it's not a mob grinder but it actually works with smelting so I'll show you if you go up our nice little tower that's right you're gonna start hearing it it's obnoxious which is why we had to build it up high enough so I didn't have to listen to this all the time but you'll see this interesting two traps and technically this is turned off but I'll show you yeah that was only one of them going we have an automatic farm XP grinder and the way this works my bread what's that Hank so somebody told me about this and this wasn't of my own device the tower and stuff I made so that it wasn't such an eyesore cuz you'll see here it's been making dye we have some stores stuff stored over there back in the storage room we have a double chest completely full of the green dye that's why you saw some of the green wool blocks we have too much green dye but the way this works I pause this so now the furnaces stop feeding into this chest because as you'll see here we currently have pistons shifting sand and on top of the sand we have cactus over there and we bamboo over there and when it gets too high the shifting the sand increases the grow rate at two high piston keeps shooting out with an observer hits that brakes that goes down then the hopper feeds into the chest chest feeds and that these hoppers which feeds into the furnaces that goes the same for the cactus the reason we have bamboo bamboo is our unlimited fuel source and cactus is what we burn we do that because it makes a die which gives a decent amount of XP so this hasn't been running for too long but if I come over here I do this which stops it from sending it into this now what happens is the furnaces remember how much they've smelted even though it technically isn't here so when I go to grab this die it's technically gonna grab like the three or four stacks of XP that it's it's made right so you see level 53 I grab this rule level 54 which might not seem like that much right but I'm pretty sure the higher level you are the more diminished XP gains you get so if we were a lower level like that would have been you know just an insane amount suing head back down I made a little puddle to that we can drop down faster but I suppose if I make like probably maybe one day I'll try and make a mob grinder I know people really like those I have no idea how to make them but if I'm able to I think I'll just make this like the the autumn eyes to village you know I use cobblestone for this by the way just because I have way too much cobblestone but maybe this whole thing the nice thing is it's close to not that I don't have to go too far but also far enough that you don't see it from base and that my friends has what I have been up to from day one hundred two hundred I am hopelessly addicted to minecraft this is so much fun I'm enjoying being creative it's just a really nice fun creative outlet which is why I like as you can tell I love building I really like making something I like doing it and knowing that like I made that hardcore you know maybe like a regular creative like oh that's cool I guess but I did that in hardcore hardcore just makes everything more fun for me and that my friends is the updated tour on the fruit Kingdom but what I want to have happen between now and the next update is I want to defeat either the ender dragon or the wither or both I'll take both and then also start a villager farm those are the three things I want to tackle hope you guys are enjoying these updates to those that do watch remember I'm doing this whole let's play over on Twitch so to those that stop by watch support free shape that so anyway thank you very much for watching have still spent a stay I'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music]
