heidi hope everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to more among us apologies on the delay between among us videos it has been an ordeal trying to set up a session but we finally got some more content so enjoy the episode all right ladies gentlemen welcome oh look at the little i haven't played since the update oh isn't this adorable oh this is nice i haven't seen all these little things now this is nice it's been a little while since i played and of course yeah boy is imposter first run so not a great look for us i'm gonna go ahead and just sit here i wouldn't mind if somebody wanted to uh walk on in here i'm walking on sunshine [Music] walking on sunshine and it starts to feel good [Music] and sitting here and i'm waiting and okay all right good enough had to wait for oh oh my god we can see our little uh oh yeah that's so cool that's great whoa right outside of security hold on don't someone's probably never done this spill the tea okay oh god here we go all right oh and for the record i don't know any info though shark is an admin with me i think right now yeah i i was in admin two seconds ago bryce you're terrifying me you know you turned me where are you coming from were you the one i saw in cafeteria that means it was probably jessie dude there's no [ __ ] way it was me i was on the right side of the map this is i think if he's the one i saw in cafeteria just so i'm sure here don is the one talking yeah just don donna's justin donkey dick is her father please okay dawn so you got nothing yeah that's all i got i don't know did you see anybody buy it or did you run past anybody no i came from electrical up through lower uh engine i didn't pass anybody probably sitting in an event sounds like self-report to me dude all right jesse sounds like you because you killed t-rex first every time i'm gonna skip what do you get that's kind of such rob i'm voting crafty looks like a murderer so i don't trust him okay okay it's always crazy okay clean surprise shark didn't end up getting a kill or anything i don't want to go on weapons right now because i feel like people are just gonna metagame it so hard i'm in a lobby with some new people you know some tryhards you know how it goes so i wanna i wanna stay frosty so to speak i'm stuck in here and i was hoping i would lock somebody out but i didn't all right well a lot of people coming from here to fudge okay checking for bodies anybody's in the chat i'm also reason it's so cold in my freaking house i need to turn on the heater i'm gonna do that next oh this one is like it's right by reactor and it's right behind uh i think it's dawn and crafty doing something in reactors so i don't know if one of them is faking but security was locked so the killer could have went ran into security invented wherever my mama i was doing it i i was doing it as well and i failed on the last one i had to redo it some i don't know actually pretty pissed about that what do you swear on her mama yeah wow okay that's serious there was someone that was doing wires who was that it was shark yeah i was there right outside security that's why it's right outside purity that's where the body is right in front of wires it's gunny's body literally right in front of wires and then i left after and then don and crafty was there we both went into into the reactor and started doing simon says mr fruit which way did you go from electricity and i wasn't sure if like you invented into upper react into upper engine or if i had just like been shark where are you right now bryce are you are you trying to think that i vented into electrical and ran out is that what you're trying to say no engine and went down to kill and then went back up there's a lot of side conversations going on i think it's i think it's mr fruit and shark i mean i'm skipping i think it's either crafty or done no they were doing i saw them they didn't even see the body like imagine being an admin during this and being accused i'm on to you oh rice with the uh could it be only one god dude i just wanted to know where you went from electrical that's why i wondered i want to know where you were i never left electric i'm not kidding though i'm so cold i am terrifying [Music] oh valley or plenty to do some stuff or something freaking i don't know do this turn lights on yeah yeah totally original got him i like it oh body on the light sharks running out of uh electrical how could this happen it is 100 wait where i was just getting into electrical were you there before that's a lie because i'm working into electrical yeah i know i'm also trying to running into electrical as well i'm gonna go ahead and vote shark on that one i think it's crafty there's no way he like reported it as soon he saw me trying to get in electrical and then as soon as he saw me he he self-reported i'm gonna vote because they saw you at wires don and crafty and now don is dead that's weird that's just weird oh yeah empty honestly that's pretty good evidence if crafty did self-report then we'll just we'll keep an eye on him and vote him out next i think it's self-report where did you end up going we're about to vote a killer off right now i don't think so man dork did you vent no we also shouldn't i'm trusting robbie with my life by the way uh because i know you're good 100 so we're putting some real trust in this dude believe in something crafty's not that big brown let's be real all right so we got to go to lights unfortunately i was thinking you know shark was going to act up and get to get a double kill or something or like get out or get a kill that's that's why i just honestly i just kind of dipped you know i just kind of like nah bro i'd really rather not all right let's see if i can catch somebody going oh rob saw me i'm gonna go on cams got dork up door cup new navigation crafty rice on me rice looking outside all right sucks now where everybody is uh unfortunately i've got some buddies with me and they're making this a little difficult so i'm going to go with bryce [Music] unlockers i was about to do it dang it why'd you have to go make things so freaking complicated i was debating what i was going to kill was kill him and invent an admin but i saw crafty there which made that unfortunate i'm a fiend all right i'm just going to chill here with dork we're just going to kiss she's like what though that's the big idea here yeah wouldn't you like to know all right so i found a body bottom right in shields wow crafty unlockers so uh robbie what were you doing that game man running around doing my tasks and i was honestly trying to catch someone venting out of electrical into med bay but i didn't catch him oh because i was curious if you had just vented from electrical to med bay oh no i've been trying to camp that van and trying to catch somebody trying to kill somebody electrical jumping in the vent going into that bay i thought that's what would have happened when the lights went off but it didn't that's why i went that way i see you and shady chilling together uh shady has been horrifyingly chasing me like something out of a horror movie i just want to pet your dog it's a really good dog that's that's understandable you could just ask hey man can i pet your dog you know yeah i was waiting until the next meeting etiquette do pet etiquette i did see shady in the cafeteria earlier but i'm thinking i went to admin and i saw there's two in cafeteria and i was hoping there would just be one person in there and someone's sitting in an event but i saw dork and mr fruit up top uh cuddling yeah obviously right i just do not vote me we're going to skip and we're going to do tasks okay please we're going to skip and do tasks if you guys vote for me you guys are going to lose i think i think robbie's i think i was innocent because he was doing meteors before and he took his time a little too long that's i mean i didn't miss him he took his time maybe i don't mind you i got kicked oh no oh i was kicked was it rob no no there's still people left oh i don't know what happened what just happened well i mean i guess a win is a win right well i guess i'll just go ahead and hmm well you hate to see it let's get destroyed i'm glad that lag switch i bought actually worked who was who was was it you mr fruits yeah me and truck i had nice dog no idea at all make the lights go super dark when you turn off the lights i feel like when we turn off the lights like can you do that i can't legitimize there's not like a close circle around me i can still see a lot i can still see like my name and stuff i don't know what to tell you i don't know what to say to that uh i think that's just zero visibility vision is point seven five uh vision yeah if i made it point five everyone would probably re probably all right there you go if you guys don't like it blame them together i'll put my lag switch away sorry about that i can't confirm i can't see dick rob's like bro this is one of the weirdest things i've ever heard bro like can you make it so like when the lights turn off like the lights turn off well that's not a setting and i don't think we've ever i think once see this is what he wants but that means you have to have point five vision otherwise nobody wants that really this it restores my vision but oh wait turns out it feels like the lights have always been turned off you have to be checking me out a little bit i don't i think he passed me and then they think he came back and quite frankly i don't like it i don't i don't really like his vibes right now whatever chakra whatever friggin cha ch i said chai chi um other spectral things that your body can give off oh oh no found a bunny wait a second i gotta get some t-bell found the other body i know where ravi is okay well i know what bryce is but first i want to ask where gunny is right now because i could have sworn i saw him like not long ago like probably a second ago before i found a body i mean i'm up in cafeteria how did you get the cafeteria likely story did you walk all the way around the right side after i saw you i don't think there's enough time for that wait a sec wait yeah i t where are you uh i am in admin rabby's body is right in front of the card swipe okay he can't be in cafeteria because he just gunny just came out of communications oh people going to navigation yeah one of them was me but that was also pretty no you you i passed when was that fruit storage yeah and then i saw two people run into navigation and i'm sitting at the i was sitting at the door because it was locked in cafeteria i'm up here doing a garbage shoot right now when the meeting was called did you see the gunny go right after community just because you guys are blind it's not my fault [Music] honey i literally ran over tea fruit yeah that's what i'm saying like i barely even started my download and that was right after i saw you you guys had me where was the body okay the body i found was near navigation on the vent here that's how he could get there so fast makes sense i mean i actually voted on that wow it was very quick i was very convinced it took a while it's down to like eight seconds all right so if it's not though oh it could be crafty though it could be crafty could be crafty could be crafty and tea the question is oh wow oh is this for colorblind people oh that's so nice instead of having to figure out the colors they put symbols as well just in case and that's very considerate okay i got my susan crafty and tea i don't really think t but i didn't think about crafty i just kind of but he was last seen a nav so if we were wrong and we get a double kill soon in fact i might just call it um a meeting here soon might be a little meta gaming or something oh let me just power down the shields that's forehead so i'm going to attempt to find this and yeah if there are two kills i need to do this really fast because i'm worried that if i wait too long i'm not gonna we'll get past the double kill or something [Music] sup okay i have a question crafty where were you last match um i went to nav we were nav together and then i went down and you were in comms and then i poked in and then i went to storage and that's when the body was fun so who found the body and now shark did i did yes and t where were you you said you were around now weren't you oh yeah because he found the other body you said right yeah so where was the other body t t-rex you're muted by the way [ __ ] uh sorry quick uh so i was coming uh out from the right side of the map into storage i saw him cross above communications then you saw him at nav so wait so where did you find your about your bodybones and yeah the rabbi's body is found inside of admin at the card swipe okay so i'm just thinking yeah i'm just gonna say i feel like we we voted gunny off real [ __ ] quick that's why i'm saying i'm just i also wanted to call it just in case it was a double kill because i would be telling but i forgot that i had seen crafty before me at nav but if he did see me at comms if gunny went up he would have seen the body i'm still pretty sure it was gunny but i wanted to just come back and check with crafty so it was either if it wasn't gunny i think it's high the crafty your shark self-reported i don't know but just throwing that out there yeah i'm not i'm not voting but just yeah i just wanted to get that out okay if we voted wrong they win now anyway there's going to be a double kill unfortunately so i don't know if maybe but i'm i was positive there's gonna be a double kill so that makes me think we were right i don't know because i feel like ah but they would they didn't have to get a double kill ah i mean if that's the case where you're gonna lose anyway so what are you gonna do but if it is crafty you know screw me they're gonna kill me right at the lights before i even have a chance to do anything oh yes uh that was that was that was half my bad because i thought they lift the lid did they remove the lifting of the lid when you push the button okay well i didn't i was gonna push the button as soon as lights were fixed and uh i just wanna say that the doors closed immediately at the start of the round which i don't know just seems seems sus it makes me feel like we got an imposter okay shady so you're you're at button right wait what what does that mean obviously you're a button hold on yes you're a button crafty where are you um i just ran in to turn the lights back on t were you uh i'm at the actual electronics box fixing it and then the button got hit and dork where are you storage heading to admin okay all i know is this is weird because i fixed lights i was the first one there so little sus on t or crafty i think they're both using it as an alibi and they could have been but shark died couldn't have been that long ago so my other sauce was on crafty but all i'm gonna say is i think gunny was an impossible gunny out [ __ ] insta i skipped it's so weird because i'm convinced that gunny was imposter and that's what's making me sucks of you the fact that you're that like i don't know why why are we convinced and i believe i don't know what that's what i'm saying now someone's digging with me i'm digging my own grave i don't know here's my the only theories i have i don't think it's dork and shady unless you killed and pressed the button like immediately it it seems to he could be in cafeteria it seems too good to be true but i don't know i know that crafty was there and t could have very well gotten that second kill and just been like oh i saw the body so i don't know uh i think we can skip because i think gunny wasn't imposter i would agree if not though rip us right uh i couldn't make a vote and it was too short on time okay we got t okay i'm just gonna have the report button ready shady's over there there's not around here t's to the right or crafty this is weird dork okay so shady went to the left he went to the right shady's looking oof i don't like that a little scared about that buddy old pal let's all get to the lights immediately fix them if there's a body don't report it let us fix the lights first shady's there okay that could be a bad look your ex shady we haven't lost yet so something tells me gunny was an imposter still feeling pretty good about that t's coming here crafty's coming from the left t-rex is following me katie's up okay shady and t wait why would he try and lock me maybe he's because crafty was falling tea and shady teen shady god i have to do this real quick freaking stupid thing what okay i'm not i feel like there's a dead body i can check ah what are you doing what are you doing where's the body uh before i say that uh shady where were you hmm i don't know how i feel about that but i i i i don't think it's you but i want i need to know everyone else was that shady where were you admin admin k dork where were you i fixed the likes it's crafty 100 wait why reason so the reason why i know where's the body dead fruit is dead right in right why are you not telling us where the bodies at i'm gonna tell you where it's at because it was right where you two i last saw both of you i went over security start sitting on the lights because my tasks just got finished i saw both you doing simon says and then i walked back that direction and then fruit's body's right there so let's see and then i'm left to go to lights and then when i'm halfway there the body gets discovered by t yeah correct it sounds a little bit like a self-report to me man i don't know it's not it's absolutely crafty absolutely rob i'm i'm avenging for you hopefully let's listen i was go i was headed to do lights and i left t up there so yeah you're leaving where the body was at and yeah one of you two walked through my lights and or walked through my security camera when i was doing it i forget which one it was but one of you two saw me between the two one of us has been very vote happy this game one time and it was also not after because we haven't lost yet but i did see someone i i really think it's tea dude so let me put this away if i was why would i vote off gunny who was also the imposter i really think too hell yeah hell yeah why would you vote me dude if it's not you i'll feel real bad okay i'm faking it hey t-rex on your left probably hate all of you hell yeah so you guys this is the one instance where your smooth brain actually paid off because i i literally hate that 100 i legit did not vent at all i literally ran past the two people going to nav i was up there by the weapons door when the body was called [Music] you
