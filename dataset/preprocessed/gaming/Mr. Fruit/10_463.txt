[Music] oh okay not a shotgun kill man slide in like man you gotta let me fly i'm not scared he didn't oh everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and look at me spaceship goes that's the new eververse universal lauren missile lizard i just had silver laying around don't judge me in today's video ladies and gentlemen this might disgust you so bear with me i broke the crucible i did it [Music] yeah what the heck am i talking about well today we're going to be checking out the new exotic duality shotgun first off let's take a second to look at this sexy son of a gun like future it's got that wild west vibe but with some like you know yeah it's intrinsic trait compression chamber fires a pellet spread and hip fire or a single high damage slug while aiming it's a two for one deal we got corkscrew rifling first lady alloy magazine on black wings it's straight pellet final blows grant a stacking precision damage and reload speed buff precision hits with slugs extend the duration android x dot great winner is this dope pump action kind of shotgun it can do one of two things it looks cool i mean what's not to like but so yeah yeah whatever a lot of people have the exotic you know it's in the season pass so like how are you breaking the crucible i'm so glad you asked you guys all know and love the antes wards as we see reflect events sliding reflects projectiles and grants super energy pretty good right well it just so happens with the behemoth titan subclass i got fragments by the way so um that's a thing and i got a new grenade they like go hand in hand so we're gonna be using that but here it is bryoclasm stasis aspect now now stay with me okay enables a longer and more powerful slide sliding into stasis crystals or frozen targets shatter them at any nearby frozen targets so we get an enhanced slide on an enhanced slide on the farther slide with reflecting slide with super energy slide with a shotgun and i get to blow up crystals nice i know i know i feel scummy just talking about it so enough is enough why don't we see just how well or not it may perform in the crucible now i have used this sliding nonsense in pvp not with the duality but with another shotgun and i gotta tell you i had to take a bath after that's how filthy i felt and i will say up to like 1211 light i got all the subclass stuff i got three characters to 1200 i'm gr you boys out here i gotta get day one raid ready so real grinder hours right now and i'm slowly losing my sanity fragment wait a second is this new no this isn't new uh no i think i say this every time i play this map because it's just i guess it's just not memorable enough you know whoa that titan looks sick that black and red low key kind of looks like the character from division eight except division the fudge is that thing called it's the the movie that was supposed to be the halo district nine what was i saying district 8 or something oh my god what am i doing right now i don't even know who am i okay i don't know but i got emma okay okay okay here we go here so watch this ready here's my slide skirt you see how far and faster skirt now you see chrono class i'm cool now so you can't spam it per se but let's be real you can and then you can also miss every shot ever yikes harder than it looks okay recently i recorded a video with my brother and he's like you know i never realized just how hard it is to play and record at the same time all right all right it's time it's time to stop messing around though oh bro i was um that was almost my kill all right you know what get frozen i got the prediction ready bop uh killed him oh wait i got lots of am what the fudge give me give me oh there goes my ammo i work so hard for oh give me my ammo back thank you oh my god quit who is shooting me bro let me live my life like some overprotective parents or something like i'm a peacock you gotta let me fly i'm not now check this out ready skirt he didn't yo i'm gonna be honest that movement was nutty did i mean to do half of that not really but i i did bro why do you have friends they're overrated all they do is bring like happiness and companionship to your life okay get them out of here and apparently they help you team shot i hate them oh okay not a shotgun kill but we got the kill because of the shotgun the one two combo you see man slide in like me and then you come over here like me and then what and and mira gonna be honest don't really know what happened there and i have to always be cognizant of the fact that when i'm adsing it is a slug so if i'm like wait how did i miss that's because it's properties changed pop freaking pop yeah what up i'm out of here i'm out of here skirt wait did you just run through my berry hold on let me reload oh darn it that was my kill i was out for load oh my god i can't hit this what that oh wait i got a super it's super time baby freaking bop frickin bop friggin bob we're good boots yeah goose oh god why why do you use the yard okay here's a little can i break enemy stasis i can wow i'm gonna be honest i didn't know that okay reload feel it a little bit quicker here maybe okay all right or not all right i think i'm getting a little ambitious with the shotgun thinking it'll do things where it won't solely relying on it all in all you know it's just not fair oh oh you're in my nade you know the three two well make some noise make some noise and you are my friend after that just kind of downhill you know it's unfortunate but i speak the truth see you boy wow that was so worth it i can't believe you've done this oh yeah get reflected okay look at that we got a kill in the face of three enemies i maybe could have done more if i had more ammo but whatever didn't want to help after all bob okay somebody want to explain that one to me huh just punched a dude in his face and he go why is that still a thing now if duality had slide shot it would be even better so i guess what i would say is you know using another shotgun oh my god i'm just like choking on my words right now using another shotgun with slide shot just double down on your double down quadruple down we got more ammo the game's almost over but it don't matter watch ready we're getting a nice last second kill i was reflecting the yelling see the on black wings is cool um just doesn't really like it doesn't come into play into pvp much so it's more just the two in one shotgun that looks dope is this oh i thought it was bannerfall for some reason don't ask why but i was like are you not a great man for shotgun and you know i want to ape and it doesn't really let me amp on that map but we're gonna make do the slug should have killed let's be real not mad about it all right did they like mess with my reflecting because i swear on me mom i'm not reflecting as much as i it doesn't it doesn't really seem like i'm reflecting at all from being a hospital bob i can't i don't even know what i'm shooting anymore holy jesus what whatever dude doesn't matter bro oh my god i just wasted my melee i swear to god oh look at that precision damage ooh ah a saucy sausage saucy hottie totty potty two damage with my uh three damage with i'm sorry what's my slug doing is there like the oh my what am i shooting at i wonder i'm doing three damage with my slug but if it's a slug that means there's only one shot and if i'm getting damaged it means it's hitting it's doing three damage the falloff isn't that bad is it because if that's the case what they're trying to tell me is like it hits oh my god am i going to kill you emma did kill him okay okay all right all right it took a match and a half but suddenly i'm doing what i came here to do oh there was a lot of them that felt good that felt right felt like everything i've ever wanted in my life sounds like a country song [Music] i i instinctively may like thinking i would have to do you know finish the the kill but instead it just uses my melee and i i'm fly like a bird i want to fly away why won't you die i'm so nervous to use this superman because you can pop off listen i got like a quad with one right click in the right circumstance you're nuts oh my god sentinel shield really skirt your booze come here boy yeah freeze got booge okay why aren't you why aren't you freezing what is going on are you it's great great super bungee yeah yep titans so like i said i've been doing the other characters i unlocked the warlock subclass bro they're literally they're not in the same universe like i was using that i was like oh my god this feels amazing this is so much fun then i go back to the titan one and i'm like what is this and why are they they're they're hunting in a pack they're like hyenas this is gonna be this is gonna be big this is gonna be big okay they don't know what's about it look i'm gonna freeze this dude and then watch pop yeah so i can freeze him just slide into them and kill them it's incredible it's like i i can't even play the game by myself because why wasn't i reflecting projectiles i was sliding i really thought this was gonna break the crucible more ironically using like i was using uh fell winter's lie with this strat oof now that was dirty so uh maybe it's just duality isn't cut for a playstyle like this not that it's bad it's just you know everyone's got their own flavor where are you sir sir yeah bro you really gonna do me like that you saw me you saw me call dibs oh my god i gotta kill okay okay here i come oh oh okay oh [ __ ] i've never really gotten to show off the oh my god oh my god oh my god yeah there we go all right we're out there we're on it we're going baby oh my god but where's my aim going okay there's a kill so once i start to move it move it and get into a groove i die i blame them you know they're not letting me settle is this a super it kind of sounds like a super it is a super okay farewell sir whoa he found me he found me bro get out of my way yeah it's another l we lost the first one right yeah i'm pretty sure we lost first one okay now hear me out here this is only it's a small sample size it's not enough to draw a hypothesis i did this before in pvp and i was fragging so you know uh closed professional or professional on a closed course results may vary in my case it was a a noob on the closed course results may vary the duality it is fun especially in pve been loving running around using it and i think i just have to get used to using it especially the slug rounds in pvp because i don't normally use slug rounds so that's when i was like why aren't i hitting it's just you know i'm not used to playing with that and i'm sure once i did it'd be even better getting the aspect thing for the titan subclass still think it's the worst of the new ones it's pretty meh but i get to slide around i'm a slighty boy so whatever with that said i wanna thank you all much for watching have yourself a fantastic day and i'll talk to you in the next video where we'll probably be showing off the new salvation script so look out for that farewell [Music] [Music] you
