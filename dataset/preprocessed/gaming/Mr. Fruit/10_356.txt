heidi hello everyone my name is sir fruit and welcome to today's video where we're playing for honor again because it's a great game and i love it and it's been a little while and year five is out more people need to play this game also it's on the new consoles it's 60 frames buttery smooth i can hear myself reverberating through this whole thing listen i always wondered how people in medieval times fought even just with swords but now knowing just what it feels like to wear just chainmail on my head i don't know how they moved at all no wonder they were jacked or some of them anyway i would have never stood a chance but i like to pretend that i would you know i was born in the wrong era i would have rather been born in the medieval times where you know a small infection could mean death stub your toe well we're gonna have to amputate it that's not how that works but you understand what i mean anyway i love for honor new hero griffin that i a warrior whatever you want to call him i'm gonna take this off now so enjoy the video whoa i like the loading screen okay i think there's are there new heroes there are well one griffin never heard of him playable hero in training modes only let's see what he does yeah oh it's coming super fast unstoppable veteran [Applause] like that oh okay i think i'm practically a champion okay great oh or eight dollars i get an elite outfit though an exclusive ornament champion status and three scavenger crates i would never do that that's ridiculous guys why would i bother doing that i'm not gonna do that what wait griffin's unlocked that's whoa okay cool and i randomly got this outfit actually one of his cooler outfits does he not wear a helmet he's not into that huh okay great great great great great great careful death match with the orchestra twist as usual you will win when your opponent dies same time it's a single pick match with no revive no feats and no gear perks defeat the orchestra's challenger to steal their modifier i don't fully understand that but i'll weld into it what are we up against a shaman oof i must admit i do not like shamans they are very annoying thank you very honorable very honorable okay we're doing that huh can't dodge me son oh see here it comes here comes i hate that why does that exist i i kind of forgot my buttons i'm gonna be honest right now okay what the fudge yeah see see i don't remember what my buttons do i don't remember what my buns do dude here we go [Music] do you okay unfortunately didn't hit any of that what i blocked all that [Music] see i'm clinical bro yo ho the mix-up's unlocked right now okay she's gonna try and jump me i no no assume stupid stupid victory and the first game of griffin is a resounding w not even close dude okay great oh he wants to rematch okay now see here's the problem he's probably gonna pull out his like actual mane and he's gonna they do this every time this is for another one everyone's a nutshell they play someone i play them with someone i've never played before i beat them then go okay that was funny but now i'm going to show you who i really play and then i beat him on their main two that's kind of how this works i told you let me see yeah i see he has three reputation all on this one character i people are so predictable i'm gonna be honest i don't remember that character i don't know who this is and the best thing is it's not gonna matter it's not gonna matter i'm gonna embarrass him on on his mate yeah you're gonna be coughing up a whole lot more than that in a second here you have but little honor okay okay wait a second okay so apparently that's unstoppable okay get red stupid okay okay so this is coming out kind of quick what the fudge is going on okay i think i'm dead wait oh that sweeps okay slight problem i need to figure out what this character does real quick and adapt but i can do this so he's if he hits that swift thing he apparently kicks me he can't follow it up though but i need to watch for that big sweeping arc i can't dodge it and he's also unstoppable so if i'm gonna do this [Music] okay just gotta block that okay but that comes out super fat okay okay whatever he what the fudge is this guy made out of him okay yeah see that bro i'm not gonna be honest i'm super confused i don't know what he's doing out i did need to know what the character does i thought i paired that okay where hat yo what's the name of this character i straight up don't know what i'm fighting i need to forget what i'm playing defeat tiandi what what does tiandi do if in between games i can read what he does bro he's done when it comes to adapting nobody can defeat me except for maybe this guy's his quick attacks okay okay that's so comes so slow brush the second heavy doesn't through all right now that i kind of know what he does i read him right there now i actually play his man okay and then look at this coward look at this guy he leaves he leaves la mao that's lame i i would have been down to play him again because i know i would have won see i'm not i'm not some little scared scaredy cat like most of the people are like oh i lost my 1v1 let me put on my mane and show off my big dick nope don't need to yeah see who is my main exactly i don't have one i don't need one conqueror i think that's what it is whatever dude try and flip me that's the guy right i think so i actually played quite a bit of him but it's again it's been about two three years so bear with me all right i just i just need to figure out what i'm good at cannabis oh i remember now okay okay stupid stupid stupid i jumped at the wrong time okay okay all right i need to figure out how to avoid the tanabush thing just don't get hit by a light can i dodge out these are the questions i must ask oh he's gonna try and flip me oh no you don't sir oh you like that you like that suddenly you just can't handle my offense dodge dodge didn't dodge that take that take that take that take that yeah suddenly i figured it out hey check this out [Laughter] he realizes i've read him like a book you stupid now i'm out of stamina not worried about it dodging back okay he's going to try uh-huh uh huh take this buddy take hold this hold that oh hold this both executions back to back okay come on now [Laughter] you little coward yeah [Music] yeah wait what i actually threw a second heavy why didn't my second heavy come out okay there you go ah i messed that up so much it all went downhill after i didn't for whatever reason heavy him a second time when i threw him over and then my pace was off then i throw myself off but i ain't playing games no more i ain't playing games no more like i said sir i'm not playing games anymore sir this is a wendy's [Music] uh yep there we go here we go just didn't feel that i feel that sorry he took me to gameplay you know didn't make sure i didn't want to mess it up dummy now i can't wait for him to use his mane mm-hmm go ahead yup he's going to rematch wait for it oh wait no he's actually the same person his portrait changed okay i regret this or no not regret this i respect this he believes in his conqueror his faith is misplaced but i respect that all right here we go i'm feeling it now mr krabs [Music] [Laughter] i whiffed it to better man to kick him to finish him oh yep don't mind if i do just bring him over here the flames of your defeat my friend the flames of your defeat it will taste bittersweet i believe uh okay i missed time the pairing that's unfortunate i missed timed it again you know if i just stopped if i stopped parrying i might actually lift it oh but then again i love for honor we go again my friend or not it's up to you you feel free to pull out your main if you he left i love me some kinsey or i must warn you i will not go easy i do have to be worried my perry's got to be on point because of all of his uh unblockables he's a little slow but he'll he hurts dilly dilly my friend yeah oh look at you and your fancy little thing okay yeah i definitely don't have that oh he can also do a whole bunch of dodges if i thought i could do dodges he can do dodges like it's no one's business okay yeah we're just doing this okay i'm just miss timing everything wait what oh no oh this is bad oh you like that wait what how did i not get something guaranteed after that what a comeback holy i wasn't i was i was trolling the first bit easiest game of my life dude easiest game of life i just decided to start playing you know i just i decided to start pressing buttons quite frankly i can't time his parries wait i'm just messing everything up right now someone want to explain to me why nothing's blocked see like why didn't that combo this is strange i'm messing everything up unlockers [Music] oh i thought it was pretty good i've never seen this briefly defeat see like i parried and i got nothing off of that [Music] what are you doing my friend [Music] there we go easy peasy right in the wall yeah take your flute and shove it up your butt i make him right quick friend i don't know what you're doing but you have to hurry because my control is about to die get destroyed no refund he raged quinn he forfeited that's a forfeit refund the poor it's not my [ __ ] i want he forfeit i won the game i didn't say anything about forfeit wait a second did i fight this guy before i don't think i did well i don't remember he's at least wearing the same thing the last one did it's different guy i think i don't think he had that much rep all right give you a little sauce jelly very honorable appreciate that but the honor is done for okay well what if i just take a big old dick okay apparently i don't get guaranteed heavies off of those and i don't think i've been able to do that for a while and i keep making that [Music] mistake no no yeah it wasn't flashy but it did the trick come on now my friend i'm not gonna go i'm going aggressive okay well that was clearly a mistake everything i'm doing appears to be going poorly i don't know what i'm doing anymore okay i think i'm here i walked right into just about everything he just did ouch i gave him a homey stock i wanted to be a best of three we're starting from the top he plays defensive so i just have to punish what oh my i'm literally forgetting my combos too like i landed that and then i didn't do anything even though i know i could have like that my stamina this is going to hurt a lot yeah i think am i done fudge i was gonna do that okay okay all right this is sloppy this is messy i'm better than this i'm cracking the knuckles it's reverse sweep time it's okay i ain't losing again stupid stupid stupid like that damage you a dirty girl oh you slide dog yeah i know what kind of a game you're trying to play now there we go okay all right that was a little bit better we were losing it towards the end you know i'm serious when i stopped talking to if i'm not making sound effects it means i'm like oh god please don't choke this is it for all the marbles it might as well be a best of one ladies and gentlemen i'd like to repeat round one not round two if i could choose i forgot my combo there again okay what bro everything he does is just quicker than me oh my god it's a it's a repeat around two oh i i tried to back up to not run into that five all right you better rematch me i want i want a best of three this is a good one i like this we go again we go again my friend we go again come on bro it's an unspoken rule of for honor best of three do it are you does no one have honor anymore this is for no honor what the fudge i know puppy i know why wouldn't you man [Music] you
