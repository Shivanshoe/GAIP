well yeah oh my is it just me and rob i think so oh god oh my god how come like the killers they get such an easy job they do but uh hey i will accept being alive like being a hider sucks yeah i'd rather be a kid in that game you should be the killer if you're the killer you wait until everyone else has done it then you kill someone else you are guaranteed a spot in the next round right so what team are you on we got to work together i can't see i have no idea [Music] one of you follow around a blue guy just around the map the entire time i'm putting it in it has to happen between the two of us we should be fine yeah yeah i know i agree i just want you to know joey is not assisting you for the record joey i am i he's lying he's he's trying to bring us apart you're dead he's done he's
