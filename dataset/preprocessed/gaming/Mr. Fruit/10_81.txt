three failed attempts why oh wait what wait what wait what i don't know you stole me my ip address no okay what's the fudge oh i think you have to tell me which firewall i know okay and um okay so there's like you have numbers or like they're like it's like uh it's like a a bull half bullseye half son bulls on the left side sun on the right oh okay hold on bullseye on the left side sun on the right okay i think i see it i'm disabling nope okay like a target and then like a sun yeah i tried i don't know what to tell you oh there are different suns okay so it's like a target on the left and then uh does the target have gears or is it like a hexagon no look it looks like uh like a nut looks like a nut okay yeah and then what's the side the sun is like a fully filled in circle and three filled in triangles but where on the outside like middle outside like so because like there's one where it's like at one o'clock six o'clock no they're all like four or five on the right okay yeah all right i'm on it there we go okay and pop easy but watch out for the antivirus yeah that'll do it okay i think um uh suspect files found um okay d you're the yellow orb i assume i i guess okay um uh what can you do i can't move i can't do anything i can only click oh click to enter there you go okay oh i'm just entering i need you to go to the right right what is right there i'm going to score there's there it's all right technically wait what are you looking at i see a blue door a white door and a white door and a blocked off door okay whichever door you just came from go the opposite or go like keep going straight from there no no that was no okay go back i don't know what back it is dude there is no like okay well then just keep going wherever you just went no that's backwards how'd you do that oh okay wait so i don't know what you're like okay yeah keep going go on go where now i'm looking at like weird doors and it says click to enter there's two white ones and a blue one because i only okay okay click the blue one i click the blue one no okay well i didn't uh click the white one they're both white what's the orientation what are we talking okay so i'm in a square okay i'm in the middle of a square yeah each side of the square has a blue door no that one is blocked off there's a blue door block okay well that's fine uh it position wise like like orient yourself say position wise there is no like fixed is the blue door make sure the blue door that you can't access is to your right okay dude but it could always be at my right do you not understand what i'm saying okay okay imagine a square okay wow this is a square okay and put a human in the center of the square okay yeah and put a door on each of the side of the square but if there's only one blue door then it can be to your right okay but which side with my back looking at the door or with my face kicking that no like if you're looking away from me it would be to your right okay so go on the door that's facing away to the right okay yeah sure okay we got it perfect okay now uh the blue door should be at your back okay go to the one opposite of it go straight that's great okay now make sure the blue door is to your left okay now walk straight there we go okay great look at the blue door okay then turn left once you're going to the door to the left of that nope what we do okay okay said from the blue door look to your left and you're going to go into the door to the left of that uh well i guess you technically could different left okay make sure the blue door is uh let's just it's to your west okay you're you're you're pointing yourself north yeah which is straight and it would be to your left right yes now that door you're looking at as long as the blue door is to your left go forward perfect okay now look at the blue door okay and then turn left 90 degrees walk through that door perfect okay now we're talking same thing face north with the blue door to your left your west walk straight okay great this is going great okay look at the blue door now rotate 90 degrees to the left again go through that door wait one more time okay so look at the blue door looking at it yeah it'll be the door to the left of that 90 degrees to your left perfect okay look at the blue door okay do a 180 you're going through that door perfect okay blue door should be on your left okay walk through that door that the one i'm looking at as long as the blue door is to your left yeah oh my god we did it oh my god that was confusing i hate it every second well now it's a bad time oh yeah there's an ai scenario if you didn't know about okay i'm on it there's a new firewall uh the ai sentinel system uses machine learning to identify viruses malware and hacking elements okay so it's like a triangle point uh the top side pointed to the right with three circles in it in it or on the left well one circle's in it one circle's in it two circles are in it and then the left side is kind of protruding out a little bit got it rebooting nice okay great great great great great i think there's another one yup we got i'm analyzing the threat okay so circle with a triangle and with two half circles out of it um the triangles pointed downward and the circles are kind of half circles i'm out here explaining my life it was just like triangle i'd circle half circles there's okay what do you got a circle high rule dry force because we're going to try to force it he's dying on me i'm gonna be stuck in here oh okay this one's we gotta be fast okay uh triangle to the right uh circles in it the one we had the first time okay i'm on it there we go [Laughter] we're in the mainframe okay we did it no way mainframe access oh i'm like walking oh whoa this is like trippy what are you doing i'm in the internet dude scanning microchip.zip make sure to unzip it first uh control v it's a good one five copied success nice transfer of the microchip records confirmed okay i'm extracting okay please do partner awaiting extraction okay i got a freaking pity bop um extract are you gonna extract me exactly jesus i'm running how do i elevate let's go to the elevator i'm going to the uh okay i'm at the basement exit i'm in uh i'm clicking a button i'm going down i'm going to the basement exit look at the look at the uh there's a camera you see me yeah i see you hi hi okay what am i doing i don't know okay okay it says i'm gonna i'm on the basement floor there's a camera here okay the door is about to open all right i'm in the basement okay now what so just kill me all i see is
