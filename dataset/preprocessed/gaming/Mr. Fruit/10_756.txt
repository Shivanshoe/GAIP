figured out how my old works alright so I place my totem in order for you to get the buff you have to interact with it but as soon as someone interacts with it as soon as they're buff disappears the totem disappears so we often do it at the same time be on the same queue no I'm saying so we get buffed for touching it yeah so with my alt if you die with the buff active you will respawn at that totem with one health oh yeah Oh bamboozle there way up there I'm getting native I'll wait my ability to disable my finder we are they oh that's you oh that's a goodnight lifeline Katie's abilities

see one too right Rob body dim blue shield down it's that octane yep that's him right okay just get down noise I don't think he died right here it's in the light mag are you sure yeah octane immediately done okay because I got an elimination or something also don't forget when I yell out next next time we need it come to me so we can all get my old and then we do our thing so we get a little more aggressive all right only five other squads although all the squads are full-on people what its all full squads left come on guys yes peacekeeper still good idea I think so I mean I would think but they got nerfed a bit you need a shotgun bolt for it to fire decently where's Nick all right there right there right there no shield no shield on that guy Oh above there's a guy up here Wraith up there get your head of tumor up right above you yeah I hit that guy for 55 kid torch [ __ ] right here oh right here is caustic I'll come help you AB he's weak no shields where there's a caustic you're probably getting shot by caustic I got a help Rob real quick where's the robbers I can't see oh I got anymore zone is about to close so whatever you're gonna do I think it would not use this wingman yeah yeah yeah they're all dead yeah we got the there was six they heard that shooting show as always they're probably let's go other shooting up all over this ravine do not engage Rob get in circles Hill ravine it's all sprawling landscape what you want for me keep the high ground go the Left Front no yes okay all right all survey the area shooting over here pass that rock but it looks like a team here shooting happening over there well let's assess the situation let's not get too ahead of ourselves we have had like three teams just walk right up on us so our situational awareness is pretty terrible if we want to just try and camp it oh jeez that's pretty bad we should set up if we can let's go then team here okay there's only three squads left so this is two of them so there's one unaccounted for does he have a Craver no that's the the new one is that the one I gave you yeah yeah wait Rob what's not good I mean okay we're just yes you don't have to we've got to get there before they're able to heal and everything and hope that no one finds us while we're here cuz we're sitting ducks call me planters baby not because this is a bad idea what a stupid okay well let us get there before you get your grenades I'll get your grenades out right here you see him oh yeah ready go Oh his idol keeps getting in the way it was I missed so many times oh my god okay okay they were fighting team over there I hit Pathfinder 68 wait wait come here for my idol come here come here come here yep okay tracted wear that rub above you up here he's sniping from a little top of
