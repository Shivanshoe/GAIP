oh well wolf maybe you should help me hi friend and don't shoot back right 49 more oh we're heating up now it's pretty tasty hi eddie hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video i got a new fit huh no what what do you think huh you like i think it's nice i'm big i'm chunky i'm ready for adventure because the moments of triumph 2021 seal is almost mine we're skipping the triumph i'm skipping gambit these two playlist things i'm literally knocking out later today there's chosen lightning round bruh it's a struggle i don't know why it's i'm convinced it's not in the game anymore anyway what the fudge am i talking about wait no this is oh jesus no because i need the acres hold on oh my god the dead eye seal we're done we're done oh one left right yeah one left kill guardians with trace rifles so that's what i gotta do i gotta get 49 more and then i get deadeye because for so many seasons i've just been so close to dead eye but then i never actually finish it and i know deadeye isn't exactly like but you know i l i like having a laundry list is that weird i i don't know personally i really like it in the game when i have a clear list of things i need to do and then i go do them and then i check them off like mindless grinding aimless grinding no but you give me that checklist bro i'm there which is you're like well then why the fudge why do you have more seals that's fair i guess i just never bothered before but but i'm here now best of all too i finally get to take the covenant beam rifle for a spin the retraced path free hand grip extended barrel projection fuse perpetual motion although i don't think that one's really gonna help too much in pvp we're gonna go around we're gonna laser people that doesn't work we got the prometheus lens or i throw in the egg receptor because i do i do have the catalyst so i just gotta finish it and i'm pretty i don't think guardian kills give extra like progress so also gonna be using the dune marchers i don't know sounds fun we're gonna go into the iron banner two why because well two birds one stone but can you feel that bad can you feel it it's that special something in the air before a brand new destiny 2 expansion a big one at that which queen i straight up i don't know if i've been this excited for destiny especially destiny 2 maybe ever i don't know i'm free i'm freaking pumped man let's do this okay well people are people are falling left and right it's just one frankly but i loved him so much it felt like it was more okay i don't know if i'm ready for this all right 49 more 49 more 49 more 49 48 more oh that's a lot of ammo though okay okay okay i think he's got a sniper not entirely sure come here i'm helping you lone wolf lone wolf oh one wolf maybe you should help me okay retrace path might not be the play okay that was two kills with it i'm gonna we're gonna swap to the prometheus lens may i need to get some more precision damage but didn't feel like i was killing fast enough maybe the prometheus plus i've never used this ornament but i had it it's like the story of my life for so many things you know how many league skins i bought i've never used you know i'm feeling a little indecisive my co-ager scepter here in a second because if i can get a kill and freeze some other people it sounds pretty fun to me but whatever linear actuators i haven't used them yet but i'll get there just it's the problem is like meat titan meat ape but also me not completely trying to ape um where am i oh jesus christ that's it that's it hold on hold on do this quick do this quick just quick i'm nuts oh i didn't get the ammo i'm not nuts you got a linear actuator okay maybe not my friend what i could have killed you bro man you make me sick people just it's not kind man this mirrors the real world a little too much i thought i was escaping it that's a nice name said no one because it didn't do anything apparently oh they're gonna freeze they're gonna freeze i thought they would freeze but that's a double kill that's frankly way more important there's another one you missed your you missed your shot bruh you had it and you missed it wait help me help me i got my ammo all right how you looking buddy you okay he'll get in there get in there they're so weak freeze them freeze them he's eyes awake okay i thought i figured they'd be close enough for egg receptor to uh be slow in their freezing some people but evidently that's not the case okay i'm i'm trying i'm gonna run out of ammo before anything happens oh why do you have an overshield no i don't have enough ammo for an overshield i just i don't have enough ammo for anything anymore which means linear actuators activate what okay maybe the anchor scepter isn't it's too late feeling indecisive i'm all over the place i don't know and yes uh i have been diagnosed with adhd probably should have seen that coming up a while longer tbh no that was 12 of my shots bruh screw okay we're going back to the prometheus lens i i fee i mean i don't know i'm a little naive when it comes to these things but something tells me the prometheus lens is the play here i can't see past the freakin go lone wolf for now your duo wolf for i am he i won't let them take you not alive at least he's like wait no i'd rather they can capture me live dude don't worry dude i'll kill you i'll make sure they don't get you you say no you you don't got to do that ah forget about it it's like that peacemaker episode if you've watched that where um that guy gets captured and tortured i gotta be honest i haven't laughed that while the tv show in a while that was a funny little part great show anyway i digress speaking of digress this isn't what i'm really trying to do but i'm gonna do it anyway oh with a prometheus wait it comes an explosion kill does that no no my ammo my ammo i didn't even realize oh we are double cheeked up on ammo brother this is good all right i'm gonna capture these zones though so that we can i forgot this is iron banner so i do need like getting kills and stuff will help quests which i do what freaking the fudge is he doing up there what is this bob you like that ricochet oh he's dead he's burning he doesn't really thought that would hit frankly and i'm back they didn't expect me to come back okay i don't know there's grenade launchers i don't feel comfortable that's a hammer assault bro look i have too much ammo to be to be losing it come on yes okay you know what balls i'm helping my team balls balls okay darn it uh an assist triumph completed ah well would you look at me nice am i staying back a little bit yeah i know ain't miss fruit what that's not that w key you're not wrong he's invisible look i just have too much ammo right now to be going in willy-nilly there we go i gotta preserve my life right now play for my life no shame okay feeling i'm feeling i'm feeling a little little saucy i i'm not feeling saucy in fact i'm feeling the opposite oh jesus yeah i'm like bubble boy that's why i don't go outside the world's out to get me [Music] okay okay we got him but it would cost all right lads go go go the flinch on whatever he's using is insane that's not that's another uh freaking trace rival kill though let's get it bruh yeah get killed get ammo profit just feed off of each other you know ah yeah i don't know i don't know the music's getting whimsical i i don't know if whimsicals look what i would use but yeah oh oh i thought that was a super wait what how did he die yeah that didn't i burned one but i figured winner actually is like oh you see a little train lightning guys guys this is a comebackable this is combatable for i have the power of trace rifles if i could just mantle why would you do this to me [Laughter] nice oh 68 out of 100 hey that was pretty good that was what night was that 19 trace rifle kills go on me what's this thing to do huh if i even made a video on this i think i did maybe if i did it wasn't my account clearly final blows with the weapon green stacks of light consuming the green melee and classically each attack full auto and osmosis right or something i mean that's what that's okay well that's not pvp good but that's interesting that's frankly that is really interesting in pve because you can make this whatever elemental type your subclass is so you get another you know what i'm saying now the real golden goose i'm chasing it's the sleeper catalyst hoping i get it while i uh get conquered title but we'll see young lords and iron wolves yeah let's get that capture bonus everybody get in here here we go that's that's some good progress oh he dooby burns that's a kill bop okay we're just spawn swapping sure bonus to the captures though there's a guy over here and i'm convinced ah i was gonna get the final blow but last i've been betrayed yes but i'll take that final blow good they're coming for the heavy don't let them yes yeah if you can just hold left click which i'd like to think i'm pretty good at this thing seems to be doing pretty well chief i don't know oh my god it's melting and don't shoot back it's pretty it's pretty tasty ghost wolf wait what oh did i really get phantom essentially and iron banner wow oh thanks to the prometheus lens i think i just took my first damage oh it's it's the whole grenade i can't i can't see blinded by the line i got you buddy yeah really thought would have had that kill oh we got him locked down to i shoes i didn't really get many but if any come on burn baby burn come on try me try it ah telescope really oh my god but i ain't getting away with this what the fudge he's so weak oh oh my god he has looked up zero else okay lock down again l-m-a-o yo grab that heavy grab that heavy oh yeah dude it's free it's it's so excuse me leave my friend alone or at least let me grab the ammo i mean i don't care about my friend that much i just want the ammo frankly thank you that was a little too much ammo bob i don't know give me that you didn't even give me the final blow bruh get on me okay all right all right how many assists can a guy get yo if i didn't know better i'd say this is momentum control is that a free kill dang it one day perhaps but today it's not that one day yep let me just pop that and pop screw your telescope screw you okay yeah sure sure what i'd like oh how about bob [Music] [Applause] you know turns out when i come to make a destiny 2 video on pvp when i haven't played months and i don't even play any warm-up pvp matches that i struggle a little bit but that ain't it i'm warm baby i'm warm is that just the prometheus lens perhaps yes perhaps interesting tether play there oh wow i don't know what killed me frankly no i'm the no we're going for those 31 trace rifle kills in one match you thought it was a joke but little did you know i was completely serious there's another one oh we're heating up now hey no i thought my friends were over there if anything that asserts my alphaness they feel they have to bag me because they see me as the primary threat in this lobby and you know what they'd be right oh yeah if you didn't have friends oh i'd be bagging you too buddy but friend's overrated oh he's so weak i gotta reload yes yeah help me help my tom cruise here i go ready yeah oh ooh okay kamehameha i didn't get that killed all right who's next huh you you want some of this how about you yep what the [ __ ] just hit me though actually i don't know guys i need the last hits i mean oh jesus okay holy supers batman well i think i just not you don't mind we're heating up watch for the supers we got a couple we got a couple roamers out here we we got a couple roamers out here ah he was it's so nimble wait wait let me get that captured thank you wow i wanted that i could have just mailed him but i wanted to kill him the kill with my trace why do you have friends man i'm getting reckless but god do i need that trace rifle kill i crave it i thirst for it time's over give me one more give me one more ear these violent delights congratulations on a hard what's the rest of the have violent ends or something top of the team 39 most kills best efficiency let's go and i literally use nothing but a trace rifle which means momentum control should be way easier right guys okay what was that uh 25 i don't remember what we got to no we were at 68 right so that's 20. so 12 more in momentum freaking you know it dude you know what they say free sucker all right oh yeah i didn't even think about that like everyone on their mom's gonna be using scouts on this map huh i just need to find a way to the back line wow that was huh no gotta get that ammo having no radar is honestly it's refreshing i'm gonna say i almost wish this was how i i almost wish pvp had no radar it promotes much more aggressive play everyone i don't know i like it i didn't get that kill what the fudge give me give me your ammo nope guys no i need i need the last hits here can't help but notice you're not giving me the last [ __ ] okay i think is it just the that the scepter man i kind of feel like it's just the scepter i don't know let's see because i mean i don't think it's a coincidence we threw on the prometheus and we absolutely fragged it no please not please i'm reloading uh it feels a little faster not drastic but enough that i'll take it i can't believe it but yeah i think iron banner was a better idea you can quote me on that things i never thought i'd save her 500 why do you have so many shots why didn't they kill me i swear to god wait what oh did we mercy them guys that didn't even get a chance really i did i did not get nearly enough next paint there guys they're really about to make me play another iron banner game fine whatever there's one there's i kind of have to play this sub up because i don't have radar and you kinda gotta get first shot here with the the trace rifle oof oh yeah i also don't wanna talk about the fact that i grinded all the wither horde grenade launcher kills last week without realizing momentum control was this week paying yeah it it about killed me inside tell you that much no god zone advantage is yours okay i'll take trades every day baby what's that three more trace rifle kills let's go just so weird momentum control has straight up just a different meta so many things one shot that i i never thought would oh come on we gotta be close we gotta be close is that one more kill maybe capture the zone autozone it's got team's head whoops one more one more time celebration that's gotta be it that's gotta be it let's go we did it grab that let's go dead eye i know it's not gilded and to everyone else just like really that's kind of sad that's that's what you're celebrating i don't care it's a win for me i also don't have the huckleberry survey says oh i do have the catalyst yeah we do that uh generate orbs on multi-kills wait what oh oh kills with this weapon what reload the entire magazine oh okay let's get to work then huh i'm gonna be honest i don't really remember what huckleberry does in general i guess i don't need to remember because game's over i got dead eye baby increases rate of fire and regular goal i hold down kills rubbing really portion magazine wait huckleberry hasn't gotten a single ornament really they said it couldn't be done and frankly i might have been the one to say they were right but that's one title down i'm fitting to hit like four or five titles in one week watch me dead eye down mmxxi coming for you next conqueror coming for you too guilded conqueror maybe i don't know we'll see let's not get ahead of ourselves i could also probably get splicer i just i just don't know if i want to play that much more override really what else could i do eliminate all cabal vips and the strike proofing uh secret triumph what is this i'm close i'm close to this wait maybe i should go for this because it's going to disappear right maybe i don't know deep stone [ __ ] no i'm not even no she's in the hunt triumphs no all too good now beyond my uh what the fudge oh my god i'm not even no no hard nope die oof no what is this complete um collect all bones in dream city truck corrupted eggs in the dr oh wait that's what i gotta do oh i guess i could get that vid master up literally just one more lightning round and i got a bid master flawless i could have if i had just like played the week before last unbroken it's been this way for years frank i just never bothered to hit legend oops anyway i digress thank
