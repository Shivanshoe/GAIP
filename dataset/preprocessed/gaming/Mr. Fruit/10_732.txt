hi-dee-ho everyone my name's mr. fruit and welcome to quantum league technically the open beta quantum league is a well it's a first-person shooter how complicated could it be apparently very complicated that would be right it is a time paradoxical shooter sort of so there's like multiple rounds and every round you create a copy of yourself from the previous round that does the exact same thing you did last time except you play along with them so it'll be two V two but then four before and then technically like 66 but it's all your past so yeah I fear this might be the first FPS that's to Omega brain but that's but that's not an FPS but I don't care like this is like an FPS and five head Oh quantum stadium being control of the goalie okay hey it's me hey it's them hey it's you who yeah it's them alright they probably played this game so let's show them that our route raw talent can beat there whatever that we got to get the point first but I'm gonna get a sick in air snipe wait for it I'm dying I'm dying I'm half health I'm practically dead I'm dead I'm distinct okay so that means I guess I'm technically out of this life there on the point push push push oh yeah I'm still fighting as if I'm alive but I'm not okay that went horribly I'm still alive okay but that doesn't matter because now did you we didn't do like anything okay I'm using the grenade launcher you-you-you I don't know what I guess I'm just dying I don't really know I can't aim at anything there on the point I'm distinct again I can't hit any shots did you hit any shots either good I have one maybe okay so now I'm on my third life and we have we killed anything no all my lives are practically useless anyways so yeah I'm bum-rushing I killed what let's go I can't let's go yeah push up jump c-d-c I got another one I'm desync dodge wears a health kick alright they at one point it's only one point I'm gonna go with the laser beam let's not suck go go go with the rifle I'm pushing their left side oh I see him I see him I'm pushing I'm shooting a barrel it somehow didn't kill him I'm tea seat I'm going sniper - I got this listen I'll finish off the first one you didn't finish oh maybe I won't I'm gonna finish one I finished one - or the back is one - in the back this one - in the back it wait we need to get on the point that at some point we have we haven't gotten on the point value have we ok I exploded in the barrel ok they're there they're both pushing right side already I'm distinct as well I distinct a guy but then he got one took the health don't let me get on the point he killed you I don't know nothing Oh tea oh shoot ok ok let's go everything's just frozen I know what's happening where are they we call me I see him I see him he's weak ah but I so am i he's on the point Rob he's on the point 1 1 I don't get it I'm like trying to remember where we're going wait why a second wait what's going on I don't understand oh we're replaying through each of the first I'm distinct one of them's weak I gotta find healthy I'm trying to resync but I can't it's up to you just stay on the point I go for oh wait how are there that many of them I mean I killed Ford bro I was popping off oh my god press tab and like [ __ ] mosaic painting I don't know bro oh my god yeah what I'm trying to shoot something I got one I killed one I guess there's one on the point like I got another one on the point and I'm decent cuz life sucks Oh oh my god wait why are we I don't get this it's the first loop again um there to update what is going on Rob I can barely count to ten I why does it why is no-one getting points why are we started in these weird places why do I die so fast I'm coming wrong alright don't get right on the point like that every time cuz that's how you die on the point on the point d sanctum there's a guy on the left side left side one near the point I do think the guy know that okay I still don't know what any of this means but um what the fudge is going on I'm sure we need to get to the point that the end of this ideally I'm gonna snipe somebody though cuz I'm I'm insane killed one hit another yep killed another I'm insane right now going get to the point get the point he's won on the point get him no we can bring this back I think they have a rifle and I'm he's trying to snipe me I hit him once I I hit him once in the back he's watching you Rob wait you're decent [ __ ] kidding me god I killed him but I'm DC what happen you body I just get head shot it every time it's not my fault dude they're just good they're just better we need to be better up I don't want to hear that that's not true they just have more experience that does not equate to being better headshot wait did you just get headshot I'm distinct already bro I don't know I don't know I don't get I don't get it though okay they're on the point got one I'm teasing I'm going to get a grenade launcher here and just spam the middle I tried right in theory do that I'm going under with a shotgun yeah I'm going under with the shotgun we'll figure this out how am i decent that doesn't even they couldn't even see me and now we're at a time okay you way to save it Rob we needed that that's big very big you're jumping to the point right now bro I just immediately get desync means me too what is it I just did I aim and then a DC I have a master's in quantum physics and I don't understand this oh they're sitting in their spot why did I spawn at the top of this stupid freaking why sinked well there's something I totally didn't see coming they're on the point just show me who's killing it feels like I'm playing a first-person shooter for the first time you know that's how lost I feel right now to shoot everything on the point there's like 8 million of them oh my okay most of them are distinct okay I'm on the point I'm on the point oh just watch blue three just unleash it I like the strategy when in doubt spam it out home home let's just try and win the first round headshot I got him go guys on the point we need to push point push point get on the point get on the point I got decent amount wait what you didn't get point well no I got shot from behind because that guy got health look not using it shot a guy held behind me as I was trying to walk up to get point dodge then I'll figure out where he got health I'll kill his pocket right side on the right side copy that so I'll get his guy when he respawns but then once he resyncs I don't know okay I killed his resync thing what my anus shot no I shot last second we need to find the the three people for this time paradox thing the point the point we're never even on the point wait for it I didn't do you think dude the time you have 17 seconds it's like it's so fast I'm like alright I'm ready and it's over what is going on big same my dude see I just I don't understand bothering to do other ghosts or save them and yeah like if I kill a ghost that's not even shooting at me does that even matter I'm gonna talk [ __ ] this we're playing the exact same people yeah let him know how's that headshot just trying to snipe I'm distinct of course hey me too okay i headshot him in the middle so if I save my ghost this time then they will headshot the first ghost so that first goes will be taken care of so I need to kill the one the one goes on the second run and and then push the objective okay make sense go come here one ghost okay I saved my ghost and I'm gonna push I'm getting destroyed I'm getting destroyed and I'm just synched what do you know this may be the worst FPS we are I admit I'm bad final loop and why not right I know you are yo behind you behind you it's where the Russian oh I got a double kill get to the point gets a point there I argue right I know you and me both this is okay we can do this we can do this what the fudge is happening okay okay okay I'm shooting the dude right in front of me immediately oh wait that doesn't matter okay where are the people that matter I'll leave a rifle here i body them my body them okay okay I'm getting health I'm grab the help I'm running back let's go rob what'd you do kill them I pop oh I totally forgot that there's these dudes let's go my boy okay we just do it again we just do it again I'm starting to understand how to use this rifle I'm still not understanding how to use time though I got a guy almost dead on me sit okay I got one I go and point point point I'm going to point I'm on point I think they're all dead Oh mega wall and watch me kill you I'm just gonna watch me kill you over and over and over again on the point okay that's two out of three I think we just need this last one and that's it Oh God what is happening okay I have a grenade launcher and I'm right in your face behind you know what the fudge DC this grenade launcher isn't working so well or maybe it is op don t sink are you kidding what happened to all of our ghosts what they we got two out of three and then they just get that one and they score this must be super obvious and we're just missing it but well it's not for me I bodied one on top of the building killed one killed one push right side below you right side below your um okay I'm gonna go for the point wait I guess they respond I'm decent are you kidding me okay I guess they also got help at some point I don't know I bodied one on top oh oh they're both dead okay push push push okay I'm pushing the point is there anyone left oh he's on by their base just one shot he's what I'm doing for you you're a life though sit I'm going laser being screwed I don't know all right final loop we got to do this one of them is bottom mid why is this laser beam have no range does this thing do damage hello he's right next to me on this point get on the point get on the point d synched again get done did someone survive yeah okay it was my it was your number two copy okay apparently it didn't give me a weapon oh I get a cheese now I guess always one shot left side I'm going for the point I end up distinct again he's gonna take the I bodied him once on the point killed one yep bottom rice it going through health go 4.0 4.0 4.0 guys I got that guy yep oh and somehow my ghost previously got saved so somewhere we killed something that saves something from some time loop paradox I don't know I knew that's why I killed that guy yeah big brain dude well done but no okay there's one of the three guys is left side one just picked up health bottom on me on me oh wait we got you we got you I'm distinct I can't do anything they're not on point though so let's go let's go oh my god that's got to be embarrassing I have no idea what I'm doing but we're winning not to get the snipe in my life's ready bottom it'd bottom it yep body you got health bottom Wow these one well this pistol sucks Wiener and I'm distinct budge even matter right okay I think if we get decent just get the ghost to the point while shooting yeah and then so that way if we ever save it yeah that'll be on the point no matter what you know and I'm distinct I killed one let's go rob I'm getting shot Oh left side Oh ID synched him at the last second alright let's just forgot the illest ripple that's my boy what are you using the rifle again yeah and you just lighting them up just popping heads I'm gonna look for let me know where three are oh I headshot one of them well I'm going point now and three was on point that's it let's go I got both the threes this time oh watch three on the left here alright you could see it with this rifle here a bit of a dead goes to dub hit but doesn't after but wait a second that's a three headshot and body Bop going for the point Bop new dog got to be honest I'm still confused but we don't know I don't know what we did we [Music]
