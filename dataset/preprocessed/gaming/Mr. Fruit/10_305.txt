yar heidi ho everyone my name be mr fruit and welcome the king of cheese uh apologies for this uh ice pack i'm gonna have i'm rather hot nauseous right now and surprisingly this is actually kind of helping well it was until i put the headphones on just thought i'd you know little life hack there for all you out there who suffer from constant hotness and nauseaness whatever the word is anyway uh yoho yoho a pirate's life for me so if i'm being honest with you all i have not played this yet so this is all going to be new for both of us you know this is uh we get to experience this together is this some sort of like an action rpg pirate game i think again i don't really know but they had me at pirates so we're here to play we're going to play it together and we're going to see how it goes i can choose my adventure i can be a ship's boy which is for plebs we can be a gutter for new sailors who want a more challenging game this experience is recommended for most players though or we can be a captain for more talented captains oh my god or this course you're a king of this he's holy permanent death you know what i'd be a gunnery and i be lukey the finest pirate of the west of westeros i don't know and i don't have a safe slot yard you know i don't have a pirate hat or a patch which is surprising i know but it would have come in handy here it would have helped with our immersion in the middle of the ocean many years ago within navy sailors traded surrounded by thousands of dangers it's a lot of dangers at that time pirate law was enforced on the seven seas and shamans shamans with fearsome voodoo rituals i don't mess with that but a bloody battle changed fate forever the fight between pirates and navy sailors inflamed the sky for endless days that's crazy okay so what are we doing here i don't know but i see pirate ships and i'm happy and castles i love castles is that a moat king's fortress yeah 832 something something look at the wonderful village yes the peasants seem to be doing well today oh this is pretty um supreme the supreme admiral burns the ship is ready for departure we are waiting for the captain to arrive sorry i'm late it won't happen again see

of this beautiful map let me explain how it works it's a map wow battle thank you okay well looks like we got to go this way a little bit oh we've got 8.4 nautical knots or whatever level 60 battle mints or whatever those are lighthouses towers cannons not really sure but they're friendly so it's all good the wind can be your best ally or your worst enemy yes it appears it's uh going this way uh north east southwest southwesterly oh jesus holy the little raft what you doing there oh that's an island with a stern wind afraid to set its fastest speed other boats instead sailed better from different angles wasn't entirely listening to what you were saying uh oh it appears we've found our way to the oh yeah there it is good old break yo ho yo ho my friends i come hailing from uh

preliminary part of the game you know the uh little tutorial or whatever can i zoom the map i can screw so you uh sail off dinner oh come in ray what brings you here you can't escape lookie the whole capital knows what you've done huh you will pay for your crime what are you talking about a witness saw your ship returning to the fortress from the side entrance when it should have been enroute to

they betrayed me but those people on the ship did they do me any harm ah all the the conundrum and philosophical problems with killing it's gonna mess me up i'm getting a lot of therapy but now this kind of therapy not this kind of talking okay let me go kill a little bit more so i have more to talk to my therapist about okay the sloop which boasts three guns on each side is an agile life-saving ship ooh is that what i have it will be easier to handle in the combat and not flank your enemy watch out for multiple ship valves you may find yourself in trouble i guess that's what we're using or they tell me which one do i want no i guess we have this flute blah blah blah blah shut your mouth captain d morgan i also got a date with pizza coming in like soon so looking forward to that i mean yarg there be some sardines in the bellows of the ship plunder ship is that am i fighting you kind of seems friendly oh right all right what am i doing what am i doing uh zoom out where the fudge am i

uh can you just run me into the market and buy wood ah yes yes of course my man forgot to give me the memo i've never seen you around here before i i'm ed and this is my market i get it you sell things i give you money for it gotcha okay i need a tin food yes yes give me tin food yes good good good good raise the anchor reach the merchant company port yes yes where is that exactly it's all very old it's over there of course it is hey get out of my way plunder my business not be with you yard although again i think we're friends we we sail with the same flags yes oh i can zoom oh that's fine oh my immersion but i don't see my mates on deck where are they they're not busy getting drunk again are they not without me some sunken treasure oh well don't mind if i dare and it looks like there's something on the shore too but first i'm gonna loot this rack man what do you see out there what have you done to it is it booby trapped is it the kraken oh we got experience it's gonna say i don't know what's happening four pelican eggs oh i can make my own breed my little pelican not fun we got gold we got experience freaking pog man all right now let me um interact with this we got some treasure on the shore we got medicine we got candies whoever tried to bury that treasure can be honest with you not the best handiwork i've ever seen okay did you even try and dick acetate cool what the fudge uh i i guess i should get the school fish but also um the freaking kraken is over there and that ship does not seem as alarmed as it should be it just got whipped with a tentacle a giant tentacle you need expert fishing rod okay well thanks for baiting me game appreciate that so you'll tell me to catch fish i can't but you won't warn me about the kraken sure whatever hey oh city tweezer oh hold on there's a cannon keg who's this explode exposure we must not get close oh [Music] yeah what do you know okay that's what i figured i was just checking ah treasure ship wait a second escort ship whoa get the cannons ready i say the same for you all right we gotta use our speed wait what i'm like poison or something i missed oh i've got friends now though i've got friends in all the right places i don't i'm switching my cannons but admittedly i don't know what they'll do oh but whatever they do they hurt i missed suck okay but what if i boosh didn't miss that come on fire again oh my god i'm the best okay but i'm switching to those other things again they did way more damage oh oh wait uh you're hard okay well i'm just dead maybe i bit off a little bit more and i can chew i really need to figure out like this seems to be a chain shot maybe that slows this seems to be to hurt people or just larger easier to hit this one seems to be like the play though a i could be wrong do i have to re-interact with everything i just went through or no i don't okay i don't think so or it's all randomized but make no mistake if i see another treasure ship with an escort i will be a uh going for him again no shame i will win this time okay why is the music ramping up i have not engaged okay i think it's just travelers music that's our bard on chip who i said to keep doing that or to stop doing that he knows it scares the bejesus out of me now where is that treasure ship it must be in route they go about the same trade rest don't they hmm apparently not bump oh there's

something about a cartographer or something i thought it wasn't wait what oh we did sink him i guess oh we got xp wow that's kind of morbid see there's a random man trying to go on a raft in the middle of the sea kill him and if you do we will reward you you need fishing round of fishing we only have a basic fisherman that's what dave's for dave you're the fisherman fudge why why are you on
