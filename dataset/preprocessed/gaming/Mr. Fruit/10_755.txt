hi ad hojoon money mr. fruit and welcome back to Calgary modern Roy fair or as I like to call it these days I don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore I'm just mindlessly grinding camos because another one bites the dust the fal gold unlocked I know this thing's come a long way since the beginning of the game where is absolute trash it's been buffed it's a little bit better and honestly if you're not using it in hardcore you're still gonna have a bad time what are you doing use it in hardcore now our first game will be on hardcore shipment and because of that the barrel of choice will be the 13 edged osw barra operator for grip for some recoil control stipple grip tape for the optimal PP speed and sprinting 2 PP speed oh you know it sleight of hand any FSS close quarter stack for the amount I speak that is for assault rifles down 4 to go as I'm just a zombie at this point need milk good blue hell jeez ha got a game in progress oh yeah oh geez everyone's dying ok so the good news about the FAL in hardcore a lot of things 1 wait life a lot of things 1 shot but the FAL does no matter where you hit ah that was my kill and you know it oh you're gonna watch that too a lot of people like to just lay prone especially in hardcore shipment I have come to find and the unfortunate thing is it's actually quite an effective strategy bow baby get destroyed I was actually really happy for a second there cuz I was like oh I got three kills in a life because I literally just finished getting the game up so we had to grind out log and E for cha teammate killed a cow daemul worst aw jeez I'm dead I deserved that got a kid it's hard to quickly discern who is enemy and who is foe is that a collateral or did did I not even I don't know okay okay okay can I just enjoy the gold looking good FAL now I do think I'm using some sort of a blueprint that was a collateral which is lying from like peekaboo so yeah I'm not quite sure what the normal FL looks like there's usually a lot of wood furnishings on this blueprint but again forth a are in a row were the last thing I actually had tonight wait the enemy killed me what do you mean my team it was right behind me and shot me yeah whatever doesn't matter what it did do was get kills 800 kills every AR so far has been that way because like I said I've been very efficient in the camo ground shoot house is very helpful but I just oh that was the enemy okay thank God I don't know I saw someone a shot and thankfully I I didn't get punished because the worst is when it's like well the worst is when you die the worst is when you accidentally kill a few tears it's like damage will now be reflected and then you spawn you panic you shoot somebody and you kill yourself you know I'm saying or is that just me alright dude yep that was Alma deagle right there you're welcome team oh yeah go ahead spawn right in front of me watch this you're gonna be to the right but I'm gonna pretend they don't see them past this [ __ ] oh my god mr. fruit you're a man possessed right now mister what we had a quad kill another collateral somehow I miss that guy right there though we love these kind of spawns though I said I love this spot and then they just oh no see the enemy just spawned there and then someone else to immediately spawn there so has been immediately shooted there was a teammate because it's a teammate nine-minute for the world Fricks if they ever do that would I feel bad if it's a map just gonna come eyes oh geez can't hold my breath for that long just means I would not make for a great diver light what is this guy doing is he trying to wallbang endlessly is he just purposely shooting the shipment I don't I don't really okay I can't quite gel with these kits these days you know it's either they're incredibly cracked or they're cracked out on something and they're wack you know I'm saying oh well I reflected the sea and the kill fee that just a headshot mr. fruit so I would have had a headshot but it was my teammate instead it goes it reflects right off him and right back to me sex but oh my god it was just in the corner creeping waiting they black come on now boy no you're out there you can't hide forever boy take that with it oh I see you up the hour I'm going I'm going hi oh come here yes dude goosh goosh yeah I threw three throwing knives in your face killed your teammate what else can I know what can't I doubt Jesus I got killed by my teammate not to be fair he was just shooting the enemy and I jumped from the heavens right into his bullets so you can't really blame the guy but I still well it's your fault and I hate you no I did do huh huh I didn't almost exclusively use the FAL in hardcore because like I said you have to do it here you go crazy they spawned to drive me a little crazy but c'est la vie he's sweaty beads because yeah FAL ain't bad I mean in hardcore honestly it's one of your best options in my opinion but in core you're right you're gonna have a bad time how you killed him well done you did not kill him though I tried it even on shipment like regular core shipment yeah I'm just no move why is there friendly player collision thought they'd remove that or something I thought it was like a bug I guess it couldn't fit just you don't realize how many times you've run into your friends until like that you just start running River Road yeah the FAL grew on me I mean at beginning it was pretty trash it got him minor buff I'd say and I liked it a lot more once I took it in hardcore at one point in time way too far into my camo grind I decided you know what mr. crew get off your high horse what is the wood what of what even of a high horse in my on what does it even matter why when I play hardcore it's gonna make my life 10 times easier and at least for the FAL it has done exactly that like why did I not grind any of the ride shield hardcore I don't know that's a great question but I'm about to break cuz I still have that on the old backburner I just killed them Oh what is this way I mean the pic of this pea shooter oh okay mr. fruit okay okay go on son oh I had to reload Oh give me that care package Sam your cap care package you try and help your friend nope and oh you already dead that's a grenade oh no I'm losing my train of thought I'm losing my train of thought where was I oh yeah so I still got to get the three kill sprees with the ride shield it's just like what and some people say to do like hardcore shipment watch I've tried using the ride shield I'm lucky to get like a kill in a life much less than three like what do you mean use it hardcore shipment it's a terrible idea you just can't get to people everybody's on everybody's on high alert and at least in other maps like you can kind of get like a flag you know catch people by surprise or take a different route to go about but like here what what you gonna do what you gonna do boy what's gonna do when they come for you á bad boys bad boys what's gonna do what you're gonna do take my grenade I don't know if you're still a fish but we're about to find out I don't think you worry but that's a lot of kills what enemy UAV yeah oh okay can we stop spawning me right in front all will get revenge darn it okay okay okay they're gonna die they're gonna die you're gonna die they're gonna die okay yeah I guess they're dead I unfortunately did not smite them but my friends did and it still matters mm-hmm I hate reflecting damage but I mean it's the best way to go about hardcore otherwise you get griefers or you know that kind of steer cuz I mean I'm pissed every time I get killed my friends Michael what the heck even though I do it all the time - and I know almost all the time it's like it's completely harmless there was no ill manner behind it they did just it's just next gen you know what those things happen from time to time but I refuse to believe that instead I believe that the entire world is out to get me everyone hates me and because of that I must show swift justice to all those that oppose me which means friends and foes alike which means I have no friends everyone's a phone except for my puppies I love my puppies they ever turned on me a phone no you know I always think of like those episodes in Pokemon or something where it's like so-and-so has to decide something or like Pikachu leave me but if we go or it's like alright who do you want to go with then they have to choose one person or the other I never want to have to get there because I'm worried that my dog should be like who do you want to go to and then I'm like come on girl but then the other person has like peanut butter hiding behind their their back you know what I'm saying and then they'll go to them and then a bit of me but it's secretly because they had peanut butter the entire time because I'd like to believe that they would choose me but maybe they wouldn't they do like peanut butter I can't believe them they're simple-minded they driven by their stomach they take after their father I don't have a heart have a stomach and that's the way to my heart wait I got a collateral in there or something no no no it seems to have worked out for my favorite though ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ah man can I'm on a bit of a tear there I see a laying prone that is gonna kill you oh darn it did it go too high I didn't give it that much sauce my arms not that strong come on now I mean I'm flattered but and I also love this is just yet my answer to ever finding enemies just way on the trigger and something might die never really be too sure plus I have no idea how far along the game is because it's hardcore and I refuse to check because then there's no secret some things in life must be ambiguous mr. fruit everybody likes it okay see as soon as I mention it everybody likes a good surprise and in this case we lost Oh play the game with the FAL don't mind if I do apparently there's a collateral in there I still don't see it playing it back but thank God gah gah gah look at my team on the 155 we all been on that ground I see speaking of which new season does start next week and actually as I ended that match today's playlist update went live shoot house 24/7 is back baby which means time to grind the other four assault rifles screw me right okay well I'll go ahead and show you the FAL in some core though not terrible but again my go-to it has this weird place where I don't know it's kind of like the EBR but I'd actually rather take the EBR even though I don't like the EBR way hold up that actually went kind of well holy jesus Oh God yes scared the bejesus out of me I think he was using the mp5 though but did nobody tell that rascal it got nerfed I don't know how drastic it is I think it's a pretty major range nerf but aside from that hold up now okay we might be on to something you just double triple quadruple tap like every time you see somebody and they're either dead or you're dead but don't stop tapping to find out just keep tapping you just keep tapping just keep chipping just keep tapping tapping tapping I get what I am shooting at this range I'm praying I kind of turned into Digimon Digimon what are you doing you are lagging a lot did your Mon digital monsters I needed to reload change into a patch or her weapon or a real Marchman rifle wow did jump on digital monsters I'm going to actually sing the song did Chapman and digital monsters Digimon are the champions hey wait what a lot of stems wait a minute I haven't used to I thought I just spawned however to use two stems oh my oh like I said just keep shooting this is incredible holy cow oh my god hold oh actually a bit of a tear there and I freaking forgot to turn killstreaks back on yeah I need to do that somebody asked me why I prefer the specialist when I do McGraw and in for camos and the way I explained it is it's just a little bit easier because you're not killstreaks can't ever help with a camo right but getting a few additional skills a few additional perks can lead to longer life longevity which means you have a good chance of poppin off or doing whatever you need to you know what I'm saying at least that's the way I see it I shouldn't have pushed you know what have thought I've learned but no I am loving that get rip left it get up though haha faze clan did faze up brah about god you're with face do you like do you like trickshot or like you like sick with it bro what well the mp5 might have gotten nerfed but up close now it'll still sure add me still an mp5 it appears that uh literally everyone is still using an mp5 no one got the memo that is another mp5 and I'm trying a little hard out with my with my recoil here wow that's incredible if I'd had a scope or something we could have had a better shot but I was a shouting into the void shooting popping off left and right open eh one of these is bound to hit something I hope to god all right how are we losing okay that's why because my team ain't doing nothing oh come on now ah wipe darn it I didn't think he'd poke so it's gonna throw a grenade and then I died because of it you oh I'm surprised there's not more around here Oh golly gee willikers I'm not going to engage with that but I am going to engage the rascal that has resided himself upon up here upon up high in here on in this place I don't know what I'm saying anymore FL weapon you push with no no absolutely not but is it a weapon mr. fruit pushes with yes because that's would it here's a qualification for it to be a weapon that mr. fruit will push well does it shoot bullets alright mr. fruit pushes actually I take that back can you kill something with it mr. fruit pushes I mean the knife the Brad show they don't matter how many shoot this darn thing down we've got to put launchers okay I'm doing hey wait a minute you guys just shoot it down what the heck I just changed my whatever oh I'm hearing some bullets though come here come here come here yes why why would you do that why he's dead - yeah if I am free him execute you shouldn't be able to shoot him if I'm executing them okay ladies and doing one please give it up for the FAL but I hope you had fun watching this video with that said I don't think involvement for watching - - I'll talk to you in the next one maybe one day I'll slow down that outro there well [Music] [Music]
