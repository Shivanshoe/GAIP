hi everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to this video which is a strange video never really thought i'd make a video like this because you're all wondering what happened where did i go uh why did i disappear and i'm here to answer that more or less january 25th 2024 date doesn't matter about two and a half weeks ago i disappeared but disappeared i did make a community post on our channel and i did tweet if you ever curious about what's going on with me if there's ever usually an announcement to be made at the very least i'll tweet about it so mr fruit yt if you don't go check that out wow managed to get a shameless plug like what 30 seconds in to my first upload pack hopefully you guys are watching this i have been a little worried because i've never wanted to take a break because i'm like what if i take a break and then youtube's just like you know what we're just gonna not let anyone know you uh upload videos anymore or everyone's like mr fruit who forgot about him you know how the internet works everyone's got like the memory of a goldfish myself included so but this break was not planned which is why there wasn't like an announcement because in the future if i ever take a break there you'll have a heads up it won't just be like poof i'm gone like that it was a an event that happened that was i hadn't foreseen happening it was sudden and it required my full attention so because of that i stepped back from most things in my life especially i had to take a break from work i just had to and that had taken about four or five days but during that i had time because i wasn't working it was bizarre there's so much time in the day and from that i learned there is a lot to unpack when it comes to christian which is my name is weird to say outside of mr fruit there's mr fruit and there's christian and how do those play into mr fruit because as i had more time you would think wow i've got so much time i can do anything i did i didn't do much because i don't know how to not work which some people like oh bro i wish i had that problem it's not healthy they're so i was trying to unpack the fact that there are there are good things about liking my work and wanting to work a whole bunch it's because i'm passionate i like what i do uh i'm fortunate enough to be able to do this but on the other hand wanting to do it all the time isn't necessarily healthy and not all of the reasons are good like not all of the reasons are well i love what i do it's also because um if i'm working uh my brain can't wander off and think about other things uh and somewhat it's a coping mechanism i also feel like i always have to be creating something and i can't let my mind sit still so there's a whole bunch to this unhealthiness as well and i was trying to unpack all that and uh i did some but lord knows there's there's plenty more that's why the break lasted a little bit longer because some people are like oh my like what if he never returns how long is it going to be i didn't specify them but i definitely knew at the time it wasn't going to be an elongated a lot a long amount of time for all you know like this is it boom because some creators in the past on the on this platform and others have just kind of poof disappeared that was not my intention and it will never be my intention if this thing ever does end there will be a proper send off but hopefully that never happens well it will i mean let's be honest it's a it's it's inevitable whether it's a year from now five years from now 20 years from now maybe i'm old decrepit dying on my my death bed and i'm like hey everyone anybody oh okay well rest in pieces so that's what i'm saying like you don't have to worry about that again i love what i do but also what i realized is i and i it's it's like a puzzle i've slowly been solving you know imagine you're making a puzzle but you didn't know what it is beforehand you're piecing things together and you're like oh oh i i i kind of see where this is going i recognize this little part of the puzzle i wonder what i i think i have an idea of what the rest of the image is i'll keep piecing things together and they're like oh i didn't oh i didn't know about that that's kind of a metaphor for what it's been for me for the past like year half a year to a year essentially is i knew something was wrong in the essence that especially mentally struggling with work in a way that i hadn't before and i say that in a way because grinding was it came so easy early on in my career and i think it's understandable and a lot of people can say the same thing but burnout is real and i was like bro i'm never burning out and i thought that until one day i just woke up and it wasn't that same gusto and it wasn't just like a a switch it was like a slow burn and one day i'm finally realizing wait a second this is what's going on this is why i'm having this is what feels off and that's kind of what happened especially right before mangas popped off funnily enough i started to take a little time back step back um was like i'm going to single upload for now to take some time try and work on my work-life balance which honestly it started to make some good progress and then the mungus came and all that hype and i tried to manage my expectations and then it blew up and i was making sure to be like hey this is temporary enjoy while you came it's just numbers but then suddenly you're like uh but this isn't performing as well numbers are going down oh this i can't keep this how do i how do i uh maintain this uh what if i i tried to prepare myself and i knew i almost like to a t said like hey you have to do this or this is what's gonna happen so i tried to do this and the same thing happened and where i'm stressed about things down on myself you know up in the the old noggin which is what i'm trying to work on the rhetoric up there you know be a little nicer to myself talk nice to myself and i know it sounds silly but generally try and phrase things a little bit differently like for me for instance this is just a tangent but when i first started working out for me it was literally what helped me was not i have to go to the gym today like if i'm talking to somebody or i'm telling myself like i have to go to the gym to date i get to go to the gym today and even just that little bit like don't just say it once but keep saying it and then suddenly you're gonna realize like you start to almost trick yourself into believing it but anyway that's a tangent aside the point i like to word vomit and get on tangents so forgive me i'll try and keep this back on the tracks i don't have a piece of paper or anything to outline what i wanted to talk about so figured our first video back should be a little more candid just me talking to you you right there at the end of the day we have some fair weather subscribers or viewers fans whatever you'd like to call them come and go with certain seasons content games all that kind of stuff but i know i have a core audience that's always there for me which is always hard to wrap my head around but i'm so grateful for that but essentially what happened was i did all this introspection and i realized the way i'm going about working and my life right now is just not healthy and really i've ignored pretty much everything outside of work for the past like six years of my life which isn't good i'm trying to work on that i can't enjoy free time which i view free time as a time it's time not working or working out i see those as things i gotta do and i love to do and i'm fortunate to do but then when i'm not doing those i have a hard time existing almost which is why it was so hard to be idle for so long like trust me i wanted to work i wanted to come back that's when i realized like wait a second we didn't see this break coming i certainly didn't see it coming and if it wasn't for that lord knows i probably would have never taken an actual break i would have had the balls to do it be like hey i'm cutting it like two weeks i don't think i could do that maybe now that it happened i could in the future and i'll give you all a heads up i had to just sit there and stew and brew on things and that was scary i know that sounds stupid man it's scary bro up here it can it can be rough all right you're you're your own worst enemy is yourself i was fighting my brain we were throwing hands you know what i'm saying me and myself my shadow's up because as you all know that's the thing i'm pretty transparent a lot about a lot of things too i guess the the question most people want to answer is like well what happened i'm not comfortable talking about it because like i just mentioned i'm very transparent about almost everything in my life but also for the sake of my mental health this is gonna sound weird but christian and mr fruit have slowly molded together for me i know it sounds weird but sometimes it's hard to discern what is what and if i shared everything it would almost violate certain and it would it would confuse things so some things some personal things i just got to keep separate this is one of those things but it's nothing bad nobody's dead nothing like that i'm okay so just know it's not it's good what happened is fixed it's great so then it was just a matter of you know me fighting myself because i haven't quite felt like myself and like i like i've said plenty of times before i suffer with depression um and unfortunately it's not like seasonal depression or anything it's just that is me i'm depressed chemically i got some imbalances and all this kind of stuff it is what it is combining that with some other stuff like i've always had an inkling that i have some sort of like adhd but it never felt debilitating until recently where i'm i'm noticing a lot more that i think i need to get a hold on that too because that's the tough part too is like it's rarely ever just depression that's like the layer and then you peel it off and you're like wait oh there's a whole bunch of other stuff contributing to it great example is my migraines i've never had migraines in my life cue last november well not anymore because it's 20 21 good lord november 2019 i get a migraine for the first time this is terrible and then i get it the next day and then i have another one the next day i'm like what's going on here i go to see a doctor it's like they're cluster migraines i'm like cool but i don't get those like i've never had these they came out of nowhere and then for whatever reason about every three weeks on the practically like on the on the mark on whatever i can't think of the price on cue let's go with that cluster migraines couple days like i start to feel one i'm like i'm gonna feel like this for a couple days boom but like i went to doctors we did this that looked everywhere couldn't find any reason as to why i was getting these turns out i'm having jaw issues right as you know i wear a splint now uh we're working on fixing my jaw it's it's not good but i finally go in i get this splint starts to help my jaw pain i can finally chew again and stuff and what do you know i haven't had a migraine since i got the splint in which was october it's at this point i've been about four and a half months migraine free which is great five and a half i don't remember because it turns out that's what was happening the the muscle here can often when there's pain and stuff it can it it runs up it can upset and aggravate this which in turn can lead to a migraine and we just never thought to connect the dots so it's kind of like that on the outside we say we see hey here's a problem this is probably what's causing it but then that's not the case turns out it's it's this completely unrelated thing that turns out to not be unrelated but you just never connected the two and that's kind of what i'm working on right now it's it's trying to unpack and and figure out and lay it all out like okay what are my issues i got a lot of them what can i work on what can't what can't i do and if i can't do something about it and i say that like you know physically like you know it's not a problem i can just solve okay well then mentally how can i frame it in my mind differently so that you know if i sit here and i tell myself i hate this i hate this i hate this you know and it's you know this pair i keep telling myself i hate pictures i hate pairs i hate pairs i hate pairs i love pairs but if i keep looking at it and i keep hating it eventually i might convince myself like yeah you know what i hate pairs but that's not the truth so i need to just start loving myself a little bit more and working on a lot of things there's quite a bit so the the skinny of it i rambled plenty apologies i'm struggling i'm a human being and i think it's always hard for me to admit that especially when it comes to my work i'm very proud of my work i take pride in how much i work which again is a good and a bad thing but my work ethic i got from my parents you know grind hard you want to earn it work for it that kind of thing and i think it's it's served me well in a sense that you know i've gotten to a place that i'm able to do the job that i have but it came at a price that i didn't necessarily see immediately and that's what's kind of been the slow burn kind of like my jaw you know technically i'd had jaw issues for a while but never realized until it was like uh at the climax when it all fell apart at the same time that's like oh something's wrong here and that's kind of what happened here i kind of let it come to a boiling point and so hopefully i can do better about that because you know mentally i've been better about my my depression and being able to recognize when i'm getting to that point and trying to mitigate that but now i have to also realize i have to do that in my work and sometimes working more isn't always the answer because that's what i used to do so i'm trying to take care of myself you guys need to take care of yourself i know like physically i'm up there you know i've been working out for years now dieting uh i drink plenty of water um i talk with a therapist i take meds you know i have a lot of that stuff i get plenty of sleep i have a bedtime i get at least eight hours of sleep you know all that kind of stuff but that doesn't just solve the issue like clearly it doesn't work for me it helps i know it helps but it's not just physical stuff it's mental stuff and i think that can be some of the hardest stuff so hopefully the reason i've always opened up about my depression is to be transparent with a lot of you and hopefully make some of you realize hey maybe that's me or hey that kind of sounds like my friend maybe i can help him out or maybe i can help myself and i think that's the biggest thing is you know remove this taboo around mental health which i think the world's been doing a better job in these past years decade especially i said that's kind of it i'm human i'm struggling i just needed some time away but i'm ready i'm back part of the issue too was realizing i was in a creative rut that was also part of it where you know like a lot of people will tell you especially artists and that kind of stuff after doing it for a while they see it differently they don't think their work is valued as much uh they're not as happy with it they can't come up with new ideas and they feel like they always have to iterate and one-up themselves that's how i feel with my content and i didn't initially realize that was the problem and that's probably why i've been trying to iterate and change things for so long in this past like six months without realizing that's what i'm trying to do the thing is though like i feel i feel refueled i honestly i feel way better about where i am with my channel and stuff than before and hopefully i can keep that up hopefully this video serves some purpose hopefully the channel didn't die you know hopefully some of you came back um content is on the way ironically we're we're going back to daily uploads on the main channel and then there will still be uploads on the minecraft channel so now we're doing more but i'm working on my work-life balance i'm actually going to try and take weekends off because i've never had days off in the past like seven years i kid you not i work every day all the time so i think that's a good starting point is giving myself some more time to step away from it all and from there you know what this is a journey you and me are in this together i greatly appreciate you guys i love you all thank you very much for watching and i don't want to drag on so i'll see you guys in the next video [Music] you
