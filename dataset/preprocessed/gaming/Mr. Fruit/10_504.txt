heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to among us bryce coming away from not a dead body probably doing a card swipe which is gucci okay too slow somebody just vented somebody [Music] oh my god okay run i saw the vent open on the other side and close so i went to go click the button so can anyone play somewhere around there anyone [Music] slow me up like what's the point man i try and be a good crewmate i find the incriminating evidence and they're like yeah let's just vote mr fruit off god whatever it's behind us i need to swipe this card hopefully someone else is gonna fix the power on this asian server the ping is so bad as you can obviously tell that trying to flick the lights especially if anyone else is there like literally impossible ab left the game no wow they killed him so hard he literally quit pretty sus i think it's [ __ ] ab it's [ __ ] up wait was it is it at cafeteria no it's by electrical he was that means it was yeah he was playing and he left discord so yeah somebody made him rage quit among us but we made our friend raise quit part two part dude i think there's now we have this point and now we have to find the culprit who made average quit it was made now we gotta find have a guilt complex yeah it's a blessing the reason i'm admitting is because like i don't want to make anyone upset and i feel really bad when people are mad and you know just about me what huh yeah no no i feel bad i feel bad when other people are sad you yes but that's gonna make the imposters mad because then you're just like throwing around when somebody gets impossible yeah maybe you're right you're right you're right it was fruit you know what dude you got me these arguments are so convincing that's convincing don't vote fruit vote me thank you my man welcome somebody had to me and you we're both the imposters right what was it about that kill that just put ab over over the edge you know what god i hate it's this asian ping bro okay like what okay also like i'm i pretty much know it's bless i'm in here with electric with him yeah this is this isn't how good things end shark and rob were up there there's no way bless is going to get the kill he already knows what's going on it's going down in timber it's pretty fun it's like i've left the game i wonder if he dc oh is there a body here oh and it's ab go ahead and kill me bless do it i dare you do it why are my tasks always tabbed out like that no okay whoever reported there's also another body in electrical you reported it i didn't report oh it worked yeah okay because i kept on saying the report but i saw no body so i was just walking around spamming report trying to find that well uh funnily enough wait shark didn't you go into electrical recently i did i saw oh [ __ ] he's the imposter wait hold on no because shark who'd you see there i saw ariel's there and he was doing his hands and bless was it wait bless was there i didn't see bless that's even because when i was walking out blessed was up there so he would have killed invented you know the thing that you feel like wait so it's blessed you know i said unless it's shark and he's gonna go with maybe it actually was blessed and when he was saying vote for me i'm gonna go with fruit because like after he walked that way why are you going for why are you going for like like you saw me walk out that you walked out and you could have i would have saw you come back in yeah there's nobody yeah i did not do it i'm innocent or maybe it's the long cone [Music] i immediately suffered myself now if i'm the imposter i'm just going to be like [Music] oh [ __ ] uh blue's good okay wow where this is the party we're all um are you done yet or like oh okay right price is going okay wow what would you leave this if they really wanted to see if i was innocent they wouldn't finish their task god it's so dark all right well that eliminates a lot of people blue bless and myself shark was there momentarily oh god come on boys come on we gotta stick together we know it can't be us unfortunately for the imposters well i waited to go to med bay for so long and i was like surely up really at the scene of the crime where you reported the body what certainly died well here's what i know yeah it wasn't bryce or blue idea i know for a fact i can trust my two homies yeah we homies that leaves three people thought i could trust shark but now you're shark why can't you trust them because we're shower buddies we saw each other naked and i was depressed okay i'll confirm that i did see them together and then i went to do my uh how did you see us together when the lights were off because i had a no like literally at the start of the round yeah when i entered med bay i did see shark however if you want to go to the beatty boot bop we didn't you didn't well i guess the lights are off so we didn't see you however you could have just gone right down to electrical and then did whatever you wanted to however we don't know where dork is and dork probably won't say anything ever i could even do it's not the imposter i can already guarantee you he's not the imposter okay so deutsche not the impossible granted yeah he probably would have given up wait why are you why are you defending him do you guys are trying to you don't try the third impossible right now no it was blessed there's only guys what it's not i don't think it was blessed i think it's shark and rob they immediately are trying they're trying to they're trying to do the gaslighting thing where they put it on me but bryce and fruit already know i'm good yeah i mean i don't think it's i know you're wearing i literally saw you in med bay should have blocked running behind shark that's why i thought i could trust shark because i was coming from cafeteria it's sharper it's trucker personally i don't know why you're doing run cafeteria like from like the little from med bay that little hallway tell me how this whole time the lights are off you can even tell where he doesn't follow him we do can we vote one vote robert roberts lights have been on this i'm voting dork i'm voting please i don't know please vote rob if you don't vote if you don't vote rob shark then you're the imposter how how does that make any sense maybe it's also maybe bless one that had to be blessed though i don't i personally don't think it was blessed that would be the only one i know it's rob oh [ __ ] so wait was it not blessed well then why would bless what i don't know it was man now we gotta find him complex wait that still makes sense though cause shark could have come in and that's why he would have vouched and be like oh yeah that's why that adds up so then i think it was blessing shark maybe it really wasn't rob i don't know okay so blue's over there by electrical that's where i last saw a shark i'll double check he's killed eight million people there apparently oh and there's shark is he leaving a body i'm looking he went through navigation i'm just gonna follow shark all for the possible trail bodies now unfortunately jesus my last two tasks are navigation which is last where i saw shark so that's a bit unfortunate bryce is over there doing the hand thing there's just torque doing whatever dork wants to do all right everybody's here was that bryce or shark uh pretty sure that was shark you know shark wants to stab me no you don't no you don't what asian ping what the fudge what happened he was locked out and then he wasn't the heck just did some vanishing in jutsu on me jesus all right well i gotta finish my task in peace oh wait oh i still have to download gosh dang it really do be like that though let me just do this do that my best cat impression all right come with me blue i knew it oh my god of course you leave me with dork oh i knew it for you to just stab blue and clean my face you sat blue in front of my face see the funny thing is shark is blue bryce and myself all knew we were innocent and he's dead okay and bryce is dead and knows he's not the imposter nobody cares let's get this run over with thank you thank you dork appreciate that now the real question was was it blas i think it was a blast no hey shark nice try man oh my god was it no shark dad i killed him yeah i did not i did not i did not okay the lights are off he was going to electrical and i had to drive by i'm sorry i'm the crew mate again uh really really it's shirty and blue i know it's oh my god and then he just fudge so are you not even oh my first part two is he didn't even see you did it not that i think it would matter he's just gonna sit on that body until somebody comes and finds him there that's the worst part he wants someone to find him on top of that body he wants to make it look like he's downloading or something they can't see the body okay or he'll just or he'll just kill blue right on top of or kill dork right on top of that body all right well i don't think i'm gonna bother to do my tasks because something tells me this game is gonna be over real fast kill me right off the bat spawn nothing nobody bad tonight rob is sitting in the electrical you are playing a dangerous game my friend you gonna stab bless wouldn't put it past you oh blue had to kill somebody yeah dear god wow all right holy [ __ ] let me just say this time out i know it's probably not sir dee cause he was afk with me to start the game correct certainly that's messed up check some babes my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined so what's that like if that is the case it's not rob and it's not sir d and i know it's not me that means it's versus in blue wait wait hold up hold up okay otherwise knows i don't necessarily disagree with you but can you run that by one more time because i wouldn't bring for a second i don't necessarily agree that i'm the apostle but you know we'll see we'll see no no i don't no i don't i didn't i don't disagree i just can you please run that by because i didn't hear anything you just said so robbie and cerny said they were both afk at the beginning to start there were a lot of kills it's very unlikely that two sets of double kills happened while afk people that's true that's fair didn't you see me though like you saw me for a split second we made eye contact i remember that oh god i was like who the hell is talking to my team now my problem is is bryce is so like gun hoe on yeah for me not himself that it almost makes me feel like well why would i try to throw my teammate under the bus immediately because you're going for the long term yeah because we have to vote somebody here we can't skip when we know there's too impossible i think it's either versus or blue name every task if you're not at the imposter it doesn't matter if i name every kept appearing behind me over and over again i'm voting right now i'm going to go i'm going brian price is going down sorry bryce i'm voting bryce because i think right back i'm about to find [Music] that was like the quickest impostor out [Music] ever [Music] you
