hi a behove villain my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to a Minecraft hardcore let's play Survival Series in today's video as you can guess though from the title things didn't go so well in the surviving Department I'll give you some sneak peeks into our journey as we slowly and unknowingly approached our inevitable death a couple times that's right we didn't just die once okay first on the agenda folks hello for those unaware meat ghosts in Momo no they're beautiful oh and then we have of course Applebee's and then the POG the POG fishing spot for those that missed it I do have a pav Grande I got like literally a God role fishing rod so we spent a lot of time fishing and it's so incredibly worth it so we're actually going to be sinner this is gonna be the centerpiece of our brand-new estate which we're going to start on here as soon as I catch something we got to start the day off right okay it's just the same and whatever it could be worse oh is this series gonna be fruit well until I die so it'll go on forever spoilers it does not go on forever but I didn't need to tell you that after all like I said it's only a matter of time before we do die we need a cow farm will get achieve some chickens we'll get the whole shebang bro oh I can see it now it's the center of the house it's beautiful it's gorgeous maybe with some glass at the bottom and then we could do like lava below it or iron blocks but that's actually that's that's just probably just too expensive for not it's not really worth it you know I could start with a simple house but no no no no we started with that man Sean ah we start with a perfect estate no less no more yeah looking back that wasn't the best idea and actually in our second world we do click to remedy that and actually make ourselves at home a right proper home I was a bit ambitious a little overconfident and thought that I I'd never die as debate making like making this real easy on myself and doing a wooden house but then I was like fire and you know I don't know I don't know if I trust myself seems all suss now this is what I call NASA oh yeah it's coming together I attempted my very first cobblestone generator Oh didn't go quite as planned come on there ow just decapitate myself but look what the fudge it goes what is that retreat what what are those ah what are those there's crossbows yo we might leave my pond alone bro I thought you might lost oh my god how am I lost what the fudge I swear to God I was like didn't even go that far oh [ __ ] me the good news is though in these attempts I have learned a lot about the game and I have learned to always save my coordinates I got lost way too many times and never learned my lesson in our first world what the fudge happened here oh it is a kitty cat Oh No although an kitty cat you're gonna be my friend you're gonna be my friend give me say come here I left my bow Shh no no it led me to lava dad what secrets has it led me to Oh creeper not very good secrets if I do say so myself not know wrong ghosts ghosts why are you here I let my shield out either ghost run ghost use your TP sorcery I'm not losing ghost we're out of here ghost come on now come on screw this place I know what you did the deck things were looking up I started an animal farm we made some pens we got some cows later got some chickens I even started farming you know started some wheat crops this was all new to me and I I was on top of the world guys I think it's really starting to come together look at us we got horses we got wolves we got cows we got wheat we got an extremely extravagant over-the-top house that's gonna cost me way too much and it's not worth it at all and so much more I don't need these lanterns right now but I didn't tortures oh Jesus Christ bro hey what are you stop who myself bro I was a pillager I was a busy where did you come from the strange Lama peddler must pay however for nearly killing me via heart attack he might not be a pillager but at this moment he was as good as dead to me also I want the believes he had for his Lamas don't shame me his trades were egregious hey hey hey not cool hey don't spit at me yeah yeah hole back at you oh yeah now you're oh shoot I messed up what have I done [Music] what the off oh my god what the [ __ ] they break down doors this was a terrifying revelation but not how I died he has my door give me my door Oh Oh bye what did I tell you guys oh I told you this was a good one Oh let's go hog found a big vein of diamonds this was exciting but I was told and so I decided to wait for the fortune enchantment which I did not as of yet know about however I never got to mine these diamonds because we didn't make it that far I know what to do this time ah not again I look at me autonomous is this faster than in the caves I don't know probably not but it's cooler because I made it myself I made this smile Lena's infinite cobblestone generator ha ha ha except that I have to do it manually so it's not really an autonomous plot dad's yeah ok Oh what up Wolf's what up my dudes oh I heard we got some sunken treasure down here huh Yoho Yoho and a pirate's life for me yes so sunken ships that was anything to me didn't even know these existed but I was told treasures lied below and so for the better part of like 30 minutes I spent shoveling underwater in this stupid ship I hate these things I'm still salty about it have another map already Oh buried treasure map oho well hello now you have my attention all right now let's find the treasure a deep could it be so after spending forever unearthing the stupid ship I'm like hey let's go find this treasure well it fast forward another like 20 minutes looking for the stupid treasure I swear to God I think I cleared everywhere except evidently where the treasure was but we're still alive better be the greatest chest of all oh is that good that seems pretty good a horde of Bessy art dabbed I see everything's better where it is what the hot tub does see well now we can just hope that we either find slimes or witch thing or something wizardry how much all right we're almost full on sugarcane now that's a big POG when we get back with the addition of our five books we're gonna be able to make a couple of bookshelves which is a big giant pong I mean I've already so far from home you know might as well just see what else is anything porpoise is trying to scare the bejesus this is if this is a sunken ship I'm gonna be pissed I swear to God God that dolphin scared the leaner Anatomy this is a sunken ship isn't it I swear to God oh hello turtles turtle turtle - will you be my friend no sorry sorry for science I'm sorry ah I'm the worst Oh kelp did I kill him for nothing we'll take the kelp though Thanks wait we're at the kelp go yeah okay I thought I could get something cool that's my bad whoa that's cool-looking trying to distract you from the fact that just killed an innocent sea turtle okay what do you want from me I swear to God is this it is okay okay wait wait wait wait like none of its buried oh my god okay this is so much better it's screw it all right find me that wait I can't okay okay I don't have to I don't have to go around 8 million different I'll look at all the horses I'm sorry I killed the sea turtle I wanted to see what would happen okay I'm not proud of it I just made another one screw me not proud of it I know and he was so nice he didn't fight back he's like bro we can be friends bro bro bruh go go go breach bang through the door go go on ya can't see for it the life for me oh Jesus it's dark down here can't make a torch hider oh I don't need one oh my wheat other caps sucks a lot of rotten meat sucks but I guess a lot of wheat right hold on okay do it yeah I want all that wheat what does aqua affinity do helps with underwater well cool oh my paper let's go that's huge Oh do I do it yeah bro I don't know where I am oh my god I'm stuck I'm stuck no no no yeah so needless to say there's a new policy no more sunken ships they're stupid I hate them and like what you couldn't see there is I knew where I came into that room but for some reason I was like blocked like I couldn't get anywhere and I had doors on me but I was panicking and it I'm still upset about this oh my god that I did I rage quit after that we were streaming and I just ended it I could I couldn't deal with myself so the next day was a new day though and I decided to tackle a new hardcore world this one was going exponentially better almost immediately within the first day we have a wooden house I started some farms we got some cows we got some chickens started a wheat farm everything was coming together our spawn was incredible we were next to a village we were next to a spawner different biomes everything you wanted was right next to us and I managed to well you guessed it throw it all away I ended up finding a mineshaft and I said hey there must be treasure waiting right this is worth it right in my new hardcore world there is a nother new rule no sunken ships and no mine shafts holy choosers these things never end what do we want to go it's good this way come on hit me with your best shot entire Oh God I know where to go there's so many ways we could go bro this never what do we never ends wait a second yeah they're above us they're gonna all fudge me don't back myself in the lab and he is trying to bow-and-arrow me so give me a bell you didn't know coming out oh you leaving me - oh my god she bet it's not worth I was in that mine shaft for like an hour bro nothing [Music] [Music] at this point team morale was at an all-time low started a new world spawn was absolutely butts so it's a little salty I decided to build a shindig in the middle of a desert seemed like a good idea until I realized wait a minute I'm in the middle of a desert there's like no resources how I'm gonna have to corral animals from far far and away to come for farms and then on top of that I would have to just unearth the sand put in dirt so that then I could actually farm stuff mistakes have been made like I said I was a little tilted thought I'd get a little fancy with it what do I have to lose watch this 360 I should have gone for the 720 I guess it was so young and that is the heartbreaking loss of my first three hardcore worlds however good news I'm on my fourth and we're still alive I'm hoping to show you all that world soon as long as I can stay alive for a prolonged period of time all in all though while it was incredibly depressing losing some of these worlds especially the first in the second the first one we'd put nearly fifteen hours or so I did learn a lot about Minecraft and I'm certainly getting better at not dying if you want to follow along though with the series I have been live-streaming that there's a link down in the description box below you ever want to catch me when I'm going live with our hardcore world with that said though I want to thank you all for much for watching heavies was a fantastic day and I'll talk to you and the next one farewell [Music]
