hi there hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the last spell i've been recording this back to back because i i'm addicted and i can't stop playing so here's to hopefully clearing night six week that's what we're on uh never done before myself because i'm papaga but we're getting there we're slowly evolving we're learning and i'm drinking some advanced gg uh delicious mr cherry limey there's a link down in the description box below if you want to go check it out you just couldn't make fruit numbers and off it's delicious anyway let's get into it well the ways i see it there's no point in resting on ceremony in this phase brother because we got everything ready so now it's just a matter of what do we want to plop everybody i think we're going to go melee over her yeah and then i'm gonna swap the rangers the range damage rather because as we saw earlier if there's like a certain enemy type that resists range and we have both of our arranged on one side yeah it's a bit of a problem right so we'll do this and then i'll put the omega range well the only problem is yeah there's not a problem we'll just put the omega range over here perfect i love what i'm seeing over here i think i can hollow thyself try to remember how far they come up i want to say i know i just don't want to get hit right off the bat that'll be real dumb of me but i also want to get a little greedy i do have 10 movement though i think i'm fine i'll hide behind this barricade like the coward i am and then just kind of shinner these guys by the gate something like that perfect um let me go ahead and use the armor things not because i have to but i'm pretty sure there's like um i saw we get like an award at the end for essence if we actually use like armor perks long enough so like that literally just gave me essentially some essence easy clap right to the walls well yeah the runners have no problem getting up there but oh what spearman oh my god my walls already three archers what the fudge what is this alensa stun resistance is rather 200 armor and 100 health what the heck well i know one thing and i know that that one thing is i don't like that i don't much like that so we got to figure out how we want to go i do have snipe shot and i will use it however we're going to slow our roll on that a little bit because we do only have eight mana and we only well we read gen 8 in between but got a whole off on that so for the time being oh my god we just killed this thing what uh i mean it's because we do double damage to armor but freaking supriya with the new saucy sword showing everybody up look at this what let's hope we hyrule survey says we hyrule uh we cannot hyrule this one never lucky just execute so then kill you slice through you you can't move uh actually you can move far enough to hit me anywhere huh okay but the crossbow or the ballista why do i always say crossbow the ballista should be able to help how far can you okay you can hit me from there so i don't like that how about there that should be good oh well then now i haven't even used him now hold up this might not even have to be the case can i peek around the tree here um i can't tell i don't think oh cause this stupid wall ah of course there's a wall right in the way looking boner okay what about this okay so there's no way i think i'm able to hit them unlucky unless maybe i come over here then they're too far anyway okay well yeah a bit of a blind spot for us what do you want that sucks all right well just weaken what i can if that's the case then i might as well just kill that way the ballista will hit a fresh pleb right there and actually if i skadoodle on over here requires line of sight never mind requires on the site oh the freaking balls man the walls are everywhere there we go all right i'm not gonna do anything else i don't want to waste that but we'll be able to move back if we need to take shots anyway but seems like the best is just take advantage of the damage while we can let's see we can pick off this little feller then unfortunately everyone on their mom has armor man the fudge let me read armor specifically so i don't think magic damage would ever prevents that ignores resistance inaccurate increasing targets dodged for there okay that doesn't help at all mazel tov wait oh is this showing their action points and movement points oh i never realized that all right let's see how much damage we can cause here uh we can one shot you oh they got a lancer up there oh shoot that's not good i might have to focus him down let's decide what he's gonna do i think he's gonna mark as many people as possible i would prefer one of those people to be the um lancer so if we come over here i get six targets so good i don't want to even risk killing you how much we doing here not enough okay this would be another two mana i don't think i need to use more mana here on this turn at least so we'll hit you your dodge is pretty good not gonna lie let's do omega omega as long as it does dodge bop i could have just marked it that would have been the smart play but clearly i'm not smart okay i'm going to mark him because he is literally called dodger so the likelihood he would dodge is pretty good crazy right all right we can take you out hyrule pog and i'll weaken the archer i believe that's all of our action points okay the first wave we fended off rather well i think screw you runners okay a lot of people came out of nowhere real fast they've already broken what the i hate these archers i thought the little thing on the ground made it look like he had a cane yeah i'm an old zombie we're doing this longer than you'd believe kid i kind of forgot are they running this way you're trying to you dare try and escape death i think it won't uh huh we can't target we can only tell you this line yeah having the miss pushback cannot under understate just how good that is it's very good in case you were curious let's pick up who we can well no i should probably come back over here so that i need to kind of pick off these people because they'll have the most direct route to the walls right right right right oh resist little son of a all right weakened uh see i do have my scepter but it's all melee right range melee melee one to two but i need to give him another bow or something you have so many action points but only so much i can use see are any of you going to reach the wall you might perfect you're not reaching it anymore i'll tell you that um make it easy just pop not dead unlockers you are dead then you don't have to kill oh i can't go past you like that i can't execute you i can punch this guy i guess oh wait um is that what i want to do how much movement will i have left maybe execute you come over here excuse me four movement left so i punch you and run um i didn't even see the runner there maybe i want to punch this i can't shish kabob man all right i'll punch it oh then i get executed big big big all right and then that lets me run practically all the way back see am i safe here i don't think anyone can get me right there perfect your big chilling let's see um i can only shoot here and get three i don't think that's really worth it so i'll just do that and then i'll give you some extra dodge just in case anybody wants to get a little uh fancy and by that i mean archers and stuff all right we're back up top the harder the nights the more brain power it takes man and i'm just too small brain for this but i do see a nice opportunity right here let me tell you again you lived with 10 health really sir i do have a bone to pick with you i don't like this setup i will do one marking though a little bit like that then do i do it again the numbers are starting to flow and how you you recover 13. that's a good bit currently we're at the threshold but i might buy a mana wall or something sometimes so i'm not that worried about um yeah i'll just take out as many as we can that's three we'll take it i need to stop this lancer i haven't even broken through his arm good lord all right he's still unaffected he doesn't get reduced move speed unlucky i think with his spear he gets range so if it's anything like the spear i use or used i haven't used it in this one bop bop uh this feller's looking to do a good bit of damage but i might be able to kill him let's see if i go over here over here debuff so i don't miss bop all right not perfect but we'll take it farm the movement speed you know how it is all right um those crawlers man or runners or whatever the look at that ballista though hitting from downtown funky stuff malone let's get it the walls i have seen better days better day [Music] these folks we got a bit of a issue here though i can't take all these people out like honestly i kind of want to shish about these people but i could just omega stun them and pick these people off but see i was thinking like come here kill come over here kill almost all of them but maybe that's not the best play yeah i'm gonna i'm just gonna stun these guys i i hopefully is oh that's we all stunned but one yeah that's real nice we take those baby and now we high roll these oh my god yes we do not able to execute that hurts but you're kind of useless right now so i'll keep going uh let's go through you into you screw you lancer into you still not enough to execute i'm only a little upset about it i can kill you i can kill you i don't think you can reach the wall now nope then let me how much damage are we doing here not enough like i don't even think yeah i won't even break armor awkward so do we just go for the kill i don't think they'll be able to reach the gate so instead why don't i just finish this guy and hit this guy since he's not he's gonna be hitting the wall never lucky but see they can't reach me this guy almost can the guy might go for me but i feel like he won't oh this guy can hit me so maybe i'll just take this hit like a champ how much does he do 33 to 40 that will go through my armor to be fair civil that in fact this guy does less damage but this guy um yeah he can okay yeah i think this is our best chance all righty then let's farm that movement i'm not seeing enough moment oh right right oh my god i only did the bottom half jesus it's a good thing they told me that wow yeah how to throw 101 all right i think we throw out some more magic but then what do you want to do literally i don't know the only reason bear takes good is because this magic missiles thing but it costs so much mana thankfully we have the thrifty but it only really means we get one decent use out of it because like you don't want shotgun fudge there's a lot of big dudes yeah i think i'm just gonna have to use all the man i don't think i can really save here although she does have plenty of mana to be fair she could be doing some of her own like come over here do that come back over no like here all right and that should this should well we have to high roll but better nothing what else it's okay this guy's gonna breach unfortunately um so yeah i think we just go magic missiles again we're not gonna be able to kill this guy for a while which is annoying but i think i go for as many kill shots as i can here still the archers over here which is really annoying okay so this guy's not gonna be but he gets his 200 armor back next turn i have to finish him off here yeah that'd just be really annoying all right our wall's gonna be taking a little bit of a dicken but not much we can do about it good lord there couldn't be more of them even if they tried oh my god the range you're nuts oh the walls god dude just getting pooped on over there sweet moses we need more ballistas and i can't let him get to this bullish otherwise he's dead so what miracle can we conjure up with you i think 100 we got to do this again just done as many as we can or kill some i'm not gonna say no to that one more mana you just don't have much money to work with do you buddy old pal and then go for a big stun here hog uh we're not even gonna kill that many with this what can't even execute you guys what the fudge but i can't kill you and i can think about killing you and then i have to get rid of these guys oh wait a second i did not see this little runner rascal fudge gotta take care of him and i'll just probably take care of these people in the front out of range oh really i'll be the judge of that now you scurry on back now girl because i don't know if they face they're stunned i i always forget about that so i think i'm more or less not safe here okay just farm that movement all right lord be with us through these trials and tribulations that is good but is it good enough i don't really have time to think about it just gotta take the shot and then good lord it's all right i hate man anyways there's so many of them can't even kill anyone okay well we have to kill this dude because he's threatening shitty panic and i won't have it this runner i can't have it get through now we just gotta kill both these but then who do i want to kill who you want me to go for the armor dude well they only have 17 armor yeah it's way more major do that okay then i'm gonna have you sit here because i need to stop him from hitting our ballista so take one for the team buddy you might get hit by both though if that's the case oh i'm gonna debuff you because i hate you in particular and that's all yeah okay yeah the top is just getting rammed we can't clear fast enough to be fair the only reason the bottom's not getting ram is because we just have aoe stuns our walls jesus the lord said ow god look at all the archers man okay 69 nice i think we have seen about all the ones we're going to see so the good news is they're all kind of stuck honestly we just aoe stun in the back how much rain do you have five so we got like two more turns to that we keep that up and then just slowly pick off the front and then i think that's what we do down here and then up here i'm gonna figure that out later that's not my job not right now at least so you sir and you gain eight back okay yeah whatever i don't have a choice this is our only hope of survival aoe stun here and i also have to hope we started but i did give him an extra stun perk so i'd have to hope we manage all right kill that didn't kill okay i get actually i was gonna say you've got to be kidding me hyrule pog then we do all this they're all dead finish you this guy is not wounded at all um i can't even kill either of them though who's threatening the most i guess they're all kind of this guy is just gonna do way too much damage so screw you in particular and then i might just have to god all the archers are about to be in range though all right you just nudge yourself right in between there all right and then whatever this is uh i don't know say a little prayer what i guess we just gotta just slowly knock out everyone in the front that's even possible i don't want you to accidentally kill out of range voge oh i don't like the spearman i didn't see him the lens you have so little mana left but i don't have a choice maybe i do let's see if i can hold off okay so i was thinking skewer here aoe here let's see doesn't kill anyone sick aoe here but that's about this okay but now i have to worry about everyone right in front of my face you're at action points how many do you have three uh we can't kill all these guys oh my god they're all rendered more or less useless would i have to stop them from hold on debuff this pleb i can't hit the ballista god the ballista my friend i don't think he can fudge that's it all right well we're gonna get some panic at the very least on the top side uh so you my friend run back and you have to be he's gonna get doubled up on and then he's gonna get sniped i think i'm gonna have to give this ballista uh yellow whatever one hero didn't move i'll fix that nope there we go one here it didn't though wait what oh it's you you little ray ethical you think you can escape all right bullets to go big not perfect it's better than nothing though okay oh my god didn't even go through his arm let's go birdie holy archers city panic is just okay all right this is fine uh we only have three more stuns in us at the bottom and then this i can't kill them all there's too many this stupid armor i need melee [Music] all right we get to use your how much does this do not nearly enough all right i will just have to go for anyone giving our city panic that i won't kill well i would kill him these guys are threatening the ballista not cool and to be fair i don't like the lancer but then are the archers are gonna hit my although it doesn't say panic so i don't think they're gonna hit the end but if they do fudge and then yeah i don't know down there if we go over here [Music] he's too far to even skewer of course he is i would have to get back further which i can't not good all right let's pick up everyone we can give them the city panic out of range out of range too hold it back up one two three four five you got four kills i think that's most of the people pant giving their city panic if i come over here does this kill you you have to high roll so there's a chance seven help unlucky you have one point left can we high roll i think the ballista dies i don't think there's any way i can save it you high roll though my hero oh this guy can't hit our house i don't like that but i also don't like the archers take care of you take care of you these guys are all threatening the ballista splitter does way more damage what if i debuff him come back oh wait you're at a oh you're completely out of ap oh oh rip wait the birdie's gonna die yeah birdie i think you're gonna have to get out of there buddy but the ballista i don't want it to ends like cease i could let him hit the house but i don't think that's gonna do us any favors so the blister will kill one of them it should kill the dodger so i'm just trying to figure out because if that's the case is there any way to stop the splitter but if the splitter hits any of us that's a lot of damage because he would be doing like 60 damage to my health bertie yeah that's just not happening buddy sorry oh yeah you got back it up nope nobody's tanking that screw that all right let's see the mess we got going on over here execute you i can't execute you it should be a threshold instead of hp points because 15 hp points it's a bit ridiculous that's what it is say it oh it is um this could kill you i have to really hope it does kill you i don't think i'm gonna be able to stun much more we gotta start clearing house if i don't stun i don't know at least this side has some walls still unlike um that oh it's dire circumstances here chief well i can kill you not kill you kill you not kill you oh no oh man how many my lord won't be in the thick of it sweet jesus run back so who are we gonna try and stun uh jeez i guess these we did not stun the one in the front that's the main one i wanted to hit but whatever out of range hold up uh i wanna get rid of you but i'm not even gonna get through your armor i'm just gonna get i'm gonna take the kill shots and who i can kill right now um best i can do i didn't mean the movie but whatever i guess i needed to anyway all right pray go ballistas yes no oh it appears i've made a miscalculation what the fudge what um minus two more points ten acres oh i didn't realize this i must have missed this splitter i didn't realize he was may could have been oh my god we lost the ballista this is bad this is real bad okay the panic is setting in suddenly it's not looking good well was it ever really looking good you know that's up for debate i can't hit anyone near me so gotta back it up a little bit more oh my god he's completely out of mana fudge oh just i was like it can't get worse and then it did it just got worse i can't let you take out the seer building see your building is way too important but how do i stop any of them really i come back for two action points you can kill two of them if i come over here and let's see i did set this up that would kill two of them if i come over here i can't set that up so there's no point in me bothering okay out of range oh my god oh so bad not worth it i don't know i don't really feel like i have a choice all right pray this 10 accuracy debuff doesn't bone us i have to hit every shot boy oh boy oh boy cars line of sight pp my poo poo all right you got three attacks in you kill kill kill then you need to back it on up girl i'm trying to see the archers shouldn't be able to break your armor i don't think yeah i think you're fine so just have to make sure he's not going to get hit by anybody so he's kind of just got to dip over here all right much for the no city panic man as long as i get a gift but i don't think i do if it goes past this one the gift would be a game changer i don't even go about this i have to hope i stun almost all these well when in rome we stunned everybody that's cannot understand just how big that is i'll leave the archer to hit this thing because i gotta go over here kill this uh oh wait thing execute this dude first come back swipe and then kill come over here jump over that and you've got some actions left so we'll kill you hopefully don't miss pog how much damage two shots should kill this dude is that what i want to do sure okay it won't kill you know that's hard at least we still got our ballista oh fudge yeah it went past the first estimation mark go wait what did they just do 162. oh that was the the ballistic wait no i don't know are walls now the end hasn't been hit the house did get hit the end hasn't been hit the gold mine hasn't been hit okay save the city not to mention after this though to my guys what no man i'm going to have to make the manuscript thing uh julie chef nice kill good kill captain take the shot take the bloody shot ah we didn't hire all kill you we'll probably take everything but kill you uh i am able to punch you might be like ah he won't oh but i will 39 to 50. i just think maybe if i do you have no you would have to use a man anyway okay well then yeah uh i don't want you flirt with the the debut somebody's gonna have you sitting over here should i maybe i should go help yeah i'm going to go back to try and help them and then you just chill out my dude show right there um i mean i feel like we kind of got it under control now but we'll see about that moving that this far i guess wasn't necessary wasn't it okay i got one more stun in me so let's hope we pop off again yeah we either killed okay so he's the only one that lived that's fine with me dc is fine schweip let's pick off people not um stunned out of range are you you kidding me how much movement do you have that's all i got okay if i come here okay pog what about there high roll one health well i will be able to you know you know what i'm talking about i can um i'm just trying to come back fatality right whatever um so the dodger might be the only one that can hit me i think i'll be okay i think we did it we still got one panic though if i'd been able to get through it without a panic that would have been nice but but alas it was not meant to be easy clappers all right let's just leave two left which is what you're dealing with so i've come to aid we did we beat night six level seven oh there we go let's go we lost a lot of hp almost exclusive we would have literally lost like no hp if i wasn't just at one flaw otherwise pretty clean all things considered please tell me i get a gift i don't think i get it it's a lot of materials and gold but i need free things man that's a lot of essence here has 20 less health remaining on the edge well that was not on purpose let me tell you all right we got to push back to the darkness yet again oh give me all of the things oh i've unlocked so many things materials materials gold gold gold gold gold almost 400 gold let's freaking get it and this will make it so that future runs will now have extra mana pog that means next run everyone will have six action points and plus ten total mana don't mind if i do i don't like anything new the watchtower granting vision to heroes atop it bro all i'd have to do is put my archers in the watchtowers or the catapults which one do i do should i wait on those i don't know should i get like more of this stuff first no maybe this is the play huh do like hand crossbows but see like maybe i should do yeah better change to get uncommon i mean i can literally unlock this whole thing so all right i'll save the rest for now what prowess did i get i think it's the level seven heroes right yep additional positive background traits during the generation heroes pog we did it all right well we just got a lot to do right now don't we right now so exciting i never thought we'd make it this far you need your physical damage but i think i'm gonna raise your crit that puts you at 27 pretty good accuracy does melee even i mean i guess you could dodge melee right should i worry about that though i don't know that's a little too good to pass up oh shoot now we get tier four okay when there's no other hero within 10 tiles of distance plus 10 damage i just throw her on her own side to the wayside when attacking a badly wounded enemy adds the effects of armor-piercing and no dodge oh shoot you're just guaranteed the kill disables the second weapon set in exchange for plus 20 damage and plus one use per turn on every skill provided by your remaining weapon set i mean she has yet to even have a second weapon when the hero has three less move points remaining attacking with a melee range skill added effects plus 10 damage armor piercing no block and plus 20 armor okay i think we're about to i don't even think that's a question 500 critical when attacking enemy with full health wait that's good too she would one out of 50 work one out of 50. practically one out of two chance to crit at that point each enemy attacking a melee gets poisoned landing a critical hit regenerates mana or minus one move points to get another bag and usable item yeah i think we go relentless first blood's really good too but dan's specialist but well this is just so good it's very good i guess specialist isn't bad too but if you live to level up i'll give you that okay deal all right birdie we need to get you some better stuff man and these uh this ain't it let me tell you re-roll that's okay we'll take the magic damage daily mana regen yeah i guess yeah all right perks what are those sounded good for [Music] mage um we could disable your second weapon set but i don't think we want to i think attacking a bagley wounded is really good we'll go with that that way we don't have to leave that the chance uh extra range damage very nice and accuracy i could roll to get try and get a better one but now we're just gonna take that as is extra critical would make it a one out of five chance not terrible specialist again not terrible just because i don't have any other stuff for them but i almost think she should go hit man too it just happens so often yeah i'm going to because if someone's badly injured and we miss it's always devastating because we've always you usually account for them to die and then when they don't you're like oh jesus uh none of this is really good for you um gamba sure we'll take the range damage extra isolated damage you do do isolated damage but that usually comes down to the end of the waves usually because that's when people aren't bunched up and then at that point um but then again i know i can't re-roll these like between the reliability or the isolated i'm just gonna take isolated perks we can't get you the tier four yet maybe first man consuming skill costs minus one that's pretty nice then we could use snipe shot without having to worry about the cost or we could arctic blast every turn at least once for free oh free wild except you okay now though i'm thinking we upgrade and get another hero how many we're still only getting hit by two sides see i'm afraid later on it's gonna be three or four like i assume as the night goes you'll get to the point where oh wait a second one two three four oh i wasn't wrong adding a mage decreases the turn so if we added a fourth it costs like five thousand tainted essence but then we only have to survive nine nights if i'm seeing that correctly that's a game changer oh okay well maybe we'll do that okay thanks so much for this information sear that's really gonna help i i do think we go with another hero that'll be most of our gold this turn though because the hero and that will probably be about 400 gold so we'd have to use workers for the rest i could upgrade gold production effect but this turn let's see that'd be an extra 30 so we get 60. so it only cost us 140 gold this turn best a lot of gold trying to think if we get that back we'll play decisions decisions okay well i'm gonna first off just propel fog we're doing that no doubt about it hmm and i think i'm going to upgrade that i did it but then that's 105 110 gold right there let me upgrade this extra hero capacity so then let me see what we're working with here wise 135 gold it is level 6 though comes with mana manor region experience game less magic damage and dodge 20 experience game and they come with a bow which isn't bad or we get a level five with a spear extra physical damage resistance extra magic damage extra poison damage but less health i know xana looks pretty good to me am i wrong i mean another melee wouldn't be bad to have on both sides and to be fair let me see buy some new gear oh shoot wait i should probably buy this so that that would be nice and having a tome of secrets ooh if we could get both of these and give it to them but see that's a lot of gold i don't know if i got that much gold um okay let me just use workers first marker worker worker and then i have one extra so might as well right everybody says it appears to be even still okay i have one extra worker to work with right now so it doesn't matter too much to me okay so that puts us at 149 gold it's enough to buy zayna but then we can't buy anything else but maybe we don't need to having another archer right now might not be the worst thing it's just that if i went like laurentia instead that would leave us with 29 gold i did my math rank and that would give us either a wand or tone of secrets which is both very nice because if we go to birdie that increases our base damage overall by 30 okay that actually doesn't do much it does give us crit power though but then this one could be good it gives us better daily mana regen but then it also gives us something to swap to which could be big a little propagation propagate 11 times granted it's three mana two action points but i almost think we would do that those are some nice paints just can't afford them so she comes out of the gate with 30 experience gained extra that's crazy uh it's it is a good build it's gonna be like a druid staff i guess i'm being greedy like i don't need to get the highest level it just makes things a lot easier out of the gate [Music] i think unlocking the spear and then getting the weapon is to play but man would this also be good oh yellow we're going with the spear i'm doing it hello friend um and then i'm gonna do that so i can buy the tomo secrets go to birdie there you go friend now you've got another another set if you want to use it i think that was i think that was the right play i don't know um we're not making you range damage although you're really trying to make me apparently we're just gonna go save and get another move point your melee so that's nice extra physical damage don't mind if i do um gamba extra physical damage don't mind if i do extra physical damage again girl you finna make me act up how many more times can i go i don't know um [Music] yeah why not four more times okay do you use momentum at all that one does that worth it right reliability isn't bad gamba eight percent damage increase we like that better accuracy uh let's do that two more uh gamba extra damage or extra health regen [Music] oh wait fudge i was supposed to buy the mana well wasn't i oh mr fruit you've done messed up i'm gonna get taylor managing um gamba skill range i don't think you have any modifiable ones we'll just increase accuracy dang it all right let's give you i want to give you fatality at this point getting someone under 15 is a feat in itself what's your health regen okay you would get like four armor that's garbage extra chains for regenerating mood paints for each enemy damage during an attack that could be good because almost all the spear things are multiple targets except for skewer i never even used that one before but like this nine targets three minute little good one it's just hard to account for that i'll just go fatality it's good does any of these come with stun chains no all right we're just gonna give you back protection what else do i want to give you i guess increased xp screw it you get one more perk point uh thrifty's not bad dead eye i don't know i don't think you even have armor penalty yet nope well at full health extra liability but how long would that last that would make it at least 90 to 100 but we'll go with thrifty drifty's just too good man the skewer now free yeah why not all right we have a decent amount of building materials god knows we need them because there's we have no walls and they've destroyed our ballista which sucks that was probably the biggest hit we took and i can't believe i forgot to do the mana thing so that one's on me let's build some differences um i'm gonna go with the ones that don't need vision for now because we're poor at the very least i'll put one right here we're gonna have to like move around it though now don't we okay one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14. so we could put reinforced wooden walls everywhere but that would be everything there also wouldn't be gates okay so let's put a gate there we have two melee people now so gate there and [Music] the gate there then we'll put obviously like all these are so weak too i don't know this side will put all reinforced and then this side the very least every other thing not screw it we'll do it like that uh sir you need to move okay so then how much would it be to repair 11 this whole wall looking great though i can just upgrade this it's still on fire what's his health at 36. did that change his health maybe he didn't or maybe that wasn't the best but whatever we have another ballista i probably should have scooted it back i wish there was like a move or undo there's not oh you can just upgrade it to a mounted ballista whenever you want for oh for the same amount oh well that's good that's good to know ah yeah yeah i think that's as good as it's gonna get right yellow all right we'll put one melee here and the other melee here let's see this side has two blisters this side is one uh this seems to have bigger range although i kind of like to keep you here i think because like this gives you like whole overlay of the land so we can do that there botch i didn't heal you either so you're gonna stay wounded so we have five heroes but it's the it's the accuracy that really is the most annoying thing like the movement points is whatever you weren't that mobile in the first place but i think we're going to go like this and hope it's enough remember you what uh we'll just do it on everybody pretty cool yourself girl armor armor dodge dodge now you should be fine unless runner comes but because of the perk too you're also sitting on 130 armor so and i think if we put you over here because of the trees and stuff i don't think anyone can hit you here we go they didn't even reach us look at that oh what are those things oh my god i don't have things over there on the oh jesus all right well new enemy type you know screw me the armor's holding so that's nice they're already hitting i even pushed the darkness back now they're buffing each other way whoa this isn't wait did you just like consume it what the extra movement for 99 turns and 15 percent yeah they feast on weaker members of the horde to satisfy their thirst what feast they eat smaller allies to gain strength what jesus and they move all my rippers rippers can suck my poo poo and pee pee jesus stun resistance 90 armor 340 health holy suck i don't i don't know i really don't um a doozy isn't it okay how much damage would we do to this a lot but it would still take a two shot sweet moses so what do you want to do there's even more rippers over there oh sweet mouse's lord and heaven above i don't know i'm i'm having like choice paralysis because lightning strike isn't bad we have to be careful about how we decide to use this though if i swap i might just have to do the multi-hits for now i'm gonna do this so i gotta be able to hit one of these dudes sweet moses requires my side questions can suck my pp while you're on it i can't reach him so this does 72-97 this is 77 122. okay so this is just better that's nice we can also propagate and debuff people's two action points though well now you're just asking for far too much we can do this for free is it worth it though why not wait okay [Music] i really want to do this to go like this oh wait i can execute you for free certainly one way we can go about it this takes two action points too so i can skewer for free pierce his armor oh that's nice i need to remember that so if we got a big armor dude it'll take two action points but we can essentially do upwards to 222 damage straight to health don't have to worry about armor oh there's just too many freaking things to shoot and do and god i gotta do this again okay we killed that though that's pug i've got a high roll on this thing now oh suck we did but good lord i'm just gonna let this propagate three mana though to start i don't know if i can afford that not in this economy and then these things are gonna hit my walls for eight bajillion damage it would take all my action points to kill one of these things sweet jesus hold on now what if i go over here is it any better no no i might have to do that though how much it leaves you with two so we could at least back up against the wall and get some armor yeah no i mean that might be what we have to do let's see this does 77 and 98 wait do they resist freaking they do resist of course they do all right i have to use all this on him oh my god i have to execute him if i want to stop him all right well i gotta back up against the wall and that didn't go as well as i'd hoped christ's line of sight you sir there we go boy i need guaranteed kills and there's like none of them this guy's gonna hurt oh oh wait fudge oh i think we lose or at least we're gonna lose lauren tia this guy's gonna do 78-104 and that's gonna be not nearly as much but holy i have to kill him yeah i have to because otherwise uh lauren tia gets absolutely pooped on and she's still mined jesus man oh there's too many fights on too many fronts i tell you what and i can't see anything because of the stupid tree in the way here's the plan uh do i really have one i have to kill these rippers man there's too many of these rippers are not to be trifled with they don't they do have stun resistance an actual freaking penis that's what they have yeah they have an extra penis i know because if i go here one two assuming i'm able to kill him three four i have one extra move a lot of ifs here yeah i don't kill him i'd have to crit we didn't crit well huh did what i could now i must scurry back behind the wall i'm gonna just try and kill some pretty good dodge chains he's got there though i could snipe him i think we go that okay he can still hit the wall though please hit pog um but now what i can snipe somebody else but here's the thing i'll only pass through some of the armor and the other problem is i have to watch for this side too because you're the only one going to be holding this forward down and if they just start showing up a little too quick not a lot i can do all right we're just gonna try and kill this guy all right buys us a little bit of time uh stop you so that the ballista will hit something else and hopefully kill the runner nine health that's all i can do oh it's getting d d seattle oh my god our wall is gonna get boned or just and then there's the hole in the wall and then the freaking didn't do anything oh well that went terribly see at that point should i just i don't know i like melee weapons but they kind of they put you at such a without as much movement speed as supriya 2 it's really difficult but like was it worth buying the fifth hero there or should i just invested in the four i had and made them stronger you know and then waited and like healed and man i don't know i guess it's a tough call no real right answer yeah at this point practically you guys are holding off different armies by yourselves the fudge are these rippers man could you just i don't know die you're the worst i don't know i'm all out of mana i don't know if it's worth hitting nothing oh my god he consumed again for another 15 he can just keep stacking that oh my god he did the same thing fudge uh how how far is this thing moving pretty much whatever it wants i have to high roll on that right should i help you or should i take care of some of this kill the archer hopefully pog kill you fog kill you requires my sight budge there we go hurt you uh hurt you again dodged um that sucks uh i'm like not even breaking armor on some of these people so yeah just try and kill him there we go oh stay over there farm the mana or whatever yeah what does it matter oh geez all right well if this isn't a good time to propagate i don't know when would so propagate away my friend it's pretty good not quite good enough but pretty good fire away i don't know i have to kill this thing i'm gonna take two hits that's gonna take this will take my last fudge this dude's gonna be right on top of me again good low you can propagate a debuff i guess [Music] or i can multi hit here might be your best play we got two kills almost three oh and i was like oh i have another hero all right no she's dead and that's not my friend you're not my friend uh i hate you oh so much the ballista will kill him whatever i roll no okay wait oh my god i thought you would hit the wall not oh my god you're dead well this is how it ends huh sansa guns man and the lord said dicketh on you and they did all right well then we're just going out with the bang propagate away just kill as much as we can for prowess maybe i don't know i don't know how that works you're the last one in that stand or just stand on that side don't back down this thing refuses to die oh my god you know what screw you in particular oh bye uh there's a guarantee one shot there's a guarantee more shot and then there's so many of them all right i did my best ah oh one here didn't move was it you was it you no you moved it was you fight forever friend lord i got on wasn't even fair finally made night six i'm like ha night seven bring it and it did oh it did very well oh farewell knightsburg 80 million as to how anyone is still alive is nothing short of a miracle minty let's get you're out of my line of sight oh i can get you nope you're out of my sight now well well well well well well done soldier now walk into the embrace of death you'll die together good lord man oh no man seriously every night it's just so like what the is this we're not even done seeing him spawn by the way yeah losing that other hair didn't matter i don't think we survived this night i got to reapproach my strategy again i think we're onto something with the gold though i i think we're making some headway there i need to remember what i upgraded because it was kind of like perfectly calculated for a while [Music] um just kill people far away no hyrule lookers you're out of stuff wait are you the last one oh you are ready 120 monsters left oh we just saw him stop spawning great great good lord man [Music] back to the drawing board huh i don't have any more heroes all your heroes are dead at least the wizards get to live spoilers they die but they don't have to see that drive seven days and four and a half hours it didn't take me that long must be some afk and stuff i don't know barge i have like nothing to spend here chief yeah i have 298 okay i'll just wait on that i have any prowesses to unlock i don't think so no have a hero reach 400 now lost over here reach 12 and move points we got close-ish deal 500 range damage just single hit we didn't get that drive tonight at or under level zero of city panic four out of five times we're close to that we should get that next round items offered as a reward for the city panic have plus 15 chance to be rare that's nice euros with magic weapons are generated with a plus few magic damage ever here reach 50 in magic damage oh i've even got someone half the jesus what i haven't gotten anyone near any of that whoa sheesh right lakeberg seven i think um like i said i rerolled a couple times so i think it kind of expedited the number of lake bergs but that means we're coming back at it again i think what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna play a run or two on my own to specifically maybe get some of the prowesses focus on that like literally just roll somebody for exclusively move points or something um mess around to just get some tainted essence get some more upgrades and then come back at it in a run or two just because this is fun i mean literally that's why it's like i almost want to do that so i can play a little bit more so i don't have to always be recording it and also i think it's going to still take a decent amount of runs before we beat it if we want to beat it i definitely think one of the things we need to get immediately to is the more wizards because that takes off three more days we have to survive so if i actually want to complete it that's what i should be working towards um but i just freaking love this game man and so i just don't want this the first city of this let's play take like 20 episodes which is what it's looking like it's gonna do um maybe after we beat the first city we'll see how the let's play is doing maybe i'll just call it there i don't know how many cities there are it's taking me this long to kill a first one so lord have mercy but god it's so good i love it i don't regret anything so i'll probably see you in the next episode and from that episode we'll have done a run or two i'll update you guys then so with that sound thank you much for watching have yourselves a fantastic day i'll talk to you in the next one [Music] farewell [Music] you
