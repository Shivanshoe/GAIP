hi 81 my name's mr. fruit and welcome to rogue company hi-rez studios newest game it's a third-person Jack tackle shooter and that's how I guess I'd explain it seems like valerie and csgo had a baby there are different rogues which are essentially different characters with special abilities we're gonna play strike out this one is a respawn based game mode however it appears the core game mode is very similar to most competitive shooters essentially their own Search and Destroy oh it's go time welcome to Factory I'm selecting ronan is he played her in the tutorial so it's all not to do oh look at this phantom Dallas Deema open shop oh shoot this is oh god ok um let's try yeah I'll buy an 8k and I can buy perks here don't ask questions you jump and use a wingsuit because what other way could you enter the match you gotta enter with style and that's exactly what we plan on doing so it's interesting to see this from high-res it seems like everybody's going for some sort of tactical shooter - these days oh look at that damage you know what I'm pushing this I'm pushing this why wouldn't I like it it might be a tactical shooter but I'm mr. Rick ok ok I regret everything he's pushing me yeah ok can I flank no I have no idea this map works here we go oh we got a kill and I got him in a death hole we chase a ball team deep where are you God but it looks like your team has respawn so it looks like we have 10 left now I'm gonna get my explosive knife essentially I throw this on a wall and it's like a proximity okay I'm just going down you nice roll me oh my god I lived long enough for my team that saved me I'm just creeping up here oh oh ok not really sure what what was going there I'm an Avenger oh and I got somebody down oh I see this guy poke up poke up yeah you didn't see that coming did you oh Jesus I need to get his friend ha what role oh no I'm the worst I am unable to buy so maybe I have to do that in between rounds alright can I jump over this oh I can can I jump over this I can't okay here comes the Omega flank I'm spending like a couple years doing this oh yeah break the glass we're not here to be quiet evidently I mean I would have liked to but okay down yeah they're like oh shoot we're getting flanked yeah you are they're on the point but not for long he's literally one shot you gotta you gotta not school there's another one go go go let's go double down three streak kill leader and just like that that's a four streak that's a four piece there's only a demon left they never activated my knife here what the hex oh I found a bra off of respawn let's go of the bag all right let's buy so I can actually upgrade all this I'm gonna get grenade and how about my secondary that looks pretty good to me I don't know how the abilities work like the the grenade for instance I don't know if I get one alive if it's it's probably on the cooldown just like mother ability it appears we've swapped sides and I'm terrified wait a second I'll wait buying this replace my a cape I didn't want to do that why would I why would I pay hey could you get oh my god what a hero thanks all right let's try this

that sure let's go ahead and land in here alpha Bravo Charlie Delta I don't know what squad we are but we're the best I debated going for the immediate flank but if that's the first play is it really a flanker check this out though omegas brain with my little knife throw check the corners you're weak oh you're so weak oh my god I made it myself oh my god that we're getting flanked we're getting flagged I'm gonna flank the flankers give me a second yeah they won't see this coming it's a bit of a long con okay wait wait did you guys already kill them oh but I'm oh no you didn't okay okay it

personal and eliminations first downs first damage del first it's just what I do who the father lass we're gonna play Dallas because I get to reveal the closest enemy for a short duration this means I get an ape even more I will say though I'm impressed by their multi-platform launch and with it being on the switch okay what do we start off with what is this a DMR this seems trickier let's do it hey wait for me guys I'm coming I should probably get used to how this thing works huh all right I know exact what I'm doing let's do this feels like a lever-action rifle and I love those alright I'm gonna oh Jesus he 100% sees me oh I got a headshot though oh you know what I'm doing I'm chasing with my revolver I revealed him I know exactly where he is but so does his teammates let's go my little revolver that cool it oh my let's go team okay thank you for the backup I I went way to ham I see you say hello to my little lever action rifle huh you like that I do it's it's actually really fun let me reveal the nearest enemy oh there you are and if you're the nearest enemy then I've got you fudge oh no I don't know I remember this is a third person which means I got to watch my corners cuz people can easily peek around there I'm going slow and quiet there we go wasn't pretty oh my god I'm not the little revolver play though all right let me use my little mole flick boom your one shot you're dead let's go there's another kill there's oh you're nuts let's go yo this little pistol this little revolver Dallas is mom boy are we spawn camping these guys let don't mind if I do I thought you've never asked okay I'm actually almost had a mother what do I do oh what a headshot oh oh let's go oh wait a second the enemy's on me yeah but we're just rolling up and I've got a little revolver and this dude ain't got nothing I'm gonna melee him no I won't actually yeah this this is incredible I'm having so much fun they're on the point yeah dude yeah this revolver kind of low-key meta and it's free I could just only use that I guess I feel bad we did kind of blow them off their spawn so we'll see if they repay the favor I'm gonna go the super back alleyway no one ever went this way I'm going I'm going like through their spawn I'm going a whole like Omega oh I see him too but the best part is he didn't see me okay I'm just bad oh there's the headshot all right let me reload I didn't realize it's one by one no wonder that was more difficulty to be alright let me snap my fingers where's the closest enemy oh ma I found Tim right next to me oh my god I'm behind them all how did you know how did you know oh ah feels bad yeah got a little ahead of ourselves there that one's on me honestly though I might kind of made for this yeah this DMR is nice with it oh yeah there's a kill easy peasy I'm running up oh my god that headshot though bro Dallas is BAE they're already out of lives let me Oh let me I was gonna say let me do my little flick oh that's embarrassing lot of Binga but a puma I mean let me get your resume get to rest you're fine you're fine get up Ronan and we won again no I'm not gonna lie is actually a lot of fun and I'm not a huge 3rd person shooter person ok

you come on try me they don't know that I'm right here they don't know that I'm a BK and I'm chasing they don't know that I can't hit my shot school but I did it's just in the nick of time Oh ready for this and the headshot j.crew snap the fingers again Bop you're dead go ahead and finish you off oh no I was stood II don't doubt Wow oh I'm gonna pull out the revolver because I can skirt Boosh Boosh you think you stand up to my revolver no Old Faithful and they have no more reinforcements we've got the crossfire uh-huh I got you buddy Oh swapped it Brown is this is this like Emma am I going pro eliminations first downs first revives first sitting on the top of the scoreboard all right I'm gonna say it I'm pleasantly surprised with this game the videos and stuff I'd seen albeit not many it seemed a little generic and to be fair it doesn't do anything super special but what it does do it just feels right it feels nice and tight you know I don't know I'm gonna I'm gonna have to keep my eye on display.this occasionally let me know if you guys want to see more on the channel though or if there's some specific rogue agents you'd like to see and with that said I want to think all too
