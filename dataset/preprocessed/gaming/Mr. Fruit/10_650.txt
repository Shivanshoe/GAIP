hi 81 my name's mr. fruit and welcome to this really short update video I just wanted to put on the channel to let something for you guys know what the heck is going on because the last two days there were no uploads on the main channel and if you've been on the channel for a while you know that just doesn't happen like not on not an upload on one day as one thing but certainly not two days in a row Wow tell you flush going on I am exhausted like physically exhausted not so much like mentally I guess but I have been struggling last couple weeks especially the past couple days - I know like physically it almost feels like when I had mono but I don't couple that with for instance like what's going on in the YouTube right now where it's really record lows I can do the same amount of work right now for like seventy five percent pay cut and then on top of that just not a lot of content to work with on the channel I'm not sure I mean there are some games I'm enjoying and I briefly mentioned it in today's destiny - video like I've been grind in teamfight tactics just hit diamond and ranked which was a gold mine and I'm super happy super proud if there's that there's legends of runeterra also a ride game it's their card game for League of Legends been enjoying that I've been grind in Minecraft mainly moreso on the stream because it's hard to make a lot of that into a video plus like part one did pretty well of the hardcore it's like okay cool part two which is a bit of a bummer but I'll at least get one more app maybe try and get two at the very least I'll continue it over on the stream did a lot of app stuff so if you want to watch that there's a link down in the description box below to watch me when I livestream that's been really fun it's this nice in-between of like relaxing engaging but it's peaceful and it feels productive oddly enough I don't know like I'm making something if you've heard about it I like to feel like I'm productive I like to feel like I'm working towards something and in that game it's I am I mean it's very clear to know what I'm working towards see I don't know like put those all together and it just I don't know I'm trying but I'm struggling I just think it's a good case shove the old oppression getting to me do my best it's been pretty overall me especially since so quarantine thing I've been trying to like bring up mind like self coping mechanisms and they've been working and not working good in some ways bad in some ways just know I'm trying but I'm always sticking around if there's something going on usually I'll tweet about it but I also don't like to seem like I'm making excuses and stuff but the point in this video wasn't for you to like I don't want your pity or something I'm just simply updating you guys I'm trying there's still uploads on the second channel we've got a let's play going on there so we technically been double up putting just been on the second channel check those out if you want it's a really fun series good having fun with that and then we've been streaming as well so there has been content just not also necessarily on this main channel oh and also the podcast no episode today obviously we're taking a weekend break because we're gonna pick up next week so that audio listeners are caught up because the studio is not posting audio on Thursday so what we're gonna try and do is have the audio up a couple days before the video but that way things are aligned a little bit more and it works more when we have sponsors and stuff so podcast will be back next week and if you're not that's not going anywhere just weekend break and that's really all I wanted up to update you to have a bath I'm literally so tired I'm like stumbling over my words it's one I just want to lie around and do nothing all the time so that's what's good I hope you're all doing well though staying safe wash your hands I know some stuffs starting to slowly be lifted but don't get you baited be careful stay safe call so when you love today tell them you love them and appreciate it doesn't matter who it is just do that have a great day I'll talk to you guys in the next one farewell
