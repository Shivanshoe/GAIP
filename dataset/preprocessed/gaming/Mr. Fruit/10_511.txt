an electrical i ran away from him because he was getting me scared then i went to the middle doing the little uh caterpillar task whatever that thing is called we like lead the light to like the end and stuff and then i went to the vitals because i have two tasks there and i saw the body i'm like whoa there's a dead body there and i want to see who was trying to run away from that dead body and then i saw you come in and then i freaked out i'm like oh well gotta report this body before dada blames me which you are that's kind of weird so we you're both trusted you're both af right now yeah wait dada what was your pob my pov was i walked into the office i saw shark trying to leave the office and then he immediately hit a fat 180 and inspected the body because i was looking [Applause] they saw a body but not the kill i know it looks us oh but i'm trying to like see who was running away from the body but datto ran into the body you know i'm saying like yeah i don't know i don't want to tell you it's not that it's not that um by the way it is not that it's me a little bit earlier by the way i wanted to keep the information i wanted him to spill more by the way three seconds by the way all right well good news is that that puts me in the clear turns out you know tech in against other people does the job oh i didn't even realize blue's my boy attaboy can we double kill in here nah there's too many people i want to but i can my body's telling me no or something or [Music] oh blue vented that's big that's big i'm gonna go fix lights i was close that was close you know if i was imposter that would have been a hell of a case let me tell you something let me tell you something if i was imposter that would have been pog champ but you know what i have some sort of immunity and i get to finish my task as a free man okay what kind of call was that mr fruit blood thirsty fruit all of that i'm gonna sit on cams here with blue i do want okay oh no never mind uh yes i was just about to say i do want to revisit the shark thing and he's dead no i guess it's not him oh yeah wait he was my number one suss yeah personally because i was going yeah okay why did you say focus on bryce what happened you would be wouldn't he for your friend wait a minute fruit fruit was in medical just now no walking away i just did a lights without fruit did lights yeah did lights yeah he walked during lights i saw him walk out of med i didn't know that is on the other side of the map exactly there's a vent there exactly but here's the thing right i saw him walking out from the area where i found bryce's body so either well it's funny let me tell you you're the last one can anyone corroborate this let me talk so either fruit did it or this was the swiftest vent kill of all time because that report button did not pop out when i went back it went into decontamination but when lights came back on i'm like oh yo maybe someone did something in med while lights were off i come back that bryce's body is over the freaking in the in the toilet it's in the freaking toilet i mean fruit was literally on the panel yeah all right yeah but here's the other thing i want to point out arios went up to the temperature thing and was only on it for like three seconds because you can press and hold it and it goes and then it goes to that number that fast i've gotten some pretty quick ones i have gotten ones that are only like here's what i'm saying 20 temps but for 20 degrees i didn't even know shark was med bay how did you know he was med bay yeah no not sure i'm talking about bryce you were you were yelling that i killed shark yeah you were actually i was talking about bryce but you said shark your story's not adding up right oh my god that is weird he literally said he was blaming me for shark he was like you saw a shark or whatever didn't you i was like what all right it's just going to take a little while i'm going to pew pew asteroids for a while because it can never take too long all right i'ma do asteroids or not no i did asteroids now i'm going to go to the seismic data's going to the right or the left i know my directions i'm going to do right alm is up there sonic is up there all right it's all all well and clear for now but now i have to do the light soon got it what is ohm doing over here he's just standing there menacingly i'm acting real weird oh he's alive all right see i'll fix it um know that i went to go see him i'll play it off that i was worried oh no i i literally just scared the crap out of me you what okay i don't think it's sammy anymore i don't care i wanna i to point out something that was interesting so i went and did i i did the the upper right tower put my hand on it i'm leaving fruit's walking with me i'm like oh he could have killed me but he never goes to check for a body so i'm like huh so i go up to the left tower you know just to make sure that nobody left somebody up there come back down i'm like oh man look at this beautiful view i can see inside this building now fruit was doing he was going from one panel to the other and i'm i just i never do this but i was looking at the bar and i didn't see anything change that's because it was download it doesn't change until you upload are you sure yeah because i made that mistake once with dork when you fill up the gas for instance i thought it was dork it's like the bar didn't move that's but it's only until you fill up that's a good defense and then i'll have you know i saw you at the window we were dancing and then the lights went off so i thought one you were either turned off the lights to kill me or someone's gonna kill you i went over and i fixed the lights okay and you press the button on me all right so then i i trust for it then ladies and gentlemen we got him either he lied to me i don't know he doesn't really like this we did dance i could confirm we were dancing through the window dork what did you say as soon as i left uh i saw datto on the reactor but he they were done the last person i saw was fruit no well here's the thing data was on left reactor wasn't he yeah he was on the left i'm concerned that there's a killer so fruit since i trust you i think we should vote you call the vote don't do this to me what fruit come on we have 10 seconds guys someone sonic tried to pin me that's all i got it's not me yeah no it's you it's a hundred percent you guys told me to take the shot are we voting for we got to take a shot that's a good job guys yeah take a shot thank you yeah yeah dude really yeah you say that when you vote me good job god blame fruit victory he's like hey put your finger at somebody and then i point my finger to somebody and they blame him like really man come on all right so i'm gonna go to communications to upload because he's gonna be waiting to see if i upload and here's the thing i'm not going to i'm going to run past home next time i'm sorry i wasn't lying about the downloading the progress bar does not move when you download i did not like that no i'm done oh my god i knew it he walked away there's no thank you i knew thanks for giving us a free kill but i know i like how home goes but choose one and i choose one he goes he immediately chose me and that wasn't such enough yeah good job at that point sammy was our biggest threat and oh we just like pick one and we're all right well every single time i have it and you danced with me too i know i'm sorry i've had one of those rounds where i was like blue i trust you wholeheartedly and then he just stabs me around the
