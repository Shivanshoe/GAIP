what y'all can watch this ready that is things are possible uh oh some pagans whoa i'm gonna win my first battle guys oh they're friendly oh that's nice darkest dungeon is about getting pooped on you are not expected to succeed ever take heart relent don't press forward redemption will not come perfect sure you can have all my private information never never played these kind of games ever never i've heard so much great things about darkest dungeon the first one even watch documentaries and stuff but i just never made it more like five minutes it's very punishing and i'm always like i'll you know i'll dedicate more time and sit down to do this another time uh and here i am and the sequel's released so yeah i just know i'm gonna get pooped on shut up i can't hear anything don't you shut up ruin has found you at last by protege my friend our calculations were correct the world is a wasteland of failures past take this it is hope the very last of it be bold once more free yourself from this suffocating stillness fix your gaze on the horizon and face the fearsome truth of the darkest dungeon what about the brightest dungeon can we go there if this is the darkest then we must know what the brightest is right you have cowered in your crumbling denial long enough whoa i get to drive a stage coach she's oh look at me go oh my god wait what is it what the [ __ ] where lost souls hope to find their way hmm do i want to go to guilt loathing failure regret or disgrace i'm thinking regret ah oh i like the new graphics keeps the same one but like nicer you know does that make sense we have the plague doctor who you want me kill rank whatever that means wait what does that mean i don't think they're right something about where i can put them in my lineup i think so he's best placed in the third slot duh then we have the grave okay yeah what what the fudge is this four heroes blah blah blah yep stagecoach uh-huh driving press to uh double tap uh click and drag here portraits to send you a party four here is it here in the right most position rush it'll be first in combat line okay i got that much okay so you should go here the grave robot can go really just about anywhere angel gracefully singularity surreptitus surreptitious whatever uh sunny disposition unwaveringly positive that's good uh you're blood thirsty which means uh those stats modified by blood if if if turns start other things okay i don't know what that means the highwaymen dismiss extra speed 33 chance food has no benefit unlucky uh the man at arms barristan combat start pull three something something blah blah uh fear of cadavers something okay they say you're not even the best in the front well it doesn't matter too bad you're in the front okay i guess technically you're our best back line okay we're gonna put highwaymen second and then uh the great robber which leaves us we can get helyan runaway jester leper and occultist uh if we ever level up what does this do what's that do oh your abilities wait what what'd i do what oh i ran audrey no okay whatever now you're raskopf pond cardon sure that's your new name i'm ready no i'm not the valley the shadow of death seems pretty purposeful to me holy water negate token of something pouch of lie dartboard gold currency okay how do i pull up my character do i click them oh there we go uh vague trinket extra blood resistance okay i don't think he wants to have bleed so it makes sense to give him that right is this like already activated all right i'm not scared you're scared i like how it's the 3d map thing kind of like slay the spy or something oh my god this this steering what the fudge is this is like impossible uh oh some pagans i don't encounter such as this one heroes will voice opinions on a course of action you must choose one of their wishes all right i'll help you guys what's up abandoned or forgotten it is ours now we got uh some slime mold restores hp and diseases resist oh no we're more likely to get disease that makes sense well thanks i guess good luck in your affairs to come you're doomed yeah that is things are possible why can't i just sit in the back and look pretty they just had to make me steer it welcomes you wait i want to go back i want to return uh oh something's blocking the way you see even your valley is not immune oh no no i'm gonna win my first battle guys if i don't that'd be pretty sad i assume we're up against the lost soul lost soul and a widow uh oh my okay this is a lot okay what's okay so bergstrom is going first okay so this does four to seven damage tim chance to crit and it ignores armor or block and block normally takes minus 50 damage to the next hit but we don't have to worry about that we could throw our dagger doing so is ranged meaning we can hit the back three to five damage 15 is better chance to crate ignores guarded whatever that means ignores ignores wins why can't i see the okay what the [ __ ] uh what am i looking for and ignores okay ignores dodge when i'm stealth flashing daggers it's easy simple poison dart targets two and inflicts blight obviously this is all so simple guys i don't know what you're struggling with why don't i see black this is not all the whatever an absinthe wait am i able to drink this i thought she um like abstains from the bottle uh if i'm less than a quarter health though i get a heal 33 i get three dodges and i'll act faster next round okay this is all very simple okay and there's clearly an optimal plate here and i know exactly what it is i kind of like spreading out the damage here but then again starting off immediately with a with some dot damage seems pretty good to me i don't like the widow you resisted it i also thought i got a target two people what the fudge okay clearly that was a lie oh it goes this way in turn order not that condition blocked oh requires i have oh my target to have dodge i see alternatively we could just take aim and then dumpster somebody i'm thinking i just do it on myself okay you don't stand a chance blighted oh my four damage okay so for each stack i think they take the damage that's pretty oh pretty good what is this thing stress one out of ten oh no he's getting stressed calm down buddy it's all gonna be fine uh once i figure out each ability it's gonna be a lot easier but i'm figuring everything out right so i can give somebody uh guarded protected by two is that what that like two damage or pop-up ball so protected by bearish stance so what exactly does that mean dodge [Laughter] what did you do an infinity bar between two heroes becomes fully positive or fairly negative so immediately trigger a new relationship all makes sense how do i see the relationships oh they're friendly oh that's nice oh he loves everybody you're not loved we got to get everybody to start you know knowing and loving each other that's a one shot ah never mind is 13 hell well check this out yeah death blow not bad eh oh i guess they gassing her up or something so this corpse has seven health it can only blind or blight or pump everybody up so why don't i increase my relationship with everybody everybody get some things that's right we're all but oh he's getting fast no he was great wait horror horror is stress every turn well he's been stressed all the time i guess he's been getting attacked hasn't he oh so close and he's stressed out okay all right we only got to deal with the loss well muscle for now okay we can just slicey dicey let's do that in addition hp here is also have stress they begin the expedition at zero but gain stress through a wide variety of game events stress can be loaded various items treatments at the end the hero stretch bar fills up completely that hero will suffer a meltdown meltdowns have several undesirable effects here suffers immediate affinity loss while her hairs and here also drops low hp my man's already like halfway up the bar what the [ __ ] do i do about that okay i think we do the uh double thing again get rid of a corpse gobblers oh is that a crit you saucy dog in the past we learned to face the future i didn't realize if they were just all graves you're good i thought okay oh i can give that somebody for less stress and a trinket giving extra damage never mind if i do first victory don't want to say we destroyed it but we're in the strongest i will give you a holy water wait can we split this what what i tried to split it and it discarded it what all right i didn't need the holy water anyway ah botch we could give you extra damage or how about you some extra damage sure that is so uh pepika stagecoach no upgrades nice excuse me coming through this is certain this is not a city in fact it looks quite obvious i am pooping my pants we would come here and summers of years gone to write think and rest um travelogue dismissing bergstrom become friendly friendly print they reach torch and crown oh my god oh we actually made it select recipient oh everybody healed uh you're a little stressed buddy there you go this takes me back to my dialogue i know ah so i'll give this to two for minus one stress high chance of improving affinity i don't like that but we're going to give that to you and you and i think they're happier i don't know if using these like early or a bad thing or something but restores 10 hp don't even need to do that boom mastery trainer when survival demands it oh he can remove one horror as well as vulnerable i'm gonna upgrade that yellow whatever i mean that's probably a terrible idea what do i know all these are 50 crit when target has combo but i can't apply combo uh wing right i do have an upgrade a new variable in the equation i got that it's like drought okay it's go time i i feel like i would have just can't do the photo because avoid the hospital does that it seems like if i'm just going on a route and i encounter it and even if i immediately leave i didn't avoid it how do you avoid something i mean i don't know yet clearly there's only one way to find out its tendrils of rot and pestilence journey onward yes [Music] wow this is really long what the fudge okay i get it because in the previous one we didn't have a choice but now i see there is a way to avoid it because like hospital avoid hospitals avoid i get enough an assistance encounter giving us flame food and supplies or unknown we could do another assistance afterwards if we do unknown we have to go immediately to unknown let's go assist [Laughter] wait what wait should i not are they getting they're getting stressed what why are you stressed i'm stressed why are you stressed i'll give you that oh is there no way to split things okay well i reckon i should stop running into corpses like see that doesn't look like a corpse it looks like it could yield supplies maybe not perhaps later we can get to drink i'm oh jesus this steering is wild brother ah i'm not even trying at this point the desperate for you i've come to assist you put the goods in the bag gloves we lose flame yo you're trying to freaking rob him i'm down i mean what he wouldn't like that but she would really not like that i guess oh i have to choose hmm huh we only get one item but we get a lot here we lose a lot of flame though which is odd because i thought we gained flame i would get food loot mixed blue tree can chance coach equipment or just relic loot yolo way i didn't like that you can be off once more a lot of slime all garbage playing cards clotting poultice whatever and whittling tools really that's okay well maybe that wasn't great i thought we were getting a lot like where's the trinket where's the coach equipment i guess just chances at all that i screw you guys uh we'll go left road battle let me guess god oh my god what the fudge is this a ghoul he frankly does not look fun he has dodge wait i'm pretty sure you have a thing that if requires target has dodged yes oh but all it does is remove dodge he's only going to have it for one turn um first guy and you're blind it's stupid ah fine everybody gets some resistance in crisis we can rely holy exactly what he empowered by what we gotta take that out screw you ah dazed get destroyed wait oh oh my god wait what the fudge six damage did i just blind him though maybe that's the point and blight will kill you soon so maybe we just guarantee death blow skull toss ah stumbling and stupefied stunned what i feel like i'm getting bound i wish i knew what he could do i can't hit him with my noxious blast i can blind him though what does that do exactly reduces accuracy x amount i assume i don't know 500 chance to miss next attack now we're talking yeah wait he had to dodge what okay i'm gonna knock you back oh my was that a creature go on better starting oh quick why can you drink this please oh but it's only if my hp is less than 25 i'll end up appealing they're just pooping on me dude why aren't they going for freaking or bergstrom whatever the [ __ ] another deathball all right here's what we're gonna do we're gonna take aim ah but he gets dodged back uh fudge man okay i'll just light one of the corpses i guess i don't know speedy they're dead okay but he might dodge this if he does at least he's just the worst oh you know what i should do that cause wait but maybe not i don't know anymore no i'm gonna try and blind again yeah okay i'm thinking he's blinded anyway and you're dead [Music] wait what oh we gotta we gotta like kill kill him booze let's go wait what he's upset i took a death blow get over yourself we gotta shrink it extra fire resistance and some boxing gloves wait i just realized i think i bought these last in and didn't even use them she man what am i doing here what is your problem pericles parodies nuts get over yourself you want to drink it you want some fire resistance i should probably give the bearish i don't know he's in the front all the time i don't know and now you're hungry and tired really we were just vibing dude avoid avoid the things in the road apparently it's bad for everybody what the fudge is that thing the towering feast oh so that was the question mark let's be gone before they know we were here quick tactical retreat we've been spoiled we've been spoiling for this fight okay what everyone else doesn't want to fight him we would we would lose flame and run but they would like that to get to battle i don't care you guys hate that scream for guys flame i'm down to 31. 20 chance of affinity changes the enemies have extra speed extra crit enemy battle advantage chains what the fudge is that the lord plagued eja the maid playgator and the livestock plague slash animal con enemies are forced to attack this target if able oh that's good to know you quit your laughing i think i'm dead frankly what's going to attack first the maid the livestock then this thing he's kind of slow i did we just leave him okay we're good we're gonna blight are we gonna bite we're gonna blight the big guy we're gonna stack blight he resisted it okay okay taunted nothing oh wow that hurt tight what wait he wait did he just switch and buff is that what happened 80. was that is that is it 80 chance to not be blighted is that what he's saying so in other words blight are terrible on these guys and that's all i have okay great how about i don't that's not going to do anything so paracelsus whatever mr whiny paints himself is useless is that what i'm understanding great okay we're getting we're gonna stun this thing booze because it has the it has uh the dazed or no the strength whatever okay we've taken aim like that whatever what is what is this dude steal play doctor more like whiny doctor i'm sick of you all right blinding ain't gonna do it i can give myself dodge and speed and maybe that's the play cause you're gonna probably poop on me now we can make this dude bleed watch out and you're dazed stupid ah what the [ __ ] disappointed dodge he pushed me back you know i think i'm just gonna do it and a crit dude oh my god can i just kick him could i get someone else what is your problem i do anything and my point doctor's like wang what happens if you're in the back what can't you use pick to the face and that's it okay well then i am going to move forward and gotcha it's weird what oh it's because weak applied oh i thought it was only achieved reposted stupid ugh stupid what he eats the grape i thought he was just gonna eat the [Music] yes livestock you're at nine bleed okay how much health you have 18. oh ah oh nice counter attack everybody oh we're blighted and everything hurts it helps if you make the sound effect what is your guys's problem [Music] what do you mean stealing my glory bones ah it does bows how can you how do you repost from that far away sir that's for you what do you mean we got that looks epic or something rare i don't know trophies hard-earned from faded items of bountiful harvest 20 max hp i like that see and now we're dipping into the like we're not friendly i thought we had something now everybody's mad at everybody i have to get through boss two three four five six seven eight more encounters without hospital there's no way i mean he just randomly insults the plague doctor now they're minus two you guys got a problem you guys gotta sort this out or something all right oh what a dodge though i'm trying to sleep oh sorry i'm trying to get us out of here like what bunch of whiny babies ah two arms no no no satisfaction you gotta be kidding me they don't see us wait what does this give us a debuff but they get an extra move he won't like running but then again he doesn't like anything but that's my entire flame fight now or fight when the light goes out whatever yolo ah low roll all right nice resisted it okay it's a 20 resist chance you gotta love that knocks me back two spaces hold the line so great buddy oh and that's a crazy oh my whatever oh my let's go that's a great baby oh my god he's almost dead he's got smallpox meltdown oh what does this mean what covets what the other has and plots to take it what are you doing right now what what what is this stop it stun this dude i guess nice crit at least i can rely on you i see now why this game is freaking good come on let's go you guys are just buttholes you know that what wait what biggest hits again we're both heal yourself okay he's no longer a death door just a good dog okay thank god you will rolled well too late cause i'm freaking out and then it's gonna be oh that was my phone wow nobody complaining moderate heal in items doesn't matter a vague trinket holy i think we're getting pooped on here yeah you're gonna you're gonna want that buddy you gotta go all the way in the back buddy there's no other way this is this is terrible this is bad what what's next on the road oh my one two three four five more before i even hit the boss oh my everyone just lost health for what is this another fight oh my god it's another oh my god what am i looking at are you kidding me i think i'm dead here but uh we got a 50 health dinner cart and ladies obviously ladies you look fabulous um i think we're all dead um the slowest and deadliest poison of them all not that you really deserve that what oh 18 and i'm blinded not now resentment the slowest and deadliest poison of them all are you what is going on right now take that i have to try and take one for the team here hopefully they target him not that it's worked at all okay well finally something positive happened wow that's crazy oh my god leave her alone how are you still alive your death store thing has to be like nothing jesus okay somebody's got to finish that thing off i hate my life the war oh oh they hit both that's nice that's that's a big mess please miss okay only one damn that is okay please god someone killed this thing thank god final round i i did all this to not even get anything in what world are you able to get through all this what is this i thought i cleared the corpse where did this come from and death throw and then the blight might kill you that that was it so we took a dicken for no reason i think we nailed that one are you kidding me another fight good pushing corpses insta kills them i did not know that good call good resistance you're doing great buddy i know you're stressed aren't we all why can't fights be more like that the means of mastery flight resistance well at least you're happy about something this does not what is this what is that this good this bad the harvest house it's bad it's bad okay we gotta kill the maid here everything's not awesome everything's not cool i wanna die everything here resists blight man then let's make him bleed oh another one look at his health holy jesus you know they used to have a good relationship take this heel okay well at some point i thought we could kill this thing excellent work always cringe i can at least count on you buddy great job and that's oh a crit why wouldn't it be oh okay meltdown naturally you don't even have anyone else to be pissed at that's where we're at right now just just there we go nice a dodge

stealthed how does that even work when i'm the only one left i don't know and first try okay let's hope they find peace all right knowledge that was quick maybe he'd give them a run for their money you know maybe like a dodge he had dodged it nope 20 league stand i didn't make it what that wasn't even enough to get to level three oh my god i did unlock stuff but not much you need to discard everything in your wagon for it to count wait what but it didn't even give me a chance [Music] [Music] you
