so they [ __ ] there's just red everywhere my i don't know what's happening i'm gonna let it shine and one of them is dead yeah what is hurting me okay okay okay nice i'm gonna get team shot again okay hi do you hold everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and welcome back to the iron banner except if we take a little trip on over here hey what we're shouting dude nah he just finally got upgraded to vip he said guardian games it's back it's better than ever well maybe i don't know i haven't actually played it yet you know battle do you know your light so let's find out what kaido's new war commander whatever he's called as in store for us spoilers it's rift by the way don't forget before you hop into the match the more iron banner gear and emblems you have equipped the more rep you're gonna get so what are we missing out on free real estate which is why i look like this it's all the iron banner ornaments i have then i threw on the sword to complete the set i also didn't even oh fudge what am i using because apparently it's for i don't have a hug that's that's apparently what it is it's first of five riff dunks and every time you dunk it the match is gonna reset so it could go four to five who really knows it there's a 10 mad 10 minute you know limit but okay you thought i'd fall for something so but i'm intrigued that you i also need to realize it's time to play the objective and the objective is not to kill believe it or not that's unnecessary [Applause] please die please don't ah no shot oh my god i didn't see it my hammer exploded because it was on the ground too long and it killed somebody that is hilarious okay and that's not so funny what uh this is my game by the way oh that's fun yeah uh just a whole team of solo keys versus the six stack you know just another day ooh things are gonna be i was like well okay well maybe my team is like a five stag yeah that makes sense and they just needed somebody else to ch what did that spark oh there's two of them i couldn't even see both of them what the probably gonna be close soon i assume stop the runner well that's the idea yeah well um see that where is the runner exactly uh and we're stasist and i don't even know what my stasis breakout button is i don't i don't have a button for it okay all right just spam z remember this is z zed guess who's back back again it is i that's the dancer i am back it is me that is it let's get going i'm gonna get team shot again okay lovely somehow i got naded too oh hey give me my hammer back what's the hammer doing what's the hammered what the [ __ ] they they're really just going to make me have to six stack huh i'm assuming this was permanent every iron banner match gonna be and they scored from the top fellas i don't have anything if i put on a sniper or something huh what and what is it what is this wait yeah what am i looking at here that dude jfk i don't know what this is you why are we not moving forward what am i where's my team i don't they don't eat the spawn i guess that's the answer to that riddle okay well killed somebody but the runner is near i'm afraid but not close enough okay here i go lads let's go i've got this spark and i've got to ignite it you light me up inside like the 4th of july i'm running oh my god i'm going to die i'm what not dancing in the mirror because i'm dead in the shower he's coming he's coming around he do be coming around they've gotten time to gather their forces he's yo freaking nevermind i'm back right into an oats that's incredible i think i would have just preferred to respond normally because this is now what the thing i mean everything hurts what am i supposed to do about this five minutes where's the solo wolves playlist lone wolves yeah okay guess jesus christ there uh it's this is the thing that's that i also don't know what's going on with my chat shot c-h-a-t what's that spell chat why does everything hurt but actually i'm not the spark is ready wait what what is going on right now my brother's in christ wait how did you yo not how i oh my god look look at this boner and he left okay jesus christ thank god okay yep that was a match that happened okay oh great oh even better oh i joined a game in progress we were already two down nice it is on the new map though oh i've only played this once in momentum control and i was so confused but look at the content new maps cool it's also funny because it's it's a giant map and it's a stark difference from whatever we were just playing where you know oh the spark oh that was where the spot i don't know i'm just kind of running uh i can collect it you know what i'm thinking about it and you know what i'm done thinking about it because because i'm running with it yo i'm yo we going baby oh jesus hey yo hey yo team sticking with the shish kebab yo any razors nice all right we gotta defend the mint help them out there's so many of them yeah there we go oh my god i can't it's an it's another six stack actually enough all right all right nice now just six stack losing game but that's okay hey you know what the power of randoms cannot be understated because it's it's a thing i i assure you somebody what do we the the spark runner is near so they say and what is going on here what i don't really have a problem with the game mode so far it's just the nature of the game of being six stack uh in objective game modes you know teamwork always is usually gonna win out and uh well yeah it is nice having an actual just objective base mode though for crucible i haven't really had that like ever because even the other modes are just tdm but called something different you know tdm but extra flavor but then there's never extra flavor hey yo i got the spark i'm running okay that person is so dead i'm zooming i'm grooving and i'm trying to how did he how did we not shot gunny okay you getting rest oh my god you're not okay i just see bodies flying i don't know what's going on i think they're they're probably grabbing heavy to be honest that's exactly what it seems like frankly all right that dude okay no move stop stop pushing me oh that's a machine gun okay i don't really want the runner is far okay everybody got a little piece of that heavy i guess so they're just holding on to it they're just okay they're turtling which is wait but yeah they're they they don't need the score wait yeah the game is over if they oh i tried that okay ah they ignited it i did not see that one coming safe to say yeah when i walk in the room this is what i see a stick a six stack team looking back at me i think oh jesus and then i stopped singing cause i'm like oh sweet moses that's okay now the australian that was the problem you know i wasn't using a new seasonal weapon okay okay we got outlaw we got kill cut that's a super he fell down we assisted we assisted he's trying to get a res but he couldn't get it stupid come on come on oh that's a well wait oh we grew the spark okay i'll distract him over here boys go go go three and a half minutes doable totally copium there we go okay outlaw kill clip extra damage they're dead ah shotgun you tore through the plane that's a rift ignite let's go three scores in three minutes didn't realize it'd be that easy i'm saying forgot to set my iron banner match settings to difficult accidentally set them to easy oops let me get a quick little snipe here yep easy peasy lemon squeezy i don't i don't know what's hitting me actually grab that spark gamer nice great stuff we're gonna defend them come on guys we can do it together oh my god wait actually you're a gamer oh my god it actually is that easy are you friendly or not i can't tell okay now i'll donate two scores two and a half minutes what did i say come on and that's just to tie it up i mean i know if we tied up we're gonna win let's be honest in fact i know we're gonna win anyway it's just delaying it you know do they want to take another minute or two minutes that's kind of kind of what we're we're dealing with here speaking with what we're doing with here where where are oh well i found one of the gamers and one of them is dead i hear the hammers i hear them singing and ringing and i want nothing to do with them i don't know how that didn't yeah okay okay okay oh well let's oh wait runner progress near and they'll have heavy now though okay look for the runner where is he i can't see him but the ref look at it's pissed just like don't get it away there's just red everywhere my i don't know what's happening okay nice yeah yo yo grab it grab it grab it i got you baby i got you i can't what am i throwing at i don't know i g you were there i guess yo my little rift runner that could go get him buddy buddy i think you might have to fight this one i think you my guys wait he's alive wait wait hello hello 52 go come on there's no way you're mad man dude funny or tangent out here smurfing dude but don't let that distract you from the fact that i've still only played six stacks and even got put into a losing game however it appears i'm the catalyst that would provide victory i um whom i can't i'm just a hype man that's why they sent me they're like they only need five but they need a hype man say less come on show yourselves you cowards that's a bubble oh we are in is it does that just is it game i think i think it's game no that's so sad they don't even deserve the wait wait how did he grab this okay well surely ah that was sick dude i don't even know how you managed it i don't know if i was that sick stack i'd be kind of embarrassed i'm embarrassed okay dear lord heaven where for our thou just not a sick stack maybe just all solos as if there were a playlist for that almost wouldn't that be crazy convergence this again oh lord drumroll is it a sex stack oh it's only it's only a three okay i'll allow it i feel like it's what the fudges is uh jesus uh he played in her and other things he was in gladiator he did like the thumbs up thumbs down thing ooh that's cloud strike double kill um my bad dude uh hey uh uh guys guys guys guys the um he seems awfully close this map just seems like a clutch the other one kind of played a little bit better that's what it felt like i almost almost felt like it was made for rift this one everything's just so snowballing i guess but hey if we snowball then i like it but when we're getting snowballed i don't like it uh i'm gonna get cloud strike again i'm so sorry friends ah it he's cheating that's the explanation oh god oh god oh no jesus oh the healing yeah oh my god that what was monet doing what is hurting me i forgot i used all my ammo okay one kid down he's just holding the spark in the middle i'm ready i'm not gonna go on the left side anymore because as much as i like giving that man a free double kill every single round maybe i should stop just like this guy should stop shooting me in the back yep thanks for flinching me buddy anyone trust your own friends anymore you know what i'm saying okay ow oh it was a spark what hey yo any razors oh thanks guys a couple of pals what a couple dudes being bros you know i hold the spark and it opened up my eyes i got the spark i'm gonna dunk it on these boners all right we ready to move in team operation what's with this i'm back and i have the spark oh my god let me guess he's got a sword with like eager edge he's gonna eager edge his way what yep that's exactly what he's doing literally exactly what this man is doing oh nice your ally has the spark all right we run hello good sir we're right into the battle i am here to cover you my friends i thought what just happened i don't know but they're mainly dead your runner is under fire he's under fire yeah well aren't we all get in there nice all right let's go get that spark gamers and let me not get sniped gamers oh that's a cloud strike can't see anything i'm alive though i do know that and i'm getting a rez so feeling pretty good about this one so far that's a kill so i'm feeling i'm feeling i'm on cloud nine right now that's another kill i'm getting a rez got you this is us this i'm getting shot though i'm getting i'm getting oh they got us well they had a res you're dead okay up that you're dead we're going we're going they needed the oh my god does everyone is everyone using cloud strike where's we like it was like a six-speed entire enemy team and now melee registration what the melee registration doing all right skills grab that heavy i like the play didn't what happened to our team oh my i am here to i was going to get the res but i understand you might not have had a chance eh they got rock yeah guys guys they got heavy ammo in case you yeah just in case you didn't know oh we got there okay this is it dude did mine to my teepee i get messed it did i actually click my dpi i was like i don't know man i'm just moving and grooving a little bit more than i thought i would and that ain't necessarily a good thing how did that my cloud strike dude stop it oh god i've got you friend oh baby the spark is yours you got what i need i'm trying to get your resus and you all just keep disappearing i'm gonna let it shine everything hurts i'm gonna get your arrest all right i'm making a push i'm making a portion of making a position making the buzz that's crazy let's go sometimes you just gotta say send it and then you do it you know last time i did it didn't work this time i did it i'm 50 50 right now like if i was a doctor mortality rate you know when they're under the knife if i had a 50 50 i could sleep at night probably why i don't have a license or ever try to be a doctor you know all those things uh you know what i'm feeling my lads my dudes my duders my my people i'm feeling i'm feeling a little frisky i'm feeling that dude is level 81 on the season pass i just realized that how i've been gaming pretty decently and i'm like 40. 81 that's that's incredible you are a gamer certified good gamer moment oh my god it's so am i gonna know what it feels like to win an iron banner match perhaps perhaps it's a little magical thing i like to call not fighting the sick snack and admittedly i haven't done much in the way of helping my team i haven't really been locked and loaded you know i'm here for good vibes oh tell somebody want to run that one back and tell me how i uh did not somehow kill that man the spark is ready the spock is ready to pee pee poo poo get pooped on oh my god wait first off how's this not going that well secondly they am i am going to respawn it guys any spark stoppers yeah the other thing is they have about um five enemy approaching where [ __ ] okay well remember it's nice yeah they have all their shapers that was one of the four they still have i'm gonna get the sickest snipe off the rip okay maybe not but i didn't get sniped and that needs to count for something but i feel like it doesn't i weaken somebody and i'm gonna be weakened oh i stopped it no don't let him grab it no somebody shoot him just don't let him you would've just tried to shoot him once man that's okay match point doesn't matter because yes it does 20 seconds okay i didn't see that it matters so much holy everything i said i need an opener more than ever and that's what i'm gonna deliver the opener like i said more than ever holy suck oh my god i'm i'm different i'm different yeah i'm different last chance at home i'm ready i'm running i'm running and i'm slamming yeah what i did everything in my bloody power oh my literally like a split second oh no well nothing like some iron banner with a little side of depression [Music] [Music] you
