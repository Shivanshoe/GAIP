heidi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to pokemon unite an exciting day this game is so good i'm so addicted and i wanted to upload it to the main channel for you all to enjoy and see what your thoughts are you know dip our toes in the water see how you guys are feeling because i've already uploaded a pokemon unite video to our second channel more mr fruit and if you like pokemon we're in we're we're in the midst of a soul ink nuzlocke for diamond and pearl with blue westflow but we might do more unite here if not it'll certainly be on the second channel i can't stop grinding this been grinding with my friends as well in ranked that's been a whole bunch of fun and today is even more exciting because a brand new pokemon the first pokemon to be added to the game has released that's right ladies and gentlemen if we take a little jaunt over to the shop we're going to see gardevoir has been added that's right the first uh let me just go ahead and i'm gonna do a little bit of that thank you arranged attacker never played obviously don't even know what she does i'm gonna read the abilities right now it appears oh we got a bit of a late bloomer here ralts doesn't evolve until curly until six and then guard for level 10 so it looks like we're we're not going to turn on until a little bit later kind of like guard chomp off the bat waltz has confusion attack straight in the designated direction pretty easy teleport has used a warp to designate area increasing the damage dealt by one basic attack after warping unity move fairy singularity warps space in the designated area drawing in opposing pokemon shoves and deals damage to possible when the instant the warp space disappears that kind of sounds sick the big all suck synchronized when the opponent flicks decreased movement speed or a damage over time condition on the pokemon the same is inflicted on that opponent that's pretty cool basic attack becomes a boosted attack with every third attack when this attack hits it deals damage to opposing pokemon in the area of effect and increases their special defense for short time which is a good thing because i imagine gardevoir special attack upon reaching level six we'll get to choose between size shock or future sight size shark attacks destiny location three times this moves cooldown is reduced each time one of these attacks hits an opposing pokemon or a future sight such a delayed explosion when the explosion hits an opposing pokemon it reduces the moves cool down uh which one's better i have no idea we have here at level eight being able to choose between psychic or moon blast psychic after hitting opponent pokemon to travel on its maximum distance deals damage over time to post some pokemon in the area of affecting new kisses and movement speed for a short time sounds pretty good damage over time aoe or moonblast has a user attack while moving back to create distance when move blast hits it deals damage to opposing pokemon in the cone and leaves the opposing pokemon closest to the user unable act for a short time i am not going to play ranked first game gardevoir instead we're going to play standard and essentially pray that we can get gardevoir it's it's everybody's favorite mini game can i lock in the pokemon yeah i hope so we got her ladies and gentlemen we're good i am going to go degenerate special attack build shell bell wise glasses and special attack specs i better be dunking some goals for the extra special attack and then just eject button because that's what i always do as for abilities i think i'm going to go maybe moon blast future sight kind of sounds fun uh what lane do they want me to go top sure i'll go with cinder ace let's do it buddy oh yes the only cardiff they're probably like oh my god i've yet to see a god of war you're about to see a number one in a man okay watch out gardevoir maine all right with little to no communication i hope everybody goes the right way i don't like it should just be okay this is a good start zara or you i'm gonna tax your willy pop what the fudge are you doing what what what is this go to j am are we in troll zero aura uh you know there's a jungle right what the is going on right now all right well we're just splitting xp three ways sure why not zero or is fighting well he's dead oh and so is this snorlax here we go no just kidding i don't do nearly enough damage oh but i'm throwing that dot back at him that's right because that's what i do synchronize baby oh shoot oh shoot ah okay that's not cool this little zero or actually came here to just grab all that stuff from us and then go take jungle well i'm taking your this thing yeah that's right now i need to go grab these bees hold up yo yo let me in on this wait don't i didn't mean to teleport like that but where'd this lucario come from yo that's mine no it's not okay oh he missed it oh this this snow is so dead he's so dead oh you're so good you're not getting out of here he's getting out of here what the fudge okay that's incredible can we kill something maybe that would be nice okay this lucario is actually griefing i don't know what his plan is here let's go that's a k.o get out of my face sarah aura okay you're not helping anybody no no go gank i'm sorry i'm just a little salty i just need to see some plays out of you buddy okay we'll take that and suddenly i'm in oh shoot and i'm out or is there aura got absolutely obliterated there i'll save you from lucario this lucario is also griefing other people what what are these guys doing who should i focus uh there's so many so close on yet so far well i would i'm gonna say we're doing all right i feel like we're not too far behind and as soon as i hit like level six i feel like we're really gonna turn on here uh so yes i'm 100 stealing his jungle what comes around goes around just got to kite it out a little bit oh boyfriend you're so far from home buddy what you doing all right that's level six uh let's try future site it's happening and i'm coming down here to help friend i don't know how this works but here you go oh that's how it works we just kill everything apparently yo and hit you with the future site oh my yo damage kind of real question mark holy okay suddenly this is looking real nice okay don't mind if i take all this i should have probably banked when i had the chance there you go yo hit him up bro what are you scared of him yeah go okay i don't he's got to be trolling holy damage wow we hurt okay go go go get him go crap morant i believe ah and i'm out i gotta grab citrus spray i'm ha i'm here i'm here hold him you're fine no you're not you're so dead sorry friend oh we got him oh we got him oh we almost had him oh my god and then here comes uh the most balanced character in the game and slimy son of a gun all right i'll go back top boy well it seems i don't know i feel like i should go help um i've yet to be able to score to use my glasses oh they're doing dreading aren't they no they're not why aren't they doing dreadnought where are they oh yeah and here comes yeah a little hex fiend screw you you're already level 10 because that's fair he did miss his sludge bomb though there might be a chance here if i have my unity move maybe but i don't oh wait a second wait a second get out of my face and you know what i have now i have my unity move screw you was that overkill probably no i'm going in oh i'm going in i don't care let's go 40 points uh don't mind if i a bop-up finally start stacking this thing that's my bad yeah now let's go get this dreadnought my friend or okay i'll just get it that's fine they don't they don't prioritize dreadnought big mistake on their part normally when i'm like playing friends but when it's like 30 seconds to dreadnought i better see you all down that dreadnought you know what i'm saying it's a game changer global xp and everything it's it's just op you just snowball with it you know what i'm saying prioritize dreadnought more that's my advice bob your welcome team somebody had to do it and that somebody was me they gave me all uh oh my dad the raw damage here what even is that he's like me and i'm like uh yeah where'd this guy go oh there he is what you doing what is you doing level that up oh my god but discharge is a balanced move i'm not why i'm not salty but i have to go assist my team and i have my old back it seems like a pretty fast goal if i'm being honest with you fear not actually you should fear singularity oh my god he's uh of course he can just hex through all my abilities because invulnerability and dashes and he gets instant resets that is the video i made on my second channel i've literally only played two games of gengar because i cannot play anymore without feeling like absolute scum if you ask me rightfully so oh here comes the raw damage so oh and the future site upgraded means instant refreshes if it hits oh my oh my i'm coming for you hello hello okay i guess you can only go one at a time i never knew that i need to dunk though so i get a little extra points here that'd be great little extra special attack don't mind if i do uh skadoosh zappados in 15 seconds that's disgusting i missed oh oh my god send a race what the fudge ready for this oh what up senator i missed literally everything zappados and i have a hate-hate relationship i wouldn't even say love and what is this sarah aura doing he's literally throwing is this a bot like what am i what am i watching right now oh but if i just keep lighting them up nope discharge what was i thinking we're gonna lose right here because zapdos oh you missed buddy you missed i'm sorry we don't have to win to show off gardevoir we do some nutty damage man i'm gonna be honest with you and i'm here for it you just destroyed that you son of a oh i'm gonna use everything on you oh you don't stan you don't stand a chance yeah no it does seem like my old regeneration is way faster than everybody else i'm gonna see if i can get this out in time before they jump on me okay i don't think that's gonna win us the game but yep yeah i'm gonna cc him of course i didn't i'm hopping away screw this oh i'm going on gengar what the fudge and we miss literally every everything pretty hard to hit a moving target even still though nvp 12 and five if you look at the rest of our team's scoreline it's pretty darn good i'd say all right we're gonna do a quick battle these are so much fun different maps and some of them are beautiful and there it's always either 3v3 or 4v4 uh enhanced leveling and stuff it's just a quicker game mode it's only five minutes like everything's doubled it's sick and so what better place to show off some gardevoir especially when you don't really turn on until a little bit later this time we'll do the exact opposite we'll go psychic psyshock and uh see what trouble we can get up to i'm just waiting for my boy blastoise but most importantly i'm waiting for toxic croak and krogunk please i i never made anyone but i'll maim them and it's been data mined that their name is in there somewhere i'm just really hoping they don't make it an npc that you fight because nine times out of ten like i feel like if it's an npc in the game it's probably not going to become a playable pokemon and that would break my heart as you all know kroger is my favorite pokemon look at this map though like isn't this so cool i love it okay anyway gonna start with confusion there's only two lanes here everything's a little bit uh turbo fire we got some alolan meowth here yeah dead just do this real quick there's uh if i'm not mistaken there's electrode on this map too but like you think even just the damage you do is increased oh that boy's over there just counter-jungling immediately i don't know if that's the play but i love it i don't he's just vibing okay if i'd known you were going balls of wall brother i would have i would have been all on that i'll be honest with you cheap okay get him that's what i thought yo i'm going you think you think i ain't going you think i'm not okay okay i'm out and just like that i'm out and i need to score oh they only have one go oh no you don't no you don't he's not he's not living this he's not living this bob zero or you're not living this either actually i'm just ralt is pretty weak man that's uh okay but in my goal what is you doing what is you you just took give me that citrus okay yellow okay that wow that was just terrible timing on my part yo give me this all right i don't know what that was okay but we got psyshock this is exciting okay what are we doing here i can't even hit one of the side shots man oh my god don't leave me alone i'm getting bullied come here unless i'm able to see him i feel like being able to his sideshot dangers pretty impossible i'm going to be honest with you come here oh jesus run away oh guys just cat mouse cat and mouse yo stop it i'm trying focus focus that on my team oh wait big size shot damage oh if you guys want to do that oh i'll play now well we got psyshark psychic so that's a thing okay i'm going to try and help greninja here love what he's trying to do here he's going for the big kill you'll have to see it yeah i'm probably pretty good though because i got super high damage if they can't get out of my aoe and uh well spoiler alert avalog ain't going gonna be doing that this is probably such a terrible idea especially when they're all right there but whatever if we get this we'll be legends we'll be legendary man greninja i feel like we're just not doing much damage here please kill it let's go blah blah blah oh i got my unity move to wait wait wait stop that dude sir i demand you holt the avalog buff what does that do exactly you know what i'm ultimate screw screw you lucario in a particular oh shoot we got all this stuff i got uh leveled up psi shock i'm gonna be honest i don't know really what that does but i'm gonna see if i can't try and score here probably not but i'll just respond i want to help i do but i don't know if i'm going to be able to so instead i'm going to try and hide out here never mind i got you buddy oh big damage big damage bop and then just do it right here while they chase me okay level that psychic up bop just sit here oh you guys want to sit in my dick okay yeah you like that fudge okay get the citrus berry he's gonna do the same well good because he'll need it frostmouth mike frost naw got him i really need to score here ah fudge no stay away somebody help me thank you treasure you're the best i have to hope nobody bothers to stop me there are like puppy garden now no so is talonflame fudge no i can't do anything about it oh my god i can't score wait wait oh wait what why is it instant oh i'm used to that just oh is it wait what the dunk last second winning us the game baby just like that mvp what can i say 100 points all from my last dunk here's what i think about gardevoir pretty crazy damage uh if they don't leave as a dueler i think you're pretty poor but as a team fighter i think you're nuts not as sick as this game though i'm so addicted to pokemon unite so let me know if you guys want to see some more it'll either be on this channel or the second train i guess it all depends on how well it does here but with that said i want to thank all everyone watching have yourselves a fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one [Music] you
