heidi hello everyone my name's mr fruit and it's time to smash not like that don't make it weird and i'm not talking about nintendo's hit franchise super smash brothers so what are we smashing in exactly well we're smashing and smash legends smash legends that's right it's a game i randomly found on steam that came out recently and it had some cool graphics i like the art style uh i had little no idea what i was looking into and i booted it up and then i realized oh it's a mobile game on pc but there's also the mobile game itself point is though it's fun enough that i don't care it's a mobile game because i have fun with it even though i think it would actually probably be easier to play on mobile because the controls are weird you can't rebind them so you have to use arrow keys to move and then zx and c for your abilities and you can't rebind them like i said so it is what it is kind of paper a bit of a potato to be fair but what am i not a potato let's be honest mr fruitman like mr spud anyway i'm here to show you the game it is very similar to brawl stars if you've seen that in a sense like it has a shop and you know you can get your free stuff has legends and then the way you upgrade legends to get like better abilities is by getting in this case puzzle pieces and then you can upgrade them and upgrading them increases all their skills i currently have three of them we'll start with pia because i have a little skin for him i don't know why i got it but they gave it to me i'm old pirate yarg he is a fighter with abilities crazy right you have a basic ability of a like just your normal attack then you have your first ability and then an ultimate and that's for everybody and the goal of the game well there's different game modes i've currently only locked two there's dominion which seems to be like the bread and butter ko people after reducing their health to zero there's also battle royale which is exactly like showdown in brawl stars if you played that blah blah blah you want to be the last one standing battle royale i know you pr you probably whoa that's a completely new game mode wow what a cool genre people should make more games of that anyway we're gonna hop into it i know this is all confusing you're welcome let's start okay dominion so you can only move diagonally but you'll see here i'm looking cool like see the graphics look sick like when i was looking at the game i only saw screenshots and to be fair if i only saw screenshots you know i wouldn't think this is a mobile game it looks cool and so like why does why is the fact that fb mobile game be an issue you know but watch my ability as i completely whip it holy crap so point of this is you want to capture the zones you have to capture it four different times i almost knocked that person off the map okay well we just killed them see i guess it's like smash because they even have like the little animation for when they get knocked out okay now i'm going on them okay check this out though i'm gonna use my ultimate and i'm gonna knock him off the map you're not recovering from that oh but i'm hurt and you do not regenerate health you can find health packs on the map but that's about it yo team up on him team up oh i'm trying to get you can go through the air and there are counter aerials oh my what an ultimate just like pulled everybody on in there i'm still alive get pooped on i'm helping my friend oh please tell me you fell off the map darn it okay well let's fix that there we go oh i thought i fell off the map what a twist i made a tiny mistake wait no no i want the hell we're about to win the game but i don't want to die you know i got to get that flawless dub here right after i open them and miss practically everyone oh god oh oh oh run run very fast okay all right i'm not dead yet i'm gonna go down swinging down swinging okay so it's very fast it's very frantic and if you're confused welcome we're all confused uh i guess i just picked up a bomb and threw it at him uh i guess that's kosher around here nobody seems to be batting an eye i don't have a wrap tell me that's illegal kind of feels like it but that's all right whatever gets the duh but that person and they're all or something here's my old as i whiff it again oh yeah yeah boom now we captured four zones freaking flawless victory and is that is that an mvp i'm honored oh my thank you why yes i do frag from time to time i do smash uh so we're like completing bounties or whatever you know it is what it is now we'll go to battle royale so i'll show you that real quick uh pretty self-explanatory but i guess it is what one three four five six i can count eight people so it's you versus seven others it's time to smash here's our the map the elevation is an interesting concept the way they they work with it like right here i gotta jump up but so you wanna grab these candies it takes a little while to destroy them but if you do and you pick it up like i'll show you here you're gonna see i have two above my head i gained increase attack hp the whole thing a little moba esque but that's about it does not carry over other games slight problem i'm finding with this guy though is because i break these candies so slow it's not exactly the best play to sit here and farm uh you could kill other people for their candies which might be the play oh shoot yo come back here you coward you coward yeah yeah you like that come here oh jesus we're getting bombarded hold on you can't escape me oh wait a second maybe he can here we go oh shoot okay whatever i'm gonna take the candy don't mind me i'm gonna let them fight it out wait that guy's got eight candy oh he's not oh he got a doughnut oh he's ju i am in trouble he appears to want me so i'm out of here no thanks that guy seems oh you have eight candy too you guys seem very upset oh jesus get me out of here no okay you guys can deal with that now all right uh wait what he just canceled my ability what the fudge is this guy what he just eats all my abilities wait a second i've never fought this guy and he seems to be a bit unkillable he just jumped over my okay these guys kind of seem to be gamers i'm only alive because i'm a coward or am i yeah yeah i know i'm a coward okay i'm spamming my butt oh jesus christ okay okay okay here we go ready check this oh we got him we got him let me grab all this thank you very much okay that's 12. i'm not falling for your trap or whatever the fudge that is uh let me grab this health real quick okay now i can't get go out because i will die pretty much so instead i'll knock you up fudge i'll knock you out dude what okay literally everything i'm using is just getting beat now what the she's better framed at a brother what okay i don't know what that was i threw out every single one of my abilities and none of them worked i guess we clanked or whatever and i don't know how that works well we got a second pretty much only because i was a coward but whatever we got an epic loot box here we get oh my god coins that's a road drop oh peter puzzle piece let's get it a sandy puzzle piece that's a good one that's a good one i will not fall for it though game i'm not giving you any of my money apparently i'm about to unlock alice though she looks fun oh alice from wonderland well i get it because we have oh am i peter pan because obviously this is a little red riding hood her name's red this one what cindy oh it's cinderella oh what i'm just assuming because glass slippers okay didn't see that one coming kaiser kaiser gem i don't know what that one i don't know how to say your name uh hook from like peter pan hello i like the cat oh i want the cat how do i get the cat obtainable from silver box or above trying to get my money of course you put the coolest one in the in the boxes but no nay i'm gonna keep playing the honest way because i already spent way too much money in epic seven that that can be my only mobile game because god knows i already my wife's not happy with me rightfully so right uh we'll try somebody else though i'll use a little red riding hood okay it's us versus them crazy right all right little red riding hood we're an assassin so we gotta be a little sneaky we're a little we're not as tanky as that guy good lord he's got a lot of hp but boosh we've got charges in our okay i'm getting combos what the fudge it's just like smash brothers i'm getting pooped on now i go invisible they snipe me out of my invisibility that's incredible oh whoa i like grab the ledge that's attack come here oh there we go oh what a combo you're not getting back from that buddy all pal so let me go invisible oh i got you buddy ol pal i'm not gonna let you get hurt i have to try and snipe her out of the air go invisible where did i go oh i'm right here yeah i'm dead i don't know what i was doing there okay back guys we have to capture the zones it's not going very well ow oh jesus oh i'm a busy blaze i am invisible i kill you now oh okay i'm literally just i'm mashing it really is smash brothers i'm trying to catch him out of the air but see man i feel like i would have so much more agency what a recovery if uh i was on mobile but that's not guaranteed oh what a kill but i am on death's door and i don't see any healing on this map so i will do what i must which is by my team time they captured it i'm dead i bought approximately uh no time i'm coming do not fear my team we are the best we cannot be defeated i've actually never lost a game of smash legends well i did just get second in battle rail but technically that's still a dub because i think if you just get like top three or four it counts um but yeah i've never lost a game aside from that so it's looking like i'm about to catch my first l though okay these guys are just like far superior they're gamers i'm not god they just jump around i need to do way more aerials you obviously can't hit them when you're grounded but if they're jumping around oh there we go when you slash your midair you can dunk them let's get can we get a cap maybe i wouldn't mind a cap no cap but actually cap okay i'm here to buy hold on i'm here to make sure you can't what the fudge help me okay i'm on the point and i'm dying and i'm on and i'm but i'm mainly just dying i'm on the point we're going to run out of time though oh we kept the zone we got 40 seconds left to at least tie it let's get it to overtime boyas and girls of course i don't mean to assume smashers i'm invisible all right literally at this point just keep him out keep him out we're playing keep away okay he's trying to get on boom we actually tied this is nuts this guy likes to jump so watch this snipe except not yeah keep oh my god we almost got another one i'm here to yeah get away oh no no i'm in the zone i'm in the zone i need help they're gonna cap it they capped it what that doesn't make sense oh but we got three just just get in the zone they have numbers advantage so just stall two what they don't have enough time they don't have enough time and i'm still undefeated i didn't do well but a dub is a dub of my friends it's a good thing there's not a scoreboard here because uh we'd probably goose him but that's okay oh there's something new in the shop oh that's fun a new offer i don't see a new offer all i see is too much money i could give you 48.94 for this spectacular baggage or i could go get like seven indie games on steam or probably a triple a game discounted you know kind of puts things in perspective but we all locked ours who cares dude oh my god i'm gonna go buy that package i'm not actually but the game is fine so feel free to i think i don't know what platforms it's on actually i'm checked i assume most mobile platforms but it is on steam and i wanted to show you guys because it's fun it's different i'm sure you didn't expect to see this from me but here we are you know i'd like to think my channel is the gift that keeps on giving good or bad because you just you click on it you're like what the fudge is this dude playing today and today it's smash legends had to think about that for a second i forgot what it was anyway thank you very much for watching have yourselves a fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] you
