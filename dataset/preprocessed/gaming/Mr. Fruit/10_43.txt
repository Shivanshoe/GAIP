hey ho everyone my name is mr fruit and before we get into today's video i want to give you all a little background some context i made this video last june it's almost a year ago i hadn't uploaded it i think it's also important to mention this because in the intro of this video i talk about how it feels like overwatch 2's never coming out and then lo and behold what happened a couple weeks ago [Music] and speaking of overwatch 2 waiting room i'm probably going to revisit overwatch one for a little bit before the beta to reacquaint myself reminisce and get ready so just give the video a shot at the very least i think it's entertaining and if you haven't heard me curious there's a link or something right up there to my brand new variety channel so all non-shooter content will be there if that's what you're looking for i posted some really cool stuff there i think you'll like it enjoy the video heidi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to overwatch my apologies wouldn't that be nice no welcome back to paladins and there goes all everybody just clicked off the video rude it's fun freaking new champion stay your plebs because if you're waiting for overwatch to guess what you're going to die of old age just like me all right you know what's bad when it's e3 and blizzard's announcement is subtle changes to the look of batiste and sombra yikes so paladins all of that skin rip john buck that's kind of sick anyway freaking will you oh dear you wish a brand new hero champion whatever uh no i i don't know to the bottom let's learn together who can be refired on another enemy that's fine um dash damage stun [Music] yeah seems good to me let's uh let's do this oh wait select how do i have a skin for it what happened to your mask why do i have these i kind of like the mask why don't we just let's just go with the default for now well it's not like i see myself yeah let's just do this oh they have the uh ava to themselves but does he have an animated splash that says i spend too much money on video games i don't think so what am i doing omnipresence sure um okay apparently a lot of ambush shadow shadow bombs or a lot of okay whatever uh what am i picking oh jesus a more ability cooldown why not i probably should have gone cauterized nimble i like movement speed freaking throw kunais that's fun forgetting the dash throw a bomb that's crazy and i cannot teleport because there's no enemies here okay three i know exactly what i'm doing let's go smurf some kids the silent vatu is the deadly vatu hello get snuck up on stupids bop get bombed oh my embarrassing check this out i'm going to ambush you bob freaking it it takes a little while to reload or to like my fire rate is slow that's what i'm trying to say oh my god bob from downtown funky stuff alone mr fruit you're nuts mr fruit maybe okay there we go healing i think he saw me over here i'll make him rue the day oh jesus christ the fudge oh we got to pay well let's freaking go team i was very busy keeping them off of it clearly that was my objective play you're welcome okay i'm going to jump on you and then jump on you oh my god the damage input is nasty come here bob and i'm on you bob you're dead yo show your face show your face you won't he didn't he really didn't okay check this out oh that was sick probably could have saved it for more than one enemy but sick nonetheless boom ambushed boom i'm behind everybody i forget that i have a dash okay i should use it i just straight up forget that i have that i like more movement speed all right let's do this push successful oh my god call them a toilet because i'm pooping on them gosh is it omnidirectional it is that's very important i'm liking the feel of this guy but oh my gosh it's kinky well you're not wrong he's different okay he doesn't have a wakka tikka karao or whatever and pull up a giant dragon blade okay so think about that checkmate okay they hurt okay i'm gonna dash okay i'm trying to dash okay i think i just dashed repeatedly into a wall or am not sure hey guys i'm coming back try not to die without me i know i'm a pivotal part of this team and you're lost without me but it do be how it'd be though dooby dooby doo whatever i choose you got some work to do now oh yeah wait why can't i do it again what that was what i tried to like re-activate ambush and um uh why fred i don't know i feel like shadow sure a little bit of life stealing a little bit of kill on heal i don't know i'm a greedy i'm a greedy slayer okay that's all i do so it makes sense that i should just act like it you know yo screw you wait what oh my god oh my god i'm built different blue like that you dirty fiend yeah take that damage heal me pleb thank you very much okay oh well suddenly everything is going according to plan what what the [ __ ] was what the what just happened to me oh it sounded so fun oh nice old stupid banana get kill the healers oh i didn't ambush but that's what it would be now five in a row i'm built different ben ah man what do i want uh ability to cool that shirt come on we've almost ceased victory my friends it's in our grasp ninety percent nine ninety five ish the percent is debatable because it doesn't give us two uh okay ready wait did i not even hit you are you kidding me she's around here somewhere i just don't know where she went where you at healer where you at show yourself coward i just needed one kill to get the reset to start popping off with my healing that was not the case oh i hear him ambushing because i hear that doo doo somebody's on the point i'm coming oh my god and i'm in and suddenly it's over game's over i'm getting the resets i'm getting the kills nobody stands a chance kill the healer now wait no there we go back now come over here bye now stupid you're dead oh my god get him off the point bear now let's go what a comeback i have my old ready too i was ready to ride off spawn god it's always such a breath of fresh air you can just hop on and have fun how did we do uh i got robbed of most damage what is this i had the best streak okay you might have had objective time but that's for noobs bg come on don't be that guy i'm gonna go with these sorrows look like a jade emperor or something oh my god this is an open and shut case just close the lobby now they don't have a vaatu they lose i mean it's simple math one va two greater than nova twos or in the case of last match my va two greater than another volunteer yeah whatever i'll just throw some more bombs i don't know this one's like about throwing bombs so we'll go for ability cooldown yes sir handsome movement speed yes sir all right me amigos best of luck out there don't let me down are we playing i was like are we playing on the same map no we're not silly to me do i think i can dash behind us possibly but i also don't want to oh my do that wait hold on oh i wanted to hear the banana or whatever i have to remember i don't have any kind of healing yet i haven't bought any life steal or anything no built in sustained i'm rather squishy fan ew oh take those bombs though bam baby hurts me brain i really need the kill to heal because otherwise i never pop off oh you're dead so are you found out bow now you can't stop all of me bear now home the missiles you're dead yo plebs help me out somebody healed me oh you did heal me okay whoa whoa oh that was my old what let's get some kill to heal though i meant to ambush don't ask me how i get those buttons mixed up q and e well to be fair they're both next to my middle and that's the only relationship and even then this bit of stretch okay oh my god they died before i could even ban out of them you're dead oh he's gonna try and barrage me stupid dodge out of there no thank you this person's trying to roll up on me i don't think so come on try me that's what i thought i'm about to ban out i'm sorry now come on give me another one bam now that's what i thought from a distance bit of an arc and it's impossible to hit like more than one so it's not advisable oh fan out there we go i thought i hit him with my bombs i didn't oh whoa screw you oh get stunned where are you ah that's embarrassing let me just get some more lifesteal i like to get lifesteal because then i just don't have to rely on my team and i can't blame my healer for not healing me it's all my fault because i just go in like a monkey return to monkey ban ale you're dead oh wait i can't ah they're too far away oh cassie you've done messed up girl you dumb messed up oh god that's terrifying oh you messed up jen down down wait a minute thank you oh i'll push successful lmao get absolutely pooped shut your mouth i didn't ask to hear anything from you jenos i almost want to double jump like genji and wall
