about it martin yeah i don't understand it but i'm sure once i watch the show i i'll i'll get it and like i think i do understand the meme like a little bit like there seems to be kind of an underlining theme with all the what do you think it means let's let's take a prediction here yeah i won't tell you if you're wrong or right but if you just like had so it's basically like you gotta think like without like without something like it needs trying it's hard to explain it was like a minecraft one that's it was like think about it if you keep killing the zombies or something like that

getting back in yeah don't push don't push oh what the wait what's your tape where's this oh bow's right guy in the corner right i mean i'm looking at him oh they're getting attacked they're getting attacked uh we got a minute so we need to figure out a way to get around holy where i get you're all right all i'm down to is a couple syringes in the med kit so we gotta be careful yeah oh and there's someone on this rooftop we are so boned i got my i have my wait we literally have to get across this mountain okay wait wait i have two seconds to my i have 12 seconds or 12 if i can get my all we just go over the mountain we use rob you're old i mean no they won't we have to go for everything these goober balls okay i've got three seconds i'm gonna prep it yeah yeah get over here oh oh okay okay get over here let's hope this goes high enough i have no idea it will uh not at all wait if we go around this way yes queen oh we're gonna take a little bit of damage but we should be all right take it dude five heads oh no no catch the cannons let's catch this corner and then just catch anyone coming in because i didn't see anyone on my radar there could be a team here but i don't think so we literally just go whole door because we have no more meds or anything we can't do it we got two shields here i got two shields because here's the thing if they can't get here yeah that's what i'm saying if they can't get uh i have my old two we win we win right what do we just watch this because this is the only way they get through otherwise they die is it a solo that's over here somewhere fighting they just fought i don't know no they were just fighting in this yeah i'm gonna assume if they probably got reza's where they could so if they don't do it before this next circle i don't think there's any way they live unless they have a heat stay there yeah but like even a huge deal dude is that like they have to have a caterpillar of those caterpillar like like okay wait literally like circle circle yep yep heat shield on me oh these trees red shield broken alting them alting them keep watching let's go that's what we call five head celebrate good times come on see we either fight and lose or just let them die and win it's big brain time [Music] [Music] you
