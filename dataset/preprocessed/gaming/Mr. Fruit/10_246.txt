yeah it's pretty obvious feel free to join it um i've never not seen it on my account if this is the default i'm gonna have to do some work on this it's just a little tough on the eyes but i made a post look at this reaction videos needed that was that was me so i asked you all for some videos you would like to see me react to and i haven't seen any there was one right here um i saw it on mobile before i clicked it he tried to rick roll me not today that one friend not today i'm a little worried because the top comment is shark so let's see what shark wants me to react to okay first off it's 10 minutes it's titled lasagna i am scared for what comes next i'm gonna be honest hi people i'm back cooking again and today i'm going to be doing a lasagna okay first question why is she out of breath it almost looks like she's in front of us like a steam room or something getting some weird vibes here not the best camera work but it's amateur and sometimes these are hidden gems as you can see i've got my pan oh i love this little cut how do i feel like you have to like purposefully do that in an editing software how did they even do that that's incredible i've got my pan and uh there's a new thing that's come out well i i believe it to be new um i don't know if you can see it but i know a lot of people say you get mad and hear that so sorry what what did she just say wait what i don't know if you can see it but i know a lot of people say you get mad when they hear that i i get like i know a lot of people say i know a lot of people say you get mad when they hear that what are there close captions people say you get mad when you hear that you get mad when they hear that what the closed captions actually help now i can hear it now i know a lot of people say you get mad when they hear that jesus it's this accent man right into it i have no idea what's going on let's let's take a look it's pan so is one spray oh oh my god he's not even spraying i did manage to spray it so far i did happen to spray in it i had to take what am i watching where did shark come across this how many views does this have 99 000. it came out april 1st am i getting debated this might give us some proper context i'm now afraid of what comes next and what i'm going to do is i've got some oh immensely yeah and what we do is she's struggling so much i don't want to yeah i'm not gonna be rude is i'm going to put it in the pan get the paper off of it kind of looks like me brain gigantic if that's some sort of european thing or i'm get i feel like i'm getting trolled oofadoofa i don't like that name actually it ain't a spatula it's a ufodoofa in it and oh wait and i've got some honey on i am going to cut i thought she said honey whole onion okay let's let's skip for what are we doing here now there's a mixture of tomato sauce tomato pea tomato ketchup is this is this really just a video of how to make lasagna i could get in feels like invincible you know i'm watching the first episode i'm just waiting for something to go weird or wrong but i'm gonna be honest i don't know if i'm gonna sit through nine minutes of making lasagna oh my god that sound i don't some of you might know this i what the fudge is it called i have this thing it's like messed it's something but certain noises just trigger like i'm not trigger me i'm not even joking like i get put into like sometimes a fit of rage and whatever that is right now i gotta tell you i'm not a fan i'm literally cringing literally in it right i'm going to let it cook now a bit because the only honey hands i've got to cook and i'm going to put a lid on it what am i doing right now hopefully it should it's this is actually a whole video of making lasagna isn't it um that is something i guess that could be considered lasagna uh so far it was literally just making lasagna so let's get to the taste test and try it i swear to god if this ends with like a frame of someone pooping or something but it would have been taken down by now right looks like she's in the front of a steam room i don't get it the grass reduced amidst me but the tomatoes are a bit overpowering that that was very nice i know a lot of you have been asking where lee is who's lee because i've got a button everywhere but thank you bye i almost just watched someone make lasagna for 10 minutes i still gave it far too much of my time it was literally just a nice wholesome english lady making lasagna i'm so happy that's really the first video we react to thanks shark simple as that ladies and gents you know on having it on web and not seeing thumbnails makes me much more worried how do we dice an onion okay what's what's with all these food clips am i gordon ramsay like what are you guys expecting for me do you care that much about my my my opinion because i don't cook anything because i hate it i don't know how to cut an onion well yeah no how do we dice an onion well that's a big onion look at that look at that onion that's a big old on y'all first of all whether what constitutes a good on you or good on you is a heavy horny one this is what i'm telling you is six pound on you okay six pound onion um doubt that would be kind of dangerous some people make it more complicated than it needs to be what was that what part kind of dangerous that would be kind of dangerous he has an actual knife on you on your that would be kind of dangerous out of context i don't know why that is so funny so i understand now these people are just meeting this dude who just calls the on onion onyo and apparently it's like a drinking game how many times he's gonna say i don't know but i'll i'll take a sip of water every time it does some people make it more complicated than it needs to be see the onion up and down what do we do with this and we have right here a perfectly diced onion okay on your just like that you see oh geez that was just water and i'm already bloated okay cheese you guys wanted a recipe what the [ __ ] just happened i know you like frank sinatra so you might like this okay they know my tastes oh no i'm looking at the lyrics start spreading the news [Music] looking at her she hit the floor [Music] i will not stand for this slaughter i didn't realize i never wanted it but i never needed to hear frank sinatra say flow charlie got low frankly that was terrifying i'm horrified because it was an absolute banger hey hey do it again how about bully mcguire never heard of him toby no i hope he pulls out like two baguettes instead of lightsabers he's got far too much power oh here it comes [Music] it's still impressive though [Music] go toby go toby still go the moves still got the moves [Laughter] don't do it toby how about get in there my man says how'd that get in there oh toby this was just

much i see it goku drip never gets sold [Music] and it has three and a half million views every time i see a license plate from another state uh this is pro uh pro zd yeah great guy i've seen some of his stuff and he ended up voicing uh flak or whatever in borderlands hey look at license plates from alabama wow that's so far from here i wonder what they're doing here is there some kind of event going on that is in fact not the state that we live in this was not the first time these two had had this conversation nor would it be the last constantly astonished by utter inanity within the mundane [ __ ] zone it's funny because i've kind of thought about that too like i guess you got nothing else better to do sir like a california license plate oh that's strange is that wyoming oh i got i have to watch this if you guys don't know the 112 you're about to learn you're about to be schooled i've never seen a 113 and i never [ __ ] will look at this pace to the day i died yes yeah yeah it's this one he's like going back through through his vods he's like wait which one was it right here it's this one my insane mind right here this is the 112. yeah this is one my insane pace it's crazy like later i'm getting goosebumps i can't tell you how many times i've gotten this but just how hype he's getting i get hyped yes [Music] what a rush it almost doesn't even sound like he's talking to the viewer it sounds like someone's like right next to him like he literally just like hey mom i did it like what honey like look at this mom yeah right here yeah see that see that pace right in the [ __ ] head yeah got a [ __ ] 112 baby yeah sorry bubba i'm i'm excited too that's right you see that clutchness i am [ __ ] clutch i am two quick ones i already know i'm getting no i'm getting there on the perfect line look at the [ __ ] pace look at look at his pace dude [Music] 47. that's [ __ ] it i think at that point he he had some sort of a stroke listen to him [Music] what 47. it's like i think he forgot to count he's like 48 oh shoot wait no what 47 baby baby that's [ __ ] right so high [ __ ] x [ __ ] punk's watching the mark roots i said oh my god it might be 112. and it was it [ __ ] is baby 112 to the day i died [Music] you guys didn't believe me this is my favorite this dude's in a whole like i'm jealous this dude's in another dimension right now [Music] oh god everybody makes fun of him for that [Laughter] this dude is popping he's feeling himself i am a legend now you all if you didn't already know what the 112 is now you do you're welcome one of my favorites all right well a lot to live up to am i pregnant am i pregnant am i parkant am i greg am i greg do you have something to tell me disclaimer if you have a young impressionable child or you don't want them to know about the birds and the bees um skip forward past this help is there a possibly that i'm pegrant i'm going to sound terrible but if if that's how they're asking like if they can't spell pregnant then i really hope they're not and i mean that in the best way possible i do because i want the kid to have a fighting chance and it seems like it's already downhill from here i'm sorry am i wrong am i pregnant or am i okay could i be pregonate how do i know if i'm prengan it's starting to sound like that one um pregone or whatever sounds like some kind of tomato sauce i get the pregnant day over here and while you're at it get some salt and some condoms please be pregnant do you care for pregante can you down a 20-foot water slide peg naps okay that's the most pressure pressing issue like oh my god finally they opened up that water park oh but i'm pregnant can i go down the slide we'll test the internet i would say if you have to ask there's your answer but then again it seems like these people will ask anything what happened when get purging at how can a nine-year-old get uh why are you even asking that no stop it will my get pragnan what is the best time to sex to become pregnant does it you know what i i always found weird when people congratulate you're like we finally like we're pregnant we finally did it after months of trying we did it everybody's like yes i'm so happy for you let's just let's put it into a different term okay just like just shift your perspective a little bit now imagine somebody's like oh my god we've been having sex so much and they've been mucking all inside of me for months and months so much [ __ ] oh my gosh and finally the muck did its job like wow congrats on sex dude like what is you want an award okay we get it you slash r slash i have sex okay like whatever bro it's really that's what that is it's just in i guess less crude terms the crazy thing is i think they're going through like every single one is almost a different way i did not realize with the amount of letters and pregnant that there are so many different outcomes dispelling it but i'm well the example hey here you go girlfriend ain't had periods since she got pre-gassed possible pregat come on there brother go ahead and go and get me down that pre-gap if a woman has starch marks on her wait if a woman has starch masks on her body does that mean does that mean she's been parking at before there are so many things wrong with this first off starch masks the heck that's terrifying but he's essentially saying if you break down the english if a woman has stretch marks have they been pregnant before all right this just in i've been pregnant a lot i have a lot of starch masks and i have had lots of pregnants little did i know has anybody got pergnut by just pre-cum while using birth control did most okay we're getting into some weird stuff here so i'm gonna keep this short what was it it was like anatomy class in like seventh grade eighth grade and i remember this dude raised his hand not the brightest of the bunch everybody kind of knows him to be you know raises his hand he's a bit of a rascal and i said yes question because we were going over uh you know anatomical stuff and whatever and kind of out of the blue he just goes you know and i'll use some different terms here for blessed sake if i muck on my fingers and then i insert them into my girlfriend could she get pregnant everybody's just in the class like what kind of a question is that i don't remember the answer i was too distracted like really at first that's such a specific case do you want us you want to talk about it um maybe that's not what i'm thinking about that's just what i want to go home mom pick me up i'm scared that is terrifying that's a lot of future mothers right there not that not that they can't become good mothers or fathers it's just it's just a worrying trend but they can always yeah okay it says don't know if you've seen this video before huh this looks familiar wait rob robbie v that sounds familiar oh wait is hawkmoon i think this is rob's most viewed video i literally just had him upload it to youtube so that i could rip it off and put it in the video because as you all know haha rob dismantled his hawkman way back in destiny 1. don't know why this is in my recommended but i do remember like rob hasn't touched this at all and it just gets recommended i don't understand youtube algorithm friendship and hawkmoon's have in fact been broken most popular yup i hate my friends this video will change your
