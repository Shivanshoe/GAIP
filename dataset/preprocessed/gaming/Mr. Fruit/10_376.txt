heidi everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to call of duty black ops cold war and in today's video well we're we're back playing the game i kind of talked about why we have an upload that boils down to you guys not watching it so crazy how that works anyway there's a brand new season and other things uh game mode wow i'm killing this intro man if you are new to the channel you're probably like this is garbage i'm clicking off and that's fair enough but we're getting into the gameplay let's go that's right it's that time again that i play call of duty black ops go door and there's a brand new season and i didn't know i got that because of that i got the brand new weapon assault rifle pharah83 i don't actually know what's supposed to be based off of either maybe um yeah i don't know but here's the good news rapid fire mosh pit baby call of duty at its finest here's your debriefing soldier fast-paced mosh bit of respawn game modes constant spots playing speed enabled ghost perk restricted lobby timer's reduced and it's all on smaller maps like nuketown crossroads raid garrison express and apocalypse what is not to love about this ladies and gentlemen i haven't played it myself but i know this is exactly what i want to do with my life and a lot of you like why haven't you played more black ops why didn't you guys watch it when i uploaded it dude i'm sorry ah so yeah i only have four level seven but i will say when using it it's a pretty good uh freaking also raffle it's pretty fun because what does it excel at high high fire rate muzzle velocity provides a relapse okay guess we'll never know what it excels at but it's time for nuke down what a quick 180 oh jesus jesus get down soldier oh what the fudge jesus lord help me what the [ __ ] what in the dickens and why is my fov right in my face okay i'm here to play the game now even though i don't know what the fudge they threw me in whatever it is though it is terribly i'll tell you that much what jesus i can't handle this right now and i have to tell you the volume is set to approximately blow out your eardrums i swear to god dude when people make video games these days they just don't account for people's hearings they're like hey what if we launch every game at 100 volume which is the equivalent of like a jet engine taking off in your brain not even near you okay well i'm getting a lot of action i guess i i guess i asked for this i didn't know i asked for for spawn camping but i guess that's part of the territory right i have nothing else to do except for shoot this giant metal bird i want to go oh what the fudge man let me live my life i wanna go home bro what what even is okay all right all right i don't know what the [ __ ] is it whatever okay so whatever that was let's take it from the top oh it's the brand new map apocalypse hey guys mr fruit here haven't played in uh four months but uh thanks for this lobby see that's a joke because i welcome death i welcome a good challenge you know i hop in here with a whole bunch of tryhards who've been just absolutely grinding this game i come in here joe schmoe haven't touched this in forever and boom fragging that's just what i do a map i hardly know i played once i'm practically watch this ready i knew he was going to be there and i knew i was going to die good street sniped it i forgot what button the crouch was good you know i'm starting to think this whole constant uav thing is working against me because it seems like people can just hold corners even more which i granted i guess the argument would be well then shouldn't i know they're holding the corner and yes but also no and the reason i didn't grind cold war in between doing videos is because well i don't have a lot of time and i've talked about this you know if if the game doesn't make for content and odds are i'm not playing it because i don't have that much time to play games outside of recording and stuff which is why i'm always bummed when i really like a game and then content-wise just what is my button for wait what oh gee what a fudge yo that's not my button i think i think when i because i'm on a new pc right now because if you didn't know my other one just absolutely blew up so waiting for that to get fixed so yeah temporary setup and i'm starting to think my controls were were computer based not account based or something because yeah none of this none of this is right none of this makes sense but look at the range look at the crispiness look at the coward i'm sure that'll hit somebody oh my god okay and suddenly i'm back suddenly i'm back baby dublin sliding those dm's like i'm sorry they were closed dms were closed i tried though it doesn't matter what map we're playing seems like whatever we do we're just getting spawn camped isn't that great this uh i don't even know you could be there i'll be there for you unless you're on top of that truck then i'll try to kill you oh holy jesus hey boner one boner two and every other boner on my team what are we doing because whatever it is we're failing to do it i don't know if we're trying to push up because we're not doing that okay dude we'll kill see am i am i the one playing the game out here bop throw that in there oh my god i'm burning somebody nice radar bop did that i see molotov around the corner i'm ready for it i'm running back uh huh it's all about showing restraint i'm in so much pain though okay yo look look at these guys just go just go don't be afraid my badass yeah i'll do it for you ready don't be afraid see what are you guys afraid of right now skirt uh-huh even though they know i'm coming for them they can't stop this i am inevitable oh jesus i set him on fire he should die he should die right he died but he is friends i like the range on this thing though oh wait what is this thing the lc10 do i have this is this simulator when did this come out this is fun is this an smg well i guess i'll never know it seemed like it was an smg but i'm not sure also i just realized i have a spy plane kind of redundant like what is it really accomplishing not much i would say they're gonna try and flank me but oh no they flanked my team and it did work it definitely worked no i know you can be on top of that truck now and i'm pushing back after reloading try me throw some fire over there fire and brimstone baby holy cow i can't there's too many i did see him but problem i saw i saw another person i knew another person was tail i mean there's like eight different people and my my i i must be the only one getting kills right now it it really feels like that uh it might as well might as well right best play let's go that's me boom kill boom kill oh wait no i didn't and i didn't kill him wait this was the best play imagine i gotta kill her four spoilers i didn't but we can pretend oh okay i mean a bit of a stretch on the best play of the game there but okay you know with all that said i i'm nearly a 2kd so all things considered it could be going way worse kind of proud of myself i'm going to capture this zone yes it's the starter zone but you know i'm going to take those free points neutral position secured you bet your little butt it is look at that secure of course he's sitting i should have known he seems like one of those degenerates trust me i know a degenerate when i see one because i'm a degenerate it's like an unspoken rule degenerates just you know what they they know oh you know what i know there's a uav and i understand that and i use the uav and then for some reason i just think they don't have a uav but that's not how that works we all have uavs you have a uav you have a uav i have a uav we all have uavs you are very dead my friend apologies there i'm just going to destroy that okay sit over here bop my friend is getting toasted yeah roasty toasty get the marshmallows and sit by the campfire because we are making a melt s'mores melt s'mores ah we're on that one didn't i what are we shooting skirt oh wait what you can go up oh my god sir you just got embarrassed and i i missed the radar that's a bit okay they're behind me no they're not what's going on here the fact that i know i can shoot from here though super big brain look at that look at that look at that oh i even destroyed that okay let's get it oh oof you appear to be in pain friend gotta kill you gotta kill i'm out i ain't getting greedy oh same turret it doesn't matter come on try me uh huh uh i'm baiting him with these uavs i didn't have enough penetration but if i did do it they came in with protection and i did not remember kids wrap it up because i'm talking about a burrito dude come on if you get a burrito right there's a lot in it you don't want it to leak out so you need to wrap that up put some tinfoil around it or something come on you're not an animal seriously ah you must be a psychopath if you eat a burrito just as is like you you grab it from the tortilla and that's just how you're eating it burrito hole you know there needs to be a layer of protection between you and your hand otherwise you're doing it wrong you're getting messy when you don't have to you know good food does call for some messy hands and stuff sometimes but a burrito that doesn't have to be the case you're not a savage okay i don't care if it's tinfoil i don't care if it's paper towels wrap it up just don't double wrap because it's counterintuitive you know what i'm saying i know i know look i pre-fired just knew he's gonna be sitting in a stupid one oh baby okay yo try me okay the recoil is kind of nuts though i i really can't control it with like that tiny of a window okay whatever screw you know what you guys live your life over are you kidding me i'm the only one they killed where'd you get sniped from buddy i don't feel safe [Music] he's got diamond huh yeah why why would i grind you know the camos which is usually if i'm playing call of duty that's what i'm going to do if you guys watch my modern warfare videos you know that we went for damascus i got it no big deal pretty much died along the way but that's irrelevant but that's what i'm saying it gives me something to go for it gives me some content guidelines you know like there's an overarching theme you know it's it's the damascus arc in our call of duty videos and i am so very dead skirt you have a shotgun of course you do but i'm just not going to put in that time and that frustration if it ain't going to be for the content you know what i'm saying plus dark matter and everything in this game so underwhelming or whatever they're calling it ironically i think i should put on the other site back again what am i doing i can't make up my mind it's high your friendly neighborhood produce on the scene check this out skirt asserting my dominance in this lobby already we playing it slow what's the what's the match for looking like because i'm about to turn it up to 12 baby i did not get that kill oh shut up everybody shut up [ __ ] oh my god there's so many of them hook up he's on fire i pressed the wrong button again this is not my usual key bindings so oh [ __ ] oh my god oh my god that's embarrassing i'm almost out of hand oh granada just checking those nades left and right eventually it's going to work uh huh i'm i'm pre-looking you know me oh my god the target acquisition on these what did jesus who's mike this out i think that scared me more than the dude what the another dude definitely just came anywhere i'll be honest but here we go i know you're down here and you're creeping around boy i can smell you but whatever i'll i'll let it go because i ain't messing with that voodoo boom throw a molotov i knew you were going to come around bop you're dead now watch me come around uh-huh reload real no no no this is my moment no go for my friend i had to reload maybe those 40 mags would have been a good idea i'd just say check this out though that's a good throw that's a good toss it hit no one that's incredible wait a second there's somebody right here ow what i'm blinded not not exactly i'm just hamming it up hamming it up for the audience at home you know what i'm saying all right can i can i get a little pixie doodle out here come on i'm a cheater oh really they're over this way get on the u-boat or what exactly is this thing called i don't know all right they'll never know nobody thinks to look on the boat it paid off finally i knew it would i never doubted it all right i'm going to be honest that's about as far as my attention span goes go go go go go um oh my god like i'm saying the range on this thing is i'm here for it i'm here for it and i am nearly dead because of it oh scratch that i am dead for it all right this can't hurt that bad right well where are you getting shot from oh i'm parachuting all right that might be a little bit of an overkill and let's just go ahead and let the entire enemy team know that we're perishing into ow come on that's just my dead friend you can't fool me they're they're watching down here okay like i said i like the range but man i can't if you can't control the bronco which oh jesus christ most times it's complete complete random luck happened chance somebody we gotta stop you mcgee i repeat we gotta stop you mcgee too many stopping mcgee's i can't keep up how copy another shopping mcgee imagine not using ninja couldn't be me black ops literally changed for me as soon as i unlocked ninja so i was like all right this is what it's like to not run around going hey guys you hear that yeah wait you're not even in my game i know that's how far i can hear him like that's kind of kind of how that works again i know a little hyperbolic that's pretty much my my oh pretty much my primary language i'm bilingual in english and hyperbole those are the two things that i communicate communicating and i've really nailed the hyperbole bit here is a uav my friend which is important because unlike the other game mode we don't have it all the time they have a sanford or something that is revenge i still died for it but that's for me oh i thought i got the double kill and then i did that makes me sad and the flip on the spots of course classic all right skirt first to the line of sight and it didn't matter i guess okay counter uav and bound or camera spy plane what are they called in this generation time zone time zone what am i trying to say not a time zone in this what the fudge of i can't think of the word hold on i'm sure i'm still thinking about it i would i can't think of the word oh my god is just going to trigger me and i want to look it up but it'll take me the rest of this match what am i trying to say in in this designated set of time i am it's a it's a piece of time and it's not history but ah timepiece no no no no no no no and i can't think of the word i can't see the words driving me crazy how about i just drive the enemies insane instead go sam turn that's a terrible place to place it oh i hear stomping mcgee stare he is hey big fan buddy big fan stomp around some more why don't you you son of a that's what you get that's for sammy ooh death machine that's a brand new kill streak i do believe right i'm pretty sure it is pretty positive here we go whatever i'm making use of it yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a sentry turret over there boys careful here we go here we go here we go wow yo that thing's pretty good i quite like that give me another although i probably don't have the time to do that you know it's like i never left it's like i never left and you know what the death machine almost made me forget about the fact that i can't think of that certain word but now i'm reminded of it and now i'm triggered again oh what am i thinking what am i thinking ah who's shooting the fudge oh there he is yeah good job buddy oh there's another one oh screw you bird em yeah whatever that's totally worth it no no there's death machines everywhere hold on hold on i got your team i got you there's gonna be a death machine right over here there it is there it is you can't escape me and my keen eyes and my thirst for revenge and my magnum fudge yeah if i'd not pulled that out i'd still be alive but i still can't think of the word i'm thinking about uh is it maybe it doesn't even have time and the thing it's just holy jesus not era that's not right either just god i'm i'm literally still racking my brain about it i can't believe i got that kill and i live to tell the tale that's incredible here we go hold up hold up wait a minute is he back here yes he is oh my god i'm doing everything right now even when trying to rethink of this stupid word that i can't rethink point is i'm cracked point is that hurt holy cow okay you know let me just go ahead and desk pop sheet down here real quick desk this is something something something something something i'm out here fighting for my life team come on where are you guys oh hold up hold up what do we got down here what do we got donny huh hold on there's another one another bogey another tango and we lost really i did pretty well i did pretty well oh jesus oh never seen that before nice little purple diamonds or whatever you got there nuts your nuts your nuts dreams cracked that's so nice of them to line up for you cheer unlocked just 79 more to go probably not going to finish it be nice look at all these things unlocked you know in my time away did they ever fix the weapon xp because that was another thing the weapons had no right to take that long to level up like how how they did because that was ridiculous anyway that's called the black ops cold board there is another new season pass gun as well if you guys want to check that out or if you just want to see some more again depends on anybody watches this video a lot of people are like yo where's it at you know what modern warfare was was pretty well received in it you know people watched it coldborn not so much plus i know a lot of the kids these days are all about warzone i literally can't play warzone i would have been locked out of my account since before halloween because i remember i wanted to play the halloween zombies update and i couldn't and i still can't get in it literally is stuck on connecting the services and just says disconnected activision has refused to help me so you know what screw it who cares about warzone or sounds stupid anyway i prefer apex legends i said it i'm just going to keep rambling uh have yourselves a fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
