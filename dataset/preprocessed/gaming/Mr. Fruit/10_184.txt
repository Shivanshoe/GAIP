oh my god i don't know i turned off all audio because i just can't trust anyone no that's fair and it is a response especially you and that too okay what okay our guy is standing still okay we don't need him then he is we just have to explore on our own discover okay let's go i'm ready i'm ready i'm pinging this okay i'm following you mr fruit let's go let's go joey i'm ready wait housing 933 doesn't seem to be with us but luckily we have each other and that's all we really need right okay yeah got a couple baddies but not real baddies you know artificial baddies you're the only real baddie i see oh how'd you know i'm um all right this should give us some health it's big okay okay that's all there is here though so we should probably worry about the storm there's this random thing the other one near us is another health thing we i think we got enough health right now we don't need that we're good yeah no one's even shot at us yet wait i'm kidding all right get ready to absolutely poop oh right in front of me [Music] [Applause] three people good because i got the flank i i hit one's armor hit another armor i broke his armor i think they're all coming for you joey i broke yeah [ __ ] are they let's go i'm so sorry i gotta eat i gotta eat man yo pick berries i was going for the vegan there's berries right here and we killed those deers well i need me i need protein too yes i was going for that all right so i don't we're in third place point wise we're not doing great i'm gonna be honest no i mean we took out another squad and now we're gonna go find some stuff i got that guy i want to like the bow i am going in but i feel like i get outclassed by everything i'm going to start uh scavenging the crystal because because that's the obj point that's obj yeah we need points again if you find a gun locker let me know uh they just shot out a bunch of flares wait who did uh i don't know whoever's here the ai or like real people i don't know now you're making me worried well there was some flares so i mean they could easily just roll up on us right now and i'm not ready for that okay well this root i will protect you i have two guys oh wait i can i can craft my signature god knows i need it all right all right we've looted this place let's go stay mobile we're going over here now are you good oh geez do i homie there's just a lot of zombies on me and you know the whole thing proud of you okay i'm ready though i'm ready i'm coming you're the best of us well now that's what i'm saying signature weapon two wow so we got the points that were here right we're in second mister we're not doing too bad yeah okay i love that why don't we just go kill the boss wait what i just got sniped i know who's hitting us was that helsing and he just accidentally no i don't think so just right just right here we go rod oh my god i could use this think didn't you build your signature weapon like a while ago yeah but now i can get rid of the i like bows all right wait that's not us we got tangles do we yeah you heard that oh never mind it's just that dude okay keep going keep going the vip we're going i'm shoddy oh okay time is of the essence also remember to remember to craft if you can i don't have enough points for anything but that's not cool i import don't either so well i have a thermal boost which increases my temperature but i think if you get a little nothing too chilly but yeah i'm gonna save it for the shield that seems like you know the play okay it sounds like they're fighting the boss oh yeah the bounty's gone or is it crap we gotta stop them before they kill them them as their bounty or as our bounty i'm looking forward they're fighting oh oh yes they are oh it's oh it's just different ai factions fighting each other uh oh okay so the enemy is moving against themselves yeah exactly take him out come on over i broke one armor almost i broke one arm right he's got it there's a vote is running don't worry i got him with oh jesus we got him let's oh that was so that was so many we're second we're second that's good but but we there's whites over here there's bears in this game i know the rv bars i didn't want to mess with them though i was gonna say we were literally just talking about running into bears now we have the chance and you're running away well why do you have to make it sound like that i'm just saying also yeah i have every other ammo except um okay there's a supply drop uh how many do you need on me oh jesus oh it's a full team on me boys there's a bear on me hold on i'm coming again bear on me but whatever guess i'm supposed to come help you out they're opening the package maybe we can get them after they opening that supply drop because we don't have enough or we just kill them i'm pushing he's looting he's looting i broke his armor i'm i got him one left somewhere okay i'm thirsty no shame in my game that's right okay well the good news is uh i got a resurrection oh oh look there's there's another one right here okay okay now let's go kill the vip access we're in second but barely this is combackable oh wait wait wait uh guys on me actual team on me okay oh crap okay hold on uh okay well i'm using it this pistol better be good because uh all right that's all i have i'm gonna sneak up on him okay oh my god yeah right on my way yeah there's more guys sliding down the hill so watch yourself oh yep also wait oh i think there's like two teams here our guy died so he's i broke armor he left the game oh two people are fighting two teams i need your help oh my god i'm stunned okay i killed it under fire it ain't going well mr vote where are you what do you mean where am i i'm here oh you are in the middle of the action okay yeah there's a few teams uh we are not any of them on the hill on the hill on me i mean i'm i'm on my way mister trophy i need you to know i need you to know we are in the best position we are in the worst position possible mr vote doesn't matter there's like eight people here we're killing him right on top of the hill there was somebody he's right there hit him with the shotgun gun with a shotgun again let's go dude this is an explosive pistol what the look at this thing ready i'm here i'm here for it oh my god yeah okay we are in first wait there's only two teams left you and us oh okay okay that's good though right but i'm pretty sure they're around us oh my god this dude's coming for him we got to take him out if we can get this kill practically cements our victory okay i'm with that it's broken light them up oh light them up i am really on fire i only have like pistol ammo so i'm doing what i can let's go grab the stuff grab the stop oh we're so okay we're so in the lead baby we have to be right honey i gotta heal up because i'm in trouble there's another vip over there though it just depends on what they're doing though oh can they even catch up because we're kind of bad i don't know i feel like they could i mean there's a thing for a hundred another one for 75. we're not up by 100 if we keep killing these small guys we'll just keep getting points oh oh oh they're only up by five points uh-oh the only problem is i don't even know if i have ammo to kill this thing and also i don't know if i want to kill this thing it's terrifying i'm still in a shotgun what so that's what we're rocking what the fudge is that what i don't know i'm shooting that's the thing that is disgusting that shouldn't be allowed only i had more ammo we ascend like if we don't get this dude we lose this is it let's get the dude i'm officially out of ammo on everything i'm coming i literally have no ammo do you have enough ammo for that i think so uh oh i don't think i have enough ammo for that to shoot the other people god i wish i could help that's your friend why why couldn't you scavenge like the game intended you i tried well i'm i'm gonna make some grenades it takes 15 seconds though and by that i mean i'm making one oh my god he just shoulder charged me this is he okay he's weak this is pretty weak i'm i'm doing i'm throwing an angel i'm throwing aid i think i missed okay oh my god i missed it i'm
