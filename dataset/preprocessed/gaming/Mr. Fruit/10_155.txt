spiders there's a spider guy just chilling oh spider guy spider guy spits at me i want to die oh you did what the hell that was guess what i got a defibrillator what yeah i spent 500 on that so you better do something hey yes sir exploded on the explorer bought it for me if you had died i wouldn't have told you i had it my god i mean what i said that out loud crap thanks i got you don't shoot teammates yeah i got that i was protecting my my man i'm 16 here if anyone wants it i got to warn you guys this next part is real bad real bad i don't know okay we got to go up here but then it's going to be a gigantic cord and it's so should we set up up upstairs and then just we're not sure yet hold on there's some loot here anybody need ammo any ammo uh needers all right max health already 40 out of 40 baby am i uh could i get some assault rifle ammo you bet uh i have a 145 on me how much you need are you using it yeah oh well then where'd it go oh i'm not here mr fruit uh where did it come right over here i thought i dropped it ooh fire axe let's let's decide what we're doing here yeah let's find it all right we're gonna go up here it's gonna call the horde i don't and they come from way way way way way way way look at what we got here um whoa what that do not see that nice magazine it says start the gravel filler calls the rock i swear to god if you click that button i don't know what a haraday is can we stab you in the face with a spoon oh no i don't know not doing anything about that okay watch out for the horde boys oh but he's coming for me i got you i got you how's he not oh there's another one on me i got him no i'm dead arios yeah i'm okay mr fruit i'm in a super resident spot right now i've been him worse i'm actually reserved mr free if you kill this arms guy he's weak oh [ __ ] me behind mr fruit here what do you think ariel so you think he makes this one he's built for situations like this he's built for moments like this it's built for you got two systems you got two arms mcgee's on you the spiders are on me right now okay good jump versatile we like it oh good man oh he's a melee god okay yeah it's just two spiders on me i'm almost dead though i'll be real with you oh walnut right next to you oh nice nice goes with the melee coming up on you yeah you're you got to run just take care of the zombies a hammer man with the arm with good shot there fruit disengages see how he plays this final round here okay there's two of the oh no they're both uh coming for you but you're you're making some space though any defibrillator nope unfortunately i would if i could you know i would it was used on areas yeah that wasn't even the main thing like the main horse i will have to stop the next cord i guess okay you know you did good on this one you're doing great kitty you got hard you know i also learned that they have a crit spot on their other shoulder what yeah like the one with the big arm if you shoot the big arm you can just shoot it off it's so easy i hate you i'm out of stamina so much almost out of hp too yeah but my stamina region is like non-existent if i don't get a kill all right let's see if that ain't one v1 gosh you're a gamer man this is impressive though regardless of how this is nice hey let's see it what i think there should be some more ammo in that package that i opened up because i didn't take it all what goes through your head in situations like this like what are you thinking wait bob mom can you get me up oh heck yeah finally someone useful let's get it dude what do you mean that's sucker why isn't ariel's here though i was actually the first to go down so that's weird okay all right here's the plan put that right right at the the bottom of this ring right oh fudge put it down okay okay okay when they come up here we're gonna shoot that and run out okay hold shoot shoot out the left as long as we can um okay shoot it go you know i was like keep going keep going keep going okay you guys have like let me count one two three all right you keep going left your left your left your left right melee melee nice easy you got more left side look at this fall right now he's locked in he's dead i'm dead oh red oh wow ah gosh oh we have no continues never mind no continuing uh what the [ __ ] why are we not getting yeah you know what's going through my head at times like that areas what's that what's going through my head is why am i in this situation well it's going through my head yeah yeah and part of that is my bra is my is my fault and i take accountability for that that's on me that balls on me i gotta be better you know we can all be better arios i think but that's the really takeaway here you know you messed up you know what that's human and and and that that's what makes us different from the zombies all right right so so mr fruit is there anything you could have improved about last uh okay so nothing mr fruit could have improved on but you know me and aries we got some stuff to work on i didn't know that door did the horde yeah i didn't know i didn't know that or else i i wouldn't have not have done it you know yeah and that's the thing right we learn we learn next time to read that says alarm will sound when bright is open right reading comprehension that comes first um that's on me however we we move on we grow all right we grow from however i can't grow anymore today i need to go guys what i know i hate to leave you uh here no more growing today no because your download grew for so long so i gotta yeah i gotta um i gotta bounce though guys but um thanks for playing ariel's hopefully you guys can find a fourth or fill in because i hate to leave you guys with just three i know it's already hard enough but all right thanks sirius it was good playing with you it was i'll talk to you guys soon okay i love you i love you too no just saying i love you too see you guys good luck well we'll need it we're never going to make progress on this yo meet me give me it get in here don't worry ding ding ding come on you like this like that like that take that you like that give him no give him the ryan give him a round give him a laugh yeah we are uh-huh you want in on this yeah there's a ring that's good the ropes i think oh my god wait a second he's rearing up yeah i just need a desk you think a bat with nails in it would be that effective in a zombie apocalypse um i think you'd really be wanting to get that close no well i think the issue with that is that you would hit a zombie in the head with the with the nail bat and it would get stuck in the head yeah oh yeah so you'd have to really force it back out so that could be a bit of a problem because then the thing stuck to your yeah but then it's kind of mushy brain though so it's not like a firm brain that's the thing though are you just gonna be doing better with like maybe even a katana kind of thing or like you know a sword because even if it's dull like just like you what what george washington i think it's too valuable not to have a melee weapon shower cap later [Laughter] fire crackers go with my fire axe possible to go with your fire drip dude this part with full health though we got this oh we don't got this oh yeah i do guys god i hate shower cap man me too it's like the hunter from left 4 dead left for dead never i wasn't i was on the back what did you mean that game that copied back for blood at least that's what the [ __ ] did you hear that now who's that was the colonel i want you why don't you be on flank duty okay hanging in the back watching behind
