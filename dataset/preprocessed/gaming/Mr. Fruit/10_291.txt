heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the last spell i'm enjoying this game and those of you watching are enjoying it as well which is fantastic and i'll have you know i jumped into a random stream of somebody playing it real quick and boy oh boy does it get crazy they had like six different heroes there were like catapults trebuchets it was wild so just go show we've got a lot to go a lot more to experience and unlock and that excites me which is exactly why we're here back at it again with some more last spell so if you haven't watched the previous ones i would encourage you implore you to go watch them and give them a try pretty fun game with that so let's get into it alrighty then my friends we're back day one has come and passed i believe we've made all the proper preparations so we're gonna go ahead and end our phase uh did see some comments though big brain about how making use of different item sets can actually be really good because let's say we have like like well how we do right now five action points and maybe the bow it's regular shot you can only use four times let's say you have an extra shot and you're like man this bow doesn't work boom you could switch like the crossbow and apparently i'm a pleb and the crossbow can be super good you just gotta invest in a whole bunch of multi shots or something i don't know i'm not there yet clearly so we're gonna go ahead and get started i need to deploy [Music] i need to put him somewhere i'm worried he's gonna get him i don't think he's gonna get hit here though but i don't have a gate so he's gonna have a hard time coming back in which uh whatever that's fine you guys are just gonna sit right behind these things uh we'll actually just put you right next to each other isn't that cute all right um wait can i already use this i think i could i don't know if that does anything um maybe i sh oh maybe i could armor myself i don't know and then i'll give myself an extra point i don't know if that's how any of this works but i know we're gonna find out there i go in the face let's see what happens if this get in this case you know if we do get hit here oh we're not even we're fine we'd be big chilling and we are and we have all of our ap back yeah so what do you know now i got to get back to trying to big brand this with my shish kebab here much easier said than done if i go here can i go all the way behind no so let's say i didn't do that what if i did this i could do that then i have two movement left and i've all but boned myself so wait what oh i said what the fudge it's because we swamped the weapon set see i understand now all right what do we want from you some good damage how about that chief that's uh yeah that'll do that'll do pig um we'll finish you off then go for the omega boosh go for the omega boosh you're nuts dude absolutely correct so i mean at this point i don't know maybe we just kind of keep our friend here at bay i really want to kill the runner though okay we're going to move over here do you not have line of sight oh you do oh taking a little bit more than i thought it would it is unfortunate i could go here slice over there and move i don't know if that's the play could go like this skirt well i did it so i'm gonna give you an extra turn wait oh you oh does that give some movement oh i didn't realize well that's quite nice let me go ahead and armor you up and arm are you up again you have two more points so let's take out some of the people out of range take you out bada bing bada boom two action points yeah but i can't do anything with them perfect nobody's gotten hit yet they're already starting to hit our defenses which is a button um it's back to our archer we have to be careful with this freaking man of man and it's sacks quite frankly it's terrible i don't want this oh we got a lot of runners and they're trying to uh be sneaky over here so i'm gonna have to probably take care of all them please okay i'm hoping we once shot all of them it's looking pretty good okay you over here uh you got you got a task ahead of you let me tell your friend um yeah god positioning matters so much with him it's quite difficult difficile if you will yeah and i always click the wrong button for that you have to click delete like actual delete button like who the fudge whoever puts their hands near the insert and home page up page now button you know what i'm saying nobody or at least not me so clearly nobody uh i think we might have used some mana here let's focus the right side probably this gives us four targets this gives us six all right now we're just gonna go for everybody here nice damage buddy as always can always count on you so let's go for some multi hits here requires line of sight my anus you what all right fine just come back here then you boner uh go here here there there there not as much as i'd hoped but we'll make do dodged literally right in front of me and they dodged it that's incredible okay i can slice through all those that is tempting i'm gonna think about that the fact that we missed this is tragic uh and unless i kill this the armor's just gonna regenerate so i'm gonna not kill him and then uh i guess we're just gonna chill in the depths of hell what fudge am i doing uh yeah yeah yeah okay we're gonna whack you whack you over there and we're in and out like a bandit very good well done well done that's quite a few of them our defenses are in shambles and by that i mean we have okay well the good news is i think we pretty much see everybody left 43 of them it's a good bit but where there's a will i hope there's a way like this whole thing what am i going to do about this should i gander i think i just gotta hit him up like this and then we're like out of mana aren't we practically i have to replenish my man yeah you're telling me uh we could go for a multi hit here this might be the play hopefully we get all these guys big okay kill that guy dodged what is wrong with you who hurts you uh just finish this runner omega this dude and then we gotta take out we're just barely out of range of range oh my gosh still out of range take you out i gotta take out the runners before they get out of control here we're gonna go back a little bit you're out you should probably get back a little bit they're going to be upon us before we know it uh i might just start slicing dicing here uh-huh how much money do we have three we'll be left with one movement here ooh it's too dicey gotta keep playing it safe you're do it great buddy i'm afraid if i go over here we're gonna take some damage but we might not their movement is four uh yeah so they could hit me so maybe i'll just go right here armor up even though i don't think anyone can reach us anyway i could also just kind of use that as a movement tool but we'll just arm up just to feel good about using my action points all right and this is the last of them would appreciate if you didn't hit my walls like that my dudes uh kind of really like those and need those frankly all right yeah it's time to use the rest of our mana here this seems to be the best deal what a steal uh you got no more mana my my man is almost depleted uh no correction your mana is deleted friend uh i think i just gotta oh oh you think you're slick do you uh i don't think i can't target you fudge okay we'll do a little bit of this a little bit uh that i guess okay we're gonna have to use more mana screw it finish you boosh and you have no more anything left so okay you got three i'll save one for you let's omega u um omega u and then hope we don't miss that would be really bad okay we're good you have no action points you have no action points all right now let's see what we can what kind of trouble we can get up to with you huh all right so we're gonna slice we're gonna slice we're gonna slice we're gonna dice i love the sword man okay how many people if i go this way i can get hit by one but i think that's best because i limit the amount of things that can hit me to a singular person yeah i'm at least an old choke the only problem is though i'm gonna have a hard time getting back to people but yeah we'll figure it out he he just absolutely fragged that so that's so funny he's like and they didn't even go after him okay never mind they have one objective hit my walls the boners oh this is nice what do we have here some easy prey silly dilly um okay i'm gonna try and save his mana from now on we have no more movement though well that's not good no is it uh i could give you a little bit more i think right it gives you two move points okay well let's just omega you get out me fess uh omega you bop uh i am going to give you some more movement get back an action point you're back at it my friend kind of want to stop the people hitting my walls frankly uh i think the best way to do it if i do this this that that ah seven health you gotta be kidding me uh so we're not gonna finish everybody here unfortunately trying to think you still have some moves left okay how much damage we're looking at not quite a one shot oof this is tragic all right you know what skirt we'll use some magic why not oh out of range my anus okay oh wait oh my god i can't um okay give you another action point whoops a successful night i think yes pretty much everybody's back with mana that's good uh our walls took a beating though so if they come back from that side it's gonna be rough but an s only 15 hp lost wait who took damage i don't remember anyone taking damage have i been lied to something must happen guess i wasn't paying attention but that's a perfect city protection which is great because we get neither we like items uh give me that tainted essence yes sir knight two with an s score dilly all right now we got them coming both ways of course check menu where's yarg when you wears nothing you just give us production right what you want about right now look at that 196 building materials we like that okay let's go ahead and grab us some blighted tainted essence things whatever um okay so new havens without plus one major k see i don't know what that means but i think i just keep investing an extra mana on heroes screw it we also unlocked uh some special uh i think why are you helping me by that i mean give me my free stuff what is this survive tonight at or under level zero of city panic aha we did that five times we got a new spear longbow and power staff and we've gathered enough gold so the gold mine building password generating some gold [Music] i love passive things now of course it all costs gold but okay so this improves production effect and this upgrades scavenge uses and get too interesting love to dissect here let's start with kulb also ah actually actually wait wait wait wait wait wait let me get my rewards what do we get here okay we could get a trinket which gives extra propagation bounces and extra critical damage with a stun chance dodge with armor physical damage that could be pretty good for our friend durant here pretty good or extra block and how yeah that doesn't sound okay we're gonna go with this yeah and then extra materials don't mind if i do so let's go to his character sheet put on new fancy stash for you then what perk do i want to give you somebody did tell me apparently the fatality thing does not take an action point so that could be very interesting he could just kind of run around and finish people off and frankly you know what let's try it we'll we'll learn together won't we friends all right so called wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait i didn't give him his uh yeah wait what what oh yeah i was like uh that's a lot of extra health i'm gonna do that yeah um extra mana regen can't hurt i think we might just go with that yeah why not we'll just take some of the first stuff we get perks for you my magic friend probably you currently don't have propagation but the likelihood that we do get it could be did you get extra multi hits oh see with a crossbow that could be good right it could be real good oh let's let's just go with this anyway then we're going to give you could give you don't use movement at all really just give you extra magic damage i don't i'm not feeling the gamba yes i am what am i saying paid off that's like an extra five percent magic damage um this one gamba it's not as good i guess just propagation damage we don't do propagation yet but i'm investing into the future of the potential of propagation you my archer fiend if i gave you a crossbow we could also go with the other thing but temperature and extra damage ain't bad um minus dodge isn't bad also probably pretty important for us but for now i'm just going to give you extra xp script and then we need to go no thank you ball hauls paid off extra range damage daily health regen no healing received nah experience gain nah gamba we'll go with more accuracy the feeling we're gonna need that okay so we got some workers we can build some structures we got we got passive materials currently going so it wouldn't hurt to possibly invest in a gold mine passively getting some gold we could go for the manuel to give us mana in between but right now we don't need it that much we could do the temple to top up him or our wizard or sorcerer but it's not too pressing so we could just try and get just start building this stuff and hoping we get like see we'd get a random defensive item a melee item a ranged item a magic item i'm thinking screw we're gonna go with a magic shop feeling crazy and we automatically unlock what it looks like uh can i maybe all right it takes a hundred gold okay oh balls paid off a rare wand holy jesus plus one extra critical extra critical yeah don't mind if i do oh it had like different rods and stuff i should have checked that but i think without a doubt this was the better play is this this is one-handed but i guess you can't like dual wield uh so yeah this one just has better base damage and 10 extra critical damage if we crit i reckon not gonna say no see that already paid off uh i feel like more workers can't hurt though should we do that i'm thinking so okay now we're gonna destroy you for some gold and we're gonna destroy you for some gold we have enough materials um that's all the goal i got for that wait did i did i break it the wrong way ah fudge i don't think i did did i yeah maybe i did you really just don't get that much coal oh rip me okay so we're not gonna be changing that we do have two more workers though we can take this out for 44 gold which still doesn't really give us anything oh or does it we could get a better sword and we've already seen how raw the sword is better damage we get momentum and critical power way better base damage um extra health and resistance man fish resistance daily health reason magic damage and critical i only have enough to buy one though you know we're investing in our night for durand because you deserve it buddy okay so i have a feeling there's really no point in saving these right i could make like a second gear set but with those weapons i wouldn't really say it's worth it right i don't think so it will just sell them where do i where do i go to sell take it take it take it uh we could get a scroll or maybe a potion for what some mana plus five mana i think we're chilling right now though i think we're chilling like a couple of villains could get a regular crossbow but we already have no no i like our current bow that's about that uh we should build some defenses i concur let's go with um a gate here and a gate here i don't know uh i wanted to reinforce walls but we just can't afford that yet and i would rather just have the whole thing yeah see hog i think that's worth it okay that's pretty much all we got but we'll do it okay on to the next night position your heroes where are thee all right position you you will be in the front perhaps preparing for death um wait oh wait what happened to your oh does this not come with oh this one doesn't allow me to give myself more armor i guess interesting it's not a big deal i rarely use it i'll get a little fur though so sick uh you're gonna see right here i don't think they can reach you gamba and yeah oh oh my god oh but they're coming from oh my god am i just the dumbest totally just wanted to forget about the fact that they're coming from both sides apparently well the good news is there's going to be a lot in a second but there's only currently one runner yikes it's embarrassing he really can't move that far uh what's the range i won't be able to hit anything so i might as well do what i can here because if i can make it so that he can just chill there not too shabby we're gonna shoot you can i we literally have nothing left to shoot okay is she able to make it i don't think so who should we send over i think we send the archer over here but then again i guess we could kind of do both right okay i'm going to give you a little bit more movement speed i don't think that's going to let you get in range no uh all right not my best 10 action points remaining i know but there's nothing i can do all right pray for me okay well they're already hitting the gate the fudge stupid archers that's not fair um well let's let's get to work i reckon bring in all right omega you boosh uh you have armor so maybe omega you take out the archer i hate him all right there's all your action points you my friend can start prancing around right uh like that um i don't think i want to do this okay not bad he's probably gonna get hit though uh yeah this guy can reach him be fair that's it uh wait so who can reach him this guy could also just give him another movement thing thinking about it let's hit this bat shoe bat shoe runner god i can't kill anything though uh kind of just want to chill here in between for now give me an extra action point aha now they can't re-trim perfect you don't have any action points left right no okay double check we're good all right ooh a lot action on the left for now yeah so we might uh oh my god the archer good news though is armor made it so we didn't get hit oh that's gonna be annoying to deal with so many of you i think that archer might be better over here well you know what they say yeah they get busy shishka bobbing or you i don't know i'm gonna leave me with one movement though it's not great so instead we're just gonna oh i wanna do this if i kill here yeah whatever we're just gonna start making moves he'll you did not die well that's not good uh i don't know if this is gonna kill him just leave me with three movement it did kill him it's good news might have to give him an extra action point to get him out of there uh you my friend just need to start killing things line of sight such how am i going to get line of sight though yeah we might flex you okay i'm going to give you an extra action point and then i want to say this guy can handle this side on his own kind of can he i don't know we're going to move you back there um maybe like a going away gift you're out of range uh [Music] what are the odds this thing dodges you know hog not good it's the answer all right let's fudge not as much damage as i was hoping do um really i can't see it from there i see it from here well not really well it's not great out of range you have to be kidding me all right well no aoe for now take out the archers all right now your time to shine buddy old pal uh how are you gonna shine it's a good question this is all you can do but you know what it's something buddy all right and we got to stab those demon bats oh fudge he broke through that wall holy suck our walls never stood a chance okay looks like i might need to come back here what's our best course of action here that's pretty good looking not too shabby if i do say so myself uh fish shish kebab and shish kebab nobody can reach if we go here i don't think well maybe the archers but all right so then looks pretty good to me out of range you want me oh there we go not quite dead uh let's just finish off i don't know if i'm gonna finish him off we're gonna try nice screw your armor okay you are not this strong i'm gonna be honest chief i have given you a task which frankly i don't think you can complete and that is my fault oh i get five right because i got the extra multi head oh that's fine nice uh we're just gonna use more mana because screw us right well i only got a target for that time though maybe it's only the first time you use it i don't know uh screaming at least no one's threatening city panic yet uh i might move this fella a little bit ah these bats are annoying but whatever forget about it not the walls oh jesus yeah reinforced walls would be nice okay see this guy's threatening it and we can't have that uh i think we're just i think we pretty much see all that's left though oh that is a nice looking one of value i might even i might have you just finish off the rest i might go over here and help this dude let's see what we can do here um um i won't be able to slice through them so there's me with two movement i'd be taking a little too many hits if we stay here to be fair i think i just kind of bought myself though i'm taking a lot of hits no matter what i do chili chef you got it buddy i believe in ye because uh we got a little problem over here that range rip okay what if i skadoodle over here i want to hit patch this all right it's not bad come over here finish what we can now we got to people kill the people threatening the city first and foremost and kill all the runners who are going to be fastest and the archers i hate them then we get one more shot oh this guy's threatening why didn't i target him uh we'll do it again okay good good good good good good no immediate threats anymore so let's just do some damage here you can't get to me okay i really want to do something about you so i'm actually going to prep because the archery is going to come to help relieve a little bit oh did not realize that bat would be right next to him there goes like all my wolves that's a lot of damage very well okay for some reason they didn't hit you we're not gonna question it uh all right now you're gonna have some fun here buddy that didn't kill him [Music] we'll take a little bit more damage but i don't think anything cherish dead i don't know if i should save this mano out of range whoops i'll kill the gate but that hits five this hits four oh that's nice let's do that oh yeah oh you betcha you're at amanda though oh that was all your man i don't know if it was that worth it let's just omega whoever we can kill you at a range what out of range still wow requires line of sight what hold on oh there we go really healing out range out of range you can can i hit you crash linus are you kidding me whatever the best we can do but i can get the bat next time okay all things considered we're doing all right no city panic so far either we took a little bit of damage and our economy is in absolute shambles what why'd you do so much damage okay sir i'm gonna have to ask you to back it up killed killed we're so close okay i'm gonna just omega that give her extra a turn thing it's oh man [Music] omega you okay oh you still have four skill points or four action points but you can't see anybody so we'll just have you hit wherever you can and then can we get far enough for this well it looks like it i'm trying to see if any way i can no target oh man there's no way i can like set him up and we're just we're just one square too far okay i don't think it will break my armor i actually just going for the wall anyway all right screw you buddy screw you night three or what was it night two that was night three right yeah it was knight three 49 hp loss not great but it's still an s lots of xp baby no shitty panic we're getting better it's another item we need that a lot of gold a lot of materials very nice holy tainted look at that tainted essence another ass night holy we're cracked and the production is in full effect all right so i'm going to finish this spawn with extra mana thing obviously this only helps us next run but i think it'll be worth it we got new additional defensive gear variations during the generation of heroes oh more starting armors we like that more tomes of secrets more hand crossbows more hammers well well but i feel like i should just start unlocking it like this right although this extra chance for the items to be uncommon that's nice all right now i'll work on i guess the magician's i don't think yeah we don't have a prowess thing all right let's first check all our rewards we get the new weapon what do we got oh we finna eat okay we got a warp crystal offhand magic weapon gives extra four extra man at one move point that's fine extra critical power and teleportation whoa okay and it doesn't require a line of sight yo wait this warp crystal kind of knots because currently i think that wand only is one-handed so we could totally fit this in there armored boots though lots of armor lots of opportunistic and isolated but i don't think anyone been benefits from that daily health regen and dodge this is really only good i feel like for yeah you know what i'm going with this kind of raw where's your source for oh there you go okay at least i think this is how this works oh it is look at him holding that thing this boy finna make him pay 22 man love to see that we get another perk so what do we want 50 reliability and isolate enemies isn't bad um improving critical isn't terrible either wait we never used fatality i don't think we've it even came into play we just one shot everybody we'll see if it comes to play some other time um let's give you some more magic damage of course and then daily mana regen probably bump that up right yeah why not now those were pretty fair upgrades all right monica what you want girl we give you more mana just worse thing but we could just give you more range damage let's just go with the solid play first daily health regen hopefully you're not getting hit anyway which is probably going to change here soon gamba that didn't work gamba that's okay not bad we'll take the extra accuracy i don't want a mess hit or miss i guess i'll never miss huh but i also don't really know what to do maybe we go with the crit chance on youtube i don't really know i mean marking somebody could be good making sure they making sure we hit them maybe we do that because it might come down to a point where like we're gonna need to hit somebody and if we miss it it's gonna really mess us up so it's like a guaranteed kind of thing that's what i'm thinking at least now you my friend 11 chance of doing critical damage is pretty nice 15 more dodge is really nice um i think i'm just gonna go with that some nice dodge none of that is good for us i don't want to gamble again i feel like we get something bad so let's go with reliability [Music] and then for perch you can't even stun wait i thought there was one here about like increasing momentum am i crazy maybe i wasn't i think i was wrong um cherry-picking this might be pretty good for him or we just don't do like huge aoe damage with the sword though so i don't know if that's the play maybe increase armor pretty good all right 44 armor we'll take it now we got a decent amount of gold what do we want to build here we already have magic store or yeah this is magic right yeah so defensive item might be the best purchase because that's the most versatile everything else right am i crazy i'm gonna well whatever maybe i'm crazy i'm building it anyway let's see what we get give me something saucy extra dodge and armor could get a helmet which just gives extra health and resistance i like this chief i don't know who we're going to put it on but we're going to put it on somebody uh i don't think we want to put it on you no that one's kind of raw so who's the next most likely to be getting hit maybe you this gives you extra dodge and armor well this is that but better we have enough gold for another building so we have armormaker and we could build two more too just you know passively good stuff but like her weapons are decent right now regenerating some health wouldn't be bad but again i feel crazy gold mine should probably be a good idea i feel like scavengers camp is the play though just more materials so that's what i'm doing we need those defenses chief um now let's destroy this we could get i kind of want to do this to hold on 28. that'd be 60. okay i'm gonna do this to upgrade a house we get another worker we're running out of things to destroy though we got a lot of materials they're coming from the exact same spots which is kind of nice i could have i guess seen what we rolled there but i think we're chilling so oh i didn't even see if there's good gear rip was this potion of invisibility 40 dodge can't even afford a potion though okay i think it's time for some reinforced walls uh we cannot afford them here though maybe like every other one um let's repair you prepare that gate get another gate although if we're not even putting our sword guy over there we don't even need to worry about the gate i mean i guess it doesn't hurt to have it though it just has a little bit less health but whatever all right that's pretty much all we can afford i can oh god it's just a mess over here whatever i also just have to do um i have a feeling they're gonna get too close um we'll have the archer flex i'm not talking like that you know what i'm saying like whatever lane they want to go to um he's down to four movement speed yeah he's not able to really flex anymore all right let's do it was this knight four don't stand a chance what is this oh here it is mark decreases an attribute to given i'm trying to see where is my like fatality thing then maybe it only shows up if i'm near them but it looks like this does not take an action point it's pretty good i've never what the fudge is this splitter someone tells me he's gonna hurt we got a lot going on over here but there's nothing we can do we got no range so let me let's try this we're going to mark this guy and then i have to get in close enough to do my omega and i didn't even do that uh so omega and then another omega big get you with two of these that didn't kill you okay they're getting pretty tanky we're gonna go over here because i think i'm gonna have to help this next uh and then you can only hit one person right now anyway dodged really it's fine oh but we do have teleportation too right i don't even really have to worry about my movement speed because never mind we can omega flex with that guy what's the closest this guy can get here i think that's as close as they can get i really hope i don't eat these words can't tell if there's anyone out here this is it this is my moment okay they couldn't but whoa what why are they all coming out over here no no they're gonna start spilling this way wait i can't do all that time out let the fudge oh my god another split two splitters okay well you've got your work cut out for your friend i'll tell you that much kill you shish kebab you um kill you kill oh wait oh fatality pog and then so the fatality does work feels good uh this guy's gonna hit us no way no way around that okay now i still i just don't know where to go like everybody i feel like this guy just doesn't do enough damage to it's really worn taking the whole thing by himself like these guys do super damage this guy i guess should be the one flexing right because he's more support which is uh is he really though i don't know he actually is about the same uh we have we'd have to high roll twice though just to kill one of these guys maybe just hope for the magic missiles um let's hit all the armored targets since magic ignores that right oh just ignore some resistance okay well that's not really the same thing whatever and we go again are those both oh my god they're so weak all right we gotta kill that guy um um i can't even help really if i wanted to i think i'm just gonna put the archer here i'll teleport with this guy i guess i could just do that right now okay he's gonna help you out next time buddy don't worry about it now it's time for us to assist uh we're gonna mark this guy to hit him with the omega okay mark's actually pretty good it's pretty good not gonna lie finish you off hopefully hit you okay looks like freaking like every unit now has armor almost the dodger still doesn't but then again his name is dodger so he just has that high evasion all right friend hold steady you're gonna take a little bit up the butt i'm not gonna lie to you you didn't get hit once it's like kind of a good thing and also a terrifying thing there's going straight for the wall they don't even care oh yeah yeah yeah god our movement is just pathetic they realize it was this dire you don't want to use all this mana but i don't really have a choice all right it's our best maybe not even doing that that's pretty good okay i'm gonna debuff you omega you uh and i think we take this guy out because i imagine he'll do the most damage kind of feel like i'm gonna have to start taking care of these bats can't hit him uh so i'll just go for the dodger please and then uh we're just gonna have to uh yeah waste some mana but it's all i can really do budge fudge fudge we have to keep an eye on them all right now you need to get to the slicing and the dicing my friend just don't have a good way to set up three slices what i'm thinking is we go like here here take one off slice slice like this so if i can kill this guy maybe focus him like this okay we kill him then we come here slice what oh no the wall oh fudge me oh i'm dumb i'm so dumb can i reach no go ahead okay this will guarantee a kill slice slice and then get behind the wall i guess so and finish that off i think yeah he'll still hit the wall but with all things considered that didn't go that poorly all right the bats have made it hidden holy they hurt so much they're literally just like one shot in my non-reinforced walls it's bag now i have to just omega the bats right in front of me don't have much of a choice there uh i have a feeling that might be our best bet okay no one's threatening the city immediately over here ah geez we got even more over here fudge could i stone the stick uh maybe i shouldn't brought you back this far see what do i do about this um i guess i could omega that and then fudge okay hold on we gotta start trying to take care of these bigger dudes no matter what we'll weaken them all for you buddy then you can clean up to your heart's content dad dad he's out of action points uh i'm gonna give him one there you go friend okay it you hit you now i'm gonna have to come over here because i have a feeling we're gonna take you don't do that much by yourself that's okay how far can these guys reach far enough i'll sit right here i don't think they're going to target me okay we haven't even seen the last of the monsters hopefully that's coming soon our walls wet walls oh we dodged feels good he actually tried to hit me though 56 okay so we pretty much feel the last of them there's so many of them indeed what's this thing clawer i think we saw that a while ago in the last run or something no there's one right in front of me too uh huh a real good way to go about this especially when that oh oh but i forget i can do that okay if i go through you omega u how much movement that leaves us with oh not much okay so if i come here and hit here okay i was not expecting us to kill oh boy because now you are how do i say uh boned the very least probably gonna get hit by three people at least there aren't any archers but oh yeah yeah uh i just need to start whittling down i can't even reach them all right let's go for the let's see let's go for the fastest guys and i can't so oh i can almost see him i can't teleport though it's not worth it and i can't do myself all right which can harm you you are big chilling and we just got omega these guys hit oh 309 crit whoo sheesh sorry starting to sheesh uh yeah we gotta do this but i think we pretty much got it held down well more or less right i think if i move they threaten the city hmm by the way that's not good huh not quite a kill all right i'm gonna pull you back here oh right they haven't hit the city they did hit me though not a lot but enough oh we dodged every hit you're nuts that was three oh my the dodge chain's coming in huge maybe we should get a little more buzzy with it uh are you too close you are that's annoying well i need line of sight so i really just gonna walk up like this okay screw me probably gonna use all my magic here oh maybe i don't have to um okay i'm out of points but that's honestly okay this is just a mess ugh it's actually now that i'm looking at it wait a second it's all a mess uh we're not going to be able to avoid city panic here it's uh it's just gonna happen so we're just gonna have to accept it for what it is oh is the splitter gonna hit oh i'm imagining he's gonna do huge damage this guy minus two panic minus two move points what the heck i can't i would can't stop all the people who are gonna hurt the city uh is there any way around this i don't really think so no this is gonna be my best bet though uh and then let's just take you out and then bats are gonna be annoying but chill right here all right now you have whatever the fudge this is in front of you you did not kill that is tragic my friend you got done dirty uh we're going right back into the fray why not uh and as i say that i mean we killed some and we're running away the fact that they trailed off like this was essentially i had to separate three ways definitely didn't help but freaking durand over here envy freaking p man i spelt different quite literally uh i can almost give him an extra point so actually if i come over here to this i can give you an extra point and some movement uh but the fun might end there just hope for big damage big damage big damage okay well i can at least execute you go through you not enough damage that is tragic all right we're just gonna have to hope you dodge a whole bunch i believe in you i can't let them start hitting this stuff though that's far too important so screw you and screw you uh i think he's the only one pressuring the city looks like okay it took everything that sucks oh we got him no action points no action points okay the city is not doing great but it could definitely be worse all things considered i think we're doing all right i'm gonna mark you you you and can i hit people again oh i can oh that's interesting i did not know that all right there you go friend uh i don't i don't i still don't think he got hit i don't know how you do it but oh now this is what we live for wait did he dodge it seems like he dodged um this guy's threatening the city that's not okay okay i gotta execute you and then i'm gonna hodor we're gonna single single-handedly try and take the aggro here actually i think this only lets it so i can get hit by two spots i think if i'd gone the other way they might have hit me from three i don't know uh can we kill all these people without them well not when that happens uh will that kill these people let's find out please no that sucks now they're going to get so far away all right we're going to take a little bit more damage but we're going to do ow wow that hurt i didn't even think about that okay we did not that hurt okay everybody's getting a little razzle dazzle but honestly i've seen worse the right side is officially good to go support is on its way just out of range never mind good luck um but you do have support here now i don't want to do this sorry can't go that way excuse me can't see uh i could just go through here that didn't kill him what the these guys are so tanky execute execute all that poopy poop finish this guy off please dodged of course you did uh hit you and then we're gonna give you another action point and then you're gonna slicey dice let's go yo that could have been a lot worse that's my best day night night for whatever obviously it went a lot better than our last night for i think right actually don't know wasn't that bad hp lost 81 it's not fantastic look at that 38 kills break go on son go on do we get an item at least no no we don't
