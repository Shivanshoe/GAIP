i'm gonna have to like be a team player let's see what the heck i do here because i don't know all right i have like an auto pistol sick boom i think i just healed somebody all right i don't really know what i do but uh screw it we're gonna do it live i know most of my abilities are like healing and stuff so i should do that like look here take my mark you're healing passively team player take my auto pistol oh my god wait they're actually almost like they are dead let's get him you like this what up dude i just tried to melee but that's not a thing he's so weak he's like wait why aren't i

surprise i'm right on you dude he's like wait a second i could have sworn okay we playing ring around the rosie got him okay i think i'm 100 dent i'm coming back team give me a second we have multiple healers though that's nice that's very nice hey i'll help you friend ready take this take this healing and then take that healing oh my god yeah you are gonna stay topped up my friend i'm never gonna let you die how about you you want to keep the healer topped off what a good idea now check this out ready skirt boom and i'm on him oh i'm an assassin healer baby they never see it coming my my ammo never runs out oh my god what an oh let's go buddy oh geez i don't know what you just did but i'm a fan all right and call down the abyss okay i don't know what happens in here though i'm healing or someone else is healing me but it worked pretty well oh oh wait what i just smacked him in the face with it it stunned him oh okay yeah sure that'll work the spread on this actually isn't that bad this is very manageable okay i'm just ignoring the other guy leave me alone i mean it did say i was ignoring him i don't know what to buy so from the store i just bought some like ability cooldown stuff that seems seems pretty good i might want to do that for my old too but after all i am a support player so i need to be healing everybody like boom bah you're healed yo get on get on the point bro i'm covered i'm not letting this nope nope the game is not over until i say it is over take my okay it's over i'm dead all right team let's do this we got the first the cap right as long as we do that every round i mean we'll eventually win even if we fail the next one see i'm so used to just playing like damage to you i'm like all right let me in dude but like that's yeah that's not me yeah our our damage output isn't insane it's a lot better when i stick with my team so i reckon that's what i'll do let me hit you with a mark bro and then i'll heal you you got to get my line of sight though there you go there you go you're fine dude you're healing you're healing ow the molly 19 health and the dream now check this out boom and then i'm gonna oh my god this is huge this is huge wait a second get me out of oh jesus we might have died but teleporting in and getting that huge ulti off was 100 worth it oh how did he see me it doesn't matter because he's gonna die take my marks bro i'll heal you and we'll shoot them at the same time we can do this your turret is lighting them up as well i'm gonna stun got him sometimes i disorient myself with my own tp all right keep the healer topped off if we healers keep each other topped off they're never going to stop us big brain mr fruit that's called team play uh i'm getting used to it it's it's new to me you know skirt and i'm right on top of you oh i'm gonna call down my alt again why not you're slowed you're taking damage you ran out of it but it was momentarily it was super sick he ran into it you cannot contest me sir wait i have to reload hold on that's not fair i have to reload okay if i died there super embarrassing and i'm on top of you i'm gonna die here though because i'm like yeah yeah that was my bad my friends 15 seconds to stave off their attack i think i can mark them behind walls that's pretty sick i'm not gonna lie boom okay on the point now they have to get off the point big brain big brain big brain who's this furry looking thing okay all i have to do wait a second how are they still pushing oh get off the bomb okay wait are we oh my god wait what where is she we can't find her there she is getting boys nice they failed the push him we got the kill yo i hate to say this but i'm enjoying being a support player i know i know i know if it sounds weird for you to hear trust me it's weird for me to say ah we got a good old competitive match here all tied up here folks two two going into the half yeah you see okay i'm immediately getting halted guys all right well that didn't last very long okay okay you have a nice day you have a nice day okay suddenly this isn't going so well i'm giving them my marks i'm doing what i can let me heal you buddy no no ah i'm getting focused by the dp at okay and i'm i'm just getting melted absolutely sugar ready i'm trying to get this person guys you gotta help me though guys guys they're at our doorstep but this is when heroes make their stand i'm gonna try and hold on my ulti for next round i don't think we quite need it here but i'm going in anyway i'm gonna make sure we don't need it boom okay whoever that is they're done guys i'm nervous this is it all they have to do is cap the first point but i've got my alt i'm staying with you all as long as you guys don't let me get absolutely destroyed by an ultimate at the beginning i think we're looking pretty good see i'm staying with you guys i'm oh we're going this way now good idea let me put my mark on the healer all right let's do this ah it's happening again guys guys please guys wait are we winning wait we might be winning i'm not really sure i need to get on the cap one though either way all right mr healer man everybody stay topped off i'm going in because i gotta ult bolt the point so they can't stay on it and if they do they get destroyed like this i might die but it's for a noble cause you just gotta get on buddy i'm trying to heal you oh heavens to betsy we lost you hates it oh my he took corvus all right well i guess we're gonna throw back to tiberius this time i get to do damage this skin reminds me of playing i forget which fighting game when i was really young though and they had like the little jaguar in the is that tekken i don't remember i didn't play much i just remember playing at friends yeah for some reason this jungle skin got me thinking about that boom look at me go skirt throw that and break bring it back keep throwing my i don't actually know what these are but they bounce and they hurt and they see look at the meaty damage they do though oh my god oh okay my ability wasn't ready oh my god i can't hit anything for the life me though oh that was all me what can i say we're gonna get that crispy flank again see i need to play those kind of characters because that's that's just what i do in every game ever let me flank and what ah okay we capped the point so don't worry about it guys don't think too hard about it like i said all i have to do is oh my god i can if i aim up things go exponentially better oh my god get absolutely destroy what are you doing get off me bruh get off me i have the hunt advantage all of a sudden okay i think i have to jump on them that'll do it and oh he was about to alt too i couldn't imagine okay i hear him below me again which is super easy to deal with yup yeah i don't even care about the person just tickling me with their damage okay you're not tickling me though this guy hurts i forget what my ultimate does but i'm sure we'll figure it out real quick can't be that bad right [Music] i miss my jump i missed my jump oh that's embarrassing pull it back big damage big damage you're dead you're dead oh my god wait wait a second wait a second i'm gonna be all right skirt

oh we're all dead okay so not not okay not great i am you guessed it gonna go on the flank they never see it coming it's crazy you know they'd be like hey it's mr fruit he's probably gonna flank but
