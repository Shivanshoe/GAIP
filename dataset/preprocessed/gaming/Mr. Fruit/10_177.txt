them beetle looking ass with this watching the shoulders yeah what's wrong with that is this shader interesting that he chooses to go ancient republic i think he's got a lighter purple on the shoulders that's interesting well it's good it does two degree i guess it's got on the boots as well so he's kind of doing like this light dark i think i would do dark light okay i didn't know i'm saying i'm saying mr fruits is that dripper drop oh you know i i give a drip but i definitely want to see if like if we flipped the light and the dark wait was i drip or drop or did i oh yeah rocking with it it goes well with worm husk you know so yeah matches wormholes exotics you get that from mythic 12 man uh burning crusade yeah whoa i i don't mind when people want to try to match all shaders but what i do mind is when people are going for like a fashion emblem from bungie or something and they just use all the same armor from all the same set that's what i'm saying dude if they do that i was like don't expect to win anything because like you know you gotta you gotta get that you gotta get that variety in there all right um is it i was told that we were ready to go yeah yeah i don't

like i was forever 29. we got we got that see joey you don't know bro guys are good you don't know forever 29. i don't know the thing about gl's right now they're not exactly like chic you know they're like yeah they're they're kind of i have been they're kind of last season but they are still pretty good i am kind of stuck in the past for sitting here celebrating my birthday it's kind of being stuck like we're thinking about something that happened 27 years ago you know so it's canon dude the best the best way to look forward is to look back sonic's like you right so joey what forever 29 is is when vaulted glass first came out if you didn't get all the pieces you could oh what is zoomer what is it yeah you didn't know that guys oh wow i could never get the better way look at me lmg bro i was going to lfg hey i was on lfg yeah lfg no shame how do you think i got my lfg even when dream team was like still a thing yeah isn't that how it started basically yeah see dude that's what happens brother oh who knew i could have joined the dream team years earlier oh you think you're in it now oh first death by sammy what what order one paid out for the worst gamba of the day i was reading what did you have it datto dies first or sammy dies first or what it was either uh tell this to get off my johnson it was og dream team or extended family who dies first oh damn they're real lucky because i nearly died yeah the fact that the 1280 did die first is incredible oh big goldie rob let's see okay all right goldie's in a really rough spot we did it our sink points vibin so oh i

maybe that's why i never got gauntlets but you guys are capping we're not capping go look it up we're actually not because everybody was like is this where the sixth or seventh chest was whatever it was like and then do you still not think that the chest yeah so the chest wasn't there right well no because people thought there'd be more to this place okay that's why i just said like so there was no chest in there in d1 but you could go there chest wasn't here but oh geez away that was here my something we were saying no you were saying it didn't even exist did not exist the area always

yeah welcome to my life and i quote oh that sucks well oh doesn't the relic guy jump and slam to get everybody out of there that is no longer what you do because the relic person can get trapped and

lock i'm playing with somebody else is this burst let's go this is my chance yeah all right let's not get ahead of ourselves for here's what you do with the next one is you get a new person every single episode so they have no idea what's going on oh that would be actually super funny they're like this is my team yeah yeah you oh sonic are you going to chess because i'm following you no all right all right the chest is over here what there's another chest over there oh what are you kidding me someone told me they would disappear like what well i didn't know the chat down [Music] that's

oh wait i wanna die i'm charging up so i can evolve into my second floor oh uh i don't know maybe i could uh all right so what we got to do for this fruit i got a challenge for you i hate there's gonna be a hydra and there's gonna be a minotaur minotaur if you guys remember garden of salvation it's got that shield around it you gotta bonk it off with the relic but we have to kill the minotaur and the wyvern at the same time every time sure i think we're going to do great i'm dps dps okay okay you can dpsk radius on that is insane what yeah it's oh yeah i forgot the gun's really good okay keeper i'm not talking about blue and sonic i'm talking about that freaking gatekeeper i don't keep i just make fun of you at every chance like rewind an hour ago metro shift i swear you're not a destiny player if you use metro shifts i love metro shift yeah we both love metro metro i don't know my doctor said otherwise that's good let me know if a hydra or a minotaur responds over there fruit
