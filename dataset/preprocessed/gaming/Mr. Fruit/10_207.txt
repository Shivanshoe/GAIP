everybody that's not point he's a counter attacker highly defensive not my kind of style i'm a bit of an ape but that's okay i spent like three minutes in them in training so what better way to play than to hop right into some 1v1s 1v1 low activity okay only sweats in here huh okay let me show them how it is total kda freaking look at that dude 1.35 that i'm not dude i'm slaying more people on the battlefield than they're slaying me who is he playing oh it's just a raider okay all right my first 1v1 in a while and this guy's about to lose to me can you believe that oh he's gonna be so embarrassed i'm already embarrassed for him i got my heart oh it's beating okay i'm just nervous ready give him an emo hey may this be an honorable battle okay i forgot all my openings you guys ready

all right let me show you how it's done bucko okay i blocked that but debatable all right we're warming up i'm very overwhelmed actually i'm just mainly overwhelmed i'm going to be honest i think i need to sit in my stance more [Music] you like that wow that does like no damage though how does that work oh okay ah yeah first game back yeah that was the thing okay like dudes rep six freaking raider dude good life you know it's all right that's right he better rematch me because i got him downloaded yeah that's right run it back run it back whoa i know what i'm doing it's got to use my state my stance mark and i guess i should try and use my superior block more and i'm like seminary jack round one no in the arena i'd have it no other way get prepared to be pooped on stupid i'm gonna open i'm gonna open you up hey you right there you are dead you like that i bet you do you dirty little poopy face uh wait what my guy didn't uh freaking i thought he was gonna cancel it okay we got closer though we got closer i tasted it and i'm coming back for more i feel like i have to just like cancel eight million things [Music] stupid stupid stupid here we go i've tasted victory and it's all i want i like the taste of it easiest game of my life dude are you you know what i'm saying like that stupid yeah what now huh he's like oh shoot this man's kind of rock okay i definitely oh stupid oh give it to me what do i do oh yeah oh what the [ __ ] okay i didn't see that one coming let's go i'm a freaking saying dude i just get stronger from every battle bro you guys have seen record of ragnarok i'm like that one samurai i'm the biggest loser you know which which makes me strong stupid yeah come on try me try me stupid okay we're out of stamina and it didn't even matter oh fudge i didn't parry that because for some reason i thought my stance would block that but i it's still unblockable silly mistake silly mistake we're gonna win we're gonna win tie game oh i landed that my anus wait okay i parried that what okay that was stupid yeah i don't know about that one i threw that one away that's okay it's the best of five of the best of five but see that was my like pre like second game with him suddenly i know what i'm doing run it back run it back punky boy or are you scared huh he knows i'm adapting and that i should have won that okay good bring it oh no i meant there we go how do i not get a guaranteed okay you're telling me with a parry i don't get a guaranteed heavy are you kidding me sorry we already took the first dub we got the momentum mans doesn't know what to expect oh no i tried to parry that played that so poorly man [ __ ] up bronco you stand no chance wait that the wall canceled my thing you kidding me oh no oh death by a thousand cuts all right when i blocked him or guard broke him when he was out of stamina you would think i'd just throw him on the ground right yeah but i didn't i was just making it harder for me for myself you know give myself a challenge really all i'm interested in now we run it back again and again and i show him you done been downloaded i haven't played this game in months my third game with literally my first it's embarrassing dude i do keep running out of my stamina after some combos so i gotta watch for that but when i suffocate with my offense he got nothing no he don't even want to email me anymore okay he's gonna say wow bruh really watch this open it with this oh okay okay yeah he immediately went for the guard block he knew i don't know what the optimal punishes here well ain't that oh my god [Music] try me stupid against the ropes and it doesn't matter let's see come on ultra defensive character my anus where are you going you trying to stupid stupid stupid thing come on counter attack that's what i thought stupid stupid stupid nope hit me yup okay i'll give you that one now it's on the house stupid stupid stupid stupid thing stupid stupid and i get the other execution oh no you don't let's go we're going for the sweep i got to get warm but now freaking like i'm i'm like a learning algorithm learning ai bro he's going to try and throw me off this map i already feel it stupid [Music] [Music] oh that was that's so dumb i went i jumped to the side and i fainted my heavy but his reach is so insane that his accidental heavy to try and counter still hit me and it threw me off nezlen come here you i can smell you from over here and quite frankly you smell atrocious uh okay yeah he knows he knows okay good i i counter guard broke that what i'm already out of stamina my anus come at me that catches my anus again oh my god okay we're in dire straits here i'm not gonna lie and i thought i blocked that okay i'm throwing it's not a good luck i could have just swept the man and now i'm throwing damn i don't know how he caught me dodged with the guard right now truly [Music] oh fudge i went back into my garden not this again ah now i'm out of stuff screw you let's go okay whoo i yikes it didn't end so hot but we still came out with the dub and it's still a best of five of the best of five we're going to the fifth or the fifth because i gotta prove something to who i don't know i guess myself i'm gonna be honest i don't i'm more focused on him than like figuring out my character i'm gonna be honest i feel like i only know like the same three things but that's okay the fifth of the fifth my friend i mean i've yet to use my superior block i don't know why he didn't do anything gotcha yep he thought after i blocked that i was going to go for my usual fujitsu million cuts but instead i went for a heavy fainted it bob went to the light light he was off his game boom that's around it's the fifth match and i'm bringing out new stuff cause i'm learning whereas this guy can't teach an old dog new tricks you know what i'm saying he's set in his ways it makes me sick and he didn't think i would start like this but i did and i knew he was going to do that so by that logic i'm going to wait you like that oh okay that was my bad i shouldn't have just done that oh i blocked that and we all know it okay i'm throwing [Music] oh okay this is not good oh he's doing the hump man it's disrespecting me that wasn't unblockable i was what i blocked the first left and then the second left goes through ref give me ref can we get it what the fudge is at what's that about it's not cool man look at me again the counter attacker holding w brother counted do i not have time okay ah [ __ ] dude i hate this freaking character man there's no thought process to him he's just throw this throw this throw this maybe sometimes i just cancel not like this not like this well our heroes succeed find out oh my god i forgot that i don't get something off that for whatever reason stupid ah okay this is it match five tied the very last match come on i'm so nervous you would not believe it i think i just start with a flurry of attacks before he expects it see okay so he knows what to do now okay and i fall for that every time oh my god it's looking real bad folks [Music] oh no not the st what what oh did i say best of five i said best to seven babe i'm embarrassed i'm ashamed my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined i choked i choked so many times i kept falling falling for the same mix-up too whereas like light over to right unblockable to parry to left to another unblockable and then not thinking he'll oh i fell for like every single match fudge [Music] [Music] you
