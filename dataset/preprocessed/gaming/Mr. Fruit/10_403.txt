in hitman 3 for free a legacy pack will be available for purchase if you don't own those games so before we get into it like i said click that link down in the description box below to get the game yourself because you're gonna be impressed by my assassination skills i am it's scary honestly how good i am at the game and how good of an assassin it's terrifying would it like maybe youtube was the wrong calling maybe i should have gone underground and figured out how to do any of that i don't even know how to start i don't know the black web that's really not important at all let's get into the video we'll be hopping into the first campaign mission for hitman 3 on top of the world i'm assuming i'm eliminating somebody in some aerial things title drop hitman 3 or if you never knew what roman numerals were hitman iii i now see where the aerial part is coming in so i had a debriefing long story short we're in a super tall building there's some people we gotta kill i'm an assassin i'm not gonna ask questions i'm just gonna do my job our first target here is carl engram of scandinavian origin his lore is long and extensive i don't care the more i know about him the more it'll humanize him and i can't have that we can eliminate him with any method wearing any disguise i'm down our second target marcus storyvis stop marcus who also has extensive war and can be killed with any method and any disguise good good this gives me creative freedom this is where the game shines the most so there's a planning phase where i could decide you know a smuggled item to bring in certain gear to bring in i'm gonna bring fiber wire why not there it is in all of its glory chic or shaker whatever they call it's the tallest building in the world i believe the inauguration of the scepter and the ceremony is well underway yes fancy high class that's a good thing i brought my white tie or whatever signature art installation of course while a paranoid carl ingram has ensconced himself in his penthouse suite security on highest alert i don't know if hanging out on that giant balcony is the play button all right personally i think i'm looking pretty fashionable in this jumpsuit but let's do it all right i'm definitely gonna need to get a different disguise to start this um all right probably easier if i just drop down here definitely gonna need to kill the first person i see on site pretty much i hate to be that guy but it's just gonna have to be that way oh oh imagine if i slipped though see ya hopefully that doesn't happen according to my camera this can be overwritten technology these days you know what i'm saying all right i don't know where i am but making sure no one's around here i'm in position 47 the inauguration is taking place close by once you've infiltrated it get your bearings i'm sure there must be floor plans somewhere understood there's one of our targets uh first order business nice suit can i use them no okay all right i didn't oh oh what do we have here coming through don't mind me oh wow wow you clean up nice disguise in my skydiving suit you know what i think i'll pass but thank you greetings servant thank you he's pouring me this way so don't mind if i do kind of want to snoop around a little bit but that's okay i'll play according to the rules for now jesus oh don't mind if i do oh that's lovely thank you while they get busy blah blah blah blah blah i am gonna get to some work i'm gonna see if i can't oh the toilet oh my god they even have guards in the toilet wait is this the women's not entirely sure excuse me i can't unlock that wow talk about a fancy little room and talk about a handsome assassin all right here's the plan i'm gonna overflow the sink i'm gonna open that and he's gonna be like what uh so first oh my gosh you better fix this oh it's terrible oh it's terrible oh wait a second terrible for you i'm not gonna kill him okay i don't do that willy nilly but i will take your key card i will become event staff and quite frankly i should probably hide you i just don't know where uh i need to turn off the sink uh oh all right that's not good looks like i gotta take somebody else out i was honestly expecting to smell a lot there you go sorry can't have you figuring this out okay well this is going great you know i'm just gonna pretend none of that's happening silent takedown well done me i get to unlock the key read there we go okay suddenly i got access just keep walking nothing to see here i am a service person oh no that is a service person uh don't mind me camera and most importantly don't mind this sorry about that you're gonna be fine you're gonna be fine give me that screwdriver thank you very much a janitorial key don't mind if i do and um where can i drag you and let's find out it's got to be somewhere around here though yeah really no good spot so um there you go that should do just fine i can unlock this oh what does this go to oh all right what can i say um oh wait wait okay well i figured out a way to get into here quickly if i need it i guess the good news is i should be able to unlock this now yep because i have the janitorial key see it keeps building on each other now i can get some rat poison if i feel like spicing it up a little bit oh wait i could dump the body here oh should i i should probably go do that huh cover my tracks there's also a hammer that can come in handy right everybody needs a good old hammer come on you're just gonna take a little nap in here all right here you go i didn't hurt you you're fine you'll wake up soon enough body hidden boom i'm the greatest there ever was all right well one part of the hotel has been cleared uh that guy over there knows who i am so as far as enforcements go it'd be good however if i could get into here nope don't worry about it oh oh oh don't don't don't no no don't stop don't don't worry don't worry about it come here they didn't see this they didn't see this okay all right this is not perfect i'm compromised okay hold on hold on everybody just calm down everybody calm down uh okay can i take your what the fudge okay i can't take your outfit oh it's probably because i'm already uh well you're a female and i'm okay i'm being hunted this is bad um uh is there a key car or um um okay nobody panicked all right there's a hard-ass criminal out there we need to apprehend him what there's there's no bodies what are you talking about don't make this any worse come on out oh what the fudge come on you want some of this ah fudge oh yeah oh you want some of that oh i'll give it to you ah fudge all right look it's not what it looks like it's not what it looks like punch uh let me take your okay this this is going well this is going really well okay um just holster that uh and vault this real quick and just look real inconspicuous just a soldier looking for the bad guy where'd the bad guy go that's crazy i'm going this way all right now that i'm a soldier though i have access everywhere oh he's suspicious just keep walking just keep walking can i help you [Music] [Music] okay all right all right we're gonna follow him as a side quest maybe i can kill him disguises him or forget where he's going okay see i kill him and then come back and tell him i've changed my mind or whatever don't mind me sir just a hotel guest um but but the question is where are you going what is this thing oh can i blend in or interact with the terminal oh floor plan i want to talk to the partners directly make them understand why all of this is happening and that terminal gives me an idea and there's a server room near the sheik's personal reception if you can gain access to it we might be able to recover useful intel from it you'll have to work together to hack the system but it's our best shot copy that how do i clear everyone out of this area is the question quite frankly i don't think i can wait what yeah what what is that noise that's weird hey maybe check it out oh yes silly woman what are you doing i should just let the music play it's my favorite song all right turn that off nobody needs to know okay perfect okay here's the good news i got some coins to distract yeah he's a what was that noise i don't know why that guy's confused wait did i track both of them oh i didn't okay good good come on as long as those people don't look back they have million come back so we should be fine all right come here just a couple bodies right here there you go now let me disguise myself as the assassin fresh disguise well that went well i i don't have a hat but i'll just say you know what it wasn't really my thing i'm gonna go talk to their personal assistant now that i am i forgot my name but i but i am this dude wait what what what oh okay this is unfortunate this is why are you shooting me please no ow stop it why would you do [Music] is that body still here it is and it's awkward all right staff area is up there all right well means i don't have to get alerted from that person so that's fine okay good they're still searching for me but they don't know who to search for right all right do i have the key for this there's a keypadlock on the doors to the staff area one moment or seven all right try this seven four seven zero six bingo another body pound oh jesus christ one moment there's a little embarrassing for some more fresh air 47 that guy doesn't appear that he's going to be happy with me so if i can just skirt behind him somehow but problem is i have to go that way maybe he won't see me okay he didn't pay attention long enough maybe i can go back then get out of his line of sight perfect oh my god i'm a genius let's bring out the trusty all coins throw it over there excuse me all right hopefully she won't look this way you're fine you're fine your body's fine don't worry about it [Music] i'm gonna disguise myself as you though actually oh but then she's gonna notice wait no she won't okay doesn't matter you just get right into there i was just the person you were talking to i don't know what you're talking about give me that thing perfect guys and while we're at it sorry but i can't trust that you're not gonna not recognize me so uh come with me you want to leave give me that oh wait nope i need to hide you away here hey here we go okay great do me a favor and part of it oh thank you so much buddy you're a real pal sometimes you know that oh this is take the scenic route network of lawyers and financial contacts attempting to restore the lost power base of the providence partners if ingram and stuyvesant were asked to a meeting thinking they'd be told of new developments i suspect they'd jump at the charts there's a lounge area at the top of the building oh i'm trying to sealed off for private conversations if we lure the targets there they'll be trapped gotta get to this pipe and monkey my way up easy peasy you guys see that soldier out there climbing up no no that's that's just fred he does those things weird guy perfect so that was easy peasy go ahead and do that for me buddy what a pal he is nice to have a guy like him around the server room should be behind one of the doors in this hallway there's really no one else around here so sorry buddy be quiet maybe i'll disguise as you penthouse guard yeah i'll give me more access right oh wait there's definitely a camera avoid that if i can whoops yeah hey look at that finally flawless that's every hitman is just like me all right good news is i can have this gun out and it's totally normal i don't know i like feeling elite this is the server room though oh see i don't i don't need him perfect all right let me hack this terminal a calendar function we can use this to summon the partners to a fake meeting 47. all right i'm no hacker like olivia but i think you need to pull one of the racks here to gain access to the terminal but which one uh there's no real place to hide what the fudge all right well i hope this is good something to see here weird right well why is it blaring red and everything shouldn't check the rest of the room should just stand there idly uh-huh seems like something's wrong oh more people are coming great it's a party now ah i'll part of a day's work please sorry about that 47 oh let's try again shall we i think i've got it that wasn't close at all to gain access someone in maintenance should have one we could borrow for a spell oh i think i know just who you're talking about funny thing is i think it's this guy well maybe not i don't know i'll trust he's got it you had it right buddy uh uh yeah whatever else swap i guess all right this gun's too too big to carry so i'll just drop that right there dump you right in there you have a nice sleep now here all right i'm just a maintenance dude doing what maintenance people do it was an insane idea she's busy on the phone no one will notice you're being dramatic and just stay right in there you'll never know beautiful give me that key card thank you nothing to see nothing to see nothing to see i don't know why you're trying to explode things with golf balls quite frankly i'm not listening i'm gonna swap off a maintenance back to penthouse guard because quite frankly i like that better perfect all right put the beeping on the bottom anything different in the room um do i see something different in the room these things maybe not 12 seconds later monitoring server disabled oh well maybe i should do this one then huh i'm a clever one now all you need to do is access the terminal once the calendar option to summon the providence partners to a meeting good work the meeting has been booked perfect the partners should be moving up here shortly looks like the lounge can be sealed off for private conversations andy excellent i see the partners moving you should join their meeting time to end this 47. oh i'm on it yeah same code six nine two seven just don't tell your mother okay six nine two seven you need to activate the alarm on both floors otherwise nothing's gonna happen good yeah all right thanks for that buddy guess i'll open the six nine four two six nine four two oh fudge i kind of just forgot uh uh yeah i didn't really pay attention to that penthouse key card oh that seems nice okay well let's see if i can drag you oh this guy will 100 notice me though oh he's looking the other way let's do this real quietly what's that behind me nothing nothing dude absolutely nothing am playing solitaire if you disgust me on corporate time cheats i'm actually just taking care of these useless oh okay i might get a little fuller useless employees you know what i'm saying another key card why not six six nine four two fudge i forgot nine six four two nine six four two watch six nine four two the partners are alone now barge i'll activate controlling the room security six six four nine when you're ready use it to start the show six four nine two six nine six nine two four one five man uh nine two six four uh okay rewind time fudge why wouldn't you remember that dude is it is that my intel meeting room that that does seem okay very discovered conference room sure sure what all is in here a letter opener perfect that's just what i needed for this situation okay maybe i can use maintenance uh uh i found some more rat poison hey nothing to see here just need to get up these stairs asap hello friend oh okay all right something tells me these people now i just look like penthouse security right guys i think i think i'm fine there's no way that they like i said easy looks like the lounge to me now how do we close it off exactly it's a busy day all right everybody just okay hold on nothing to see here what's going on i'm an assassin stealthy you know what i'm saying wanted to do that but at the end of the day it's like you guys are right here bye-bye we don't got to make it more difficult it needs to be you know what i'm saying is there anywhere to hide these bodies there is i think i get extra points for hiding these bodies so i might as well like hey why'd they close the rail no idea that's weird see that's one way to do it just uh fix it up so that they have to have a meeting here and then just don't take care of business uh let's see yeah nothing weird about any of what just happened especially me being the only penthouse security guy to do that just gonna calmly walk on out of here fellas good to see you all again place is very bougie i love this reception hall though wow i just want to go home like soldier why are you leaving don't worry about it oh this is where he was uh chilling oh place missing explosive golf ball oh so see i could have even listened to that maintenance person and apparently he's like an explosive golf ball the possibilities are endless i could have uh i could have disguised that assassin guy i was wondering there's probably eight million different ways to play that level that's sick yeah look at all these these are all challenges i could have completed let's see how many i complete not a lot wow yeah i could have played this totally differently mission rating three stars don't pay attention to the fact that there's two wide outs it's three out of three definitely not out of five i nailed it i'm leveling up i'm killing it oh now if i replay it too i get new starting locations and stuff whoa oh i can get a hidden stash from a kitchen or something now see i feel like i barely scratched the surface but i'm sure there is so much more the game's getting rave reviews people are loving it and honestly as far as like being an assassin ghost i haven't had the pleasure of playing hitman games before but that it's about as good as a way as it like that's a good stealth game if you're trying to be an assassin and the best part is like i said it's non-linear you can approach level however you want that's sick so just a friendly reminder hitman 3 is available on all major platforms the ps4 the 5 the xbox one the series s the series x the nintendo switch google stadia and pc be the epic game store i'd read all that because it's in so many different places it's easy to access go play thank
