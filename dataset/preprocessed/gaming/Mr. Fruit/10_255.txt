hi dear everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to today's video where i push myself i test my mental acuity because i'm doing a human benchmark test what all does that involve i don't know but my wife told me to take it why what is she does she care about the results i will say this i've never taken an iq test or anything except for when claire was doing her master program in psychology she had to do this some kind of an iq test and she used me as a guinea pig and apparently in visual memory something pattern recognition something apparently i scored off the charts like your teacher thought it was fake so that's got to count for something right i don't know where that comes in handy at all in my life but you know at least i'm above average at something and we'll find out what i'm not average at right now welcome to human benchmark measurabilities with brain games and cognitive tests to determine whether or not you're a functioning high-functioning low-functioning human being i don't know so um let's just start with a couple let's start with the reaction time test your visual reflexes i don't i don't like this statistics look at that curve totally forgot what that's called from my statistics class you would think after taking it twice because my ap credits didn't count i had to take it again in college that i would know but i don't this is a simple tool to measure your reaction time average time is 273 milliseconds that's all we got to beat i just want to be above average because that's that's what i tell myself every day you're above average mr fruit just you're going to do it in addition to measuring your reaction time this a test is a latency of your computer using a fast computer and low latency high frame rate miner will improve your score yo my gaming setup actually coming in clutch just um how do i start it oh click anywhere to start okay that was the first test when the red box turns green click as quickly as you can i gotta focus up here me i need some mad clicking power here red box turns green red box turns green i'm getting nervous is this normal wait for green i think i had a heart attack yo yo that's above average [Music] we're getting quicker we're getting quicker light on my feet baby or light on my you're above average mr fruit let's get it okay it looks like there might be somebody at 100 milliseconds is that really possible do they just see it like a different frame rate in life i'm 196. so i guess i'm just a little blowout suddenly being above average doesn't make me feel any better okay whatever here we go that was slower i am my whole body is forcing itself upon my mouse maybe that's why it's not as fast okay ready i'm gonna hold it up here so you guys can see my insane reaction speed ready [Music] now see the problem is because of my intense gaming mouse i'd like to think that actually the the distance required to click the mouse is a little bit greater than the average mouse that's 100 true which is why i'm going to reposition here i'm going to like set it sideways and i'm not going to hold it i'm just i'm just simply looking like this it's going to be sideways and i'm just going to hover my finger like that okay all right here we go what did i tell you what did i tell you it's all about repositioning i just wasn't in the boom suddenly 169 where's that put us that puts us like right here on that curve that's a nice curve just how i like my ladies my wife's not watching i don't think so it's fine i've i've figured it out all right let's try this again [Music] okay i don't actually know what that was 182. that's an increase i told you just wasn't the right conditions for a human benchmark test 182 we'll take that we're just gonna we're just gonna take my best 169 i'm down here and then if you really take in like i'm not like 244 hertz um not even a 4k monitor that probably and um my pc has a lot of things open tasks so honestly if we factor all that in doing a rough calculation i think that puts me like 140 milliseconds so i'm like right here next percentile what i'm in the top 25 percent that actually that's suddenly that doesn't feel really there's a quarter of you out there watching this video that are faster than me and you know what i'm not okay with that i have to be the bet now i'm just kidding that's perfectly fine that's 74 of you guys passing sequence memory all right this one doesn't need me to be like freaking on edge at all times memorize the pattern oh no i'm getting flashbacks to clefairy and freaking pokemon stadium man the fairy tale fairy go fairy cliff well look at the drop off okay i'm going to be honest that is kind of sad i hope i can memorize pass two and three but it makes sense why there's no that's even sadder why are so many people get messed up after two apparently you either get two in a row or you get five that's pretty much what this is telling me on average people can do eight to nine i guess someone's done 29 sorry what okay this actually reminds me of this story well it's not a story some guy wrote a book i never read it read the book my brother did so he practically just gave me a synopsis maybe i'll read it one day but this guy was like a journalist or something i don't really know the details i'm gonna botch it but essentially he wanted to figure out how there are people that can memorize like pi to the infinite degree and there's essentially a a tournament every year or something you go to las vegas and there's a memorization tournament where you're given like x amount of things in front of you with x amount of time and you have to memorize the entire thing and so he goes into it and it's all about making a story in your head i can't do that literally i met somebody this morning at my grocery store that recognized me and they told me their name how am i going to remember this if i ever see them again odds or i won't but i used a mnemonic device no that's the wrong way to say anyway her name was cat and the reason i remembered that is kit kat kit kat kit kat unless you think of her face kit kat kit kat kit kat so next time i'm going to share i'm going to go hey kit kat cat but sorry here we go memorize the pattern okay i'm insulted there you go the fact that it doesn't have sound too probably on purpose because that would have made this easier because then you could kind of go based off of sound and if i really want to memorize this i should probably stop talking but that's just not possible see i can kind of i can kind of see a pattern being created in my head see now we have an arch we go through the arch and then there's a light we're putting a light at the top of the arch [Music] and then we're going back through the arch i guess another one above the arch lights above the arches another light because that one just went out so we go through the arch we put two lights one just went out and then we put the other one on the other side oh wait i was going too fast oh i had it i freaking had that are you kidding me i just missed click what am i doing what am i doing what am i doing no that is not good enough for me we go here here here [Music] um okay you never saw that one everybody wants to be you yeah except you it's crippling depression what i just start going to what the fudge am i doing man okay can i just get my 10 back sorry [Music] um okay i don't know you plan to remember this mnemonic device one two three four five six seven eight nine so we have two two seven two seven nine two seven nine three four two seven nine three four two seven nine three four eight two seven nine three four eight two seven nine three four eight five three two uh two seven nine three four eight five three two two seven nine three four eight five three two eight two seven nine three four eight five three two eight two seven nine three four eight five three two or four three two seven nine three two seven nine three four eight it's a four why would i go whatever hey we got eleven that oh [Music] sequence memory eight the best is it above average yes am i happy with it no that's about as good as that's gonna get okay so i'm not a sequence memory kind of guy am i smarter than a chimpanzee i don't know are you smarter than a chimpanzee well that's weird apparently i can see in the future click the squares in order according to their numbers the test will get progressively harder oh great okay uh this is a test of working memory made famous by study that found chimpanzees consistently out wait what i'm gonna get out performed by chimpanzee in the study the chimps consistently outperformed humans and some champs were able to remember nine digits over ninety percent of the time okay so the average it's like ten point that seems pretty high chief yeah i wanna know who in the world's like 24 who are these dude they must just be like oh mega brains man okay i wonder what do i stimulate my brain with i make dumb youtube videos you know start test one two four three huh what am i supposed to go in order one two three four numbers five strikes one two three four five oh i see okay as soon as i click them one two three four five six one two three one two three four five two three four five six ah fudge i barely messed up okay i thought this is okay okay okay real game rise one two three four five six seven one two three four five six seven eight this is where the chimpanzees could do it one two three four five six seven eight nine let's go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one one two three four five six what uh eleven one two three four five six seven eight [Music] i don't think i'm smarter than that champ man what the fudge chimpanzees doing this come on mr fruit show me chops you wait how about okay i could actually do this if i think through it like music so this would be the highest note so ha ha ha no ah jesus one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven i don't know i'm just be honest i just kind of went for it one two maybe maybe that's the play reckless abandonment because that's always worked out in my life one two three four five one two three four f i think i'm stupid one two three four five six like that one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12. freaking go all right i just gotta find like a little pattern that makes sense to me and you know how does that make sense to you i don't know so we go one two three four five six seven eight was this nine this is nine nine 10 11 12 13. take this monkeys i shouldn't even have two strikes you're lucky you chimp filth i'm sorry i don't know that's for it one two okay so we're going all right this one's a little tougher keep visualizing it miss fruit we go boom i got that part let me let me visualize them here here here and here here to here yeah here to here here to here bottom to the top here to here there all right i think i got it you're probably how the fudge does that help you i don't know but i'm using the device that is working for me and for some reason visualizing it like this see i don't know like i'm more of a visual person but not even this like i need to it's however i figure out a pattern within the numbers so we're going down the steps and they're going down the opposite steps then we have a guy in the attic and the guy from the basement joins the attic the guy who took the left stairs joined us on the right and the guy in the attic joins the other attic guy and the guy who joined us there joins us in the attic random guy all right i might be i'm trying to make a story but i might be so we're going down the stairs right stair guy left stair guy attic basement to attic um left stairs wants to go right stairs now basement guy wants to join right attic whereas what what did he want to do first reichster wanted to join attic random dude let's freaking go what i got to be oh we're on to something now we're on the side i'm going 24 points i can do this i can't do this where in the house am i what does this look like guys we're in a pond and we're jumping lilies first frog wants left willy middle one wants to go to the right i just forgot it what okay wait he wants to go to the left oh but i want to mediate but that makes abandoned frog upset so he joins us friends but they're allergic so they go back to where they started they go back to where they started non-adjacent is sad and goes back to where i was [Music] which leaves [Music] um last standing to join abandoned last group [Music] we're making stories about people and frogs jumping willy's but it's working holy brat what is this one uh seats in a classroom i'ma want to sit next to kratos kratos don't like that kim kardashian cha-cha to the left ryu cha-cha's north east superman not to be done challenges ryu dumbo's all alone pinocchio gets a boner optimus laughs done [Applause] here we go lab clifford pitbull clifford owner chihuahua husband wife old dog sick let's go are you feeling it now mr krabs alex rolls d2 vegeta wants a fajita on east namic goku in north west space lines up to shoot him chi chi next to vegeta takes him back to the farm gangness plays connect four s hot air balloon wants to travel across the world before hitting a thunderstorm crashing next to genghis competitor takes as land fairy dog tunnels to genghis's land random yes i'm feeling omega brain i'm taking this a little too seriously but like now i come on now look at the freaking look at me look at me i need to be the one percent uh but what are we doing now i can only think of so many scenarios um pikachu yells to legolas legos goes to eisenguard the gray becomes gained off the left soremn hates this kings himself the corgi can't wait to get away from this hearing so the dwarves barely miss legolas good northeast shire where frodo hides with his ring jesus hears this and wants to ring for himself resurrect but it's too late so smog awoken joins jesus where the chimney smell goes up let's go flex my brain muscles right now god this wrinkles are forming as we speak it kind of hurts but it's like unfolding folds upon folds yo if you need a scriptwriter for the next lord of the rings um we'll go pirates sure um up uh deckhand oh i didn't mean to click oh you've got to be kidding me i missed clicked and now i can't i can't undo this can i i don't even know where anything are you kidding me where does that put [Music] me still the top one percent but i think i could have kept going i could have kept going but i misclicked well i'd make a pretty good chimpanzee apparently let's do some number memory oh all right let's just get this out of the way the average person can remember seven numbers at once can you do more brother i don't think i can remember seven at once they can only remember seven digit numbers will i be i don't know man that seems more than i can seven what was the number see i don't have much time to remember this one okay i can remember that 85 458. um i'm an apartment 4166. 31867 i'm 31 years old no i'm three in 1867. three 1867. there's a hundred and fifty thousand three hundred hundred fifty thousand hundred fifty three twenty hundred fifty three times i couldn't think of something there are nine million one four six four three nine one four six four four three nine one four six four four three nine one four six four three three i was like okay i'll just think of um a way to remember i can't think of anything um there's a thousand fifty seven people in zip code five one one five in five one one five i don't even know what that means but seven six two four three there are seven thousand six hundred twenty four people and thirty seven eight four two sometimes one three seven four two seven thousand seven zero zero eight four two seven seven thousand six from twenty four point three seven eight four three seven six eight what did i do wrong ah the six looked wrong dang it they said the average person remember seven so i'm beli what i'm below average this this will not do this will not do one day one day number memory i'm going to come back with a mnemonic device and you're done my head hurts man it's hard being a chimp embrace monkey reject humanity well there's four more benchmarks to find out how i stack up as a human we've learned that as long as i don't have to remember numbers i should be okay thank you very much for watching happiest fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one and the next human benchmark freaking watch out for it okay i better see you there and if you do it let me know how you do farewell [Music] you
