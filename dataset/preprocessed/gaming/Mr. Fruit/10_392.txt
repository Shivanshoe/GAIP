hi eddie hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to today's video where we're going to be playing some duprus i know you guys can tell currently one of my lights is freaking out and i have to replace it that's neither here nor there today's video is sponsored by due process what is due process you might ask well you can find out and play for yourself by clicking the link down in the description box below or listening to me ramble on or watch us play the game wow that's like three different ways to get due process goodness because it is a 5v5 tactical shooter that requires an immense amount of teamwork and communication and with my friends you guys know we got that on lock so we were practically bred for this specific moment in our lives you have to plan and execute on both defense and offense to figure out what the best plan of attack or defense is and all this is on procedurally generated maps so you don't have to memorize certain maps it's going to be different every time so how you approach each map in each round is going to be different every time as well now due process is out and on sale right now on steam through february 26th so like i said click the link down in the description box below to cop it at a discount and become the best pros do due process become the law or the bombers you know i'm not really sure the the war behind this i don't know if like i don't know who's good or who's bad objectively speaking gameplay-wise i certainly figured out who's good and who's bad so anyway uh enjoy the video all right boys breach bang and wait to get pooped on breach praying in love team play trumpet breach is through the door all right so so we're attacking right or are we defending we are the offensive okay where do you guys want to go into uh all right yeah yeah we got to choose where we want to be okay so here's the plan i don't got one anyone else so we go here and then we're like whoa and then we make a bunch of noise and then we fake it we fake and go back this way shark here waiting and dork here i need somebody over here this way all right i got you fruit tree yeah i will be in the wait wait am i waiting well you guys are making no no you're waiting over there yeah so here oh you're here well i'm over here oh you're here are you going here you're not here though right i'm over here i'm over here when do i go a little bit of this action i'm thinking we'll do some of this i'm starting right here and then i'm thinking like maybe i should do circles here and then we go around the map and then that's when i enter is that nope nope that's not you would you [Laughter] when do i insert when does the insertion begin all right let me grab oh grab all your guns and stuff oh wait oh my god oh wait i'm still on the map okay we're all professionals here this is fine uh brought to the right of dr roger go go go watch the windows boys hey hey iron boots let's not walk so loudly wait i put a door charge on it can i enter through you need yeah do you have the the thing the switch you need the clicker clacker oh clicker clacker where's the clicker clacker oh you got your switch right here oh can only be open from the inside yeah see i need it over here but that's all right we're gonna go through the fame where we're infiltrating through the fan i'm hoping we can just kind of run through it is this how we make a fruit smoothie i neutralize the cow all right bryce your turn disable the fan have copy i don't know how to disable the phantom not electrician yeah me either all right do me a favor and run in there captain no are you ready here we go easy there's another one across ah that didn't work wait are you guys banging what's going on what's going on i think they're banging over there it's all right we've already eliminated someone through the fan that's impressive yeah what can i say you're a fan of my fan you know shark is so dead hey shark oh what oh my god what all right we're supposed to be disarming a bomb and not dancing on shark's corpse right right right that's what i was forgetting to do today okay so let me reiterate the blue doors on the map you do not need explosives and you need a clacker for explosives okay all right guys okay so let's see second try fish needs a bomb this needs a bomb okay well we got a bomb right here you can go through by shooting these walking through them opening whatever all this but the red you need explosives but beware be wary these are windows so they will be able to see you okay i grabbed i grabbed the door jar door charge and a clacker so which one are we going to then okay oh lord make sure you guys grab your guns and sidearms where the max that's fine i didn't need one oh night vision goggles press toggle hell yeah we only get a couple of those be careful this is so immersive all right boys um team the fudge are we called what are we i think we're making mouth crumpets okay rob right over here by this door you and somebody else everybody else come with me to the windows let's go let's go let's go look alive snails pick up the base i'm trying all right but don't walk don't run because this is what they hear clink clink clink clink clink you know what i'm saying now look through the windows all right let me know what i'm busting your nose that seems like it went quite well for you i'm gonna sit down kid are y'all mad i'm in over here rob he's over here on top of the couch thing careful he's head glitching if you come over here he's gonna be watching that window head glitch and careful right over here ready to stop dork breach reach go dork i hit i hit him dork if you keep going you might be able to flank him you're doing great dork but also i should tell you they're both in i should tell you that the way you're taking is the longest possible way to the bomb literally you have to oh oh oh what the hell rob's hurt oh that seems bad oh dork you're nuts oh dork is fragging follow my pathing dork uh follow my pathing you've got a long way to go go door go let's go don't go 10 seconds apologize dork you got it you got to go go out on your own terms doors i think that went well we may have all been shot but we didn't you know explode this time owner boner this is boner uh on confused boner did you just use boner as every code name and code phrase yes i'm gonna be honest red and blue i don't know what that means big brain idea guys big brain idea all right we're gonna go to this door we're gonna run in we're gonna turn the lights off oh we're gonna cut the power okay so uh wait do we not have another bomb did does somebody have a charge for the love of god tell me someone has a charge no i used it on that door remember you told me no but we had we should have two door charges what there should be three total one for each round so you're saying we should have grabbed all of them in the first round and then died into a horrible explosion okay well in that case we have to go into this store let's touch buttons for good luck but it's really hoping for a better better speech let's start things off but yeah today jesus oh they know what was that they are well aware it's just his doorbell cover the door what's in the ring ah he's right there he's right around the corner you flashbang or molotov me okay i i didn't mull it behind he's behind this cubicle he's in the cubicle i think i hit him once i got him i got him i got him all right wait i'm gonna flash i'm gonna flash balls i'm already in i'm already two left rob 100 oh reach it clear brace and clear there's uh there's chains there or whatever the fudge i can't nope i needed my one ammo all right oh no where are we where are we oh jesus you just got wall banged oh i just got oh rob somehow we have to get to the lights you're gonna get like right on this door in here it is bad bryce i need you to shoot the door open and i'm gonna i'm smoking guys oh go go go ah what the you got 30 seconds bryce if you want to get there you have to follow the yellow line oh boy go doors go yeah we can force ot here oh we could this is our time get your butt remember whatever you use is taken up if you die all right all right i'm grabbing a nice little sidearm i'm gonna take a molly uh-huh only try and take one equipment right now we don't need to get too crazy with it first off this is the easiest door for them to access okay so we should probably and then there's only two other ways a bomb here or here so i'm gonna sit up here and watch fan we'll need one person watching this and then three people watching the easy access door all right let's draw so that i know exactly which door they're gonna come in how does one get up what i didn't get teleported how do i i'm still in the car that they're gonna be coming through why do i jump too much that's the bomb how'd you get up there so hey how you doing uh i think yeah you you go that way but how do i get out of here what the i think they're coming from storage jobs how do i get out of here um oh guys i can't see uh where are the lights can we turn those off never mind not light the place [Laughter] they cut the lights on us and i panicked immediately panicked they think they're gonna win nah they think they're gonna win nah are they going to win no no okay okay everybody tune your butts to him and shake him so we've got the one entrance over here that's a freebie let's go fan let's go fan [Music] all right bryce why don't you go a dork you go take a peek for us do a run bye just do a run bye just hug the wall shark make a noise while you're running they don't hear the footsteps oh that's that's a good idea i like what you did there oh you were getting i'm i took i took a hit boys here we go back up back up back up one round i'm pushing sure they're mud i only got it is that how we treat our fans fruits okay i'm watching your eggs oh my god they're fake stains someone underneath us yes oh that's your shadow right i need you to i need you to get a double angle on me here you ready you ready go go go oh below to our left i killed one well that could have gone better you guys are doing great nice you're cracked oh rob making plays let's go there you go all right oh damn i just took someone out uh someone in the room oh okay we got windows over here we could go through and and only this explodey wall that's that's it that's what it is so we should probably at least try to do both because no here's what i'm thinking we all go windows i'm trying to smoke i smoked myself bro i'm flashing go go go i'm in boys i'm blasting they're wall banging their wall behind the counter this is going well i mean we are gamers but we're just not that great of gamers like you know what i mean like we fall under the category of gamers but like we are just kind of the 95 percentile am i the casual i'm having a look in the mirror right now all right this doesn't look any better i just want to point out that the carpet in the arcade looks fantastic and brings back memories and it makes me happy some serious 89 these vibes i can i can smell the sticky popcorn soda everywhere just looking at that carpet all right i'm taking the wall charge i'll destroy arcade first rob what are you doing i have bomb i i've got a bomb rob how did you get in there no i'm not in i'm on the roof oh okay well fudge okay whatever i'll plant it here ready have fun bryce oh okay thanks guys i'm flashing in oh god okay all right there's a smoke what do you see up there [Music] [Music] did someone turn the lights off this is the best game ever the work he's going to push smoke i smoked ourselves oh my god i'm smoking while playing i've got 94 seconds i've got night vision i'm pushing i don't know if that helps with smoke push push push go boys it's now or never in the fridge is in the fridges okay behind you i got one i got one nice nice nice obama's in store another i got another nice uh that's where you killed him fruit uh the first guy if you can in office in office behind bob behind bomb okay so one's behind bomb one's in office ten seconds you're gonna have to push you're gonna have to push this one i'm going defuse the bomb ah shark what are you doing i don't know how to get in i was like stuck i think those are my first kills so i'm kind of popping off right now [Music] i think any team want to take on us right now right sure like please we'll take them all right give me give me the op they busted it i'm flashed i'm already where are they see anything they pushed right behind me by my soul i got dome you know what the history of uh trumpets versus orderly wizards goes back like 200 years and they didn't tell you that we have yet to win against them so it was stacked against us from the start there's a deep-seated rivalry and and by that it's there are rivals but they don't even think about us like that was just another day turns out bryce's idea was definitely better i'm gonna go get cookie while i wait for this to get something so i can drown my sorrows and sugar if if we join forces and show them our butts all right all right everybody wiggle your butts at them now yo that dude on the right it's working like crazy dude they are dropping it let's think about this strategically uh-huh my plan is to go around circles okay dork i believe in you i'm going to so here is the plan we're all going to follow here uh we are going to go counter-clockwise i'm just going to try to not die i had the same that things are going really well and there's beeping i i i know it sounded like it was a bad thing but i was just really happy about it oh oh god they're here they're in my room how'd they get in they breached them jesus christ oh my god so they're in the kitchen what the is happening what's happening they could see me through that where are they rob so pill box they can see through like yeah they like they oh what the this is going really well wow okay so they saw me through this they can jump up here and see through so i now know that even with that knowledge i still feel useless all right the problem is we haven't been living up to our name there hasn't been enough so you're saying we should communicate in trumpets yeah okay so we're like the face from nick junior they pushed in i hate everything oh my god they're over here using geometry i mean oh okay oh that's what it was i forgot in the heat of the day wow guys we forgot communication you guys didn't even you didn't even leave a pistol what yeah i i got a brother got to do for anything throw it out of them i'll light their way to the bottom i wish hey guys check this out this might have helped in in the dark what we have flashlights yeah but then like they can see us yeah but if they have night vision then what's the difference on me nice job nice job dork be careful the window by us boys i got one but what why aren't they dying oh we won oh they died oh okay let's go yeah you can pick up their guns too oh fudge okay so strategies strategies yo we're all going backstage i got passes i got vip passes bro oh yeah i'm going assault shotgun baby i got a fragrance go go go go go go shark you're a man mode go go go oh my god what is this teammate who killed shark killed shark oh really dude they're just oh they're in the reception bryce they're over here right he's over here they're in

ball go to your left okay lead him lead him stop well over here over here over here okay yeah yeah now okay keep going this way this way left left left okay okay i'm going to circle up excellent [Laughter] all right this might be the last round the trumpets ever played before they disband this team because government funding is not working clearly so it is not this is it boys all right we got one last trumpet hurrah where they already opened the door what they're 100 100 getting greedy i'm gonna flashbang i'm flashing flashed i'm smoking smoked go okay all right fruit i'm with you i can't see anything i can't tell where i'm going there's a trash i'm in i'm through how do i how do i get inside oh i don't know we're gonna find out okay i can't throw a flash into the fan i got one unlucky oh let's go without explosives we just gotta push go go go go go go push boys push i'm throwing flash in the air i don't have my gun out i got white at the table on the table okay oh where's his ankles i repeat i have broken his ankles you need to get the ball one more the bomb can i pick up the ammo important question just start pushing boys i don't know depending on the type of gun oh okay i got some i got some i'm good i'm good don't worry about where's that robin you got him i'm go go go we actually won i mean i don't know about you guys but i really feel really strong about our upcoming right now like really like this is oh i get to keep my stuff because i didn't die last round i've never had this experience before night vision boys where are we at hey dork i see you in night vision oh you look even better in green it suits you okay well you know what they say where there's smoke there's fire i'm gonna i'm gonna look through the no quit running around you boater oh

kick v for victory and i'm dead oh somebody just they double crossed each other they're literally killing each other oh they turned off the lights yeah they want to take it over time so that they can just 60 seconds play with us even more 12 seconds go to the bottom i couldn't find the bomb it was literally by the arcade sweet mouse no it's it's through the wall on the other side of the arcade that was close totally by our own merit [Music] you
