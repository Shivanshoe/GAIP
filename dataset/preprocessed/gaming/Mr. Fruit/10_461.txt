oh i stunned somebody ah you yo check this guy's not gonna see this coming aggressive aggressive i'm aggressive oh my god oh as i say if they called anything yes they have ah nice one buddy you're like the first one to get a kill streak it'd be a shame if i shot it down immediately getting points from kills nope getting points from shooting down kill streak because the enemy is fracking unlike me yeah hi there everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to call of duty black ops cold war and this time on the ps5 that's right we have entered the next generation of console gaming my friends i have myself a ps5 i have myself black ops cold war so let's try it out and remind myself just how rusty i am with controllers nowadays today we're going to be using yeah i don't know i've been using some of this gun but apparently the mp5 is absolutely uh uh like borked on on a whole other level so also for those curious i immediately had to check myself here's gold camo here's diamond camera which is sick and then here is the ultimate camo the dm ultra i don't know how i feel about it i mean i mean like it's animated i i guess after grabbing damascus i don't think i'm going to do that to myself again in this game but then again who really knows i'm a grind up you know there is prestigen kind of so it's like kinda back i'll take it it's something right but i'll say this of the little bit of time i've had playing it it just feels like budget modern warfare i don't know it's really weird it's like one of the first call duties i feel that just doesn't really have an identity truly feels like it's just riding off the coattails of modern warfare and rehashing a lot of the stuff they did which is which maybe it's a good thing maybe it's a bad thing i don't know i'm not saying it's a good or bad thing i'm just simply you know making a a judgment call all right we're on the uss lady melon and our objective is to capture all the zones i'm gonna rush b because i clearly don't value my life take my grenada oh that's good that's good that's a double kill what it's it's it's not it's a no kill nope what do you mean god and i need to get the ninja perk do you hear me right now i am stomping the gate to the max brother how could you not hear me coming i have like lead boots on or something i swear to god we'll say the haptic feedback's cool and stuff my hands are shaking because it's vibrating so much oh my god wait what the fudge just happened i don't know i kind of shot nothing happened then he died oh my god wait a second yeah i hadn't really used the mp5 and i saw everyone complaining about it and i'm like oh i understand this thing's pretty good it seems like all right let me go ahead and and then i'm just gonna right back up here oh that's fine oh that's a that's a treat all right now i've got to find zine enemies before i say kill my boys but uh i'm not i'm not doing a great job yo you son of a my teammate was there he baited me dude we'll say the ps5 is pretty nifty it is something else finally being able to play call of duty on console with 60 frames and more importantly an fov slider like kind of sick i'm not gonna lie the bridge between console and pc is is thinning and then i mean not if you have a uh top tier pc then not really and then you know give it a year or two and then it's going to be astronomical again but such is the life of exponential growth and rate or whatever with uh technology there's that whole curve you know um okay well yeah smg versus ar at that range who do you have your money on hopefully you're a sane person and you have your money on the ar plus it doesn't help i have like no attachments for my my engine five so that would probably help all right i'm gonna spawn camp these dudes long hair don't care baby oh my god oh the uh real controller dust and rust is showing there yeah yeah yeah the recoil i couldn't stay on my target just getting used to the uh the old twin sticks again okay don't judge me too much let me hide let me hide what you can do what you can do feels my bop i know exactly where that oh my god oh now i got range baby try me you want to sit back in your little spawn i'll make you regret it i'll make you rue the day you decided to mess with the one the only the mr fruit come here nick come on nick come on nick don't be shy it's good to know each other keep reeling to me thank you yeah that's good that's the good stuff i stink no i just set up with an actual gun and i can actually start shooting oh we got the best player here let's see this oh look he's using the mp5

pretty watch this screw slide those dms well aren't you just killing it huh who who who in the world how did you get that package i feel that's the only way there's no one that has like a high enough

stunned dude that's pretty oh that's actually oh so he's starting he's funny oh multiple stars i didn't kill one where was my backup brother i just got to keep ran my head against the wall that's right it's me objective player mr fruit never seen this one before this is a rare form it's like an ultra instinct didn't hit anything bop gonna try and stun oh i stunned somebody ah you clearly i don't learn i'm gonna run right back into it oh but we almost have it we almost have it oh my god bro why do i my arm strength is literally nuts like you laying prone smoke yeah you are yeah you are okay but i'm gonna i'm gonna reclaim this with my fragrance well [ __ ] well sad geez louise already level 40. you're nuts bro seriously how i'm currently playing like the morning of release like how all right man we're pulling up get ready i'm not gonna lie sometimes with these intros it makes me feel you know those little like shooter arcade games at you know like dave and busters or all those like it always starts like the crappy graphics and you have a little gun you shoot at the screen it always starts with something like that like you you you pull up in the thing and then you start shooting things that's exactly what i feel like oh it's because it's hardpoint i don't know what's going there i thought it was domination or something clearly i'm illiterate and just can't read basic stuff all right oh my god i stunned someone sick oh my god you're not friendly what stop where were you how did you miss me i see him right there yo check his eyes and i can see this coming aggressive aggressive i'm aggressive oh my god perfect timing on my part surprise [ __ ] all right waste all my needs nice throw that out throw that stun i'm stunning people left right i don't even know where i'm standing that's how many people i'm stunned oh they're spawning over there bro my my ability to stay on target with a controller is abysmal quite frankly nothing quite like what i can do with the all-mountain keyboard now i'd gotten this earlier on the ps5 like before release which is why i was just playing it and recording with it but i'll have pc version and the reason i was doing it is because it has cross progression and cross play now obviously so it's like all right well i can just unlock a little bit play a little bit and then hop on pc and i'll have all the same stuff it's a pretty neat feature i'm not gonna lie okay we got a little sliding fiend around here oh and we got we got a little dude in a little the bungalow over here but so this way i can just play on whatever platform i want whenever it tickles my fancy you know maybe i want to chill out hold the controller play on console can do it maybe i want to actually be decent at a video game because all i can apparently play now is pc well then i can hop on over to pc you know it's that simple oh my god wow ah why oh as i said if they called anything yes they have wow nice one buddy you're like the first one to get a kill streak it'd be a shame if i shot it down immediately nice stun nice stun i haven't hit anyone okay well how about this check that oh they're coming from behind okay you ready chuck that everything isn't awesome everything is painful when i play console because i'm so rusty there's someone on a kill spree over here yeah the assassination it's a new perk don't ask me why it's really a perk kind of seems useless but you can use it to where when like a field mic or a spy plane identifies an enemy if they're on a kill streak they'll show up as like little crosshair target and if you kill him you get some extra xp oh my god it finally worked was i'm like one for 12 right now i'm nuts pretty solid statistic that's another kill wait a second this little head peek okay okay all right i'm bored oh and as soon as i say that speak of the devil no they no no bob get them out of here by the way the camera challenges in this game are just as miserable like with this rocket launcher there's another like when the camera comes like get 50 double kills and multiplayer with this what i think i think i'm gonna i think i'm gonna i can't bro i just got i just got an mp5 man i'm gunning after that guy specifically watch this he's not gonna stand a chance come on up he's going to get his health back oh god how did that knock what the fudge oh he hurts oh you got someone behind you i shaved you okay well it wasn't hurry he will not have fun come on come on come on come on come on yeah no care package for you uh it's the only it's the only semblance of meeting and why is it leaving go get it don't get it go get it give me that plus 100 getting points from kills nope getting points from shooting down killstreak because the enemy is fracking unlike me yeah throw that in there what the [ __ ] our point is secure that drag grenades are just the saddest thing ever so much power behind them but i'm starting to think maybe a little too god throw it back what the [ __ ] oh no you don't no you don't no you don't no you don't yes they do ah fudge get that out of here oh i got a care package okay oh that's an attack elephant oh that's real nice yeah call it in oh my god who's on the other team fragging so much that's not me i just i just called it they've got air support they've got you literally embody a potato when using a controller it's just the weird thing is at one point in my life this is all i know i would try masking keyboard and i though this is boring i could never and now it's the exact opposite i pick up a control i'm like what what is this i'm gonna get babies trying to walk for the first time or something it's so sad but i mean if you think about really for the past four years really like all i've played is pc that makes sense oh there we go okay okay suddenly we're on board oh no you're friendly that's my bad what are you doing in the drug thing the weeds where is zion enemy the fudge oh oh oh my god bro i'm telling you the auto aim like message me skirt messes me up bro you know it's gonna sound like i'm making excuses and to be fair i feel like i'm making excuses but that's not the case i promise oh you want a kill streak what oh not today okay get rid of the flares pop okay but now oosh i got two more i'm taking this thing down like i told you dude i'm just on score streak black duty oh what the fudge i was just about to wait we won oh wow we actually killed it and let me tell you it is in no part thanks to my play i played no objective nice kill okay look at that ak three beasts going going vanisher come on let's see let's see let's see the quad oh that's a quad atta boy see here's the thing in a call of duty before modern warfare on console in that match i would have done so much better but because skill based matchmaking is just layered on thick which is fine i've just come to accept it like this is just going to be the norm now so fair enough but i'm just saying i'm not as bad as it looks it's just that now i'm all like they're thinking i'm gonna scale higher above where i am because of previous matches little do they know like i'm not used to this this controller and stuff bro like i'm not ready for this throw me in on pc that way when i lose i don't have any excuses so i need to start thinking of some oh don't worry i'll have some in the [Music] meantime [Music] you
