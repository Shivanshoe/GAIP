okay i have tunnel vision active yeah i feel like it might be dead emotionally prepare ourselves are there any job openings for death noises hi there everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video the gods shine upon me all right wait maybe that's the sign the gods shine upon us today or at least hopefully because we're hopping into pvp so i could use it we're gonna be looking at the crisis inverted the brand new witch queen hand cannon that gonna be honest i thought was troll if i'm being honest i don't know why i've started to hear some rumors spreading you know some over here and over there and no it's not death eaters from harry potter i think i just never took it seriously because i don't know look at the thing it just i don't know i'm trying to figure out what i what was so off-putting looks very huh i don't know how to put this in the words maybe uh maybe a sh what the [ __ ] okay all right i like that so yeah i'll be honest i've dismantled a lot of these things because i just keep getting them and i'm just like please stop man like i i don't so i might have honestly deleted probably a better role but i would say this is the best pvp role i got we've got a hammer forged rifling for the range appended mag because increased magazine size works with online fluid dynamics the origin weight what would i just tweet trait this weapon has increased reload speed and stability for the top half of the magazine so adding more to the bullet means this is active for a little bit longer and we might be able to reload while this is active you know what i'm saying tunnel vision it's all i ever do in life frankly reality and after defeating the target greatly increases target acquisition and aim down sight speed for a short duration and rangefinder for extra zoom so throw those all into a pot and what do you get hand cannon stew everyone's favorite although i wouldn't recommend eating it all that plastic and metal components probably cancerous don't sue me this is this is my disclaimer ah let's see what this is all about the few times i've been killed by it i thought it was a joke but i mean well let's look at it it's 140 rpm which is like the sauce right now for hand cannons and has been for a little while so 140 hand cannon thrown to pvp it can't be that bad i remember i said psychic powers about what map were playing i'm gonna say it right now it is convergence how does he how does he do it oh my god uh well slight problem is i realized i can picture all the maps i can't remember the names just like real people all right we're faces i can remember for the most part names no chance look even even my mom knows this i don't know my mom's birthday i forget my birthday like those kind of things between my depression and adhd my brain does not like that kind of stuff it just doesn't work but that's semantics also great hey thanks for the overshield great working together guys this isn't even iron banner all six of us on a point you'll love to see this playing out i'm gonna get sniped well they thought about it but i'm gonna hit him with my shield or i'm gonna miss and instead hit okay i haven't even gotten to fire the gun yet so okay and well there he is behind his shield they did just nerf titan barricade in that uh it's easier to destroy now so that is something still seems pretty hard though okay and we're we're we're swapping spawns already okay okay do i get up do something here soon or okay maybe not yeah okay ah bye so either omalon fluid dynamic stuff look at that really good speed crispy crispy yum yum yum for my tummy tum tum oh wait a second i kind of felt nice okay i have tunnel vision active yes tunnel tunnel vision active i feel like it might be what in the lag okay but he's dead by the grey beards you know i reference the graybeards a lot but frankly the reason i do is because i have played skyrim about five different occasions restarted all five times never actually met the greybeards that's like the second main maybe the first main mission frankly uh yeah that's um me and open world games we don't i mean the main missions don't really jive you know what i'm saying like i i slayed every dragon essentially before i even knew what the great beards was reading dialogue about the main mission yeah right missed me with that i don't know what i was throwing to exactly okay well somebody's got to make a move so i'mma do it okay how did he wait what did i kill him with my volatility i uh okay what meanwhile lagativity what the what is going on here i don't know you know everybody always said mr fruit you're so toxic and i was like what how i couldn't disagree more but now i understand they meant volatility oh my god from that range okay now check this out i'm gonna reload tunnel vision is it just me i feel like this past week we're gonna have has been the worst offenders with lag i don't necessarily blame the people but isn't this supposed to be connection based so why is it that i'm no no i'm also about to mercy these people i don't know if like enough times gone past that they won't anymore but probably should frankly it's way too quiet for everyone to be playing i can't i can't shoot this dude oh my what he was this isn't even what this isn't fair okay that's fair yup yup that's let's get it lads great stuff proud of you all weapons of light oh this isn't going to be fair everyone is laggy literally everyone look at this oh hey look crisis inverted let's see what we got what's the role here under pressure kill clip that's okay because that's uh shorter magazine this isn't bad kill clip's not bad range isn't bad i still like my current crisis inverted more though i was gonna say you know first impressions not bad but not exactly objective we mercy them but i did in top mid middle of the pack i ended middle of the pack okay okay okay um i can't remember my names um um uh it's um what's uh what's that one called oh oh it's called it's it's uh cauldron this isn't called what the [ __ ] is this okay well i mean i know what this map is but again couldn't tell you the name of it oh i thought i killed that man the man's is almost dead get ready cause here i come with the great suck hello hello what am i shooting at uh apparently i'm in barbershop again i've given that man the greatest haircut he's ever gotten what in the world took a little a little off the top he's like oh that's great man thanks mike that wasn't what i was trying to do but you're welcome and your nice volatility on you huh you might want to get that washed off honey that ain't good for you rusty i'm after a while you know ah god jesus i'm hiding in a corner i'm running to my friends but wait i don't have any oh he do be weak though [Music] there are too many of them and he's trying to ask your streak i mean no oh i thought that was you just fell off the map if you went that way okay well that's consolation all right let's get a kill tracker up on the screen right now for this game what are we looking at that is a nice looking is that two i gotta reload hold jump up jump up i dare you you're in the bubble and you're not killing this dude hey yo my man what is you what's what what just transpired exactly uh also wait i didn't yeah oh i guess i did join the game a little in progress but still you already have well but okay contra uh counterpoint again it is like the fastest charging super and even i am close to mine so dude like it was that lag i feel like some of those shots like we need uh we need a virtual ref here like this is football but i do know they added that recently very contentious everyone's always complaining about the virtual ref well i could use that because raph where were the bullets there huh maybe he could tell me what transpired there tunnel vision is a lot you know when i inevitably retire from this job uh whether it be because i'm ready to or because youtube has um decided that that's what's gonna happen with uh algorithm changes and whatnot and i'm not that's a different point is the one thing i'll be able to take with me for where am i what the what are there any job openings for death noises is is that even a job is that too niche or perhaps somebody's just been waiting for somebody to to take the initiative you know maybe maybe there's a hole in in the ecosystem right now for something like that in which case i'm going to spearhead that and i'm going to become the first full-time death noise actor voice actor technical i don't know i don't know what's going on here okay that's some ambitious range there okay well what if i just missed i mean okay nice nova bomb stupid damn you freaking fusion bob what is this snorri garbage things shoot so fast and it hurts so much emotional damage and physical damage actually just all the damage mental damage emotional damage okay wow that's so sad yo get in there buddy get get in there yeah let them know go home all right fine i'll let them know yeah yeah red jacks i'm gonna be honest he he's always said that i don't know who they are the red jacks who are those the new species of bee we don't find out about red jacks wait i forgot what he even said i don't know what i'm talking about anymore season pass rank 185 look at me i'm on my way to plus 20 power i'm already grand master ready put me in coach oh hi what a nice guy four hunters two titans not a warlock to be seen wow that's not something you see every day well i mean eight million hunters that is but the other things not so much wow you know it is 20 22 it's it's everyone's so progressive these days you gotta love it can i can i fight somebody now what are you using i've got tunnel vision you'll take that oh oh he's feeling it he's feeling it now mr i was gonna say if he ends up killing me what the fudge oh what what we're both so bad man i gotta get one of these kills right yeah no he's using the terrible because he's terrible got him give me the good job horn go my wolf packs nice oh he spawned right here you poor thing falling at the hands of me yet again give me that and then give me this tunnel vision what's up what's up okay admittedly he hurt did i there's no way the hand cannon shots don't over penetrate like that right how did i kill both of them oh my god i'm surprised still took a couple shots but i don't think i'd be able to make that and then next thing you know we made it oh that's gonna hurt sir what what happened to my barricade how did it die so quickly i was about to the heroics were about to be on display i was going to shotgun him or i didn't really decide on what i was going to do but i was going to do something nice kid sex dude you're dead like what are you doing go home kid you're dead you're not drunk no you're just dead and i think we can say that now i think we've had enough time to be able to emotionally prepare ourselves to to talk you took that you sassy little bacca screw you kade tunnel vision has activated yeah okay i don't yo that thing almost never tracks but it did right there and what the f what kind of what i think this man and by this man i mean that man spawned right there oh come on don't mind if i do give me the tunnel vision headshot headshot headshot headshot tater tot you have over dude okay does he have a funnel web i don't know about why is it doing that much damage does he not miss like i'm sorry but that thing only has that like ttk i swear to god if it hits every headshot at the perfect range and uh i don't feel like that's what he's been doing could be wrong but don't you take that from me i didn't even you still killing little saucy [ __ ] oh i got it well i think he's gonna kill me off spawn here with his fists dude you know how there's like that thing you can put on like a gun irl or i don't know what the [ __ ] it's called but you can like make it full auto or like essentially break it and do what it's supposed to not like oh it's supposed to be semi-auto not anymore i don't know what he's done to that funnel web but that is not human just made no sense but well played but hey even a guy like that yeah boy the the people's people person the person the people's person people's people what what's this phrase it's not important even i was able to hold my own and we probably could have pulled it out there was a couple times i choked on a couple shots yada yada we could have done something so yeah it turns out it it just feels good yeah i i'm surprised this is good hankin it's crispy to shoot it it just feels right uh perks yeah i barely even use tunnel vision really the rangefinder and other things you want to get it's it's pretty flexible and i think it can roll with some pretty interesting combos so check it out now i'm thinking about it though where have i heard that people have been using this it was twitter i don't know but you know you know it's not made up you as a viewer right guys so uh like like comment subscribe bell i'll see you guys next one [Music] [Music] you
