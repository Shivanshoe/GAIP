case i'm a nutcracker i don't know i i cracked something the da vinci code no no what's what's the other freaking hero killer dude zodiac killer i saw the zodiac thing yep that's me peep the brand new merch in the link down in the description box below we got tank tops t-shirts shirts leggings mouse pads spacebar yeah and there's two variants the white or the black design they're both super sleek super comfy super breathy only going to be available for a limited time probably about two weeks and the mouse pads range from small to hitch no chase look at this picture [Music] recently okay it's not here uh we reviewed the the fire fight brand new new uh auto rifle and it's actually pretty freaking sick i've always been an auto rifle guy since the dawn of time you know rewind back to d1 all the you guys know me i love auto rifles but they ain't been the best or meta for i can't even remember the last time auto rifles were met him but you know what screw them out i like auto rifles we fragged with the last one and a lot of you were like hey you like this well check this out it's the duty bound monte carlo who i mean look at that shish kebab connected right there it's about as useful as monte carlo's bayonet i still don't get why that's not like a special melee for the money anyway i do lots of text yeah yeah i've got a footed barrel i ain't doing this it that seems troll i mean i like range but i also like my stability and handling i don't really like extended mag but i don't want to decrease my range although that is a really high stability okay never mind we're doing steady rounds perpetual motion dynamic sway reduction are you seeing a theme here and then you can go stunning recovery but we're gonna be using this in pvp so we're going with vanguard's vindication fundamentals of the 11 grain of small amount of health throwing on the targeting gesture in case i don't know it's that or counterbalance which maybe i do counterbalance because we got lots of like stability things going unfortunately this is reload speed i don't know i'll try targeting adjuster if it if we need to smooth it out a little bit rough you get those rough edges out then i'll throw in counterbalance but peep this okay that's pretty clean this thing does take shaders pretty well like look at that that's pretty cool honestly that makes it look like a star wars blaster or something oh that's some clean gold oh what am i looking at this is sick the nectar dynamo uh yeah oh isn't she gorgeous no i'll match hold on i'm sure this is not going to look as good as i think but that is hideously beautiful oh my god i hate it so i have to put it on wow wow that is a sight for sore eyes huh wow crucible labs you say what is this zone control hmm yeah why not is anyone searching this i don't know or no i'm i am searching it so somebody is oh hey by the way hey look look what i am man i'm gum shoe i don't actually know what that means according to this detective wait really to engage in detective work if used as a verb gum shoe yeah i figured that much thank you wait no way i forgot how is it gum shoe ah guys it's gum shoe not gum shoe it was actually so fitting that i just got that because i i'm gum shoeing the meta i'm just no can i get that in a sentence please my nipples are so hard i'm in the front hey hi how are you oh that guy looks cool on white and gold and light gold's so overplayed dude have you tried what was the name of the shader again hideous something terrible looking um ah but i don't know auto rifle is kind of nice with that if i'm being honest with you i have perpetual motion activated all right we've got the first zone i'm good ow oh i e wait why did i oh right uh oh oh oh oh i like that oh i was a fan uh i am a fan of what's going perpetual motion times two that's incredible i actually didn't even realize it could stack really okay eight okay besides a little bit of lag here yeah i i think i might be on to something here that felt crispy guys got hello you're all like a stack like what are we doing here i've got you my friend i'm so stable but i cannot fight him but if i stay in motion we gotta keep it in for motion there we go perpetual motion guardian don't stop moving guardian oh okay so there's like a timer and when that's done you get the point okay a little bit of health reach in there yep that's a lot of you guys oh oh wait what in the world what's the launch doing i'm getting shot from the sides what the what oh milo yeah okay i was i was kind of like okay maybe i'm imagining it not but there's some there's a

that is incredible hapaga why is why why are you all here today right now why is it a 1v6 in this area pro gamer move here uh it's called a flink it's a pretty advanced maneuver wouldn't expect somebody like yourself to uh understand the nuance that comes with oh hello hell and farewell my friend yeah sassy little sad i'm becca oh god wait what hello who where what oh he's weak ah that you're not weak wait what did you kill what is happening right now mixed emotions that's what i feel mixed emotions is what i feel where is everybody hiding brother i'm gonna laser the dude the next

find more nuance still wouldn't expect such plabs to understand what i don't but we holy jesus i mean i am without a doubt top frag in my team and that's all because of duty bound this game would have already been over by a more marginal victory or i mean defeat victory for them if it wasn't for the duty bound so ask not what you can do for your country ask what you can do for your auto rifle okay let's look at it that way because that's that's the only fair it's like i'm not i'm never fighting one person at b dude i can't i can't cover every entrance there's like eight of them i do have an irrational fear of be so maybe i should just adopt that in game i i don't know hello mr everybody come on yeah peep me down oh that's a thorn but i'm better but you have friends uh i hear supers and i don't back back i'm really having trouble english today i don't back down from a fight because watch this watch watch this my dude hello my mans where that was not according to plan hey yo tag me in tag me stupid oh my god that's a golden pee pee yo where it was there we go okay this is this is prime right here this my bread and butter baby open the door open it open the door you captured it it's just weatherboards there's like how did i not i don't know what i'm saying just end the game dude like one more kill are you just in my suffering just don't let me be the last kill i'm not being
