another time as well as today he's probably the most useful legend on the game it is of course the big gibby however you can also be a really bad gibby and be a detriment to your team and i know this is true because that's me at the moment and the only way to improve as the big gibbo is to play the big goober so here we are today i've got three different games for you it's a world's first never

wasn't with you right there i brought us not your fault okay so this is good give me something fine but i kept getting sniped in the back of the head and this random guy you know yeah there's more teams here than um i'd expect me to me too and it's a bad place to be caught out in the open i'm out of sniper ammo wait i can be on my drone while we're on here that's kind of crazy but you can do the you can do the shots for us you can be our cameraman yeah yeah jumping off here brother i think it's easy to overuse your drone and i think people over overvalue the scan ability because they can just shoot it like instantly it's not like a bloodhound yeah yeah and even when it's hovering makes so much noise other gates don't get spotted with the charge rifle oh yeah he's like jiggle peeking with a charge driver he's gonna do like two damage every shot hold on him once am i all attack yes [Music] he got stuck behind the door landing shopping i'm going to get something there's no way i'm going to get some good weight what just happened to me hello oh i hate this game enemy reviving yet [Applause] on the roof okay you know me oh yeah i do know you we got ourselves even punched me to stop unbelievable trying to assert dominance i could never throw catch me throwing hands of any description i don't think anybody landed here no way people finally seek of antenna this is a glorious day people still got this map no i think i don't they are they're sick of war's yeah i think so my teammate's name is the most menacing name ever you think he was born in 1938 maybe mega lord the
