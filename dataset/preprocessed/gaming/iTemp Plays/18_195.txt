hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we're here in ranks and i've been putting the time into ranked recently i really wanted to make another hour of video but christmas is such a busy time and one hour of video is like making three or four regular videos and when you upload daily it's pretty tough but this is a fairly long ranked video i think it's 26 or 27 minutes long which should be good but anyway the best thing that i think apex did for this new season is vastly increase the drop rate of weapons in their care packages before you'd run up and the first one would almost certainly be a purple armor which is pretty useless if you've been fighting before that care package dropped but now it has a 50 chance of dropping a weapon which increases to 75 and then 100 chance as the game progresses this meant that in the second game here i've finished the game with an alternator which i got fairly early on and i skipped two care package weapons it was great thank you guys for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends come on i'm landing in the foliage oh god i'm in a tree it's all good for you you can climb mind you i can do this which is also pretty good oh god that's way too far that grapple is suffering from success you know the grapple was so clean and right on the edge that it just sent me way too far uh we have landed nowhere near anyone which i'm absolutely fine with we are in ranked so i'm going to cook the video here and i'll see you in about three hours it's not three hours later we're not three hours later reloading a week inside messing up together okay i'm hoping our teammate doesn't use valkor until we need to i'm going to try and get up here aren't they i should have maybe tried to let my team get a shot on them but i think they were just going to escape on the road or this way let's go ignore me i'm hungry don't know what i'm saying syringe here hostile over oh i'm definitely gonna need some more who are they firing up no way amigo have i got overzealous fields just gonna clean that up surely wow gosh darn it this careful we'll know i think it is all this way too which is great unless they're not i i have 45 crafting and there's a replica spawning in in fact there is a replica right there i'm going straight for it i don't think these guys had snipers but i'll double check a few boxes on the way no and no and no as expected worth checking i need to use this though 100 what was that guy thinking contact affirmative forget that it's that way it's inside prowess honestly i think we got either way this isn't good i think she's trying to alter we should go this i think she couldn't use it there because of the trees dingleberry isn't that the guy that someone gets like dick goldberg what is that dinkleberg is that from failure parents i think it's not him it sounds like it right where the bad boys at i'm in trouble i am taking fire friends recharging shields so they get messed with a three-time back-to-back-to-back charge rifle champion i mean is that in the middle of the ocean any spare bats i have four here you go shield battery here hey thanks here oh we should switch armor let's go this way we'll try and find some damage on this i thought they'd come from that way like antenna i finally reloaded that guy's really weak oh close oh he was trying to respawn bless him no he's put it in the open that's that is so sad oh his teammates are raging he's got it on he's got his first scout and double tap guys an absolute menace to society 100 percent i've also chilling kind of ruin their diet i got down to 300 that's that's pretty good honestly like around here maybe let's cover here right any oh my god that's not gonna hit me right any any spare heavy syringe syringes on the road are we getting there i don't think we can all just go that way defending well i'm not defending i'm healing defend me that's what i meant to say i suck what am i doing do i'm aiming at nobody knows there we go huge pretty solo or something i would assume maybe this is one guy okay this one guy i'm not gonna give him the chance i'm gonna find some damage there we go gg good job oops good job good job team huge we played that really patiently i just i love the charge rifle i love it what people are so fast man people are so fast they got the fastest speeds known to mankind i never make it here first ever wait where did my team go to safely losing where they are but we're fine i haven't heard any firing from the mill which is where we were going to land there we go they found each other they keep the vaults wait do they need light ammo all right i'm going to carry this perfection is this the respawn yeah there you go i know we should have pushed this a little bit sooner they might run straight back i think it's only one guy getting respawned because there was only four death skull things but they should be coming straight back to this place marked my next location why can't i no defend defending here they can attempt to move me they're gonna be coming back care package incoming enemy far don't let them slip away you see me hasn't they we've got one of the left still i think one there oh my god i thought i'd killed him i stopped ads that's what that was okay teammate killed one of them trying to get to you either one survived now it's that coming over of course my kills will want to get respawned too just don't get to the uh oh that's exactly what i thought they were gonna do no the guy might be weak i don't think he's that much health chase them chase them yes let's go that's huge that is ridiculous that is so ridiculous given the chimney mate my respawn beacon oh what do i have too many of these we're fine i'm happy to get back in that's such a ridiculous such a ridiculous girl oh my god just being just run just run just run just run not like that doors you need to use the doors of course let me on the roof [Music] i don't know where this guy went didn't mean to take that these bonds i was trying to put some shots in so he couldn't i wanted uh in case my teammate started getting a gunfight with him i didn't want to just leave him to it you know even though i'm no health i kept thinking he was gonna stop shooting my teammate i have no big heels kind of sucks well no big shields anyway the zone's closing so it's getting a care package i need to be careful then but i have my ultimate if i need it sounds close on these guys though they're gonna have that rockers cover soon they didn't get a gun from me but it's in the zone let's just push up just keep these guys free kp replicator yeah maybe we should just turn around give me a second let's go back where we came from too many teams coming out of the zone team this way looking at us weird as well giving my shields of recharge recharging there you go oh just about fortunately she realized just before it was too late i knew that i knew we had like a little bit of time to try and kill them and we could probably just keep them from this hill i if we need to though and they could just go to the left i don't think they want to run this way it's going to go the other way not them again they're furious reach up smoke that's a big stun too that's unfortunate this is the window here what's going on don't rush it healing oh my god what time it's a maniacs man absolute psychopaths i don't know where this team went right here moving here they were right here i'm very confused i wish i could fly like that looks fun come on please oh there's too much moss it's too slippy well these guys on the right need to move how dangerous these guys on the left care package right in the open we could smoke that off the care package has touched down over there we can get that if you smoke it maybe recharging shields thank you thank you that's where they ran off too under fire we can't get into a fight with these guys behind us two teams behind us this way actually marked my next location missile off the rails oh nice job huge good smoke good smoke again sure on the back real bad that's not annoying don't worry not on at all we all have to go the same way i might have some no i only have heavy oh no i think we're in a cave aren't we in front oh nice job what are we supposed to do or something i needed more smoke three squads left like what's going on here this is huge nice job man thank you oh my god we're still in it they need shield i got some i got some that's it nice job i think this last team might just be one guy i think it's a solo hiding inside of something let's rush him just switch him just watch him get him in there yes nice good job team nice that's huge i thought we could valkyrs out there but like i forgot that we're in like a massive cave oh my word actually made it you are the apex champions that's big win i finished the game with an alternator and escaped it's a little bit of an op combination there although i didn't get the digital theft or for it doesn't matter though good job team pretty well played by the gang here look at that my rank increases a testament to my perfection
