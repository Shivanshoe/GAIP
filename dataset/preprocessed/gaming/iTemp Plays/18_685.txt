hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some more jurors with so far but i just wanted to talk about the new season coming out in less than two weeks time now there have been numerous leaks about a new map a new legend that legends abilities but i've been very tentative to listen to leaks as of late for a few reasons one of them is that we know that respawn put information into the game files to throw data minus off if you remember back when revenant was released we were actually expecting forge in the game files forge had abilities and descriptions to those abilities listed that were then leaked these threw everyone off and it's proof that respawn will throw some curveballs into the files as leaks are very difficult for them to avoid another reason is that respawn worked really hard on the storyline for forge being interviewed and then assassinated live by revenant that was the big storyline flag trailer it was going to be a bombshell that no one saw coming but before it happened data miners were able to leak what was going to happen i remember a fair few devs on twitter expressing their disappointments and when you think about how much work is put into these trailers and the storylines for it to be spoiled the day before must have been really sad for the team so for these two reasons i've looked into leaked content less and less about apex over the last few months and i'm trying to focus more on the hints they put into their game but also you can use those to time with some of the leaks that don't spoil the storylines at the same time it's a nice balance and it gives a few extra hints at content that is on its way without ruining the hard work that the dev team are putting in as well now earlier on today this sign appeared saying all hail sheila which is believed to be the new name of rampat who is the legend that data miners have known about for some time now now rampa does have leaked abilities listed in the game files but again respawn have been known to give us massive curveballs they did so last time so you can't trust these especially as i've seen two different sets of abilities listed and one of them was confirmed to be old content by respawndev one thing that we can take away from this however is that all of the abilities have a common theme of uh construction or weapons whether they're able to play something down in the game or their weapon mechanics are slightly different it could be possible but this is all speculation and it's about as far as i'm willing to talk about it in terms of the late because any more would be blind guessing to be honest we should focus more on the hints and the teasers that respawn are giving us and there is another one here coming soon tomorrow at eight o'clock in the morning which i believe is 4pm uk time if that's the pacific time zone and seeing as well less than two weeks away from the new season many are speculating it to be a trailer or perhaps another installment of the stories from the outlands that we've been getting pre-season releases hopefully we get some info about the new legend tomorrow we will see set your calendars my friends and if you miss it don't worry because i will cover it on the channel here shortly after as well so i hope you're going to enjoy today's video

i have a gold helmet yeah we should like hold them in your bag no it's kind of around swap broken but they take up like eight slots it takes up your whole backpack yeah that'd be actually really bad because then the wingman would be even better like guns that wouldn't use ammo would be really good yeah oh yeah just destroy shotgun wingman i'm literally i'm spinning around again literally not not touching my right thumb stick i'm just in the slowly spin what are you are you on your infinity or what you're trying to infinity it stops once i move it again but weird man very strange yeah playing on a linear whenever you have stig drift at all linear is really bad because you feel it like is you feel it's so so bad on linear so i've gone through so many controllers really all right yeah just playing on linear does it have a dead sign still that uh you could change it like small dead zone but just the raw input alone it's it's so sensitive it's just so it's so sensitive that uh axe different can really mess with it let's see what that hurt that's right here staying there playing cracked that was like beneath us somewhere he must have ran yeah they're they're all the way down there are the teams this way [Music] they're looking out funny movies think oh my god they're right on this door right on this door i've got to get behind them this other team might come over the team's coming all over cool there we go i tried to throw an ark style through this window and as soon as i was about to throw my stick drift through there like nope i feel like we were always team
