hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be running a solo in trios and the two teammates that i was given this game were great players i spent half the game running around behind them trying to keep up i didn't get the most amount of damage on the team but i did however have by far the most amount of kills some may say that i stole them and i would i would probably agree with that i didn't mean to of course but sometimes it just happens if you are new to the channel be sure to subscribe to join the item player and help me reach 1 million subs here on the channel and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right octane's going to be some mimi goes and we are back and we are playing oxygen so i'm pretty sure it's the law when you're playing that's true teammate when you're playing um that wingman please don't beat me man it's an alternative okay when you're playing king's canyon as octane i will finish the sentence you have to land here i am so sorry i don't remember anyone's over this way i'm just gonna go for it i'm hoping they're gonna be split up oh i think he down here could have destructive i'm telling you idea of the century never mind all kicking off at fake sculpting did i grab that or you i need if you grabbed in you don't need it i'll i can take it off your hands thank you it's going to defect school time energy more energy here someone's here i am so sorry i i don't know how i've got all through those kills i like how she commenced me afterwards so our teammates in this crap which is frustrating because that's always what i what i do wrong i'm always just landing and then i have to get my gun out afterwards got some enemies right here what's he doing he's stuck i'll finish your kill there you go stop game listen to the horizon i don't know why you dropped my forehead i'm going to need a bit of shields though i've got i've got dos shield those i'm really trying to work on my spanish game uh whilst i'm playing octavio silva is that his name i have four shields but if you have any extra if there's any bats going getting health back anything extra is okay it's an energy in there as well i need a bigger bag thank you i could craft a bat but somebody tells me i'm just not gonna have enough time i've got blue shields essentially it's good enough i can't go there hey that's basically a hundred thousand hundred damage here perhaps oh good great this game is absolutely lovely i might as well just back this up it's my last bat someone will have something for me i'm kind of close to red so i'm not going to leave it and i can't use small hills these guys have run off into the sunset by the time i use uh by telling you small hills i say that race gone afk she's back we're good all right i have eight kills half the lobby is still up and i have eight kills and i have three medicaid to fill my fantasy one admittedly i've stolen at least at least three possibly four um but in my defense all i'm trying to do is shoot people you know i can't i can't not shoot people you've got you that's the game you know the first person shooter you've got to get involved octane has to be like the funnest legend on the game at the moment because when they both teased i don't know if you remember this they buffed his passive healing and all that did was too much going this way with you all that did was like it basically reduced the cooldown on his ability because his ability the only cooldown on his ability at the moment and i'm saying a lot of the same words here but the only call down on his ability is his health so if you're getting your health back quicker um then you can use your ability quicker and that makes him quicker because he speeds him up where do you want to go probably up top on the mountain i don't know what i just said made any sense whatsoever i feel like i said ability and cooldown about 12 times oh it's me look at me go eight kills i'm sorry i just have to every time i see a wall like that i don't know why i have to i have to go for it i can say that arkansas i think it's i think it's the fact that i'm playing octane it makes me want to go a little bit crazy with the ball jumps i i honestly can't help i'm it sure if this is the same rate a different wraith i'm gonna get up top they don't tell me that's them already scrapping and i i'm not gonna find anyone i think that's actually the case it's very sad i mean it's all kicking off nice again slight need of some energy 66 spare i need energy i mean there's about 18 boxes back this way oh there you go perfect i'm sure bass as well i think we're laughing i think uh hello that's looking real clean and all of a sudden there's 11 people left that's how quickly you can change nearly top 10 and i've got one kill from that absolutely devastating news i was on i was off for a potential 20 if i kept seeing i kept joining you i know argue though it's nice to have some good teammates it's a good job i'm playing uh a fast legend as well because it means i can keep up i feel like if anyone was that containment would they would have shot at us not on the on the way that wall that was terrible there's another flat wall though i think i've got the octane jump pad glitch oh god that's not fun someone's been here bad dudes have been through here and they weren't on our way so chances are they went south or they went west potentially both maybe they went southwest who knows i mean it's one of the worst glitches in the game you know the worst part about these glitches actually is probably a good thing other people can't see you going crazy so you think that your your screen's gone wild but everyone else you're just doing a regular jump you can't even avoid gunfire with it and i need my pad to get rid of it oh there we go the tactic is you just walk over it there's a casual stroller i didn't work oh good great sometime that that has worked for me in the past now i'm just down an ultimate and i'm way behind my team and now i can't get my weapon out because i've steamed man shieldless as well once again [Music] i mean that was 206 i deserve that one i mean i have six batteries already i'm actually sorted and there's only two squads left now i have missed kings can you i have missed the variety i hope that they put it into i i would appreciate personally if they did three maps in the rotation if they mixed it up massively because i'm pretty sure the rotational moment is olympus king's canyon i don't know i mean i know i could play towards edge if i played ranked if i really wanted to i could play a bit of rank i do intend on it i'm in a bad spot and i'm scammed all right well i get a bit of high grade man damage oh my god my nate sent him flying there's one guy left i'm fairly soon i can jump head through this and take zero damage i'm gonna give it a go i mean they're already dead oh my god that may be the first ping i've seen all game don't worry we no scoped it i might just send this hello french i'm gonna put it back on nice i don't know how many kills i ended up stealing but i i feel like it was a lot we did a decent amount of damage though it wasn't too bad you are the eight i'm hoping it's not awful and they start shouting at me i mean just make it a respectable number please 28 kills 20 or 30 all right all right well i did 18 less damage than the wraith but i got twice the amount of kills that okay well listen i did revive her at the start i know that i know she revived me back no we're not even even i think i've just stalled too many kills it was a team game and we wiped half the lobby that was a tremendous game it was nice playing with some good players i was just like trying to catch up half the time i was a gg thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in the next one bye
