hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i actually got a good random teammate in apex not only was he good at the game but he was an apex predator with over 50 000 kills as ray so he was he was darn good this guy lands streamer building on world's edge every game guaranteed and we ended up having a pretty good game together i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it as always and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends okay i'm pretty sure my teammate has 50 000 kills and he's definitely a predator because he has the trail an apex predator that is i can't believe i've landed more than two shots with a knee right i terrible with this gun i want my blue armor but someone else is here okay let's find another team looks like he might need my help actually i'm covered definitely more than one team here because i always find someone and i think this is the i can't think of two things at once i think this is the team the octane was the teammate the first guy i killed that's what i'm trying to say and they're reviving in here and i think one's got a pk and i'm scared and i've got an eve rate and i've never landed three successive shots with this gun i suck so bad with the eve right i couldn't get again now you've got the same fate as me i try to escape as well like eight teams here nice good job teammate uh would have been all right there even with my dodgy either eight shots i think would have been okay if i could have just got through the um the door i forgot that we down someone out there uh get this out of my hands there is someone here i'm gonna have to arm a switch we'll both be like uh full health i hope they hold this door i'm gonna shoot it okay they counted by shooting the rampage is an incredibly good gun if you can find a firm mic but i actually are perfect flatline like i actually think it's decent without thermites too but i find that when i use the rampage i start only thinking about thermite grenades does that make sense like i spend the rest of the game thinking how many thermites do i have thermite management trying to conserve therma it just it's just weird i think about too many things at once and i'm in desperate need of a shotgun bot because i mean i'm a little bit better with massive than i am either but both of them without the shotgun bolt pretty tragic it throws my my rhythm off you know i'm used to at least a blue bolt on on these shotguns so when you don't have a both and you think you can shoot but you can't that's when everything becomes messy this is all lucy but there's a chance someone left a shotgun behind sadly it appears though that that wasn't the case all right do we get out of here in typical olympus fashion there are 12 other people left 11 of the people left 10 of the people left this is why world's edge is just superior by the way if you were curious oh there we go it's grass that empty the crypt i was lagging behind the game just last so much longer on world's edge i'm not going to cut this guy off anytime soon and that's the main reason i uh i prefer is a map over king's canyon and uh olympus here but it is fun it's fun playing these two maps still having them in rotation i do appreciate it nice fights in the states and this guy's teammates stood up somewhere as well that's a free kill if we if we thirst him all right so there's a solo around here somewhere then there's a big scrap i mean it's not even that far away here we go listen let's move here you've got a wingman i'm not gonna shoot before you i'll just miss half my shots anyway it's gonna wait there we go was that 64 damage or something 66 i'm sorry teammate i got completely destroyed i mean it is so it energy make sense eyes are open though i forgot this guy's an apex predator what did i expect no one's got any batteries this is a sad sad day i mean he's pretty weak i assume you got him yes you do perfect that was the last one did you have any batteries sir i like our names look um our names are kind of matching too tempertron deltron we've got the whole tron thing going on our team coordination is an all-time high this would have been more fun on one's edge i just that's what i think now when i'm playing when i'm playing olympus and when i'm playing king's canyon was that just marvin i'm pretty sure i was just marvin i just i'm just thinking to myself i wish i was on wall's edge because these games are so short okay such a choke point hey that was a mistake there we go perfect look at this as proof as well they get a good angle for the thumbnail how much more damage do you reckon he did i mean we didn't have that many fights um probably not too much i reckon like 180 180 more damage that's fine one less kill pretty good i'll take it 10 minute game what can you do oh my god this guy's cracked imagine having a master's batch it couldn't be you i'm the jumper because it's awful why would you ever want to show that off ben anything you've ever seen it literally just says i can't reach pred lol that literally just says i could be prayed but i don't want to waste my time cause i've got a light that's the absolute opposite i've got a life hey you were hard stuck 10k masters i spend all my time working out i can't get to predator if i'm just so jacked that is true those little hands gotta gotta do some work oh it's of course you can hear there's no way this dude's actually trying to shoot me from from construction uh i reckon there's the way there's a there's a course you can hear it's more than a gossip where is everybody get one of them oh my god there's barrels on every single floor i got a lifeline norway is cracks man he's throwing some big names at me oh this guy's a craziest head glitch ever done um i have uh like 48 flight runs oh my god i hate this so much dude i've literally been healing this in target recharging someone's here on this course it's cracked what are you doing mate oh my god well how is there still classic traps over here i don't understand another team on me hold on you are all alone kill the cool see uh another one going down low ground he's going he's about the road almost there she's uh really low do not acknowledge my amazing wall jump over that raft oh that's huge that's huge no no

which is like a once a month i mean i think it's two in two games to be honest with you honestly i need to start making it a point to like call you out every time i out damage you and it's just gonna be the most annoying thing ever because i'll be doing it let me tell you why it's like this okay it's because you're clearly the better player okay so when i get more damage i'm happy clearly i'm happy yeah yeah it's obvious people know me so when i get a bit of damage i'm happy with it i gotta even it out and i gotta start calling you out every time i damage you which is like every single day please for the love of god i need help what do you need help with now i need a shotgun i'm so desperate for three shields when i was like 50 hp you are useless right now rich i had a comment the other day that told me that uh because i i i res this i like i went out of i was in the middle of a fight and then my teammates died or they went down and then i went out of my way to leave that fight go

octane's one i'm dead man i'm around a corner oh god oh my god this dude literally only knows how to run his gun right these bad boys up too what they backed up a little bit all right well since rich is the 1v3 god apparently we're letting him do this on his own ready for this just one person just one person no there's three of them no way i'm huge like 101 on how to take 75 damage while not doing anything i didn't want to waste and wasting your gravel i didn't want to commit to it i need to learn what else can i do rich hello i'm pick i'm picking up a spitfire this team is this is they're literally just crab walking up top bridge this i wanted the spitfire give me a second mate oh 1v3 though oh my god i will 1v3 then this is the longest 1v3 i've ever seen in my life have a crab walking team of three i'm scanned mate what i can do okay i'll come through get one of them that's all i can do nice there's damage nice there's time oh no we're actually like losing this fight like that blue tonight middle of a fight there's damage i mean that's all you can do when you can't kill people and you gotta raise right man what a mess i was i was gonna be through them i was gonna 1v3 them they terminate i killed one of them and then the guy hops around the corner with an either eight mate i don't know what you want me to do about that well then you weren't gonna 1v3 though if they let me shoot them i'd have killed them think about it mate come on if they stood still they were dead oh man
