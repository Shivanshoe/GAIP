is dumbest thing i've ever seen hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some mirage i feel like every now and again i've rediscovered how fun mirage can be for escaping or in 1v1 situations as you saw in the intro clip now one of my favorite things to do is use my ultimate and then run into a wall face first and pretend that i'm a decoy and it works maybe 50 of the time every time you have to give it a go because when it works and someone is watching you it is so funny i don't know why it's just the best so thanks for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends needs to be like intense fast right then the wind can be whatever uh i'm landing with you because the whole team just landed okay welcome to my mode wait this this is somebody else here i took care of it don't worry there's a team at a market too what's that oh god didn't even stream or i think watch my back i'm looking at the loot come in i think it's so serious all right plenty of people in stream i forgot mirage that he's so sad there's a box near the side that is the saddest thing i've ever seen boxes are indestructible in this game it's crazy there's an online in that box i tried to ping it oh he's got the battle pass again too [Music] give me a sec recharging shield times if i send my d coin to the lava oh man why didn't you warm me why would you do that i'll try to make him float so people would look there and think i'm an idiot and then i was going to shoot him oh that's not how apex works what are they good though where's this dude right down the uh put down a person oh it was a decoy oh it was a octane crab walking i don't know where he went damn he's good-looking [Music] by the way okay and i have 800 damage so let's say 500 damage i have seven kills charge oh it doesn't surprise me doesn't surprise me you know you thought it's way more than me it's kind of crazy honestly oh you're getting pushed i don't i don't i don't it's about even baths let me know if you need anything one more seven kills they are not pushing no they've been sat there for ages i should have you i threw my own because you said they were pushing me no i don't have them no i thought that i thought they were red octane pushing you i think they just got went up top okay oh my god this is a regular currency oh this is the usual these are the usual vibes no these are new vibes giving my shields of recharge oh my decoy made it over the top this guy's an athlete when you like yeah when you like slide and jump and then you send it in the middle that they they like get eat it across they go so far i've left him with the very small bacon someone's gonna fall for that actually survived he landed that big mod right i'm pretty sure you landed at big mom no he came he might he was a streamer building for a little bit there's no way was he controlling yeah he was he's been kind of close to us i think that's more impressive thanks i don't know what i need here to be honest with you phoenix phoenix kid here might as well take something nice you've got good taste i have eight backs um nice and eight kills a bat for every kill oh what's your damage without thirsting about 34 34 damage i bet without thurson yeah probably okay okay the team is the top of the though is damaging my turn mate what are you doing that for my turn it's embarrassing wiped the squad damage shields are recharged um a little under 2k okay i think i thirsted like two people maybe maybe it was like three because i thirsted the last two i'm out of spite gonna need a replay of that that's about three it's about three ah come on i'm getting stuck on stuff this guy has an eva and he is slapping people i haven't even i'm slapping people slapping people that are on the ground that can actually worked me i don't know if they're upset but i'm buying sandwiches actually this is the first floor right not a second before i work on the uh it's the one thing that you do right the one thing i do right okay not you i just mean americans no that's fine that's fine guys are we those you do that right i'm a farmer oh i actually destroyed that guy they were located i didn't get any i got one kill from that i don't like eight people so this is deserved though deserve to deserve you spent this whole game trying to just like steal actually actually true actually i tried to ping the ship and i accidentally used my ability i don't know i just did that i just loved that it's a hay it was a path they i thought he said she i probably did to the bam i'm running out stop it every single one of them okay they all look the same there's no way it's not this guy already this guy's a demon he's i don't think that's him i don't think he'd be wandering around the streets like this but why was he in the middle of the street though you just run into a building i've needed to either right am i shocked and i'm afraid just but i can't keep looking for it um i mean i'm gonna drop something cause i can't see where i'm going because my teammate keeps smoking in front of me thank you thank you throwing jump drive this is last game of world veggies you gotta make account yeah i am i have my account not really you've been spending your time thirsting people on the ground you've probably firstly more people than me this game name well out of spite out of spite but that's the thing is i didn't go into this trying to out damage you i'm over here having a good time having fun just vibing with the nose you don't understand you don't understand you're getting the vibes all wrong it's not something get more damage from you it's so it's so it's not an embarrassing look if i've got eight kills at 800 damage it's just embarrassing okay somebody like you know i've been kill steven i was trying to make it more respectable let's see ah that's the competition everything's competition to you to the most competitive person possibly ever i am pretty competitive but if i was if i was more competitive if i was that competitive then i'd be playing ranked every day and i'd be playing like trying to be a pro yeah but you're playing with me so that's why you're not playing around that much something i'm throwing true yes okay is that a thing you were gonna die oh yeah wait she took the gold armor from the cab package we're their ultimate wait i hear somebody 80 ping gamer i did i hit i hit two of them and i hit the last one was a no break someone ate pink uh so then you

never doubt i'll die in my life oh you actually punched my toe how that worked how does that even work like i thought when you were moving it didn't work i'm a demon give me a second charging shield you might be doing this in this area a serious note we've actually kind of rolled this lobby you don't want 15 kills yeah we've been i'm on 12. i'm just being being dumb the whole time i'm just reviving it okay where is this last solo i would like to get this over with if we let them farm i can get a 20 bump oh we got four oh why is he so mad at me he's so happy that he punched you today oh you just got bmw so bad ex-champions that's funny oh what's that emoji throw in the game man it wasn't even me i'm not i was respected though gg amigo 59 damage per guy akin yes there's no shot that he actually things are acting right um
