hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are looking at the fight night collection event coming on the 5th of january so in four days time with it comes a new game mode a new town takeover and a new heirloom so let's start with the airloom it's for gibby it's like a an orange glowing axe of some sort and you can see him here absolutely demolishing caustic with his sledgehammer album which clearly means that it is better than caustics and that's just how it works next up we have the new limited time mode called airdrop escalation with the description care packages replaced with clusters of increasingly rare loot and fully kitted weapons this looks like a fun time i'm not sure if they are going to limit the loot outside of the care packages which would uh in my opinion be good as it would force you to fight over them a little bit more against other teams for the best loose also in this clip you can see what looks to be the anvil receiver coming back for the flatline which is a very welcome addition on my end i loved this and i can't wait to use it again and lastly we have the town takeover fight night this is on olympus it's where that big ship was not too far away from darks a little bit further away from the states it's near turbine that sort of area and it looks like a melee only fight against other players in a boxing ring and only one person can survive i can't wait to drop in with the whole server and battle it out with with my fists only to become the last one left in fact i won't just have my fists i have the gibby loom i'll be bringing a gibby heirloom to a fistfight and i'll tell you what i'll i'm gonna win it all this is a big update coming in just four days if you are new to the channel be sure to subscribe for more apex legends content and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm actually gonna have to start landing some shots um i mean i wasn't gonna say it it's really it's kind of bad i thought i'd be warming up but it hasn't happened yet it usually takes me like anywhere from 15 to like 45 minutes to warm up every year i each takes
