hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing a legend who came out recently who was completely overpowered when they came out underwent some nerfs and then their peak rate fell off the face of the earth it is of course seer now i think sea is still really good i enjoy every part of his kit his passive his ability his ultimate all three of them are really good and i cannot believe that his peak rate is just 2.3 now i got this stat thanks to apex status it's not official but it did track seven million players to arrive at this statistic two point three percent unbelievable he's so good i am actually about to main see her just to show how good he can be so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends same thing with nfts too i mean i feel like some of it is probably a scam and then a lot of it probably isn't yeah possibly i just don't understand how a picture of an ape smoking a cigarette can cost half a million dollars it's money laundering i swear yeah i don't really understand it either but it's it's a happening it's maybe i'm just too simple minded you know maybe i'm just a big idiot that's possible no no there's another one there i don't know nice i don't the first guy too that guy owns an nft he heard me you heard me chatting you think so yeah he was angry with me thanks mate other crafting i can't see because the big crafting symbol attract the guy hit the guy for 14. he's got gold on this oh my god i said fact oh my god i just give me your gold mates actually i'm not going to use gold let's go if you can see i can't ping you me one minute i'll pick it up so bad me i like cabbage i feel like it's an underrated food cabbage can be good you know what you know he's really underrated coleslaw andre oh underwrite he's not it's not i'm actually not i'm not joking here baked potato with some cheese beans and coleslaw that's good it's good what are your thoughts on that i mean in the first half yeah in the first half second and second half you know third fourth quarter i'm just um i'm gone i stopped playing i'm not even kidding either it's great there's no way we're getting a game here we both suck this isn't ever been uploaded this is a personal conversation that was so bad in the beginning i'm just terrible yeah we suck mate so i'm just so inconsistent i was playing so good yesterday and now i'm the worst throwing nice i'm pressing my z controller set on my keyboard please don't hit me parallel oh one type of problem this is the worst i hate them with my life here three times i got it two times do you want it i've have it two times okay back to back sia is underrated no car it is nothing no cabbage no cabbage involved zero cabbages originally yes but there's 30 people left in this lobby it's kind of crazy watch this watch watch this watch this oh my god this guy rushed me oh god what lies the squad of the squad careful yeah i'm sure come on that's one on this building this one's reviving one i'm about to go okay no oh what's that [ __ ] went so bad oh i'm gonna up top she's one won where is she i need more she fades away i don't know where she works if she left him honestly i think she might actually not my heartbeat at all uh let me go see if her box is right there wait yeah she no no this is a leader ah she was that way like she's just the best legend ever now i have no ammo yeah she's good what are you looking for what kind of ammo are we looking for um i'm using light and heavy did she take the energy back i don't think she did i've got a good amount of heavy if you need it okay there's another team right here they're pushing up already how is this happening what i'm taking it yeah another one turned up i've always just so broken so good firing um good job oh no joe's awful husband i see it's a mess i'm my best work another team i was trying to shoot at yeah i guess you can't i hate people phone all the way south but by the time we get there someone will turn up here yeah this is the question of a win to go i mean we can go there right they sound pretty close over there yeah i got bad uh like my gold where the cargo but was where i just was um gold where uh in between yeah nice the car is so good oh i forgot that it took a yeah no it is because just because the attachments oh yeah because you can yeah i i didn't realize how it worked but you find one extended mag and that's fine you can use it yeah right i found a gold light mag like literally right before you said that so now i have two gold light mags on my car oh so good there's a care package to our west black on bothered ah it is really hard to use though it's not it's not an easy gun to use so i feel like that's turning a lot of people off um but neither was the 99 the 99 is is not easy to use but it's been in the game for so long and people are just used to it [ __ ] it's easy the car oh people here [Music] fighting yeah pretty much that's why you gotta heal before you loot you know what's in them no no no no don't teach them the shots tell them keep keep keep keep going guys okay you need that you need that blue stock get the blue stuff and then i need easier kills i'm getting worse as the day goes on i saw this um like little document thing on twitter and it showed the sensitivity and uh response curve that a lot of the like pro players use oh they just opened this package and i swear someone was using steady i swear if you might have been yeah those are wrestling there's one person yeah i saw those i saw that there's one person who uses steady who is this man i'm like i know who he is but like why there we go maybe you need to send them a message and be like hey man i know you're going through it i've been there yeah i know you've ended me okay listen i've got some i got an idea that's a big portal right there it's the thing with ash okay escape falls on the best because you can't see it if they cracked an octane i think he was popping him back it's flesh i think maybe no i didn't i think our rates should be won with teammate here two right yeah it was two i messed up i should have popped my ultimate but i can't unless i use my keyboard so it really put me off i don't want to rate you oh yeah you're throwing it i'm absolutely screwed if i had my like it's so much easier i got stuck right there dude i don't the uh the indication of like when you get stuck is so hard to tell now i can't tell if there's a nade next to me or if i'm stuck yeah because it's like a burst of damage but you could have been shotgunned or something who knows i think it's because there's uh there's no slowing effect anymore so like that's that's when you can tell uh when you're stuck yes exactly yeah when you're slowed and now i just like i just see the indicator and i'm like am i stuck or am i what's up whenever i just buy a nade when nick marks and like teeth slot too when they first came to apex they saw the nadines can't need them they're like i'm stuck that's it but back then like you actually would get slowed they just stand next to it thinking they couldn't escape crystals oh oh they're waiting for us uh nice but we just spring to that then it's poor guys you say poor guys would they wait for us outside you know it's poor guys man i feel bad for them no okay have some compassion no champions be human no compassion in war this is warfare okay nice wait we've got to say oh you got one more knock oh you think you so no we didn't get the same we didn't get the same i had three hundred dollars 300 damage more so that it actually is two revives one v2 that took like 45 seconds no i couldn't use my ultimate okay
