that i mean i've only got 200 damage before i didn't do anything to those first two guys that landed on us so that's probably why they just raised here yeah there's someone on me nice recharging shield those guys got controlled right i am ready uh me too you sound like irish accent um did i sound a little irish there yeah i didn't mean to i couldn't supposed to have irish on one one side of my family oh really it was just your yeah accessories it kind of just came out starting to come out you know the 65 this one on the right like two shots he's on the roof his knee is he oh my god i

donate one to the cause that would be very useful thank you you should never drop against the pack because it's always going to do that you know yeah that was kind of unfortunate nah i'm stupid on this guy lots and lots of lots of time yeah i didn't have any bats i'm still pretty be there i hear someone yeah yeah he's almost broken nicely how did he get all his health back came back around and he was just how do i think like send you flying in the air um you gotta stand like a little bit left of the rope and then i think you press x and then double tap square i think i didn't say it doesn't really work um right there though oh okay well let's just identify here let's go this way noise i'm hoping they're gonna go and loot him yeah they're on it that man is on mouse and keyboard that might come loose broken reloading i like it when they stand behind yeah i knew he was gonna okay oh my god no no so far oh my god they are getting sent he's an octane rev team my cat's in the way i literally can't sleep already giving my shields a recharge reloading reloading oh you guys getting a farmed wait why am i almost dying are they on the ship yeah yeah yeah they are yeah yeah the chief isn't safe but we have no cover here i'm gonna get ahead you guys are so oh it's such a difficult spot yeah this is the team that killed you when you you were standing in the middle of the ship yeah sorry that was that time oh and it came away from the grave thank you for raising me are you good you're good oh he had no wonder this guy's landing every shot on me oh just uh 45 seconds oh so they didn't finish me they just let down me i managed to get to you and i they were they were trying to get closer because when you went down they didn't have an angle on you and you were on the ship so i managed to get to the ship and um nearly down one and then they got third parted and then the third party i had a fight with them 30 seconds remember that's the law so it's worth it was it cracked because it can't awake oh they just panicked so hard on my decoys seen one guy so far loot oh my god oh he's flush oh you're cracking right yeah it's gonna be fine by the way nice oh my gosh i thought we were our last ropes there last legs either poor timing kind of was thank you though lucky here i got you good on ya nice well i definitely took some kills that's just ridiculous it was i was so insulted i'm dead i'm not dead i'm back selfrest i'm dead again for 14. yeah this game's kind of a struggle oh this game mode um it can be like you're always struggling yes it's fun though when it goes well no that wasn't my fault he didn't want to go up the stairs i'm not going to make him okay there's a team here me oh behind mine oh god i'm coming i'm here with you for 88. i drop if you need i'm down here i don't understand how you can see me from that angle that's ridiculous sorry i have to draw oh you dropped it oh yeah and we've got about a minute hole spitfire on me but i don't want to ping it just in case you actually take it then i'm playing with the spitfire abuser whoa whoa whoa you'd be happy that i use one heads up got one here i can i can keep some top from like this angle

round three for you oh i'm sorry love what are you saying yeah i know i'm off the scene whoa why do you know you could do that the heck very athletically i was chaperoning you to the loot but really you are chaperoning me i am the athletic one here oh my god there's a team on it i'm throwing oh there is how did you get away with that oh god i didn't know i got out save me wait i'm pretty sure
