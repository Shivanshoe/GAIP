that little you got the little r if there's no arms involved in the word then they'll see right through me that's all you need like rising really no that wasn't my fault so she would have been and then i saw that you were back to shoot and i knew that you would have seen that i was lying nearly nearly really quick yeah yeah i saw that double pad double they're both broken they're both broken some people thought i was being serious people were like people actually thought you were yeah we try to go for our lobbies like if they start striving i know the lobby which hasn't worked why does everybody have such good loot and we just don't we're finding it on them i don't think you do that because you you just say stuff and then you realize later like i shouldn't have said that yeah that's why i'd be a bad doctor but i have like that little thing in my head that said it before it actually came out i was like i'm not gonna say that sounds weird some kid would come in with a broken leg and i'd be like oh my god that is horrendous mate little freddie what has happened oh they're here my three-time site it's too much it's too slow wait wait i've just realized something it was the lifeline i mean this is a really juicy pc for a backup pc yeah i guess that point though because there's nothing else we can spend money on exactly oh where did you come from he's got to set a burst of speed he's punching me there maybe i'm fine superman over here have you been him down if you beat him down i got you i have a mozam someone's coming down someone comes down behind you is this way

guy just had the perfect noob i know picked up our teammates banner yeah if i had any other gun that's the that's the hard thing about using goofy wonky loadouts man when you get pulled up on crazy like that yeah with the team coming from behind yeah there's only so much you can do if i had a nine there or a volt they were they died exactly considering i swear to god i heard a pathfinder grapple i swear to god rich i'm nervous keep your eyes peeled there's a little rat somewhere you might have had the same idea i heard a pathfinder grapple when you pulled up there's a mastiff in the g7 scan here i can drop you some ammo perfect zombie that's good i mean leave us alone pat finder that's probably him right there he probably grabbed that armor a little rat two of the squads and we just heard where one of them was this is your kreber 30 seconds time to go go back mate you're the caustics though bye okay do you need hater balls or anything i have two shield bats uh i got some i got a couple cells i was right care package coming in ooh they're gonna die [Music] am i trying to rap with something i'm watching the right side yeah yeah are they safe there like never mind just here on

all day she does 360 drinks yes he tried to think he died there was nothing he could do leg all you want that's weird to me like he was going up at like 2 fps oh man that was wild i was terrified i was scared for my life i'm glad we got that one out of the way i want me to that was good nice good job dude most of my kills came early game where people didn't have much in terms of armor you know so the damage wasn't there you know but the action was i will say absolutely
