hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are attempting to play some solo ranked on mouse and keyboard inspired by schiff i watch his streams and he just makes me want to play some madden keyboard there is something about the freedom that comes with it you don't have to rely on aim assist you don't get screwed over by aim ac sticking in and out if you're shooting through windows or smoke or caustic gas it's always the same mechanics you can armor switch really quickly in the heat of battle it's just fun and i'm not making the permanent switch over don't worry if you're a controller player and you like watching me because i play controller i'm really not the best massive people player but it is it is fun to play sometimes i think my aim is alright because i have experience in other fps games but apex's movement is unique and it takes some getting used to saving my keybinds it will just take more time and practice now if you're watching this video and you aren't subscribed i am less than 1500 subs away from one million so if you could eat that's a bun i will love you forever so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends alright well there's definitely a team ahead of us here and there's purple armor there's no way i'm getting that what are you waiting for me get my kill and i'll run off no i wanted my kill i mean i guess i got it still you are fortunate we are on the same team i guess you didn't jump i guess we're still alive she stayed up there i don't know why she had purple armor her teammate was already dead i don't know why you want to drop down to get you killed that's what i would have done maybe i'm too too kill hungry you know probably the reason i went down in the first place our teammates are alive as well an absolutely scuffed star i honestly don't know how people fly you so quickly on this game the amount of times i try and land somewhere and some money and someone beats me there by like a full second because he's ridiculous i'm sorry teammate i should have came that way i definitely should have came the same way as you come on get up come on come on come on this is the lifeline from the ship she has purple armor oh my god i need a damn target and you're getting that from the field makes sense as long as i get the purple one i'm happy all right well i have three shots in an r301 oh go back okay uh okay massive this is the most pc oops sorry teammate this is the most pc setup i mean both my guns are pretty much naked which is not ideal especially when you've got a wingman i tell you what these are probably the worst two guns in the game to have no attachments a no bomb mastiff and a wingman without an extended mag oh good great i'm struggling here friends when i got two kills i'll take it especially considering we didn't even get the purple armor at the start and our logo had to have to throw hands pretty much because of my bad landing bad fine at least it's all good this place looks unloaded we survived somehow our chance of survival there must have been supremely low but we're here we're still breathing we're still alive and we've got a blue shotgun box and a one-time stagecraft man there has to be one in here right there has to be the law there's gonna be a gold one in here and a school piece seth here as well that guys need to crack but this guy could there you go i can't even see him can't see the man i'm gonna go five shots in this thing oh my god my teammate down one of them is that 30 30 repeater coming into action three terrific finds my friends but unfortunately i have none of those guns okay it's the lifeline i think this is the lifeline i've got respawn i think it's the one that we killed on the ship the one that damned me then i downed her sorry friend i'm wearing your purple armor you make it to us can we regroup because we might get pushed in the back no it's not okay i'm coming as fast again nice job and he's guaranteed to have a heavy mag no he doesn't i've stolen your shield i'm sorry you need some help too i only got one med kit i hope he's got one okay i'm full you know the car cracked all right guys i'm watching this back don't ask me why i didn't army switch here i would have been absolutely fine and a mouse and keyboard it's one of the biggest advantages you can arm a switch really quickly while strafing and uh any sort of pressure and for some reason you know what you know what i think it is and i think it's like this a lot of the time when you're commentating as you're playing as well there are so many thoughts going through my head i'm trying to focus so much i'm like aiming and moving that i don't think about those those little advantages that i can get from like armor switching and that's what happened here so listen please please don't berate me okay fortunately my teammates clutched up if we lost because of that it would have been my fault completely anonymous which would have been good i agree i fully agree i can't even see this guy still like 45 on there reckon they're low on like um healables and stuff why wouldn't he heal to fall i'm coming teammates reloading nice you got the res oh my word we did it level four extended heavy beginning ring countdown it's probably time to get out of here obtains jump pad is literally just the best autumn in the game look at this for the whole team too the charge tower here if we even worth it right i assume my teammates have got theirs i'm on 20 already it's not even worth it i feel like my aim on mazda keyboard is all right like it's obviously not the best could definitely do with a lot of practice but the movement on apex is the thing that i struggle with the most i mean wardrobes are easy but like the general movement mid-range um even things like i think the keybinds as well but the keyboards just come with practice i'm constantly dealing with the wrong item dropping things i'm trying to use using things i'm trying to drop and those things just come with more practice more time on the i want to say the sticks less time on the sticks see someone out there more time on the mouse and keyboard yet another res here that we can push i mean this is going to draw a lot of that growth and this is a nice bit of high ground no mind right here oh my lord he fast and i'm getting charged rifles all right i'm the center of attention apparently i don't know how this has happened and they're on top of us someone's trying to get up top hold on [Music] you still up here how are you not getting shot by the other team just standing on top okay do i take the pk it's got nine shots left i can always come back to this mass thief mastic on medicine keyboard it's just the most positive obnoxious combo especially in the giveaway where you can just like strafe through them okay who put that right there kind of climb up this isn't good uh that is a full team well teammates i'll be with you in a second please don't with the massive than i am the pk i feel like that on controller too i don't know why but i've never liked the peacekeeper i know a lot of people gonna be angry about that oh no it feels weird we got two of them there's a horizon around here somewhere i have a subject in view see we should try and get rid of her who didn't get third party seconds it's this solo and then the team that rotated earlier on i don't see it it's not here that's a shame we're all outside of the ring is right here level five robles on the i need i need some bats as well only one more squad between us and our [Applause] i prize rotate early let's go here the better skin if they're going to send that cone we should rotate on your friends we should get here they're gonna have to run down from their high ground okay these cracks i guess we hold them further this way instead subject spotted shut up when i start pinging i can't even see the guy in the first thirty i'm not gonna peak that he's pouring them out that's kind of smart i'm gonna try and get behind her i think i'll cover near these bins so last one last one nicer my aim could do with some work but somehow it's still the most comfortable part of my game i missed a lot of wingman shots i mean i think i was the most successful domestic honestly it was like little jiggle peeks around the gibby alton the gibby bubba a three and a half thousand damage okay nearly dropped to 4k with mouse and keyboard shout out my team though we were a cohesive unit right there cause we wouldn't have been alive without the caustic traps without the corset ultimate in that building we were getting rushed by like two or three teams we've been focused oh a good selective team effort that was fun hopefully you guys enjoyed that one thank you for watching and i'll see you all in the next one bye
