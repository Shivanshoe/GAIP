hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some rank today with so far and janks the dream team has been reformed we tried to do this last split but so far with silver and this split he's silver again unbelievable but this season rant is so much more difficult it's so much more punishing if you mess up especially if you mess up when there are more than 10 squads left and i realize that they are trying to make ranked kind of reflect how the algs works if you don't know in lgs most of the time you don't get any placement points until you finish in the top 10. so if you don't finish top 10 you're kind of struggling and the same thing is happening in ranked now this was recorded a fair few days ago so the competition has got easier in gold but we are in gold at the moment but it was pretty much like a masters lobby so the competition is fierce i have a long video here for you today i hope you enjoy it thank you for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends far yeah one's in here one minute running for me right for me no no no no skippy how did i not get come on guys sorted out i was i was in my own box slurp i don't know which one that was whoever that one you got you got the helmet you got the helmet he doesn't loot he keeps his whole thing his whole bag empty so that when he finally sees a kill he just slurps everything yeah you don't understand you don't understand you literally can't lose to save your life all the time you can't lose save your life but i'm the one who gets comments about 30 seconds ago i don't trust anything you do that was the fastest slurp i've ever seen in my life and you're playing on like 120 have you have you seen my trigger finger always complains about his pings have you seen my trigger fingers unboxing faster than anybody else on the planet yeah no one's got the talent by the way when i was hitting flesh up there i thought i was hitting flesh but he was using the seer the cyril as cover and i kept getting the cyril he's waiting like he's weak on me i should have queued in on that like how am i getting flushed i haven't even hit armor yet uh they're fighting they're on the building right here longbow three times i'll wait for you to shoot him jenks i can shoot him when you shoot i'm pretty far away okay here i'll shoot at my fly line i'll try he's got a big piece of cover we're not gonna really achieve anything it's gone now it is gone the pieces cover is gone wait for him to start popping something you have a zip we can zip on there on the building i'm gonna shoot him what happened man you are throwing it four five the variety has got blue she doesn't anymore jenks nice it's kp for me kill the other team so far next time you should hit your shots you should have seen what richards did is i don't have a rope i have one of these though is there a team in here i don't know inside inside i dropped by accident no hailing in here got the valk okay he's just vibing out in here lego like revive this guy revive this guy get him go don't worry i got him revive that guy [Music] you stole everything off of me it was incredible unless you have zero shield cells it drops out thank you did you say at one point he was sitting on there like a pidgey he's just showing there like a pigeon do you have pigeons where you are do we have pigeons where i'm at yeah i don't know i don't know what kind of climb this thing enjoy where do you think i live what kind of climate is the pigeons living because they live here we've got a bunch of pigeons here the rings moving big hair they just like all climbing standby champion main engine burns coming to pjs oh yeah shot this way i thought so i mean we should definitely consider playing a little bit more i just raised more vividly a little bit more they responded here yeah in the dog pants i don't do we want to go in there yeah i think complete opposite of playing conservatively yeah but like it's a fresh race i think we get them out bro i'm gonna look i have my we can get it that is not playing conservatively that is the opposite i'm down i'm down though i'm 100 on them oh janks janks janks turn around protect me outside the dogs jags i gotta kill him i i i mean i'm not gonna lie i just got griefed so hard and you guys had one job no i shot like four of them i literally leveled up to red i've got so much damage on these guys i was on like great armor dude my screen let's just get it's just shaking quack are you you think you're being funny huh what 45 to go what happened fortunately radar shows the rings close right head right head right head this rock hey now we're here because so far shot spiders aren't behind them are you cracking with an archer damage nice oh he's nice good job with the spiders because we wouldn't kill that team otherwise i mean they would have ratted us even better yeah that was the case so you're welcome might be a team in this building i'm going to climb to the roof of this see if anybody's up here dude look at he's reviving he's ready i like it we gotta get just leaving for a sec he'll start the resume i think we stay on the right side there's there's a cover over here thank you yeah he's running for me holy wingman spam yep i'm grabbing luke he ran off a little bit this walk down this down this rock she's down here down here are there any other guns in this game no no no just this just this one all right fellas let's uh let's get a little a little more tight here yeah nope nope crackling i think there's a valkyrie solo okay no putting a 6363 in top floor because i think she's gonna go up there oh my god i'm so bad it's my time is the team in that building now there's a solo valve coexisting in this little room with the boys or there was a full three in there yeah i think i think it was a whole team i don't know how they're so split hello green i'm loving star wars i could try to get an angle in arc one i don't have any nades wait i think they have to be over here they have to be on the gravity cannon i saw someone running that way but i don't know if you know what happened to him i'm watching your window rich i can't change that he's got charge of pk i mean we have to move actually no i'm staying up here i'm staying on this yeah you say that and stream in the i'm giving back shields a recharge oh my god it's a path over here drop drop i'm trying i got back i'm just gonna stick it back [ __ ] damage who's the pair i hit 59 on the belt yeah i think getting in front of him on the on those rocks that i was on was probably the one i think i think if we just hold it like that yeah i think either one if we just stuck to like one thing we would be fine you know oh god i did not land up there i got a p20 i have r9 v20 do you need 945 i'm gonna go loot these bins real quick i'm good okay are you ready they're all they're all in there's been oh my god i thought i had a bow 126 on the octagon nice tell you guys nice shots i'll be with you in a sec there there is the resin protector keeping you safe 154 nice shots man with the sense not too cheese i dropped the purple purple back there if you need it oh my god please i'm back seeing that you got a journey to the ring nice shots dude thank you thank you that wasn't i wasn't there at all i was running around looting i went for a flank i sort of left you in there uh is there a medkit anywhere um i got one i just picked one up i come deliver i come deliver you just you hang out

charge rifle so i've got a level two sniper stock so all right we're done how do we get out of here now you press the button again you guys are just some big noobs man i can't help it dude that was crazy what is this what is happening over there i'm telling you my looting is peak efficiency like you don't you've never seen a man empty his inventory so fast to collect superior loot i'll tell you this i'll give you this you're the only person that i've ever seen a little box grab ammo and when you switch a gun if you don't need ammo you drop it while in the box yes like that's what i mean i've never seen it i hate people to do that why it's so much faster so if i was like oh grab these 20 bullets no no i'm speaking you just saved him save myself no no i need to kill the 66 flesh she i think she by herself she bring herself in there i've only seen an ash i absolutely whacked her wait he's moving we got a runner he's going this way on me i'm gonna i'm gonna pinch him i won't take that take that no never mind i don't take it i'm taking it she runs with me no no i'm not taking it actually i thought i was gonna but i missed it there's no way she's using like a med kit or anything so she's probably 30 health full shield do i pk or volt no thank you though they're uh oh yeah running down the hill running down the yeah yeah get the vault unless you guys want it if you want it uh all right
