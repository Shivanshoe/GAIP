hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we have one hour of ranking up on apex now the reason i'm doing this is because i wanted to post more storm point games on the channel but i find it really difficult in the public games to get content on that map because everyone's dead instantly and then it's 10 minutes of running with no rotations but ranked it's more relaxed the problem is i haven't played ranked in a while and i'm silver too so instead of just grinding without recording i thought i could make a few longer videos of my journey for you guys as i get back to platinum diamond and hopefully masters one day and then you guys can watch it maybe in the background or something kind of like you would a string i hope you enjoyed today's games i played a bunch of different legends and tried to use different guns as well to keep it fresh thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right so in these like lower level lobbies you still get people uh like me i've got a massive trail but i just haven't played ranked in so long so it can be very easy to get too complacent and then you just bump into an absolute demon on the sticks or all with the mouse you know we don't discriminate over here you're running to him wait did i not pick up the blue shotgun bob before scammed or nearly scammed i've got a replacement fortunately oh it's tempting but i'm still inside someone out there attention if there is someone in here i don't want a hemlock here let's go that's a crazy haircut pretty sure he's got a mozambique oh my god oh my god no he's there team i think my team should be all right i mean it's only the guy at the back all right i've got uh i got one kill the guy that's what i mean you know you going just like you just want to w key everything and then he turns out there's a guy on this little part who absolutely destroys you yeah a little bit too eager you get a little too eager so you go sir well okay good job team hi i'm going to pop a phoenix kit and i'm pretty sure we're the only people to land at command center which is really refreshing because every time i play storm point this map is called in public games the same thing happens uh it's just people landing command center uh barometer is another one uh antenna is another one checkpoint thing is like the four and it rotates wherever the ship is people everyone just lands there and everyone dies within the first 12 seconds much like i just did when i got down to when i thought i could um kill that octane so i thought he had less health than 66. it was not the case shield here pretty sure i hear people over this way this is where the gunfire is right are those bins opened those bins are open i'm gonna pick up some crafting mats get me a chill battle too what an enemy out there definitely two teams here are some of the team rocking up is gonna stop topic i see up top i wasn't expecting that all right nice i don't want to drop down because i'm scared of this for the team so we killed that team but there was a yeah yeah there we go see what's getting shot at i don't know if they've already made it up top or not are they still down low need some help i don't want to face that guy that range when he's got a wingman i've got a naked vault still got nothing on it did they run off oh they're on the way to running off so where do these stairs lead you know i don't think i've ever taken those stairs before they don't lead up here do they they're like down low are they above us i mean it might as well just up top for now i want to know what oh they do and i've still got nothing on these vaults it's just the worst i mean it's pretty good stuff but it's if i had a barrel stabilizer an extendo mag any anything like that hello crazy any anything for my you know i'm using this more i'm gonna transfer the stuff over to this although my car does have the extendo mag so it's hard to tell which one is the better choice but the good news is we're still alive which i was sort of concerned about given the start of the game when i went down immediately see this is this is a far healthier lobby than most of my public games on this map i'm having a great time i'll get two of them yeah i had a blue one uh i was a bit of a waste now i don't have enough for a shield bats oh god oh my god i'm okay here right no no no you got a door that's a good ain't who was that was that then man's got red as well you see what i mean this guy's not new careful teammate i think my turn is going to get over eager here that's my last shield battery probably didn't need to use it really did i shield cells would be fine like these guys i mean the gib is definitely pretty good he's got run around with red armor yeah wipe the ice if i can find another oh my god contact i think we're gonna die here to be honest i just played that way better than we did i'm gonna have to come back i've got no big heels the gibby's got an arm shield and red armor and i haven't got an extended mag on my vault it's it's proven to be pretty tough yeah i'm gonna have to come back i know what you want me to do he's just absolutely pelting me here team do i have time to go all the way around without them noticing draken like would they see me if i tried to walk up this hill i mean i haven't even got a shield cells left i i knew as soon as that they got up top there but they were gonna they were gonna kill us they just divided us you know they play that like a team i can try and get you guys back but they're just gonna sit there looting camping banners on purpose or by accident they're still gonna be there you know if you land all headshots t what does that mean t like that's the t too late ah i can maybe get right that's still here where are you no please okay that's just unfortunate it was kind of close i didn't realize she was on the opposite side there chase oh my god you've really gonna land that shot on me no forgot that 23. i see 23 damage room with that need please have some shield cells thank you well i could get involved right should i just run over there get involved i mean he's already down two of them with a pk i need to run because i'm next have fun anyone gonna come for him ah i think i'm fine i'll try a good time they let you the team get away with it i'm dead there's a guy right here i'm dead i'm dead what a stupid game oh we had some fun for our first game on it's okay this guy's not bronze one over there uh is that three teams landing at cascade falls that means we just parted this we land straight down here we open the door we get a thermite a nade we turn around we go over there and we thermite and made them that's the plan yeah yeah because i've got no guns here we go i've got a gun now you know this little side compartment entrance here all right there is triple beans up here hopefully i get a second gun because we are running straight to cascades i like to call it cascades because it just reminds me of the old times you know king's canyon is down here too i've got an evo shield here i should have taken that three-time site for this uh repeater but it's okay i'm hearing a distinct lack of firing which is confusing with three teams landed here unless they just punched each other to death making contact with the enemy giving my shields a recharge can kill these guys easy might be two of them if it's the champion team people this way too i'm just going to get interesting here let's be very careful because if someone comes out there i'm screwed what's the champion team we have taken out the champion wonderful we just eliminated the whole squad exciting switch out my whole kit here my entire kit is just been changed been switched out no one has it two times so so sad i have so many throwables views um nice oh i heard someone does anyone have it two times for me not in the crafter keep forgetting what's in the crafter although i could get myself a shield bat maybe two shell bats and one of these still looking for two times or maybe three times or two to four which i'm not very good with i'll still give it a go i'm gonna play more defensive this game i'm here to win to get rp to become victorious for once it always happens but i'm on the way i'm here pretty much where am i looking i need it two times using grapple i should say we'll see this leg but obviously the spiders i'm really confused i landed one shot i don't actually know if they're in here it doesn't look like anyone's been in here that's a tough shot that one wasn't i'm a little bit a teammate it's a separate team isn't it oh my god come on you've got to die there's another team in here though they could have been walking up towards us though i don't know two times now they've robbed our care package it's unbelievable let's go this way oh my god i messed up so bad i'm so sorry team i'm the worst it's gonna go grab that's fine i'm not sure i actually want it that much i thought that's too much i'll take it there we go nope are you small i'll use more nice all right longbow three times with an alternator do i hear someone else i don't know if i hear something i'm a little bit scared did that guy have many sniper bullets because i didn't look 70 i don't i don't actually need any more than this i might just hold on to some light just because the alternator will run out of bullets and the person i kill might not have that many bullets you know i mean i'm not using the adventure for anything else that's pretty smart to me what was that a lifeline pack we can get ahead of these guys i don't know if someone made it close though recharging shield are they all just chilling with gold by the way that's crazy i should maybe give this to you i'm going to hold on to it i've got a feeling i might need it the gold bag i'm talking about i don't think i've ever seen a squad with three gold armors unless i just hit two people no because he's got he's got gold right did he have that before oh maybe not i think he was too gold in the purple even still even the double gold was annoying because the those little shields are giving him 50. everyone knows that's how it works but it's so annoying ow god the loss of momentum my kneecaps have been destroyed absolutely peppered with my badges that's me i accidentally got the uh if you can see the middle badge just left it's the win five games in a row i hopped on one day and won my first two solo games on this map actually and it was one of those games i keep talking about where nothing really happened i got like 800 damage and then after the second game i was disappointed because it's like well i can't even find anyone and then i got the badge shane i won five in a row so i guess i'd won the previous three in my in my previous session so i got it back soon nice little story for you i hope you enjoyed that one um how long's that care package been there might be where this alternator came from yeah i thought we'd get shot at crossing this river i don't know who that was hello oh my god i don't know if this is even going to work you see if i might need to use my grapple a little jump there we go optics here oh god yeah sorry team my the fault ah let's say for a while of that way just landed no this is why having a longbow's fun you know what here the game's over here we're playing teague now you have to hit me so far away darn it guys mocking me but we've got to replicate here so i can just make more sniper hammer if i need it what you got from your game it's a crater i'm taking it anyone need that i'm happy with myself oh god respawn underneath our nose no this is still in use these these guys aren't even rushing up is that even an enemy i don't know oh my god i'm trying to find damage yeah it's got rocked up now i really need that spitfire again i want the spitfire were you either was tea bagging or was it you i feel like it was the bangalore they're like who's this guy i think it's just a solo pretty sure it's just a solo yeah it's his pathfinder wherever he went oh my teammate where's he going oh they're revived they revived oh god we could have lost the white shield bandits from the start the heck was that oh you can't go no no but now come on kind of close oh come on come on so close contact with target where's that valkyrie going actually still up there come on valkyrie we are going to cascade falls baby we saw people land here i don't have an extended mag on either one of my weapons i would like to use the vault again annoyingly right pinged an extended energy mag yeah thought there would be you see him on my word they do be crafting oh guys this guy had a turbo charger in his uh there we go turbo devo he was crashing something there it is turbo devo who arcs artists he's gonna come back for the banners i'm gonna chill i wanna test out this turbo devo yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah here we go we got the plan we got the planning action banner campers in silver we've reached a new low here on the channel i don't care okay all right i do care a little bit we should move three times for the devo is that what you reckon i need to recharge my shields all right i'll i'll leave the venice i'd like to do a little bit of crafting myself actually i'm afraid as soon as i hop on the craft today classy oh my god get back here hey stop it get get back here i can't let you get away with this please stop running thank you tell you what the three times actually would have been really good there i felt bad for that team can you stop talking valkyrie one you're about three miles away and two you are not even connected to the same game as us i've got hope that he's going to reconnect though although he is in the zone at the moment all right i want to go and craft some barrel stabilizers it's it's ranked everyone just plays chill you know there's 34 people left plenty of action to be had and that is why i'm playing rank to begin with uh i've got a turbo devo and an arthur on without a mag whether or not i'm going to be able to anything against these guys against a charge rifle especially and you can still see me can he he can why where is this guy hello who is it oh it's there recharging shield i'm scared it's going to get flanked here team punching a tunnel are we rushing him okay uh this isn't a good play this is not a good play i'll come in i'll go you may as well play as a team right this isn't it though this guy's gone eight times on his charge rifle i think we just run yeah it's not a good play it's not a good play it's fine we tried it we tried it you retreat a little bit his homies are in the cave this guy's got a 12-time sight on his charge rifle i just can't compete at this range that's the way it is valkyrie is slowly slowly dying hello spitfire turbo divo in a silver lobby i say i say to silver lobby like doesn't half the time it doesn't feel like one a lot of people here like i said before just didn't play around for a little bit that's the way it is all right valkyrie died unfortunately she's gone it's me and wraith but ray's got a nail loom so that means she's sick that's the way this works six bats a good amount of energy loads of healer balls so many heather balls because i've got a spitfire so i don't even need to carry two stacks of different ammo oh come on do i hide this before in this corner come back for it later oh my god please stop this is why we need to just get our building like we need we need to just rotate here let's go this way this is a pointless endeavor would have sat on a beach getting shot at using resources okay i'm saying goodbye to my spitfire which i'm sad about because the crater i mean i'm not good with the crater they're just getting shot by a different team we could probably get up there without any problems with target mate giving my shields a recharge no why would i ever want to take a rope downwards why would i ever want to calmly just hold oh hold on a second let me just what oh god these guys holding hands i'm not gonna get a gun there i gotta drop down where's the entrance this place i'll take it could be worse we must go here noise tv i don't know if he's going to kill him savannah nice job what a mess two full teams landing here i mean the mozam did some good work oh god that's why i said no i've got a hundred energy these guys both had some taking a moment i can drop some energy for this guy for easy we're scanned here there is an enemy over here please don't loader [Music] i think my team wants to revive at all but it's okay ease the low balls up here yes it is that's tremendous is down under the squad to the squad this is a mess sir it's a mess i've decided today that i really dislike cascade falls i just don't like this place it's just weird that buildings are weird the layouts are weird i don't enjoy it i'm not good here give me the battle stave i've got every energy gun on planet earth [Music] first blood there it is soldier goes the beasley chimney he's attacked nice job teammates fire through these windows because you get no aim assist look i'm just lost in a maze of confusion yeah it is a major confusion i don't care anyone say that's that's the new name for this place what are we going here a bit of energy no real good attachments i might try that out again last time i used it was actually pretty good three times in the r301 i've got really good attachments here anyone needs that extended all right where would he go after this uh we could actually craft because i'm pretty sure there's a lot yeah level three light making the craft today i was tapped out when the ship came down i reckon if you open the map you should have a faint line that tells you where the ship went but then again i could just stay tabbed in and try and remember it i can't really complain this must have been a lifeline pack package over this way somewhere over there there's no i'm gonna have to sense them just yet maybe these buildings i reckon nothing just yet i do love being here so useful to know if someone's here or not maybe it's further away than i thought can't see the smoke anymore all right big care package angle good chance they're on this cypress uh that broke would have been way quicker wouldn't it if i weighs this ping that's 100 meters but it's also got it's also down low for some reason ah something nice all right what we got please give us a gun game give us a gun come on that's tremendous that is what i'm talking about there is a movie and i don't see him nothing has happened this entire game 10 seconds are you sure all the doors are closed i think he's actually seen something oh my god i don't know how we've seen no one this entire game i'm playing sia not only is there no one here there's no one within a 75-meter radius of us or at least me at all times it wasn't lifelong oh they're sat all the way over there are they that's the one i probably saw earlier on in the game let's reposition here they can't have gone far i guess they did go far oh my god that no one still no one let's go this way really yes the lifeline team i have no med kits after all this time i didn't realize i had no med kits [Music] oh come on there's a team on the left there too i don't want to go out too far behind us too i guess we know where everyone is but they have to come to us there's a tuning site we just need to tune inside let's take it slow these guys can go all the way around if they want to they need to start now if they if they did want to though [Music] no this lovely i don't know how we've just been running around thank you how many helps definitely my shoes which is nice i mean i'll take a win it's been a bit of a boring game but we just got a load of uh using a lot of kp load damage i don't actually need to get any kp for this way we do need to rotate quick we need we need to go very soon very soon we need to go soon guys come on one minute my friends these guys are gatekeepers if they're not would if they know what they're come doing guy 45 seconds ring's not too far i'm okay with that this way perhaps come on keep it going i'm just gonna risk it is just one guy yeah there we go it wasn't too bad hey another win i'll take it nothing really happened for the middle about 18 minutes at least the end game was pretty exciting we've got positional advantage over the lifeline team that was trolling in the entire game you are the apex champion they took a lot of baiting i got a few lifeline races in there and i had no med kits but a windsor win and we are still climbing the journey is not over yet though amigos it is not over yet give master yes daddy oh god now the pressure's on what am i supposed to do i've been able to land on this map i don't know where to go who do you think i am this direction i meant want to see how he play okay pressure's on lollies come on wait lo wait wait that's not good i've sentinel and an i45 i know i've used the vault loads today but i don't care if i find a vault i'm picking it up now that i've got that this is our stage no this isn't a bad start it's all kicking off i say we're just running get involved i've got two times on the center these bad boys got oh is i'm the new killer reclaimed i tried it i tried attention first blood already on the ground yet it's looking like a vault game already any guns going here guys any guns this doesn't seem like the right play i'm doing it anyway no this is definitely not the right play don't drop one of them there we go i could take havoc unless you took it there you go oh energy ammo here all right so we came from this way so i want to go over this way because that's where we are going to find people party cascades which is not my favorite place to go but if there are people there i'm interested also there's a crafter there and look at that purple white mag in the crafter this might be a worthwhile tree i've got a i've got to do decent this game too many games we've had with such good starts that have just fallen to nothingness you know what someone's been here did my teammate land here orbit oh my teammates are still how do i have no how do i have no ammo i don't have no sniper ammo my adventure was just full i guess i didn't realize i'm trying to pretend that we're fighting recharging my shields don't get shot down one of them just here on it that guy's still down which is good news please bubble nice second team maybe not actually i thought wrong i guess they just backed up far long far before i thought they did they got pretty far this way she ducked it that wasn't even me she ducked you guys saw that so i want my cells these guys oh i thought you brought me the sniper one then i can't use that i think my teammates understood my pings there because these races just walked right between us she's here somewhere i don't know shields recharging i hate that animation when you when the legends like they slide down a hill and their character just like almost like a backflip but they are they crafting is that us hello they're literally crafting we're so split we're gonna get third here no teammate don't die please don't die he's gonna try and get this right from away from from the us a second there's a i'll get stuck on our land here oh okay i'm just coming over this way then i guess good grief this is infuriating this race is just going to agree with us 100 percent which is a pretty good player we could just kill it there there's a fuse out this way too he does watch out dears body nearby that race has brought her teammates back i mean it's just unbelievable she's literally crafting behind us and no one saw this isn't good i don't trust my teammates not to die this game has been one of the worst in recent memory watch nice i don't know what has been really frustrating this game has i've we're just on all different wavelengths you know i don't think it's anyone's fault i think we're all just on a different page it's not much but it's my main gun as well dears i think we're fine though somehow we made it would you look at that my drew only got 90 seconds and we have to zoom we have to go we have to flee at the scene five five run halfway there just realize what i'm doing i have missed so many sentinel shots this game if i was using a long glove and i could just start spamming it it would have been very helpful i want you to kill us it looks like anyway okay that's one way to rotate i didn't reload we can kill these guys easy let me see the right over here i can't i just can't shields recharging is closing in 45 and we're right next door that was so scuffed we just we couldn't pinch them because they were holding the door and lifeline was on the roof like we're just so disjointed it's really tough and i can't get that banners there's no way i don't know how you expect me to get your mana it's impossible all i've got to do here like my best bet is to try and hold so ralph round five is the ring doesn't close for a minute i have two cells left i can maybe just sit on this roof i don't know if i'll be able to maybe underneath i don't know trick your rotation rings near got 45 seconds what are you doing we're looking at why do we take the time scope there and i'm back i'm gonna damage these guys before the zone comes in okay i hear you oh god no oh everyone's gonna shoot me he's touched me i'm dead equipment games no imagine if that killed that imagine if that was a headshot oh my god what is going on this game oh that's so close i think that might be a solo i think it might be a solo uh pathfinder so if i kill the wraith there if it was a headshot i think i would have killed it um i could have won that game nearly max kp all right listen what's out here it's kind of rough we're the most disappointed team ever ah it's a good try that was fun though that was a lot of fun let's see what the end you do all right nearly gold three so we've gained quite a bit of rp today i'm happy with that progress
