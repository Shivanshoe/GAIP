hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are going to be playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be talking about octane today a legend who i played so much of last season probably my most played legend last season but barely at all in season 10 because of the nurse that he has undergone now octane has had a number of nerfs in a row including reducing his passive healing from 1.5 to 1 hp per second having his launch pad horizontal travel distance reduced by around 15 percent and also having the cooldown on his pad increased by 50 percent since these three nerfs i'm not really sure what octane is good at i know there are other legends on apex who deserve love more than octane you know watson or crypto for example but he still makes me sad as i used to play octane so much i thought he was only met in ranks and competitive and only really annoying because of the interaction with revenant ultimate maybe some audio on the jump pad would have been a start but if this guy is rushing into your team there's a good chance he's already lost a lot of health because of his stim so how annoying is he really today i'm trying him out again instead of my main pathfinder and i really hope he gets the slight buff for season 11 because i'm not sure i actually want to play him anymore after this so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends when you get too excited i've rampaged in a there's problem nobody here it's crazy people octanes yeah yeah i'm about to go and your next champion how do i have 40 bullets for heavy how has this happened to me i found three heavy guns and i've got 40 spare that doesn't make any sense i always forget that the uh the hemlock can use a boosted loader oh yeah me too i never even think about it just like went on my hemlock i was like wait what terrible throw oh such a bad throw please oh wait why did i get killed who downed him this guy that i just killed oh yes let's go dude i don't even know let's go checking that peppa though fine on me i don't deserve it there's a team over there you see the bangalore smoke i do now looking for a light gun if you see one i have a p20 okay oh yeah oh i stopped shooting him because i thought you're gonna no i should have i missed my two wingman shots because bangalore strike speed is astronomical kind of crazy right i'm telling you that's a title in my other video bangalore's movement is crazy astronomical you can no you can use astronomical i love it i don't really want to mama's got a brand new bag he'll have a time to go shopping dudes over there i've been there that's absolutely freud a lower ultimate for 90. okay 45 and he still got got it aiming at me and they have a shield oh my god please oh you're dead i'm okay now you're dead that's fine how can i give his arm shot for 45 and he's still got him there sending you oh my god they're sending you you're dead sounds broken i have a 50 flesh again oh my god he's behind the shield i don't even notice he's up top big big bold play look at this look at this are you watching you watching you're watching you're not watching i'm not watching see oh okay he went outside okay he's doing cool stuff oh i'm not interested in that whole stuff anything called connoisseur so i can't lie that's my goal knocked down did you get okay all mine it's all mine well the lifeline's got it so oh i'm a little but i'm not gonna put it down i can't about to use this that's too much effort i'm gonna actually package so i can get a spare purple lara and complain about it yes i was actually hoping to go help me all right on the way don't let me down who me yeah you said there were people i'm expecting people going off a pure instinct and awareness okay an intuition what's great then what do you mean when is that ever worked i have the awareness of uh bald eagle that's true look at literally shots over here oh my god my awareness is unmatched you can't you can't say that it's not i have the best awareness in the game everything else is kind of average but you know where people are you can't do anything in the backseat yeah yeah i usually don't shoot them very well but i know where they're at well i can't talk i lost that 1v1 it's bangalore that was kind of that was kind of unfortunate i like turned away because i thought i thought we were good yeah no when am i ever good oh give me one number two three up here return of the gibson alts don't worry i've got a gold helmet so i nearly have my pad can you probably just bracelet up there yeah that's huge i'm insane where are these boys at the most use you'll ever get out of a lobo tactical ever whoa 360.
