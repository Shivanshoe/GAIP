hey wassup guys treet welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course alright it's finally gonna happen ok this is a gun but you Poli see so many people use since day one of apex legends expen nerfed a few times buffed once I believe because they nerfed it a little bit too much but it's always been a top tier weapon however it has never been a top tier weapon in the hands of of temperature on supreme here it is of course the peacekeeper but keeper of peace and I really do keep the P to this weapon because when I use it I'm like a pacifist ok no damage is dealt 21 but that he's about to change today I'm gonna practice this weapon I'm gonna force myself to use this gun more because I'm always getting blocked by this whenever someone uses this against me they land in 120 damage shots at close range I can't compete and are fed up of it and that's gonna change day so I'm gonna use it myself so anyway thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends it's all city of these my friends are at least half think I missed I missed my building you want that okay I don't think there's a weapon there anyway I'll take the g7 Scout I miss my old building the one that I always used to learn that pretty 95% of my games were spent at the same the same building beside I just have the best live there's a great place to land who's this am i building I guess I didn't even know there was an enemy team around thing like that okay that's my team I'm making those noises though right like I didn't think there was a team here to begin we saw looted it could have been an enemy team it could have just been my right teammate my blue tone is blended across the knife apparently and he's taking some fire I don't just and friend is something to do in that one building we all we all could learn there and it's that person let's go make sure you pick up a purple always drops the exam man can I do c-spine money sets on fire oh god I've gotta kill her much some battered pasty good great so someone else are we good that's the last one me footsteps - I think I've destroyed band of the truthful you were a teammate on my team I wrapped around P 2020 if you had anything better I live in screamer booth then I have to take out the fat line I've got so many light rounds and no heavy all right listen okay I was a bit confused there because I've got that setting on where if you get shot at it doesn't take you out of the loop box automatically and the reason I did that so that I'm a switching is easier you know there's been times where I've been hit by stray alternator bullet from across the map and all the sudden it's taken out the loot crate and I can't arm is reaching time at least like to be in control about half I could be it's my team I trying to get to you the zoo the response this is a race here if i briefed on them here it's far safe than down low and they can use the the alter that I've just dropped to get back to the loop again I think I've just pizza to the first fortunately very fortunately that's not good that's my plan ruined swellings going off come on gold shields or gold helmet or a gold weapon of some sort ample brains will do it's not Levi's mom for 15 minutes I've just I've just respawned this blood turn and he's got shields no excuses there's no way you haven't found any I refuse to believe you these lifelines without the health drown my sorrow all right you know what I'm gonna make a commitment right name and the commitment is I'm gonna use this peacekeeper friend come over here I said the all tip for a purpose for a reason he gets all the loops far quicker that filter was looted McGrew tea 15 minutes ago as well it's like a bit of a wave so I'm on teammates footsteps I know this there are people here and I mind these guys were not lying you're scaling the area oh okay how did I not see the smoke did they run run or did they go back in the building are they run run pretty much shredded I would say I give that a straight at our thing I don't think you can get all the way through this without attitude I see a good hopefully she didn't treat me they see have a good that'll mean the most embarrassing death more time shields re George have you got your scan think friend we have to see so fair it's like a eighty second corner stories like I mean not quite but he feels like when you play those hands you know ninety five you literally shop windswept g7 got the kills man and all epoxies gone okay Oh under making commitments okay and the communities I'm gonna use the T scheme in this game usually I'll pick this weapon off because this really good at the style of game but to be honest it's really good let's be honest it's always been a top tier weapon but not in my hands there are a few guns that are like this peacekeepers probably the best gun that I should use more often what is panic too much I think I'm betting online tonight because it's a spray weapon pretty requires less skill I'm gonna give it a go I'm gonna try my hardest with this with this piece keep on but I think I'm gonna do I'm gonna keep the peace around voltage if anyone's scrapping in the distance I'm gonna head over there and saw today that is my commitment to this game we're gonna get some practicing no that's not there you go oh it's been looted that's a shame Everywhere's looted scraps of cities looted finally harvesters looted the trains booty this side of the map is why is commonly known as completely debt I would say that is my teammate of course it ISA I should have known I told you this by the map is complete yet alright we're gonna last hope there are fourteen people left and it pieces no sorting Factory he's where it's gonna be popping up I mean it's in the safe zone so it would make complete sense does anyone have I always find precision tropes and select fighters but then I'll never find the pro in the same game and i never even want to use the Peacekeeper because as i said before just not an aficionado of this weapon that is anymore okay I told you this is gonna happen teammates of close fight as well oh my god is even getting shot how does it feel to get [ __ ] chicken chicken nugget name you got two things you wouldn't really mix together right say what are you doing him though use a Moroz ever again in in the field at least okay probably thought he's gums in automatic mode hey I found you so mean so being you knows those two of them get me out of here a bit of a white suppose I'm going to use a shield battery I've no syringes the first time ever this is a historic moment you don't even know it's around the corner but he would eat race tinny that bloodhound good grief what an absolute lunatic fortunate few there is a respawn beeping nearby I had no idea he went outside like that against the two people where you get his confidence from friend I I to run away I was fleeing the scene I was getting the hair can freak out of that I just want to describe it and I appreciate it you ought to appreciate someone with a bit of self-confidence my top ten situation and now it's a top 11 situation Fatima is soon revived what did you just stop that it's a dead tree I'm going to shoot a movie we should be okay I just wants to make sure it's always nice to get a bit of high ground when you respawn a teammate it is so loud that it brings all the dweebs out me included if I hear someone getting respawned that means there's someone out there with no good and if they've got no good they can't they can't shoot back this is worth it I don't care what anyone says this is 1% I survived that without little nodes of healthy fall that sounds like a proper scrap it sounds like a long-range scrap then me longbows I can hear life's water this way pitter patters I mean very few sure to get in over here you should be looted McGrew seed I couldn't send the pretending speak a few things up come on friends it's a scrap it's the last two people for last two teams the bongo drums a plane are looking like reporters my favorite thing to do name using challenge for the Wallaces this watch out tonight that's gonna hurt now get behind the brockandlisa I can help I can't help you there gods I should have been in watch the revived Hey look teammate and humongous headshot with the Peacekeeper come on let me celebrate three grapple don't do this to me there we go strain the lava right in there oh god what I've undone it does this until you've eventually died and it's just incredibly loud oh it's not gonna end on my apology so now I have to start shapes in here 13 kills quiet kills from 700 damage was that 140 damage per kill because home definitely deserved one I mean listen hey it was a bit overconfident but it was a true warrior that man it's got a lot of patience in some ways because he waited for the for the the respawns at least but this man is inspiration to me he believes himself and you've got to appreciate that about him 1 revive to respawns 13 kills and 2400 damage if you've rounded up and I say what I got a deist man who kills with a PC but I need to trust myself with his back for more I need to stop panicking at close range and pick my shot of this and maybe I think maybe I should even start hit firing more with it I don't even know but anyway thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
