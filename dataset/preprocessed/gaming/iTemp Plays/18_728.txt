you're shoeless rice I've no idea where the Bangalore was that entire fight it's okay when the octane was chilled listen he was losing but we got him eventually we didn't need stay that long but we've gone eventually let's explore this way now after me up here in a sec we didn't loot the course to go I don't think after next save my word Lutie just looking just clean while it is fresh I've read evo a gold bag a gold helmet for shield batteries and a definite I've g7 decked out our 301 I mean life is good my friends life is good any question now is where on earth is the next craft coming from because I do not need to loot anymore in fact I don't think I could lose any more I've got all right I've got a blue stock and a blue xn line mag and a blue barrel stabilizer so I technically could but I've got a makeshift gold after your one there we go look scrap this way and it eats my friends in the distance I don't mind Ultima as well pretty feel like he mates over I've need to get to it first so usually I just grapple over but I can't with 35 second call down here you go I remembered you're down you're down as well oh that's I'm looking six six crates yeah six crates well just got here too late I should have grappled in those be appraised that I needed strange very temps to tape you are 99 on tonight I've got g7 for long range our white guns are key to eat I'm not entirely sure I want to do so prayer and maybe I should have taken it we've got a bangle on the team oh well we've left it behind oh there we go if that's the cage there I'm extremely excited I've got my ultimate online pathfinder and this is one of the reasons I have missed playing this law guy so much places like diving board places like Paige train station on wards edge as well you know I'm misusing my ultimate - get up there from any angle people think about the cages they don't expect if they don't hear the ultimate going down you can just see above them for a little while over there there's rain down on the fire from a book and it takes a man or a second to please don't it's going over as well okay these guys aren't fighting and they're in a power position at this at this house this is a bad idea I instantly regret this choice we should we should went to the cage we would have been a third party for caged and separated I'm sure we can run away easy because I'll just come to the edge shoot us we can get one down looking products run away or send it's been done how much help it's able to me this is a terrible idea we were just such a disadvantage compared to these guys well he's on Russian either so I can get to mind go free I'll stand guard I'll make sure that I brush in first all my faith in about three hours rather than duo's is that we don't have to fully commit to reviving you can at least try and defend your team they've impacted well I won't get out of here honestly booboo but now we've been shot in the cage something good this way suppose it is tractor Don's gonna go this way I don't wanna fire those guys anymore they've got a Korsak on top of high ground and these guys of the cage are vulnerable but they don't know it and that's the best kind now that I've got to close range guns I've just got a lease of living so horrendous absolutely horrendous why have I got these attachments I don't need try to put it back on my online tonight let's go this way all right this is what we should have done about three minutes ago watch it go the horrendously wrong now I'll be proven to be a fool you go I mean do you see what I mean I know those guys are distracted we should get over there I can hear a firing there we go big Gibraltar man going down and a caustic trap hopefully Z's ultimate lovely doesn't have for a long while who's he saw a guy on the edge George fine postman over these guys are describing each other still you'd be down low unless you launched it which is always a possibility is this the same debate that we will fight tonight I think initially I thought our standard I passed an Gibby's I'm not gonna be sorry coffee how am I supposed to push this - someone is still in here I bought this gift first man on see you can't see you don't have my ability okay that that is the type of thing that if I do that in the higher ranks I quoted does get beamed now just standing there with my with my no ability really nice defending them off in a smoke the smoke will go and miss finem you know what I have a nice time to be speed but I'm just gonna I was gonna get involved I think I'm staying back too much I know the parent forget clothes they from earlier on I think just maybe 30 health mat maybe I'm pretty sure that was the same team we were in battle with that team the caustic with the havoc the rape and the Lobo just just in the in the next champion it was quite poetic actually it ended in the same place where they were just demolished us beforehand sometimes just got it get involved especially if you've got a an online sign in at peace give you just got to gain their faces they can't hang with a letter dopey ski but it does too much damage to revise one respawn 12 kills and 3305 damage not a bad game whatsoever it's unfortunate that people kind of died out a little bit a little bit too quick in the mid game compared to what this Frank usually is like and I definitely messed up at the end there needed a bit of her revive myself but it was a good game still we still did pretty good I what's the rank looking like toned room 1 RP I ranked up good for me there you go gold and platinum is in sight as well thank you for watching I do preciate and I'll see you all [Music]
