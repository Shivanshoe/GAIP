hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i went out and i bought the 100 levels required to finish the battle pass we're not quite finished there is a tier 110 hemlock skin at the end you can't buy but i did buy the first 100 levels unlike the reactive hemlock skin available in season 12 here just to show what it's like in game and i think this is one of my favorite reactive skins they've done enough well when i think reactive skins like the best ones i think of the flatline i think the i definitely didn't think of the prowler from i think that was last season or this evening before i think that was probably the worst reactive skin we've had but i think this one's kind of it's kind of clean i like it a lot and the hemlock's really good as well so hopefully you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends let's go this way that was a bit of it that was a bit of a detour i wasn't watching with a lot of people going to where we were going to land oh there's no way this is this bad okay it's not too bad landed on an alternative you can't complain that much i'm going to loot this building no matter what i get i'm going into the fight i will gladly take sentinel but if i got a shotgun i'll take that instead not all of us are in the ring oh no sentinel i mean no shotgun whatever i'm going to the fight contact just spotted someone out there that way oh look someone wandered into our safe space not talk about it the champion made a poor choice giving my shields a recharge i did land every shot with the sense no oh there's a purple over there enemy spotted it's not an enemy never mind it's just a purple shield uh we should maybe go power grid let's go this way we're fine over that way and if the wingman is still there i'll take it it's in the craft oh the flat line i forgot using grapple oh it's not there whatever it's good eliminated so what is here though hemlock and i've got the reactive skin i forgot about this you have light you have 40. light ammo here i'll try and use the hemlock i need optics for an assault rifle shotgun bolt here level three gravias hey mira got some enemies right here i hear ya someone's out there they're far they're shooting at me charging up my shields oh these einsteins are kind of clean reloading all i had to do there is pathfinder when i'm getting sent by two people he's uh i don't know if that was the pro team actually because there were there were trades that were landing there i think that's why we detoured at the start maybe the team died but all i have to do is just disengage just like fake them in a little bit pretend like i can't really escape and then just disengage this guy's a 20 bomb guy he was the pred team the match making this season is unbelievable it's so brutal it's so brutal teabag get him oh fred you see but you wouldn't know looking like oh you're in bot mobbies samlox skin's kind of kind of clean though how do you check it again hold on thumbnail shot thumbnail shot get the get the nice pink background that's kind of clean that's kind of clean teammate is absolutely struggling in terms of health healing up who's might have had but i think he might have used it to get over there oh my god hello stop looking at me look what are you doing stop it listen i'll shoot you i'll shoot you oh  your ankles reloading took out an enemy good job need to recharge my shields massive shotgun with a purple bolt don't mind huge i mean he's coming for the banners you gotta respect it you gotta respect that marvin arm now we can loot them there's a marvin over this way over that way i'm going to get him i've got to return his arm using grapple hang on this is very important it might be in the zone but this is important where is he it's pinging down low why is it pinging all the way down like i can't be right is it up top i hear him i think that was just a random pink i guess no luke marvin there oh miles away miles away where we came from no whose ping is this betrayed me alton it must go faster still trying to look they probably popped at bats but darn it let's regroup punching a tunnel just trying to keep him off my teammate no i'm gonna try and help him i'm down pathfinder is on the way friend must go faster i am taking fire i got you friend enemy down i got him just the bed someone took the port i think teammates survived for long enough there that was perfect i'm not taking that recharging shield against on the back there you go they could take the ported patching myself up this is where the three times seems like going out ow stop it giving my shields a recharge recharging that's using small hails from jumping two backs let's do this i am repairing myself throwing thermite broken i'm i'm so bright right now sorry heavy i'm okay we we're doing good there we go keep the team around oh my control is disconnected maybe i'll pick up some cells beginning ring countdown let's go over here did we get the cat package oh enemy over there i in foot i shooting at me giving my shields a recharge let's explore this way it's got to even want to challenge this i don't fancy pushing to what's in court to be honest they're not really safe in there either so replicator incoming it's the last team you know are we pushing this i don't know if we should oh if it was me i would set up on this side here and gatekeep them if we have to chase them here it's a bad idea they're not there they ran off contact might be something good this way we have to wrap around yeah they're wrapped around i thought they might it's one minute we'll be able to gatekeep them if we went this way but now i think we're going to meet them in the open ready to fly on a zip line watson and corsica yeah that's why they want to push because even if they're in there like can you get in the tunnels that seems like a terrible terrible time down there mate i've got a feeling they already made it maybe they were back there my gun look at my gun even says three times burst when you crouch look it says three times personally you see that three times burst three-time single oh that's i like that detail are we shooting enemies or i don't think we are because my tennis is bunny hopping yeah they're probably behind us let's be honest it's good time one fell off from that one of them one of them fell off the map where would they fall off where did they go i have no idea where these guys are maybe not maybe this way that's a clean that's a clean grapple coffee end maybe here yeah nice nice guys broken enemy shields careful i know my grapple i wanna i wanna be involved i wanna be involved the last kill i'm involved the last kill yes my ultimate is ready yes [Music] oh look at this thing it's got an exhaust pipe it's got two exhaust pockets got four you are the apex champions that was a fun game that was a really fun game i can't believe one of them fell off and i wasn't really involved for the last uh the last team fight there i did like what 40 damage to those guys didn't quite get the 2k but to be honest 2000 damage in season 12 is the equivalent of 4k last season because these games are impossible they are so difficult ggs though ggs
