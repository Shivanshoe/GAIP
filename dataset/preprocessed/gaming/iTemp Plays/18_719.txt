hey was the guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are landing at the new location which is called a map room and this place is a great mechanic that I wasn't aware of but I'm sure most of you are by now who played the game there's a good idea to clear the area first but once it's safe you can scan the map and it will reveal a snapshot of everyone's location this is such valuable information and have a few tips on how to best utilize these first of all bloodhound is a great legend to play if this is your game plan going in it is just a snapshot of people's location like I said so you'll need to track them down would you fly there on the nearby balloon turn return is obviously a good peak for tracking people don't because they are a tracker contacts what they do second of all if you think you have time to push a team then return back to their map room for a second scan then you can only try and focus on the nearby target it doesn't matter if there are people fighting in slum lakes you can't do anything with this information in the early game so when you're picking a target to fly to to try and kill try and prioritize the teams that look like they are either fighting at the moment or it will bump into each other pretty soon because when they're fighting they're far more likely to be in the same spot when you show up and lastly and this is really important here the mid to late game scans are so useful for predicting the flow of players which affects the rest of the map and the rest of the game massively you know the next circles location as scanning the map also gives you that information like a pathfinder ring scan and you can use this to predict the choke points that people don't realize but they will fall into so here's an example this is the snapshot from the second scan I did in today's gameplay you can tell but so many people from the west side of the map will be forced into a few of the choke points the main one being here on the cliffside so we end up pushing this little lone soldier here and tried to hunt him down and then the plan must have rotates up north as we wanted to be where the big scrap was going to be on the cliffside and I was completely correct so I hope you guys find some of the uses of these tips it's really fun trying to become a tactician based off these log bits of information that you get from these guns and it's really rewarding when this prediction comes true as well I spend about two hours landing here and it took me that of time to try and learn how to use this info and it got me some good results here so hopefully you enjoyed today's gameplay thank you for watching and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right Mac room it is me amigos for the 32nd time today I find that brushing side here is actually a better way wait just one guy I assume these teammates here too but just get me back that's not fair oh but yeah honestly I think of running inside here it's just the bare option in terms of Luke the supply beans are too slow Thanks are you stalking them I never get a gun from them guaranteed I don't know why it's this always the case there's a team running around here somewhere teammate fortunately my lobia has a 20 kill badge as well scan Wars of the moments 86 all right well I got the kill of that Lobo one-shot and Lobo got the kill that I put one shot we both got master sees then good teamwork unfortunately we spawns a decent way away so I'm pretty sure that's the only team that came here with us which is actually pretty sad good job though nice work Oh brought me a Christmas 15 very much appreciated well the next course of action here is to do what I believe to be incredibly underrated I don't see enough people doing this this map scan is absolutely unbelievable repulsed there we got two teams labs two teams capacitor the repulse ones are sort of the closest you got wanted um diving board is well that looks like he's going over to repulse a if you try and look too far across the map like it's tempting there are a lot of people have faked score same but there's nothing we can do beta here it's nice to have the information but the way I like to try and use this is because you only get one snapshot you scan and if anyone's close you will show over there with the information that these guys are someone nearby pretends a really good legend to use in the situation too because if you know they're in this area there we go that in this situation any legend would have worked but as you can imagine it returns really good if you know they're in the area you can use scans and you can see like little clues on the ground as well all that's not good an incredible network then you also go it's distracting they're so far away I think we've got more than a time here I'm gonna risk it mom did you have again Oh level one I thought he had level two these are sad times I don't need a shield back shiny yoga for shield cells let's go get my purple barony deference we have a mistake I've got one I've already canceled these I know I'm not that bad of a loser right white guys you know that you guys confess my looting actually incredibly deficient in the old live boxes possibly the best part my game is my loot box efficiency that's how you guys like to say anyway all right well we have more than of time to get back to the maps can forgot to close out of that and when it gets later in the game it's always nice to try and I'm gonna run over this way so it's always nice to try and pay attention more to the rest of the map a spot this is what I've learned because I've been doing this like two hours now blue tone is a good legend for her reasons already explained the first time you do the early game don't try and look at the entire map just look in the in the close vicinity you can always return even if the safe zone is so far away if you get on the jump Tower land in the Arias trap them down with bloodhound you can then return and then you can sort pay attention to more of the map because it gives you a good idea of where people are gonna be closing in on the safe side Oh another good thing about this if she the next map location as well it's like a Pathfinder that's equality no one's close at all we've got people at Labs there's someone people might but they're gonna converge near markets area with a lot of people in the north western side of the map - that might be a good a good rotation yeah I reckon we try and push the guy this way and then try and push more north because by the time we get there the green safe zone will be safe and everyone be pushing up that hill this is this is the ultimate tacticians dream here I'm putting together a game plan from that from the maps can also it one more tip is that it's always good to try and focus on people that are near each other like teams are closer to each other because they're less likely to be moving too far if they came to a scrap I'd depending on the player or the play of us even in the in the fight it could go on for a minute a minute or more if you're a good amount of time to get over that way but there we go sounds so good 85 seconds though I'm sorry 65 look quite as bad oh no there we go we found a microscope as well it's such a glorious combo this is two hours of refining tactics here I've had it work this well yet I'll be honest it's almost haunted here they survived I survived I mean they went down but got a revival does that mean they got injured a lot these guys are absolutely fleeing the scene good grief it in quotes how fine is heat to whose risk is to take their grapples but know this cause attacking I need to try and deal with this guy love is a good plan are you hailing let's deal with him on hello / if I can me apparently Loeb has come back over there it's by a blue armor oh nice stop and select fire - all right we are in a good spot French it's fine level 1 Evo shields see you then I was only syringe we should have pushed him sing good grief on earth is that a phase gate oh that's the ultimate okay oh that's just the regular ability well I say we just push through this teammate why not [Applause] hope they change that morning so I came down the hill again take the take the pulse if you need to two separate things I knew this place is going to be fine oh okay 0m is East a two-time sight for you I can I can deal with CRM ECC I just need to know what's happening sin tonight severe but this hasn't got many bullets either happening dude I was just coming back to check uneven barrels I needed any cake in my defense please don't hey on your boy I told you this place is bleep up and off I told you that everyone because two things we saw everyone's on the left side of the map like the west side and this is like a truck point for everyone trying to get over this way because we knew where the next safe stone that honestly this has been master class tactics through the squads a package dropping yeah I really haven't had it worked this well so far I've had a lot of see where people are and by the time you get there you can't even see the tracks kind of deals I don't know if people see you flying and they just run off or something I'm not really sure what it is but when it works some results what are we gonna hear peak a peak a would actually be pretty good or a fresh Devo if you fancy that it's got a DJ - oscillators thanks I'll be worth picking up we the best place to these mail I'm the best place Bangalore is it they're running there it's just one guy this could be the Bangalore they climbed over this way yeah I'm not sure that was hiding in the corner she could have got around the mountain but she would have taken a decent damage from the storm not sure they would have done that don't need two feet skits after I read Evo I don't like him that much anarchist I can literally win you the game none of these bangles gonna push us alright is this gonna be a PK I'd like some close range of clubs which we've heard the devotees at close range bin it's got a two-time signing and it's a third diva literally we are rotating DeVos here and believable three devotions buddies these of you that is outrageous say the least here we go a clue 71 seconds ago oh how English it have any good sometimes he sometimes he says that they don't have any gun Java scroll up for some reason but this man literally had nothing he could have had a piece of Reiner I could have let him leave you're gonna shot me in the back of the PK or a Kramer Adam a high ground on assassin we can't see thing there's a bunch of foliage in the way [Music] okay when this there we go messy very messy let's see maybe newcomer 8x champion the banner literally but I was a solid game way longer than needed to be twenty and a half minutes good grief we were sound on later about six of those minutes six of the 20 I think not none was moving to be fair us included when there are three squads left the last thing you want to do is run around and stumble upon one of the last squads and then you get into a big scrap and the squad the easing that scrap ends up third parting and winning the entire game so it's a bit of a bit of a standoff it's all right eleven kills the map room scan is unreal use those tactics use these tips okay and then get back to me if you've had any success with it whatsoever thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'm gonna get out of this room cuz it's about 4,000 degrees near let's see you all next time [Music]
