hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in season 9 everyone knows that octane is being nerfed and i think it's fair enough there isn't much punishment to using his stim ability he can spam it and not really be too affected it's a shame because he's one of the funnest legends in the game at the moment but i do understand why they have to nerf him just a little bit however this nerf could end up being an overall buff what respawn have done is decrease the steam call then from four seconds down to one second so you can spam it as much as you like it sounds like a crazy buff but the problem is each steam is now costing octane at 20 health instead of 12. respawn are trying to make the real cooldown on this ability his health rather than a actual timer my advice to all you octa mains out there who are a little bit disappointed in this change is to try and run gold armor think about it you can pop a syringe for 50 health really quickly in a steam whilst you're sliding around you can be bunny hopping you could be mid air from his jump pad or you could be sliding down the hill with little to no cost to your movement but you've just gained 50 health or two and a half stims worth of health back i think gold armor and octane will be more valuable than red because of this and i can't wait to try out this combo next season this nerf may actually end up backfiring on octane's pick rate because he may even be more annoying to chase let me know what you guys think about this tactic in the comment section season 9 is out tomorrow so if you don't want to miss any of the new gameplay be sure to subscribe to my channel to join the item player thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i probably gonna glad in the middle right i might contest them one squadron x-ray here let's go over here how do i land here first and you still get uh like ten times my i don't understand it's actually crazy low i couldn't see my shot where i thought he might be level two no no stop reloading that i need it faster [Music] i'll be behind him you guys gotta go knocked but i'm finishing oh did that cancel your finish my bad that's okay i've been trolls before i hear uh oh yeah i'm a car right there they're probably walking up on this fight they hopping if they hopped things need to crack by turning around on me back in the car again okay i can't even shoot her that's an obtained good job no energy i should ready switch going hold on come on uh they're fighting in the middle okay storm is closing though i'm turning right sure i don't know if i just heard footsteps this way i don't know i don't see anyone oh yeah behind me yeah the people wanted 36. damage i don't know six shots is kind of a lot uh it's not gonna be op but it's gonna be it's still gonna be good without having to find a hop up yeah it won't be bad but we have three other shotguns on the floor to choose from i know yeah that's right and it doesn't have hammer points it's hard to justify using it's not weak now i can't how much does a massive have how many shots is that five or six six oh it's got the same as a massive yeah that's crazy can't it is really good though i mean it is really strong right now wait where are they throw me going all the way around 17 flat line when he dropped there's no way there's more people this way than either way oh that's a papa bat it's not shields i didn't crack him he let you just have no shields hate that cracks inside another global i both went left um maybe i was confused i reckon she took that i'm gonna have to use the lower rocks trying to get some hammer and a shotgun bolt press do you have any heavy how much do you have um i have a 190x i can drop some just a little bit placement yeah no i can't get my gun out your head there's a team in this smoke here facts i need a shotgun bolt so bad but i don't understand i'm late yeah amigos let's go here my team that helps you i can't even see her over there no i'm carusi i don't know which way they went well who's that is that you yeah sort of snipe me i mean they missed but oh shots we won't be able to get this one recharging beautiful do we go up top um where is it oh yeah they are up top oh why what the heck that guy's burning because flash okay one dropped i'm gonna thirst this guy let's go get an extra kill for that not getting back up from that heavy in here okay he's time to drop down he might wrap around mate he might run into the rope he might make in time yeah i think he is especially close to the door oh this game is like it's been quick but i don't mind it being quick as long as we find people as long as we actually fight it's not that bad no it's not a fun game but i don't have loads of damage or anything but we haven't been struggling you know to find people yeah we found a good amount of people it's risky this is a little risky that was risky gold armor's gonna be so good on octane next season you stim just pop a quick syringe for like 60 health oh that's good i want me here two people can't play safe i'm i'm dead i don't know how he's not dead guy's getting started by someone maybe sniping him oh i was like southwest was it huh i think so southwest over here somewhere oh yeah horizon let's go here i have a rope i don't have any bats i'm sure that guy would have had something i have one he needs to be one they are in the open some reason uh i'm dead where is it i don't know why i didn't stop firing against the horizon you are the apex oh you were you're next games mode i was sort of going crazy uh took a few you took a few yeah that story i got the last two and we were punching this the last guy you know if i didn't get that last guy would be nine and ten
