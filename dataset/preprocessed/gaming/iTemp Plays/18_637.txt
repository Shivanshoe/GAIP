hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we have news of a new event coming to apex legends on the 6th of october including cross play between pc xbox and ps4 a new limited time mode new skins to unlock and of course a new heirloom as well so let's start with crossplay it is fairly self-explanatory we've known it was going for a while now and it is finally here or at least it will be here on the 6th of october i can't wait to test it out because i've been switching between pc and ps4 depending on who wants to play on which system and now that isn't going to be an issue at all a lot more people are going to be connected with more of their friends which is only a good thing for apex next up we have the limited time mode coming it's a new one it's called flashpoint you can see here on the trailer there are numerous flash points around the map and it appears as though these are the only areas you can go to to recharge your shields as the healing and shield consumables have been removed i'm not entirely sure if that's the only place you can regenerate as that sounds a little bit rough running around on 12 health definitely seems like playing watson for the shield regenerating ultimate lifeline for obviously a healing drone in this mode would be a smart idea but we'll see maybe i'll just play caustic if everyone's got like three health and i'll just love my ultimate people and they'll just suffocate and die you know sounds like a good tactic but i'm recording this after the intro and i've just realized that this looks like a blue healing station so you don't have to wait in there to heal up you're probably gonna be able to use this and heal up a little bit as well now we can take a look at the heirloom coming in with this event it's caustics we thought he might have been getting one in season six as in the trailer for this season he was seen with like a broken canister and he was using this as a melee weapon but here we can see the real heirloom it's like a sledgehammer branded with caustics head on there it looks unreal and i've been playing a lot more courses lately as well so i can't wait to get my hands on this one and of course we have all the cool skins coming into the game as well these are some of the best skins i've seen on apex they are all so clean they are so good this event looking like it's going to be a good one i hope you guys are excited as i am to play this today i have a lifeline game for you where i got um five five revives as lifeline five unbelievable scenes so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends fired for those type of things like it's insane like i don't understand why they
