like when we were playing destiny there'd be like a pulse rifle meta but there was like certain archetypes of that certain pulse rifle that was you know what i mean yes that's what it was that's where it's from that's where i got the lingo what was i gonna say what are the people that make stuff like make buildings what are they called engineers yeah but like what the they draw the designs and stuff architects architect okay i've reminded myself by saying ted mosby architect i hear shots like north of cage but you are miles away oh you know what bro i got a team market i'm coming they're chasing me i'm going to bait them to you okay yeah yeah yeah you got the portal i'm baiting them to you they were literally right on me oh god you covered nice excuse me so how can you see me 47

luck oh nice oh i'm doing it trust me all the father trust me bro there's another team outside oh yeah i nearly killed him so close i'm gonna nade in the smoke there's a guy in the smoker here oh he took the portal and can you break that door yeah knight on it that's inside 600 100 100. okay well that's the course expand as well so there we go that team's dead just across the way i guess they helped down i think rich you still have a knock in here brother do i yeah yeah this guy was instant now back i got your thirst thank you that's weird we have another team flying in there they flew into bunker who's loving that where did this team go uh i don't know they're launching stuff for that literally then they're in the little shed bro 47 blue on one another i was flying through the window we got a runner rich we got a runner he's behind the white truck marking our surroundings it says household just one he's hanging out yeah there we go this is the best we originally hit i think yeah he does have a teammate he's a pathfinder teammate okay hello 56 nice de niro official it's the official robert officially dead extended get him out of here oh purple i have three um three bastards uh i'm good they should be at bunker i saw i saw one uh running to the left side of bunker okay they're firing at crypto drone two on this hill right here rich yeah yeah and there's a team inside i think there is something i'm watching [Music] keep poking it's causing them some issues not not over committed yeah they're emptying an emp oh too so i can help i'm gonna kidnap him watch the portal oh i missed it he backed up he backed up i almost had him dude we're fine to like halo i think he just wants to revive his friend oh no he backed up when i went into him dude he panicked he's not healing he's not reviving just yet i don't think he will for a while that was the worst decision of his life oh yeah nice job uh four times with the wing man on red doh is behind us so we have to like kind of push him he's reviving 90. oh he had bats for days dude he's quite a fair few that was fun oh okay we have to battle our way out i'm glad i didn't go down i was like one health hello dude we had a little bit of chemistry right there we did didn't we that was good we backed up exactly the same time we took the stairs at the same time i find back if needed let me know i'm good man i'm good thank you i really wish i really really wish i would have gotten the the the the kidnap oh my god that would have been crazy that would have been such a sick play it would have been nice it was close there i think there was there was one more team and they we're on the other side of bunker you see him no oh i saw dragon the dragon wing in the distance oh this way let's go this way you can grab it and watch for you i should have picked up some more lights i mean i have 120 spare for two teams there oh no annoying thank you you go now you don't have to worry about your light i've still got my own one disregard yeah probably crafts some they're adsing me somebody's got a shot on me two teams left so if we get engaged on we're here nice spot i don't know why i think it too oh you okay they might push bro they might push five top isn't someone's getting a rez like i think we we worry about this team then yeah that team's not going to have loot no way no way they'll push through the other team even they might go to the reds but that'd be kind of stupid no no they're still there it's only gonna let me go i don't have they oh no we have to go to them nasty egg glitch man oh this guy's one shot this guy's one three push yeah we can he's he got an ego on him he isn't even healing let's go how much is going on yeah yeah i hit him two times four times five times oh my god it's nice let's go his teammate uh bracelet it out somewhere oh i think loads up here they bracelet up top okay well they can just be solo then because there's a team down this way i mean the revive team on me coming having the team did you get your finish no it might come back he got him up i've gone behind us please no oh my god lola's shot i'm just phoenixing all you for another three seconds i got one nice job behind him yeah yeah finish the job this time good job dude mate always choking some shots i don't need now this other team probably got the rest again yeah i think they actually did i tried to thirst but one second when you only have a wingman because yeah yeah to actually burst through it's difficult yeah you can it doesn't do like that burst damage to the knock down it's like no i'm joking hold on i just switch out my own mind i'll spray everybody i'll just right they definitely yeah they definitely went into zone oh i knew he went down way too many times it was close choking some shots am i scanning seven i can assume that probably sat on top somewhere definitely oh they're right there for the left further left him head shot super illegal yeah we could just like i might just send it on this close guy that that guy's cracked okay do it let's go on he wanted me back first and i will okay do it watching nice shot the other guy hit for 90 let's go dude what a game that was a really really fun game [Music] that fight at bunker was a blast yeah it was so good nice job dude you are the apex champions oh [Music] any uh damage things like is it because i died because i fell off and did 5 000 damage to myself do you like to hear them yeah go on you have 14 kills and 2 300 damage not bad yeah you fried i mean did you have as well you did more damage uh 2600 oh how
