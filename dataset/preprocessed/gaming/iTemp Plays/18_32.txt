come on oh my god please i can hear flat lines i've got p20 mozam yet again another p20 good grief my louise horrendous and my rhymes are egregious i only saw the open door there when i started when i grappled over but i'm okay 45's not bad i've been trolled somewhere i have no idea where they went but if you go let's go there down low here thank you what a guy i feel bad for armist which you know but i'm gonna have to it's my kill i guess watch out for the new kill leader friend thanks well i've still got nothing i'm going to be honest with you i've one shield cell no light rounds and a mozam it absolutely worked recharging no i could have just used the phoenix oh using my phoenix that sucks i shouldn't have almost switched extended like level three i have to use a wingman i just don't have the light let's keep using an re-45 i've just dropped my uh uh heavy mag as well which sucks are that you appear or what evil shield what's in that corner i could redo with my mag back careful might need some cover recharging shields they're gonna get horizontal maybe yeah oh i don't know why i wanted it so bad is that everyone dead nice i could really do the phoenix kit i played guys thanks teammate i have just spammed on everything yep i got it oh this is always the um this is always the rotation you want to make straight into cascade falls people love a bit of cascade falls this is like the meeting spot you know king's canyon like the house on the hill this is this is the equivalent about about six or seven minutes into a game you don't know where people are that's because you're not a cascade falls this is where everyone likes to meet has to be a team here probably not darn it no i was right contact what she got a mastiff how many massive shots was that two i mean it was so quick as well it was just so quick so at this point in the day i had been playing apex for about three and a half hours hadn't got a single win in fact haven't really even got that close i think the the closest we got was uh one third place we died to a three stack and coincidentally i died too many three stacks in the three and a half hours i don't know what punishment i was being put under but my fortunes were about to change i've been placed with a triple pred and we were absolutely dominating well i'm landing triple supply been bins i'm landing triple bins please no one land on me because i will die i was joking these guys will die enemy nice nice and i can tell have any ammo oh boy i'm hoping they get distracted by that i'm going to try and help teammate because he's playing like a maniac but he's triple parade so i'm gonna stick with him and let him carry me don't worry i'll do the dirty work i'll get the banner i'll respawn if you can get me a win i've been playing for three and a half hours if this guy can get me a win i will donate i will i will gift a hundred subs i'm not gonna tell him that though okay yeah yeah everyone's just sat on different pieces of cover looking at us the bandits oh there's a lot of bandits around here no no no no that is one of the worst decoys you'll ever see it kept messing up man uh can you drop me the phoenix kit please i got him don't worry now they're rubbing all that stuff broken enemy shields down 34 seconds on that not bad we're fine take this i might actually win the game let me double check i'm recording because if i'm not recording just just i'll i'm quitting there we go i am but you guys know that cause you've seen broken enemies to the rescue reloading do you have any heavy decoy getting the building right in front of me we need to respawn our friends nice good grief man this is i i'm i'm really trying to play with almost professional plays here to try and get a victory i almost called it a victory royale wait i got the respawn don't you worry ah no oh god i'm dead i'm a gunner i'll mess up ah look at my controller just all over the shop absolutely horrendous the good news is i find oh my god i wasn't even on i wasn't touching my right stick and he's just jolting everywhere man it's just so bad it's oh my god it's so bad this is unplayable this is unplayable every single one of my scuff controllers is an absolute disaster i've got a brand new one today but it's even worse than this it doesn't jolt and it's got no stick drift but it randomly presses my zooming button and my ping button is broken it's so annoying i can't i can't shoot like this i just can't shoot like this please oh my god i can't get to you man all right well the hundred subs is absolutely if i come in with this guy then i'll come with anyone i'd have been closer but i was trying to fix my controller all right so that is just so incredibly lucky i don't blame my teammate for going in kind of solo there because one i do that all the time that's pretty much how i died in the first game you get this full sense of security sometimes when you're playing a mobile character and two i was next to him but then my controller started messing up and i apologize if it is annoying me talking about my controllers i did order a new one i've got one brand new today and that one's busted too i i don't know what to do i really don't like to start playing with a wiimote my next video is gonna be me playing on the on the donkey kong bongos from gamecube if any of you know that that won't let me down ari's just pushing stuff off my desk what are you doing i don't mind not getting a win today because some days you hop on you try your best you might be playing well but things are stacked against you things aren't ari can you stop pushing stuff off my desk that's three things she's pushed off during this outro yeah i hope you guys enjoyed that anyway i feel like that was actually a really good game at the end so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all tomorrow with another one bye
