every cigars treet welcome back to another video today we are playing small apex legends of course and the second of our seven new limited time mode is now live it's called live dial if you can't respawn your teammates at respawn beacons and the reason is when the rink closes all the people who are dead if they have one teammate that's alive at least one team is alive can I fly back in on the map and they respawn we've shields with the weapon and then get back in the action this game-mode is going to be so much fun I knew it's gonna be one of my favorites and we've got a great game here for you as well so hopefully you enjoy if you do you shorty of like rate if you do around here be sure to subscribe to join me height Empire and icy wall in five and a half seconds my friends all right team score it's all cities we are here in the new mode and I've got me a Mozambique not on fleek level on shields it's okay though got a firm way and helmet and there's a team here every day and that sounds good oh here we go or Prowler action sounds like there's another fight going on across the way what am i doing there me to take the are throw one it's picking up every single shotgun shell that's ever existed we're playing live die live I think I don't know why I waste time pinging that I could have just shot in the head any anyway thank you extended white mag I'll take that as well don't worry about this that was my kill I mean struggling the hour am struggling the life ammo departments to at least down as well I would assume Thank You friends appreciate that thank you I have two level three extended max for my guns here and I'll tell you what value those over there arm here because eventually I will find someone they just have little pedal shields I think I [ __ ] over there I don't see if I die my teammates or to stay alive until the zone starts to come back in and I'll respawn it's okay you can play aggressive they were down like two levels right I've ground floors me [Music] stop it yes it is everybody what Timmy I'm Rosie we like bugs actually I never no one wants have a point range you know one feels like taking them they don't using the P 2020 and there's someone close are you sure the right seems okay to be paranoid Charlie do is take the syringes some reason they hopped it'll all be alright Joe leader three kills there are 32 people alive but that number as far as I understand could increase unless that's just the number I'm not sure if bug like that I'm trying to figure out if that number would go down and back up when people respawn or if the game is considered considers them still alive because they're just waiting for a respawn you know I assume it goes down in there back over so 30 people on them up at the moments after City season he's pretty dead I thought people have played is a bit more aggressive because you can get the old respawn on the guys that's the only reason I've rushed across this building is because I could get a respawn if I went down my teammates would be there I would have assumed namely tremendous tremendous or horrendous I can't decide which well joke's on you because you defied a zip line to loot Leafs but now you do not I'm gonna get here first and I'm gonna take the level 4 armor and [Music] the gong peacekeeper it's gonna be here from last season drugs on me what you lose it never mind my hands are so unbelievably cold you know and I should have I knew this event was coming at 6:00 p.m. I should have had the heat on I should have turned it on in preparation for this there we go so that's why for the parallel to loving life bit of ammo sounds like there's a little bit of a scrap in a distance that are fixed they're frozen they're frozen solid that is I don't know why you've found me a grapple I use a teammate when I can hear as a sort of a scrap in the distance a lovely East here but I'm not sure when my teammates want to go over and we all have level one shields I've really wanted to leave here with the least level to I mean this is tragic it's an absolute Monday tragedy I've gone the wrong way here look at this what if there's nothing around I'm more than willing to go over and fight some people mine yeah I've still my inventory's lacking but it turns out I just got a lot of ammo I'd have to fire to someone I'm on the way teammate you have to tell me twice I was half expecting someone to rock up later scrapped ascitic didn't happen still here waiting oh this is the zone moving to teammates drone I thought someone was flying in on us right here sort of useless you cannot be in the first place then I want about to waste my grapple shields knock start though sooner than that bab grapple you know how my team I got shot in the back as well I wanted to pinch myself the price party healed if I know anyway give me a sec teammates I really hope this has got like blue shield in or something I'll do come in I wasn't expecting grappler the century come out of this man crushed by three people now you've got gold as well I wouldn't do that to he'll be the proud of it can I please land a grapple this is I'm going to start playing better here because there's a full team of three murdered my crypto I now race on down but I can't change from this angle because this is where the Wraith and the path minded were from before I've got a hope that they start engaging on each other three seven escape Lu lifeline you are me switch or something Wiley I'm trying to place though so my teammates can respawn but I still want to be someone involved in the fight now my main judgment just chin up top thirty seconds and some white teammates can respawn that I guess because they I think they've respawn when the storm closes in every time or the rink I suppose it's called maybe changing this guy's a bad idea now we just get my killed oh listen try hey you're gonna respawn here in a second anyway I do not want that that was a mistake I'm not a big digital threat on the Prowler fan it's the reason it brilliant my accuracy the way in response to all the storms close the notion that be dressed morning no not yet drop down turn he's gonna heal cooking that I can cause he's got guard shields on up for about three or four seconds now I was trying to drop down the mountain I was trying to spray whilst I was dropping down sloppy extremely sloppy but we're still alive I'm gonna I'm gonna blame I've called hands I've already used the excuse once this game but they're still pretty chilly when they use on how to eat the rock tonight where are my teammates there we go okay so it's when the storm or so the ring finish finishes removing each round Quinn back we're level two shields good grief that's better shield and I had from Scrabble city there's no nice oh I expect these guys to have level two shields as well but they might they may not have decent weapons climbing I think I'm one about half healthier I'm not even sure that I don't think you can count as one health my Wraiths was around though so I think I should have been okay still I'm not taking a teammate you can feel free to I think I still would've been okay but I don't know maybe the race would have got away and that he's lucky it's extremely lucky I didn't think she was gonna expend to push things remain that's why I did the whole hop thing so when you jump like that you don't have any footsteps obviously so you can sort of get them off-guard kill them changing the side is terrible absolutely terrible idea unless you ducked in real life in need to rotate early because all these people have to go the same way calm down please chilly oh stop it no obviously you're here and you're gonna grapple upon you yes so yeah and if you jump down I'll grab a backup your choice manual grapples on cooldown you played yourself flatline with Amber Raines that sounds that beefy yeah he's not coming up on a focus friend things I puke on every table in the game though they're free kills one of them would have made it through great ball nope where did you get the pits do you respawn with a peacekeeper at level 2 feels good to breathe I thought I was pushing someone I was defenseless where's the Pathfinder is the last night I'm not gonna go crazy cuz I don't to throw a game here I would like to secure the win I think these guys actually pretty good please doesn't guess name on high ground good we know where he is teammate we just need to rush him as a three I don't want to throw this game away [Music] we go there pushing name that's why there you go [Music] champions I think I've got the crypto back twice and the Wraith once that's an interesting game mode I mean I do not realize that people going to respawn with level 2 shields and that Watson again they had a peacekeeper oh come if I die to that I would have I would have died screaming and I say all the time but this time it would have been true I promise you I'd say what I was a fun mode and I'll tell you why this one mode because you need to play a little bit stealthy if your teammates are waiting respawn I managed to see on top that mountain and just throw nades of people sort of tickle people here and there stay out of harm's way but also still involved and my teammates fly on in and help cook through the victory I knew this is gonna be one of my favourite mods and that was so much fun thank you for watching I do appreciate it I know you think about this game mode in the comment section down below and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
