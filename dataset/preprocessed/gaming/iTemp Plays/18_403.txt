so much arrows i got i'm i am so incredibly healthy it's not even funny oh there's a bag too i'm looking good now yeah i'm looking pretty good and i've got multi we might as well just carry all the ammo i don't have to worry about ammo for the rest of the game it's wonderful um do you want to alt if this place didn't have a massive roof on it be fine thank you so much ignorant smoking slide there was a guy right here oh yeah yeah you're right i'm sorry look at that ping by the way why is it why is it in the air i don't know but it was a great pink can i get my gun out anytime soon i'll just absolutely okay that makes no sense this guy's looting down here this one above to be careful i'm watching for you i'm just worried that the guy is going to shoot me if i push the battery yeah reloading a path retreated and he's cracked it's like 70 health max there's two guys underneath there's two different teams here 120 rays underneath reloading banded down he was standing still he just gave up i'll respect him reloading oh i'm so confused was that were there two teams the whole time i uh i don't know i feel like there was a team scrapping underneath them and these guys are phoned down at them that's the last thing i saw that was weird uh i need med kits but apart apart from that i'm good don't know when i can do it i know this guy'd one thank you yeah i'm good you still use like 400 sensitivity yes i do you're mania i certainly do man there's been a wave of people switching over to alc i might i might do some uh experimenting with it and see see what the wave is all about i'm waiting for nice weak scenes and then i'm trying to make nice yeah i don't know everybody's kind of switching over it's the wave apparently i saw someone and i don't think they're selling cookies we'll see can you make a guide on controlling recoil just pull down in your right stick a tiny little bit my friend that's it that's honestly all there is to it i don't even do horizontal stuff man like neither i use the horizontal with my left stick pretty much yeah recharging shields i'm gonna back up janks as am i charging on my shield i'm not gonna use my last bat i'm slow healing this team on the right are little burgers okay if we want to eat the team the team on the right we can usually just cry he's just standing there as soon as he's as soon as he's she's got blue one behind them they're porting to the left i think oh rings close and we've still got a minute the other two one underneath that side i thought he's an old man he's cracked i guess i panicked i think you did here too yeah i got you back i've only got small heels man i'm getting bullied this game everywhere i go i'm just getting shot in the back i'm getting frustrated i can't even shoot it sucks mate i have no bats as well i'm gonna have to uh loot some bodies here i'm i'm kind of struggling on heels now why are you in the middle it's absolutely destroyed these guys on the roof storms come behind us we can just alt and get ahead of this i want to loot these bodies real quick or at least a body i need some okay if you want oh yeah sorry wrong he's right near his knee he was running up that hill i was trying to kill the guy in the storm just getting focused from everywhere bro right for 90 on me she's nearly cracked on me she's right here mate she's right here i'm struggling 136 on them wait you're really challenging oh he's got a shotgun too i died i fried him though like 160 right 45 on the clock uh he res but this guy this guy's the only one with loot this is the guy that came out of the storm my two times is on my r a yeah you're whitney's all day long 100 i need a better position man this sucks i don't know what to come across or what one one is like looting this guy one's on me oh my god this game has been just the most horrendous experience for everyone involved i mean you should see my perspective it was ridiculous i'm gonna die in the storm i quite literally i think i feel probably upwards of like five thousand damage guaranteed okay i have four masks now oh my god get off my head oh so close why is this guy landing on my head like i'm a goomba and he's mario mate why are you trying to what is that i'm furious at this guy nice try dude you played that really good considering ah that was fun though that's right that's why we need a damage taken stab because me and you are big struggling the entire time that was ridiculous yes it was so crazy
