thank you to lenovo legion for sponsoring this video today is the day my friends this is the lenovo legion versus challenge that was set not only to me but to my community as well i tweeted out asking to get three of my followers in a war zone kill race with me lenovo legion provided some incredible prizes there for grabs the winner of the kill race gets their hands on the powerhouse lenovo legion 7i laptop this is a beast of a machine with incredible specs second and third place also won themselves the lenovo legion h500 headset and m500 mouse respectively so there was a lot on the line here what happened during the three hours i wasn't really expecting but looking back maybe i should have seen it coming because it was my community my three teammates had never spoken to each other before it was ryan charlie and george and they were in competition i told them beforehand that they were under no obligation to revive to buy anyone back or even to help their teammates out in any way but these guys went beyond just helping their teammates they were running into the ring to revive they were dropping guns to people fresh from the gulag they were risking their lives to get their team back up it was amazing it was easily the most wholesome tournament of all time and it was actually one of the best warzone sessions that i've ever played our first three games that we played we won them all but this challenge was all about kills i'm going to be showing you my best game of the session here but there were far more games than i'm able to share in one video the participants were george ryan and chef plays whose real name was charlie and i had three hours to rack up as many kills as they could i did keep track of all the kills during the session and i do have the results which i will share with you at the end of the game if you want to get your own hands on the lenovo legion 7i laptop there is a link in the description so let's get into the kill race my friends stay alive sorry ryan i'm gonna drive off me that's oh god he's red threat oh that's them that's the boys yeah coming looks like they're preoccupied anyway right [Applause] flank on the right yeah that's one behind that one's there you there's a truck behind us too okay trucks coming in real fast [Applause] um [Applause] very okay after these sessions you guys went into some tournaments cause i think we may be the greatest squad on this game yeah maybe original guys i think they must be a different team right yeah play stuck it he's trying to be distraction for his teammates i don't even know if they're the same team though it's confusing i'm going to make it to you guys yeah that's you know he's just been annoyed yeah they are yeah just got out on us oh he's sent it what are they doing i don't think that went well for him to be honest i think the whole team was there that's too dead of one team they just all pushed up the ladders lunatics i'm going to call you iv radar send recon yeah uav entering the ao that's right some place [Applause] oh no standing you [Applause] i don't have a driving license so i'm i'm can't drive illegal yeah [Music] yeah i made it to the compound yeah i'll

[Applause] yeah i think we're clearing it now same text a big help yeah great confusion i liked it we got someone there where we came from looping yeah that one stadium is quite closely yeah oh no

[Applause] oh he's just insured me i'm one oh yeah oh it's not from stadium i'll selfie guys on here there's one fish [Applause] yep next to the car i might be able to raise my record i can oh i could hear him really close yeah i wouldn't oh i saw him the last second uh i was in a really bad spot i was thinking he might push left he's got a nice heading on that road yeah he's pushing you when you're right yeah find that wall you jumped over [Applause] i'll play i should have decent money in my body oh my word they all had selfish i killed two inside and that guy so i don't if you guys got one that was everyone let me check it yeah i got one yeah i should have a decent amount i'm going to get george jack this is his cash yeah let me try and i'm not sure if i'll lose properly inside i can't believe i survived that see if we can get some cash together for you mate we don't need much running to buy i'm going to push our loadout if you want people are firing in there with the bro someone on it it's dead another one on it someone further back there's a truck coming behind him i don't know if it's his teammate picking him up or what enemy soldier probably on a boat landing on the roof behind us [Applause] i'm here with one shot sorry mate this truck is literally mowing everyone down it's it's brutal to watch me now just be careful you have to have the truck as well come back to you guys got an angle rich i think so i don't oh yes oh my god bless him that's right it was the last one it's close right yeah here two of them come another yeah [Applause] on the left and if
