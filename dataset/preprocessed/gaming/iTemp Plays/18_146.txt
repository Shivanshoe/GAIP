hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are doing one hour of solo diamond and when i say solo diamond i mean solo queueing so i do have teammates but they're not a pre-made squad of mine they are just random teammates and i have to communicate with whoever the game has given me now you guys loved my previous one hour of ranked gameplay uh that was in like silver and gold lobbies though now we're in the big boy leagues in diamond trying to make masters we've got clutches we've got funny moments we've got horrendous fails we've got big damage wins we've got crazy second places we've got everything in this video so get a drink sit back relax make sure you subscribe to the channel and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that wasn't very nice that goes cracked don't worry i'm here nice don't worry i'm here i only got one kp that's fine i might keep the triple take i feel like it's a jack of all trades like it's so good all right some early kp is actually so nice i played a game just now 15 minutes didn't get a single kp by the time we actually got into a fight there were four teams i'm not i don't mean left i mean we took a fight when there were four teams on us and it was disastrous far better to take that 1v1 v1 at the start of the game you know or 1v1 depending on how you think about it all right extra bats and a bag level two bag here i hate not having a bag it's a pet peeve of mine it's the worst recharging shield okay well this guy's got a bow and arrow and apparently he's the greatest the greatest i've ever seen i don't like this angle if we don't go here they're going to cut us off battery drop there we go and one oh my god giving my shields a recharge there too he's not got long left hopefully i can get some loot here because i did get all three of them there we go that's some good okay whoa this guy's keyboard what kind of keyboard this guy using don't pick it up do not pick that up i implore you not to use it all right well that was successful that all started because i managed to down that guy with a chill take the triple take is outrageous you land a head shot they are they're going down it's like the crater it's pretty much the crater i've got 4kp myself i've got four kills and i'm i'm on plus 20. you know what i haven't actually had a positive rp game uh in a while to be honest as sad as that is oh god you are struggling amigo are you okay no i've been flung off the side of the map all right i feel like i should move this to this just for a little what's bit give you all did we try and third this instead yeah we've got to be careful but enemy over there i've got to disturb these guys get some free kp i wish i had that scouts i mean they have to be in here as i miss i fell down as well this is good news need to recharge my shields let's move this way look out grenades i'm not going to take too much of your time here this is me speaking after the fact what we should have done is we should have backed up as soon as this happened as soon as they bubbled and that gunfight was over we were going to be the ones that were going to get third parties and we took too long to disengage so next time i'm going to try and remember that anyway on to the next game so i messed that one up that was my fault this would be even more of a oh here we go sorry timmy if your keyboard is that loud i might have to meet you even though i assume you've got some good stuff to say i cannot hear you i can't even hear my self-talk there we go there's one loud keyboard mine's probably that late to be honest from planet controller so you can't tell contact reloading the enemies nice i'm hoping i still get an assist on that him it was ages ago i did i did this stupid rock it's bouncing me everywhere there you go that's what i was trying to do yes hello this man is full health reloading take an r9 i guess i do because the ammo situation i've got 35 mats i can get a gold gun if i get the other two wait did i already get one of the crafting mats nice team they have my cover i knew fighting was a good idea i mean i got i had a flat line with the blue mag and a gosh darn purple armor at the start of the game if you can't fight with that you're playing the wrong game you know sure the team landed over that way repairing i need it energy i can see that the ring is moving on the map no i just said i wanted that's oh that is an absolute whoa i did not know there was an essay here hello yeah no problem even though i really wanted that gosh darn it there is an extended energy magazine well everyone can't remember oh what i've just saved up for a gold rampaged i'll see him and we're safe here but not for that long let's try and get around this way target over there people that way too that's the problem it's not been staying alive for quite quite a while to be honest i saw you this is a way better place to fight i've got the care package here people are fighting down here to the right i've got a feeling myself it's going to go for the care package giving my shields of recharge let's try and make a present so we don't get flanked up the hill we got this spot for free wasn't that weak on the enemy i mean someone has to protect they're doing us a favor start my brains why did they wrote that it was so loud to be honest [Music] oh my god no they are fighting oh that hurt recharging shields [Applause] just swing on him we should focus the solo here we should go this way and just focus in solo [Music] you can separate there you go i don't understand how these guys didn't get hit by anyone else i know i'm safe here i don't know where these other squads are there's probably a team up on this hill there's a solo triple taker somewhere i need a better light mag so bad i've got a respawn beacon i didn't even get a chance to loot this guy and i'm not gonna be able to when i have 8kp even though that was messy we're still alive and that's the important thing i have a level one man so bad we need to be careful don't go crazy relax we need to be slow we can we can win this easy plate smart we should not use that just chill just chilling okay i reckon making contact hustle right here in the middle uh giving my shields a recharge this is very exciting stop griefing me okay watching this one back i'm really not sure what else we could have done to be honest with you maybe see at the very top of the hill but the team across the stone from us sprinted after us for no reason and threw the game for themselves and us it was kind of crazy but whatever it's fine third place with eight kb is pretty good and this game that you're joining we landed at this lava pile on thing we had a crafter we had a beacon there was no one in sight so we did a lot of crafting we did a lot of looting we even got our key card into one of the vaults and you are joining us as we're going into the vault now he's got everything gold what a demon thank you truly he's got everything gold my word all right 33 people left flatline vault not too bad not too bad at all i don't think i maybe should have taken how close how close we talking scratch my head everyone chill let's go oh way that one's really that close this man when they've got a triple take though they have two triple takes stupid frogs man it's not assisted [Applause] need to compose grenade watch out we myself go here shields are retouching so yeah i played that terribly i'm gonna be honest with you real bad thankfully my teammates are actually doing damage what i was messing about enemy spotted shots fired enemy seems like a really tough angle yeah we don't want to take that they land a sharpness they do like 50 damage with a charge to 30 30. doesn't seem worth it it does not seem worth it diving on us [Applause] i should have saved my interrupts i've got a pad there no they just covered him look at that just covered in traps they backed up oh the looks of it yeah you're not there anymore it's cool level three i'm close to my red battery here i need to take some of these that's certain stocking up stocking up spotted the race got pushed they're fine over this way uh god is he worth pushing this way i don't know teammates look interested no one's really that close i don't think look enemy over here streamer building taking a moment we don't push this giving [Music] like one guy's a solo somewhere oh my god messed up good job is [Music] someone else knocked there race 30 seconds oh thank you so much by the way you can make this car we'll be all right this is huge this is a good spot on that nice i need that only have two bats three scores left though one minute my friends ring is close this building's free by the way our surroundings what the heck's going on here grenade i'm recharging my shields what lies phoenix wanna get hit by that i have no more bats are they not getting whacked more both teams are focusing they're so hard both teams are focusing on so hard this team down here like there's no way they're not getting focused i have two cells the heck is going on over there oh my god oh that team's still over there i thought they were all in the build what happened she's down he's dead oh they're all dead they're all screwed i've got a lot of three pieces yeah they're to design the zone yes well played team they were honestly like there were some moments there some gunfights where my team just straight carried me absolute demons they played that really well i feel like we played it really well as a team to be honest with you double scans and then pathfinder is the ultimate for movement getting us into good positions we played that so well nice that's huge good game guys that was great let's explore this way oh let's go this way why can't i get this the door to get it since glitched or something there's um enemy taken down i got you friend just one more guy in this team shields are recharging teammates coming back i need some luke though i'll be honest thank you loader tempted to put my arm in here i can't let's so let's get some early kp sometimes sometimes i feel like if you play the early game too slow it can be i don't know like it's harder to get into the groove of the game it's hard to explain the annoying thing here is that i left a broken target we should wrap all the way left here everything again i have a subject guys if you cannot i can't get you repaired oh my god we should not have won that i thought we were goners i need energy ammo we should wrap all the way west and go uh go to trials that way it's the safest thing to do all right my plan here is to go around lava fisher might be something good this way we've got two minutes to do it wrap around there's only five of the squads but i've got six kp this is it this is a game that i need to win let's explore it this way watch ultimate oh my god that's a crowbar i think got two craves in play i seem like he's got one of them we need to get might be something good this way we need to get safe let's get safe earlier there's two teams here on the right that aren't in zone let's go this way oh my god that sucks i could use some help oh my god no recharging shield i am taking fire friends that is horrendous i don't know boris one bacon no i don't that was a previous game that's horrendous both my team has got a head shot i killed an enemy first one is get headshot cratered what a sick joke i got beacon which one's that octane no you don't got our friends banner this is great i've never seen anything like it don't cry with me i need to just need to hide so my teammates get down i can't really help you i mean i've got nothing to say about this one it's just unlucky you know we move on let's explore this way how these people so fast man how are they so fast it's crazy why am i are you guys skipping is it just me i'm lagging all over the place i need a weapon you might have to restart the game then all the forums restarted there's also f4 work okay we're back yeah it's a mess one sec yes he's way there there we go i don't have a gun though uh yeah we can't all cost right now they're good so i was drum masters i was lagging in the air too so that's why they got there so much quicker you know otherwise man trust in the old father let's go this recharge two teams oh my god at least i'm alive i wasn't looking lightly for a while cracked one i think we've heard this and i don't have volts as long as we stay at range teammates can try and find some damage for uh armor upgrades you know these teams died [Music] i did third party good grief it's quite known by ammo this is a decent loadout if i had a level three bag i'd take two throwables but i don't and these ranked games gone for quite a while and sometimes you don't get to loot anything having a load of ammo i mean i probably don't need that many light rain so i think that's my mistake if i could go back which i can't because i can't be bothered i'd switch out some of this uh light ammunition for oh i could have 15 seconds no no i'm gonna have time i was thinking i could use the beacon uh i'd switch out 60 rounds of this for like a grenade or something and these guys are thinking the same thing i am marking our surroundings i'm an idiot canceled so sorry i died on this building here i don't think anyone's in here to be honest ring's not far contact [Music] horizon cracks inside that rock making contact big down annoyingly two squads left oh i didn't get any six on the wraith which is annoying so here for like 110. i reckon i was just a split second away from getting these discs there can i sound low these guys are firing each other right that wasn't us target spotted this alleyway that they're going to be fighting for i think so just going nice i committed to that because i know i had cover right there i knew my teammates were next to me that's a big ulti we should win this we should win this i think they could just retreat into the oh they could just retreat to the side as well recharging skills this is a random oh no it's just a 3v3 i didn't realize right it's cracked recharging my shields i need a foot pedal go i have a course dick so this is gonna be rough in the final the final zone i don't think he has ultimate though just gonna make sure we shoot his barrels two feet of our nature we shouldn't give up our spot that easily oh we're doomed honestly we gave up we gave a passport too easily i think nice try man this one's hard to watch back i didn't realize it was only one team left uh for way too long we could have held them uh when they had to come around the corner and know all together but the end game is always gonna be difficult against accordingly i think we should have won that game though however this game did take us to diamond three which was amazing you know i've soloed the diamond three and then the next game i missed every single shot and i got demoted back down to diamond four but it's okay though we're going into the final game here is anyone else landing here i don't think so i think okay we got a crafter and a beacon this is huge it's the other game you want i'm not going to do it actually pretty happy my loadout as well i mean i'll change it with the spawning on this pretty decent should i keep the hemlock should i use to unlock this game let's do it did we just start this i guess all these guys what am i shooting a box for so bad i hate them they're terrible i don't think so i don't think so definitely could have got a kill there but it's okay let's stay alive i guess you know how close i was to death just now that is so unlucky though i mean i guess we were third partying uh let's let's try let's try i think this is a good position come on wiggling bam i didn't mean to have it burst guys recent battle racing battle a lot of smokage he's oh ridiculously sad i broke his knockdown i cracked him and everything we could just pour it down and we could have just killed those two guys i need to nearly fell now there we go yes oh should drop this forgive me you take the bag take the bag take the bag i have ammo i have bats i'm going to kp there too i'm making it back into d3 here oh he's got a gold knock down let's go isolate the right one dive on the right one recharging my ships your time is not over yet i have a subject sometimes you've got to play viagro you know oh okay three squares left still independent we've got a caustic on our team what sides do you have only three times oh he died just give me one sec let's go where the wraiths go let's go good job team nice well played oh my god man that gold bag came in clutch it was worth giving me to the giveaway you good great champion that was close that was very close uh i had a few kills stolen from not by teammates that doesn't matter i don't care if it's a killer on a cease give me the kp four kills one assist only got five kp i only got five kp of course he didn't get any kp he had 1200 damage no i felt terrible how does that happen alright made it back to d3 i am honored
