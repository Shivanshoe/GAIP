all right train Yardley's which is also the hub Trump my absolute lunatic of a teammate wants to land here I don't know if I've ever survived a hot chopper train night I'm not the combat sniper scope through someone I drove down days gone by when I would have wished that was going to be a turbocharger but it is not it's guys fleeing the scene get back here friend Hey picked up a weapon in everything I've come to realize that I'm terrible oh my god it's a good job he'll be at 999 I've come to us that I'm honestly terrible weird The Sentinel I cannot land a shot so I do not mind I need leaving that behind I don't know if we should go back in here without being shielded there's a chance they've left this part when loot eat and this this little part here has decent Lucy you always find like a blue or purple shields near this way it's one of those little areas no no she no shoots we boy careful teammate I'm saying that more as in I don't have it I don't have a shell to protect you top as well and there's someone closer I've this you've got shields well let the game decide if there are shields here I'm going back in if there are no shelves here I'm fleeing the scene because this is the hot dropper train yard and you can almost guarantee if these guys got some decently and there you go I have fatty seals my Gibraltar friend we are getting the heck can Frick involve two is even fiery is that a slight that doesn't sound beefy enough to be sniper is mixing it up well we know there's a core stick around my teammate isn't really too close that's okay so hopefully he hasn't filled pits place his traps I guess we're gonna find out no good and he's left the shield behind so that means that he's got shield unknowingly when I was struggling oh I'm here for the scrap shields I told you that be looted what a shot to be fair to him what did he get from me you barely tickled me I'll see these lights I cannot see these iron sights I need to put the legendary skin on again some skins honestly just have their iron sights on me see what the legendary skins that it mix it up there are definitely a few I see God Sentinel I don't want it as I said I can't land a shot with the regular sense now let alone bond describe a full 10 times variable scope we already made a video on that right I did that Bellucci pick one on a gold gun and the other guy I have purple shields it's a good job I went to find some decent League that it's gold shields right there I'm not sure he's gonna know how to get up here you better hope they don't shoot me I'm doing a good deed here I met his son enough he might be coming over Timmy I don't think you've pinned it yeah the pings ran off now the pings worn off there you go here deep z3 he's going the other way ed you brought it with a level 3 shield there we go but you brought over the level 3 shield this one of these scariest sights on this game the only thing scarier is a DES brought it with a love of horse shells but I'm not dropping this gold didn't mean to punch the wall day by the way that wasn't diss furious if you were curious I've no idea what these people were firing from I guess that seal that one then I'm not going all the way at North or I could just be heading to scraps or city let's go this way never mind bye all tube top I can then transfer unto this zip line and then shoot them from above this is why I hate train yards sometimes you just get dweebs like me to south topping these old bird cages that's the gotten nothing and now he's friend can't even defend him nice job mangalore's beeline in it where she up top or something what where is she making contact with enemy this is completely separate teams this bangle was held up and she's gonna shoot me the back I don't mind taking bad trades here that's a really black trade okay I thought you were just a separate team come on I didn't my taking back trays there because I've seen it's gold shields I had this your batteries well hey whoa what's going on here oh my god I connected the punch it's a good job I did I something I've done Gibraltar Lutie friend he only can we feel bad I don't need a different weapon a missile thing it's just no work there's no any drones around there's no way that reporter doesn't come back to - Luke that right that's four steps oh is that just my cat it's gay it's the age-old question there we go he's looting if you think are those into the loot box here okay as any drones icon bothered now I've got a flat line with a three times and anvil receiver and it's my long-range option I don't like having to bomb syringes I do preacher having 24 shield cells though a man of culture of course Bob our stabilizer level three extendo max Oh level one extender max that's my first extended mags for one light ammunition that's tragic some modern-day tragedy we've killed so many people we've got such good lives and we're here trying to work with level 1 level 1 xn domains for Theo 99 horrendous this is the problem name oh my god they're only 10 people left good grief people die so fast enjoy OHS well the teams are so spread out so everyone just shoots it to each other it's on the game it'd be even worse and so Eliza I remember when sellers did come out for like a week whatever it was last year sometime if you just survived the first five minutes you were pretty much gonna win the game because everyone there was so separate out you can't help but avoid the gun fight sometimes much party helping selling looting I'm coming okay I've got a three times on this to sell this goes it's gonna put a cake got a better cake I was actually pretty good at that range weirdly enough it was good at medium range now kill it upper 4x10 on mags just what you like to see but the big heels to go along with there that's not my thing guys trying to ping the Phoenix kit to go along with our gold shields and now we have seven kills kill leader and there are fewer than 10 people left in fact I think that might be eight people right care package in the not-so-distant distance who are you hoping for here see I've literally got called everything I'm okay it's actually London never mind if I mean the answers always devotion nowadays isn't it the gun is an outrageous out of ten but I won't mind a god chill for my teammate here massive good day don't fancy I'm here I'm not good with single shots weapons ok wing wing man's wingman they're not good with that sense now any of the snipers I'll tell you what it is it's the pressure battery here it's the pressure of knowing that I need to land one more shot to get the kill I've much rather have a spray weapon because I am unskilled there you go that is my briefing on my second immersive before I get flamed in the comments yet again is it a good gun yes it is one of the best and I hate it when someone else is using it against me sorry I heard something Basilica is real far away oh yeah I hate too many choose against me but when I use it it's it's not an outrageous at 10 like the diversion is alright the reason I'm coming back here is because I'm gonna try this and I know it's ludicrous I know that I've just dropped my favorite size in the entire game thank you let's go this way however I do have the amber reins and this is looking like is that this is a lot of long lines of sight here and if we could drop some poke damage on them let's call it a range I could ulti to them and then just finish the kills and with the i99 at close range that's the dream that is what I'm going for here I'm gonna use the flat line like a g7 Scouts if possible there we go might be something strike with spotted teamate they're both one-shot they are both incredibly weak and by one shot up I mean I landed only I landed one shot they're not they're not that weak don't panic he's gonna up another way that's fine why is this thing so difficult to fight if I the g-seven Scout they're these guys literally in full auto mode these guys would have been screwed the Groot but I guess this does more damage than the g7 so I guess he has to kick more all right some of these how are these not connecting half my energy here is going to try to control the recoil god oh he's something me I think I want to find that after the game cooked up by Drew Boltzmann's autopilot Oh God knock down to someone this Pathfinder to see me here oh my god oh we peaked at the mass sniffing his clicks trip with his another same full autopilot I mean that okay with three times on the flatline he's not he's not happening anymore they're live teammate you know memento the gold knock down shield has just come in absolutely clutched Timmy give me one second there you go just in case I get shot at and I've got a gold back nice he coming back with more health I only had four god did I get then at God knock down for when I punch did you brought off the loot I think that active accidental toxicity I mean I did it on purpose but I thought he just seems that the funniest right I let him keep looting but then he got off the loots almost apologetically but that act of toxicity may have just saved us the game I'm so happy that I'm not no longer using a three time site I couldn't land a shot I mean you'd be by I could land one shot but I was the problem 1 out of 1 out of 25 now I might use math if you want to double Mastiff combination teammate I saw you pop it up the massive day feel free I can't be that's gonna take we experimented with the three times we tried it but it's not that good at close range if I have one x there there's a decent chance I'll kill that guy I mean I know you had a full-auto Prowler but I got in week with her three times if I had at one time Simon it would have been a sound target it'll be easier [Music] like a seven I'll keep it an even to stack at six this is the only area we haven't checked but there's a damn there's a down low part of this swamp disappointed but it's just one guy at the end I want a huge scrap a column grapple because he silenced me we go in silenced oh good job teammate who's absolutely caning that's right there much damage did we do 271 with nine kills that's not that bad that's all in fact I think usually you can expect to get 200 damage a kill that's usually my sort of average so 9 kills with 2200 damage I did a decent amount I'm happy with that game good grief I can't believe how it worked out with the goal knock down shields save being toxic sometimes bees are necessary but don't but don't do that it's annoying when people printer off boxes I should've done it but I did after boxing gloves so it was safe anyway thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one mmm
