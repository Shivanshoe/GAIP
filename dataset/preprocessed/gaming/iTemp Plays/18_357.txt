hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today something happened that i've never personally seen before teamers on apex i couldn't believe it it seems way too annoying to try and remember who you're supposed to be teaming with uh we died to them and then spectated them until the end of the game and then i have another great game after that as well so i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching it is of course coming home and i'll see you in five and a half seconds my friends i was seriously considering

there dixie cracked down dude i don't know where the other one is oh yeah over here i'm just gonna get some sniper ammo yes oh my god i'm just i was going around the ropes just quick scoping yeah that was awful it's not working though in here watch for that path too i don't actually know where the race was the squad squad [Music] oh what is happening there are four people there i can see an octane standing next to an octane they're teaming what look there's two octanes there look that's enough look he's just got an octane teammate i've never seen that before bunch of losers oh my god i've look oh look what there's a bangalore there friend sweet what is happening this is this is unbelievable i've never seen this before look this is just their friend this is just their friend bro which one are you watching are you watching munzo and knights yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what am i watching you're already teaming for 700 damage of one kill well done mate well you're the bad i don't even know what to report them under i mean massive nerds run for five what am i watching you know what it is a ranked is in the worst state it's ever been so these kids are coming to pubs to do this they're trying so hard too yeah and they're actually awful i had more damage than all six of them combined yeah yeah yeah 100 same like that damage is good i won't make it out but well fine well what they've been fine for a while now this is the most ridiculous thing i've ever i've never seen i've literally i don't remember the last time i saw this is the other team dead no they've got a logo next to them yeah oh my god though this is unreal look that's the other i keep looking like are you the octane you saw when the with the uh this octane looked at the bangalore in red and they just like stopped and t yeah yeah yeah like when he came to the door what are we watching right now like this is unreal they're trying so hard too they're so bad what nice sound i've never wanted a red team to kill them so bad he can't even revive his friends they would try and revive him finish him he's trying to revive him oh my god where's type of people and he's got two kills oh my god he's devastated oh he's by himself now he's by himself wait what was that you see that i'm looking through the screen all jittering for you yeah he's going crazy i'm friendly friendly okay he turned on the aimbot i knew he did something he turned on namebot i'm not sure if he doesn't nope he turned it on i i i almost promise you he turned on the name yeah that's what that jitter was it was toggling on go on cash out go on little john mess him up yeah this is the teamer yes yes yeah they killed him nice dude let's go octane team say anything with enough confidence some people believe you though oh yeah okay you're with your accent i mean believe everything you said in the beginning i just believed you all the time i'm sooner or later you got bamboozled oh wait he didn't die i thought oh nice the teammate just left supposed to see you though i'm here it's probably so confusing this guy's not shooting me oh was that oh that was you would you like this heavy uh i don't know i was doing the teammate i wasn't sure if he wanted this he's put it back i don't think he can hear you wait dude you talking game no i was just like where i talk to myself and hope they hear me come on what's that confusing about that what are these sounds i've never heard that voice i'm not right you heard that one racing yeah why can't i get my gun out reloading that's a scam oh you don't even need any straight old man for the scammed it was better in my mind opening fire on the enemy opening fire just gotta patch myself there's a lot going on with you surely deployed that easily a path between us already in the next ring i smell your life wow my two friends are oh [Music] i should honestly craft some ammo on how many points come i got you friend someone's reviving me oh it's you me wow he didn't come my way that's so crazy the champion has been eliminated i it takes using a bad i-99 skin to appreciate the good i-99 skins like they're actually so painful to win it's nice yeah it's a necessity you need a one of the good 99 skins i've zoomed in i had a circle ah awful so bad so ugly it's like only muzzle flash is all i see yeah that's about my ultimate to apply my own skin on it that's how desperate i was didn't even make sense i was in a good fight oh oh you was getting shot yeah yeah yeah so i could run away and change the skin i was like this is not happening nice i don't know where what's up is that up top yeah it sounds like oh yeah somewhere up top and they're shooting down below right here oh i know you're gonna say this but when i play card name i feel like a complete boss because this game doesn't feel like pod anymore what do you mean because like on classic it sort of feels like card so i can interchange between the two not not too bad yeah you're not gonna be able to you're not gonna be able to switch and now you're going to say mountain climbing i want to come into the keyboard yes let's go dude let's be mouse and keyboard gamers not on apex though i like playing uh controls on apex yeah controller right there's other games oh there's a firing squad yeah oh my god those are demons that's necessary especially when there's a building right here come on guys obtain the flesh his team was on the ground like trying to block the door and the octane turn around trying to get back in that team was not coordinated at all no there was there were no comms there there were no cons involved champions huge mate yes
