hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some pathfinder and then in a second game that i've got for you i am playing some uptake the speedy boys themselves both of whom are actually uh when you think about it in pretty bad spots with their kits at the moment somehow they are both bad but really fun at the same time i don't know how that's possible also today is the last day to get yourself a 30 off your g floor you can restock on your faceberry you can get yourself a fresh new shaker if you've never tried it before you can order some starter packs to see which flavors you enjoy the most the link is in the description and the code is item for that beautiful first percentage game you can thank me later it's all right so yes hopefully you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i mean a1 the truth that's definitely an american name i can tell i'm in the american lobby i don't know there's something about it no 100 percent that's like a one the truth i just i don't know but they're from new york i reckon that's like uh there's like a lot of rappers in um like texas like uh like what is it what is the what is the wrap called i care what it's called like screw like chopped and screwed is like a specific type of uh specific type of wrap and it's really popular like in texas and that that he's probably from texas you reckon he must not be very good yeah old i think i might be honest i think i might be stupid and i'm just like what's this and do i need it and it takes me so long to figure out that i just i'm doing the i'm doing your technique from now on just literally just the hoover evernote technique yeah that's what i do i spam click everything and then i just as soon as i start running i open up my menu and drop whatever i don't need that's yeah i mean i did that for a long time but then people started getting mad at me and stuff leader i have two purple line max by the way i could care less all right mate it's only purple imac of course he has this crazy angle going to grapple on his forehead i'll do it i'll do it i i i know you want to you might be broken oh nice i think it's going behind me i've got faith yeah our teammates got him broke another one reloading top uh ran back here i think where are they one's going to race they're going to race down low other one is 30 xp uh 26 actually so next time give me an accurate callback you know what you know what i will i will i will argue that because he got rezzed okay mate wait no there's no way i could have hit him for four he had to have been 30. there's no way that doesn't add up he said 26 but maybe that's like one more bullet stage but i didn't actually do that much that makes sense you know so when you get rezzed you're 38 yeah yeah yeah there's no way you can before yeah i was on sale i was using a flat line i was like that's that that's an add-on all right well i apologize all right take it back sorry you need to have a blind neck uh i have a blue and i'm chilling i've got i've got two purples i just want to go oh you have two purples level three do you want me to you know i'm tempted to fly to kryptos thing like in the storm um never mind then that's sad i mean we could i'm tempted to stop i'm still tempted it's not tempted oh oh i'm getting absolutely melted the world's best triple taker come on i'm in the store now unless they say the road they're they're diving on you hard i'm trying one's going up uh yeah they're taking up the uh no one jumped on you window is it broken down action he knows he's screwed with groot he's gonna try and take the rope right i just broke him but he's popular shields is that him i can't see my name now yeah my head like an absolute psycho come on i saw a dive on you i was like okay it came with the triple takeout as well yeah he tried to like no scope you mid-airs i think he hit that he was to be fair he was a bit of a lunatic yeah yeah he was a bit crazy on the sticks yeah a little psycho look you there to shoot me in the back fighting hard over there oh my god on the right i use my rope oh you don't even need it missed every shot oh yeah it's a classy throwing step shot part two over here oh they've got like a bubble that's cheating though yeah they already used it so they're kind of the 28 i think that's pushing up that guy's needed definitely crack now what happens low we're making shots nice yeah just watch me they're inside the building they're they're super far down opening fire on the enemy oh thank you i'm popping them dead they're they're destroying our teammate every single person in this game has a triple take what is happening honestly since it's been buffed people are just going crazy that thing oh crap both went beyond one there we go stop triple taking her stop it jesus you guys are crazy there's four squad left there fine north quite a few of them oh my god but oh that does not sound good oh god she's one i just country through the shields i was trying to shoot the shield down too i've never been so terrified yeah okay buddy that is the most lunatic maneuver i've ever seen someone attempted to tell you what i expected beyond belief i'm gonna let her leave no she's dead no i was gonna crank one on her so hard oh my god i mean he just started spinning i saw my life flash before my eyes like i should have won the gunfight but i think i was still in shock last team last thing uh how can you see me i might be dead that's on the rez i find it's cracked she's really weak over there down live she's just chilling she's nice nice she was standing in smoke absolutely bopping me like nice jesus look great what a game i was actually can't play it there was 45 triple takes in total in that game champions i've absolutely hated every last one of them there's so many i think every single one of us just got destroyed by triple t too fair in the end wasn't a bad game there was a massive law in the mid massive but then it all kicked off thank you for the res um are you do you want to leave here do you want to just head back over there i'm about to head back i'll just hoover up someone's uh a little bit of something right there drop you some more light right here thank you all those boxes in the in the train i think there's literally zero ammo in all of them oh my god you can check them but i don't think there's anything in there yeah oh there's a g7 right here oh nice thank you yeah i'm trying to find some scraps before i go back in oh yeah i don't know what not having any ammo what do you need lights i've sent it right now so i'm chilling on light i mainly need uh energy energy yeah i don't know all right what do you what do you have you have uh g7 and g7 sense now nice it's the combo you see this all the time be sure i saw someone uses the iljs yeah all the pros run the uh run that combo all the cool kids oh yeah okay i'm ready to go ready to dominate we're back in the game yeah like nothing happened duo's b squads easy easy clap i feel like every game that we played in trios it just ends up being duels versus squad oh yeah you can't just find a nice man i have no extended mag on my r301 but it's all right and i have no shotgun ball i'm burning one with purple nice cracked on the path i hit two of them quite a lot not crashed but i think i hit one with my name nice nice nice drone on me i hate caustic so much at the worst i know you were coming from the left so i cut him off on the right yeah that was good he had another another trap on the corner unreal did they do swing to the two times like um i could move it close range again um i have not used it at all so i don't know the only gun that i'll ever use the two time on is the flat line yeah i think that's a good show if i see it one times i'll try i'll use it but there we go any shotgun bolts for the boys oh i'm gonna keep my eyes out yeah i think it's this side yeah they're over there i actually think it's too close the wall to actually do anything no no it's perfect i think they're going to try and get up top oh never mind there's a few of them like mine is down so yeah nice uh shotgun box wait no no i have uh full bats if you need anything you good uh i'm chilling i mean i have two that's fine i have a ton of cells too sir oh nice i just couldn't couldn't believe that teammate bless them they don't they just don't know when to play outgrow and when to be like okay um let's just chill like wait wait another big scan coming in this is literally how every start every fight starts wait here here i can probably paddle top oh wait what does dude flying in the air oh he just flew he's up there he's up there i'm going oh all you oh no i had to drop you run down that way i missed a lot of shots man he was it was kind of dodgy let me honest with you that's that's only an octane though oh i'm getting shot from behind too i'm going to be a little bit cautious he's in this one then just spotted someone out there all right i'm with you over there like little cooker actress it's got like a burst going outside jumping down jesus he's super lacking he's doing that glitch oh like the fast space should we get a feeling i only saw him for a second but he was fast oh there he's coming the top another one on me the race cracked oh mate i literally don't have any bullets dude i got so scared i was like it's another team we're dead thank you gotta go back too nice oh i cracked the race and i was doing like 28 damage after that oh there's a pk down here if you want it yeah you know what i'll do it i'll do it thank you this dude had oh he had pk auto prowler that's a scary kind no one did trying to get close to us yeah that's a really scary combo y'all messed up not fun all right one squad oh i have my hand on my controller oh my god i ain't quite a lot okay i'm just getting beamed apparently yeah i took my hand off my controller for like one second yeah yeah i've got a sniper's careful hit that guy with a knife 21 that's come to us not much no that's fine i'm going to pick up this brawler real quick say that car i'm fine all right i'm ready i'm not there one's hopping after me lay down huh he he dropped down he's close uh low ground they need help yeah i'm going up this guy's finishing moving me no he's not nice job yeah yeah this way i'm back up see ya thanks for playing nice try though they came with a plan they came in with a plan and it was it was working out for him i mean i
