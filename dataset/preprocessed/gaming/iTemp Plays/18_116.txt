i need some of the early game emp everybody's getting paid faster faster the early game emp dude i'm ready for it oh they won't expect it level three i got a jump pad too so we can like jump on them uh i did 25 damage hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing crypto today who got some great buffs at the start of the season and for the first week or so i would see cryptos everywhere i was getting impede multiple times a game sometimes it's been a few weeks now and i actually very rarely see them in fact the only way i see a crypto now is if they're doing that weird book where they start flopping around like a fish which happens in the game that i've got for you today but crypto is one of those weird characters where he can actually be really good but people still won't want to play in public games because the pacing is so different and it must be really difficult for very small to balance him because if they go too crazy and make people want to play him more in the public games than in ranked and competitive he would just be too good i still enjoy playing him though i absolutely love using the emp i love it however sometimes it is a little bit anticlimactic as you saw from that little intro there 25 damage when two full teams are find each other thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends uh do we detour here just relocating yeah we should most certainly go here and then we go fight over again uh yes come on triple wins landing chore bins is always a mistake when there's a building there i'm telling you such a rocky mistake for me i am on the move my friend kicking off like crazy one of the biggest fights of the century i think uh i just accidentally needed a guy it was incredible huge getting my eyes in the sky no no no no no no my apologies i came in swinging though you gotta admit i was swinging are you dead oh my god yeah but it's okay we saved it so really bad [Applause] [Music] what kind of fight went on in here oh ah does anyone have any light energy animal here i can craft don't worry long oh my ammo can't even think with his dragging screaming at me it's like we're fine kalisek over here like this is i was sitting watch my back hold on that is one of the downsides of playing off uh okay i'm holding them off oh god um look at he's like one shot like actually yeah there's a team behind him i think i need i need to go back i need to hear him on a side note i have no more ammo uh what you need mate i have some heavy i think i'll come back to you i want you to know your thumb i'm good i'm good i'm good okay i just have light i've still got i'll have if you need it i'm okay i'll drop you here recharging my shield i need optics for an assault rifle sergeant on my shoes should be charging thank you i don't have a light mag i need to craft one do you have a head in there charge my shield yeah i have a heavy i'm trying to use a digital charging on my shield oh no he's here we go oh i don't know uh no i'll keep it from my wingman i can craft the lights okay thank you though okay let me get these maps yeah they're just sort of chilling in the open trying to take our stuff it's going to disappear fire one of them took the port crack the guy the back i'm coming reloading good job last cell which is kind of a bad thing better find another team behind them they got 30. it seems to be a common occurrence here that's one of them he's over this way over here that was the last of the squad huh it's hard to survive alone level one like mike let's go that's what i'm talking about i have no chance to craft i'm fine that is strange on the plus side you got goals you don't really need that we're good we're good i found i found one cell that'll do well this is fun that was a good fight yeah this still is fine oh oh oh oh what the heck's going on whoa water get the holy water that was the demon what the heck was that did you see that he was flopping about like a fish someone get the holy water for the love of christ that man was possessed hundred percent oh what's that that's some kind of lord yeah i'm playing a lot of elden ring i know all about these dark magic he went invisible or something that man looked like a thrall from destiny he he did he did yes he literally dropped on the deck and flopped like a fish from the spongebob theme chain speaking of fish dude you want to know what i've been watching a lot of for no reason whatsoever um fishing yeah underwater spear fishing oh my god exactly you ever watched like spear fishing strap gopro on and that sounds sad for the fish well you just stabbed him with a spear well kind of that's like they have a gun it's a spear gun i mean they hurt for a little bit but it's pretty i would say it's pretty tame it's probably more tame than like actual fishing where you hook them and then you gotta fight with them for however long right and you and then you pose for a picture of whilst they're drowning like reverse australian and you're throwing back in the water reverse drowning massive hole in your mouth yeah i mean i can't say anything i had salmon for dinner you know they killed the salmon somehow so very true crafting give me a speaking of salmon i am hungry oh it was good it was good it was like red thai salmon with some like rice noodles can you stop with some shredded grains i hate you it was good each word as it's a little bit more it's a little bit more coming from you i saw someone and i don't think they're selling cookies they found another team thank you very much track both of these oh she used it to block the door that's smart i can appreciate that yeah probably i'm trying to bulge him block you miss him a wingman addict now it's i've just fallen you know one of us i can't stop it that's what i like to hear i'm also a wingman i'm not killing i have nine kills you have 10 kills i have nine ah so does this valk apparently that's not true okay so you know the crypts are both level three yeah so you press the drone you can press it and it just launches it right okay and it goes a little distance and then it stays there um if you press and hold it it stays in the drone like no okay this is okay are you in your drone yes i'm gonna land you'll never know imagine if you could land crypt on his drone i'll just fly about that would be awesome just stand on your own drone and fly yourself around you might be so cool listen you just you take hair up there you find them you'll find them one way or the other i'm trying if they shoot at me or the drone one way or the other you'll find them i'm gonna be honest with you you blended pretty well like i don't even see you i mean you know i can see myself right [Laughter] yeah i forgot about that it's still zero yeah there are no squads near us wait was this this rope wasn't here i don't think was this rope here i don't think so he was on the other side this is him getting can you open the door go in here brother that whole time i thought we were chasing a solo pathfinder i had a fan yeah because those two guys were instead i wasn't sure ex champions when we were fighting the other two oh that was funny you open the door nice holy okay 25 kills
