hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the charge of rifle which is i believe the only sniper on apex that i haven't used on the channel recently i've become a bit of a sniping fan or sniping aficionado as of late and the charge rifle is probably my second favorite in the game there is something so satisfying about hitting someone for 90 and it doesn't hurt that this is a heat scan weapon as well before we get into today's video though a word from our sponsors this is the new lenovo legion 5 15-inch laptop powered by windows 10 and it is incredible it features a ryzen 7 8 core processor and an rtx 3070 gpu which is impossible to get right now with every purchase of the laptop comes a free one month trial of xbox game pass which has access to over 100 high quality games and i don't know if you guys have been keeping up with the gaming news over the last year or so but microsoft have invested heavily into new gaming studios and have bought out some of the biggest gaming development companies in the world like bethesda and id software and the place to enjoy all the new gaming content is xbox's game pass playable on pc and xbox consoles game pass has some incredible games like forza and of course the halo series there is no more capable machine for your game pass demands than the lenovo legion 5 laptop the specs of this beast speak for themselves but a laptop's performance isn't just based on the plug and play components one of the most important aspects of a laptop's capabilities and longevity are its cooling system and power distribution and this is where lenovo keeps raising the bar the legion cold front 3.0 system keeps the laptop cool whilst gaming and jawburn technology helps direct power where it's needed most based on the game that you're playing for ultimate efficiency my laptop here is a 165 hertz full hd display which is higher than the monitors that i usually play on on my desktop setup the lenovo legion 5 pro comes with the world's first 16-inch qhd gaming display at 165 hertz if you want to learn more about the lenovo legion 5 then be sure to check out the link in the description i am incredibly excited to play halo infinite on day 1 of release on my lenovo legion 5 laptop on the xbox game pass and i'm sure you guys are as well once again thank you to lenovo legion and microsoft for sponsoring today's video uh where are you landing right now i think wait i need to slowly heal okay you should i'll play more passive just yell at me i'll give it a go let's go i have no sniper but he says he pads in no no i'm only joking wait i don't know if i ever i don't know if i've walked into that but apparently i did i think he like launched in the air came down and hit us he invested in the future okay just no audio in this guy it's cool there's just two on me don't have a charge rifle mate please don't do that okay oh yeah yeah i can't climb that recharging shield picked up our friend's banner so many people yeah yeah my genius or what kind of war i'm gonna run back up yeah yeah i don't know if you see anyone come back i will no i'm gonna do that nice energy okay showing the other way darn it reloading yeah yeah i haven't got to use my charge rifle i'm much in four story giving my shields friends i love the charge honestly i really do and i've used every sniper on my channel recently apart from the charge i still think you're lying i still don't believe it no it's fun satisfying like that's just the weirdest sense of humor ever why i don't know i just feel like you're lying stealth pad nice yeah i'll never know no one else can use it nope i'm saving my rope so we can get to the top pretty quick if you want done nice i was awesome uh see the thing you don't know is that you're literally never going to get signed to g2 if you if you do that again you're in your last warnings right now oh seven how weak are they different there's a difference yeah i thought i thought it was the same team that's my bad two teams that's a [Music] took out costume enemy there's they were like right next to each other when i first walked over it's so weird slightly annoying uh they're coming up i've got bag i'm for 70 so for your life you know where this lifeline is uh yeah that's definitely a different team this classic team is super passive look good if you keep backing up i'm gonna recover you with a charge if he gets like in there or like drop down or something yeah 68 i'm going to come get you i got you friend you really want to kill back thank you sir one minute i'm gonna grab whatever said recharging i broke him as well okay no i don't yeah i don't either i'll played this dude i died like at the first time i died it's just because i want like a hundred people are you pink so far in the corner i found my package over here i there has oh this is a lifeline again nice please help me find my charge rifle easier i'm not with you i got the last one on me let me just come real quick level was up top horizon speed oh i'll change them though pathfinder i don't know x1 on the path reloading that's interesting yep they're gonna have a lot of loot um free my secondary charge rifle sorry i was gonna punch i was gonna no no no no no i like that's when there's a knockdown whenever there's a knockdown that happens oh is that what it is yeah because it just locks down onto the on the knockdown guys really annoying i'm leaving there with seven kills and 1200 damage too like i can be on the game and it's just not let's see what's on this left side here by the way i have one next okay yeah yeah that's him in here a small song reset hard reset yeah yeah i need to pop this med kit come on come on scan for like a split i think second occupied up here slap top still yeah bloodhounds is one you stand as well surviving so many people down up there thank you nice thank you this one was mine i want mine back i've got a one times on a on a oh across the way i'm literally like no scoping a charge rifle to kill people here it's great i saw that that was great two bats let's go i have uh i have eight syringes i got a digi just chilling in my inventory just five and now do we send this no do some uh do some damage with your charger i'll try even our crackling they're going to bat though intimidated i mean you could get on the rope and i can just poke from here a little bit and then i can join you um well let me know once you hit uh one's here like uh something something worthy they're dropping a replicator 30 30 is ending definitely took all the cells from there but there's a seven in here nice i'd love one bag like that i can't see over there three times now yeah i actually can't even see over there do you mind if i farm before okay i'm really close i want sixteen hundred yeah yeah boost some numbers come on those are rookie numbers two let's go mate that's what i'm talking about just 1999 more of those my 4k badge almost there just keep working i mean it's this team and another team so it's that we have to sort of go that way yeah i think we might need to do it soon so i suggest you hit a fat 30 and then i'll push there you go there you go i have another pad too i'm going to go left i'm going to add like right here i'll go left i'm gonna try and distract for you because i'll stay on the rope i don't even know if they know i'm on the road i don't think they do well they're not challenging anymore they're not peeking you hear that dirty and they're shook and then i hit a full head shot and they were just like one time see if they hit me once i hit them they had to use all their cells or bats or something yeah they're probably out of loot already don't see them other one's almost broken so annoying yeah they thought they could hold us but they couldn't they didn't even keep an eye on us no they didn't even try to hold us i find this zoomed in throws me off so much in this game like i can like zoom in my sensitivity goes instantly to hip fire sensitivity so i can spin around like this but like keep the scope basically you know what i mean on card it would be like a smooth transition because they have like an abs and a hip fire since it looks sensitivity right yeah but like even like you know when you're zooming in that sensitivity should be gradual because i'm zooming in i don't know how to explain oh yeah oh he wants to box me i'm not ah just come no it's all you mate whacking one just like come on man ah no no boxing you didn't earn it you didn't know anything he's popping up i'm so sorry i'm sorry dude but i'm so tired of boxing like i got bored of boxing a long time ago we tried to let him know that we were there to scrap you know it's only fun when they're trying to run away and they don't yes exactly wait it's only fun when it's not ironic i feel bad but no boxing around here bless him [ __ ] he's just wacky he's probably so he's probably so mad but i'm just like i want to get that game over with dude come on
