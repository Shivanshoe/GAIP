every sigasi to reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in the background I'm going to be showing you clips from the apex legends season for assimilation gameplay trailer now the trailer is juiced drafts and he showed off some huge change to the map I showed a new legend in action and one confirmed new weapon The Sentinel sniper but also what looks to be a different gun coming to the game as well this isn't confirmed I've got some titanfall 2 gameplay randomly shown in the middle of this video just to show you what gun this actually may be in the trailer so I think the major thing to talk about here is the new map changes because there are a fair few and they are huge so I read into the changes on EA's websites and it appears as though respawn have made many of the changes towards edge with reducing third party and gunfights in mind and this has been a problem the community is voiced in the past I'm sure many people are very happy to hear that so let's take a look at the biggest changes here this is the first one that was shown in the trailer and you're familiar with my apex legends videos I'm sure you're almost sick of me landing here on this building here on the left of all shouting scrap it's all cities my friends there's some good news because the building is gone and in its place is a huge chasm which splits Wald's edges biggest drop into and here's another angle from the EA website you can actually see the main building I love and learn - in the background it's it's gone it's completely got destroyed my friends it's no longer there the lava flow that you can see splitting a capital city into is caused by the planet harvester which is Hammond robotics invention which gathers resources from various planets you can see it in the background on the screenshot and there's more on that in a little bit here so EA's website says that they essentially split this area into two separate zones of placed a landing and loot fragment east and a fragment west and also that the large efficie can only be crossed in two locations a zip line or a fallen skyscraper breach this allows teams from breathing room to control one side after the drop reducing the risk of running into third parties from the other side of the city fortune for me though I play Pathfinder and more octane recently and both these legends should be finding creating their own ways to cross these lard Peter of Doom in the mid of capital city however falling into the lava isn't as punishing as it might sound you may think that you're just gonna fall to your death and your death box will appear on top field team or to try and respawn you if they can if you haven't left out of pure embarrassment of falling in the lava but this isn't actually what happens respawn thought this was too punishing instead you take 25 damage from the intense heat coming from the lava but the hot air actually carries you to the other side of the fissure you can travel very slowly they describe it as and also interestingly here in third-person so it sounds like you can cross the fissure if you want to but you're taking a huge risk it's been and falling to your death however and in many cases if there are only two ways across this this lava pit of doom which includes a falling skyscraper and one zipline it may actually be safer to take the slow option so the new area to look at in season 4 is going to be the planet Harvester you cannot miss this it's a giant piece of machinery just safe of capital city and the red beam from this place of interest can actually be seen across the map so newer players will have an added sense of direction to help them navigate wards edge the planet harvest is described as multi levels and it's unlike anything else we've seen on walls h respawn say that the fights are largely self-contained as squads will tend to enter the fight through the long hallways that lead to the center of this structure they should make third parties more predictable and easy to defend against this is the third time they've mentioned reducing third party on wards edge they must have identified it as a problem maybe they heard the feedback from the community where it seems like you get into a gunfight and then the third party just turns up and shoots you in the back hopefully these areas are more defendable so you can see people coming and you can defend against it so hopefully the third parties aren't as much of a problem actually sounds like Watson and the caustics favorite place to land on obviously I'll show you some gameplay from this place in the background or at least what I believe is going to be from the plenty harvester I can't be too certain here caustic hasn't actually had a place on more debt to convey to penis candy I barely see a Korsak being played on this map but I saw it quite offered on the old map so I definitely want to try him I definitely play McGann and land plan a half step and just so trapped away in this plan half see if they're gonna make loads of hallways I'm gonna put my mug a straps at the doorways and then everyone screwed McGrew that enters that place so the next area to look at is going to be the survey camp so this is a point of interest in the snowy fields near the northern part of boards edge is between skyhook and the epicenter which of the big icy pylon of doom so it's a smaller place of interest that will create better rotations for players who aren't landing in some of the busiest areas of the map this new area may seem a lot less intriguing but it does have something new to apex legends weapon racks so these are guaranteed weapon spawns on racks in the small buildings of the survey camp these are the same ones from the training and firing range modes and response days that they should give players who prioritize a good weapon over a premier drop a new decision to make so it's actually nice to have an area where you know you can land and get a weapon because I'm sure we've all had that fist region of dropping somewhere evening some of the high tea and loot areas you can be struggling to find a weapon these images by the way all look like they have a red tint to them probably because of the lava fissures and the red light beaming from the plane harvester so world's edge might have more of a red tint to it now from now on so before we go into the new legend and the new confirmed weapon in season 4 I want to talk about a bit of speculation here and it is just that theses speculation I thought it was a new gun when I first saw the trailer but I haven't played much of time for two so whilst I was making this video I downloaded it on PC in the background to check myself and a lot of people on reddit speculated that this weapon was called the car fortunately you can spawn him with his weapon right from the get-go in titanfall 2 so I'm going to give you a side-by-side comparison of the weapon that we see in the trailer and then the weapon you could spawning on on titanfall 2 okay so the guns don't have the same iron sights but this could have been changed the gun from the trailer does sound more like an Arthur one however the recoil definitely looks more like an SMG unless the person shooting was moving their aim a lot I'm not sure this I'm not throwing shade because they did hit shots I'm just saying that it looked like out recoil that's it now I'm not gonna leave this with any definitive statement because I'm not gonna risk it so I'm gonna leave it up to you guys to decide you can have a discussion in the comments if you like because I am not 100% sure myself keep in mind that they have often teased weapons in trailers like these for future releases months in advance these could be in as a hint so it could be a skinned r31 or a non I tonight and I'm focusing on the wrong things on this trailer I'm not sure my friends so on to the actual confirmed new gun coming into apex legends this Easter Center now it's a bolt-action charged-up sniper rifle and this is the first gameplay that we've seen of it immediately you can see sort of a weird reload animation at the start here and it goes into the bolt-action sniper animations we are more familiar with right after so we know that this gun has a charged mechanic which can be stored in the weapon which may explain the first part of the of taking the wires out of the gun it looks like it's gonna be even more powerful in the craver it may not be but it may turn out to be the most powerful gun that you can find on the floor on wards edge so moving on this is one of the most exciting parts best season for the new legend okay it's not forged that guy's dead he got stabbed in his first interview my video explaining his abilities is completely worthless its revenant the first footage we see of him here shows us placing what looks to be a beacon which I assumed to be his ultimate just because of what it does this beacon when in contact with a teammate or revenant himself noticed that his teammates are fine they look normal before they make contact with his beacon but as soon as they do make contact it looks like it transforms them into a shadow also notice how octane was taken out by one shot whilst in midair a revenant then throw is what I assumed to be his basic ability on a team on a building in Capitol City the enemy team looks stunned they probably take some damage and the ability remains in the same place on top of the building the effect that he does to the enemy team I'm not entirely sure it's worth noting that Pathfinder can still use his grapple whilst in the shadow form and I think that turning into a shadow puts you at a 1-shot State and you also have the climbing abilities just like the limited time mode that we played on Kings Canyon on Halloween if you are shots whilst in that shadow form I assume that you just return back to the beacon it wouldn't make too much sense to turn your entire team into one-shot shadows and then you just die you know that would seem ridiculously underpowered so this seems like one of the best legends we've seen introduced to apex legends he speeds his team up you get these crazy climbing abilities he looks like one of the coolest characters on the game already his finishing move looks incredible and he also has this outrageous skin highlighted at the end of the trail here as well all around revenant looks like possibly one of the best legends that we've seen on this game I'm not sure what his passive would be though because we've seen what appears to be he's ultimate and his ability but again I'm not sure what his passage could be he seems like an assassin type of character if you're camping on one of the buildings in Capitol City this guy's gonna throw his ultimate Dame and he's going to cloak the side of your building and stabbed in the back just like you did to forge if you guys have any speculation of what revenants passive could be you can leave them in the comments down below I hope that it hasn't been linked already because all the comments are going to be the same so those are my first reactions and
