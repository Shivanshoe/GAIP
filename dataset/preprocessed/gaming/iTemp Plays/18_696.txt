my eyes i'm the eyes in the sky i'm repairing myself that's the great thing about twitch chat is like when i stream you you cannot you don't miss anything they'll tell you 100 you can't remember where something is they'll let you know real quick they will oh god are you huge crap to the next bro first you're grappling yourself off the map with the world's biggest grapple and then you have a little floppy guy like that i got a little together get it together yeah we're kill leader that's all that matters all right i keep finding p20 20s and sentinels shotgun here that's the god combo you charge it up then you hammer point them yeah thanks what are you doing why are you complaining ironically that's what people would tell me honestly i'm trying to switch the same i'm doing it i am yeah

believe you at all oh my god okay yeah a hundred percent res me res me res me i'm probably not a phoenix oh it's stinky that fire is cranking cells right now i'm lagging so bad okay rich see that mate yeah yeah you don't even need me shields are recharging is that thanksgiving gross man yeah once thank god because i started lagging horde is this one landed i've got my auto solo i don't know what's happening maybe that's maybe that's a mistake i'm making here oh there's more there's more in here wait come in on your building on top or inside maybe what's inside nice the bridge is just tossing up one clipper since the pancakes your friend i just punched him that was good that's funny thank you you gotta know what's happening i'm just rubber banding everywhere dude the biggest brain have you punched them off the building no i was trying i thought he might go near the edge that would have been so good bro you are cooking where did this come from i don't know uh only six but i had two before this little engage i've just been landing oh right here right here wait what i'm i know that look at look at me jinx look at that look at this thing what's happening he's trying to he's trying to set a trap bro what's going on here no i think he's just giving you loot i think i know i think he was gonna sit over there in the corner and try and set a trap or maybe he maybe he is trying to go to sleep it's gotta be the teammate of the two you just killed come here come here buddy uh i'll take it you got no okay one shield bat there's another shield behind me if you fancy oh i'm nice you just left i don't know he just gave you all the loot and just put it do you need any shieldbacks i got two up i don't get anything they try to kill me and then they put me on twitter and then when they and then when they can't kill me they drop all their stuff and try to box like no you lost your chance good or bad i can't believe he just left i honestly think he was gonna try and set us up he was gonna like try and trap us maybe he was i don't yeah because he didn't drop his guns right his guns were still on him yeah oh no no no because his boxers disappeared so he oh no he had nothing on him nevermind oh that big scrapping yeah right on me firing what so far right that whole thing so far what i'm level miles inside bro you guys are absolutely cooking it went from item tossing on one clipper since for free then we got so far with the double tap scout uh i think this is the first time i've ever used it in my entire apex career rich he didn't miss the bullet every single double tap on that entire team what have i been doing have i been missing out should i be using this gun this is i'm i'm really happy that i'm spectating this great commentary great reset from me i mean i needed it this is what we should do every time next time i'm gonna throw myself we got to bring back gladiator boys you ever i don't think you two have been been a part of gliding i did i did it without the first time i ever played with you and um was you and finicky and we we we had done it what's we did yes yeah so hard i was so sad i choked all right all right let me explain the rules of gladiator i i i like to do this so when you're playing pubs if you're three stacking when you get to the last squad like right now you cannot team against them you have to 1v3 the last squad so you take turns and if you 1v3 them i mean you win gladiator and if you lose well you lost and then you gotta let the full team heal it's got to be fair and then you reset the fight you go back so it's so hard i i thought i was going to be able to do it really easily and i remember i was the last one to go i was with bain and i just got destroyed 153 so tough obviously it all depends on the team because it's like if they're holding hands oh my god that's hard it's that's the thing like it's easier in the middle of a game because it's more linked this is the last spot too hmm oh my god that's right i'm doing it back you're just sending him a message yeah yeah okay i can't really 99's i'm going to send you a video rich this is what you remind me of okay i feel like once blue evo sorry shout out all over you i can't believe it i cracked him yeah they're playing charging what you guys been up to oh slicing the wrong way they're partying they're pouring away dude what a bunch of weirdos they're just trying to go zone oh man yeah just the fact that they're playing like that's gonna make it really hard it's not gonna be fun not gonna be holding hands yeah well we got classic that's all it matters honestly i'm dropping i'm picking up this 99 i think i'm gonna need it do you need um do you need batteries um i have three okay it's not bad there's so much light out on here holy cow never seen so much i know where are these where are these boys coming from all right right here i think he dropped down oh my god that's really though it's broken i'm popping to bed peace i'm gonna try and sneak up a little bit get some shots as well lifeline they're in this building it's like i'm doing this anymore where's this last boy i don't know i think they're terrified of us because they're caustic what a way to end it wrench a big 204 on him i kind of yank that but i don't get interviews by the way oh jesus guys oh my god oh it's you guys are absolutely frying anybody you looked at just got exploded are the apex i'm surprised we won that last that last fight two i can't believe you clutched up at the start like you just had to face three teams by yourself pretty much oh i forgot that that was the game yeah the same game
