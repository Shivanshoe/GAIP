hey guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now if you've been watching me recently you will know that i've had some problems with my controller uh with my ping button on my controller to be specific which is also one of the two buttons you have to press in combination to use your ultimate on apex legends finally that controller died and now i'm on the backup which turns out has a faulty ping button but this time i can't ping at all and to use my ultimate i have to reach up to my keyboard and press z it's horrendous but we did get the job done despite that i have a great game here for you today lots of ups lots of downs thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh it's got no name i was going to say the name of the place it is my friends but this place has no name no wonder i can think of it here we go this is the uh the setup of champions the charge rifle re-45 famous combination used across the earth uh so i've decided to stay on pathfinder can i stick with the charge rifle am i doing it is this happening i think it's happening uh i want a third party the uh scraps of city fight that's what i want to do i'm gonna sort of head over this way i figured that i can actually use my ultimate if i just um if i just press z on my keyboard so i should be fine i'm going over this way friends you can't hear me but those are the comms i got a charge rifle and a dream gonna pop a bubble in my face like that look at him looking at me yeah yeah i know look at him hey back it up i don't care about the autumn i was crouching right these times are getting beat up so i can't see because of the smoke unfortunately someone's over there i think i'm climbing on me it's my teammate where did the fight go i think that how did two teams just wander off into the sunset like that absolutely beamed in for a total of 12. so i needed to rank up my shield though drugs on him that's all i wanted to do uh i'm gonna get involved hello nice job that's huge they're reviving all right she all the way down jump down there we go i've been up with the two times on my vault it didn't all right new controller vibes with the wingman let's see if i can make this work probably not absolutely not i've been i've been destroyed i've been cancelled i've been naded there's a whole lot of emotions going on right now all right everyone chill out we can kill these guys easy i just need an extended energy mate that's all nice teammate i mean i can't see anything i will show the digi got one of them yeah i love being stuck for 35 minutes on the smallest ledge you've ever seen here with something that's one down but there's a seer from a different team what does it mean to those valkyries just like floating around on top of the lava like that i can't even tell my teammates there's a there's a fight going on over here i think they're just looting because they need to which is fine we've been in a big scrap list a new controller still getting used to it okay we're warming up i need an extended energy so bad i'm looking for an extended energy magazine please help during the days you could ping that was some good times they were the good old days you know hold on i've got an idea oh my word look at this look at this i'm a genius i ain't for about seven i think there's someone underneath me still they're finishing the kill he's over here i tried to ping please don't beat me thank you that's a whole different team there's another squad attacking opening fire on the enemy oh we need to fall back we're getting pinched we're getting pinched we're getting pinched my teammates don't know it i've got to try and help him this might be a solo i'm so bad i'm so bad new controller new controller and bangalore passive not my fault okay we all me sometimes i don't hear anything about it listen everyone has those days what i'll do is i'll cut a few frames and say i was lagging and it looks like i was lagging too it's kind of genius but then i'd also have to cut out this part of me talking about it which is uh oh well absolutely recharging shields there we go look at that that was the last one beamed my vault which is good considering we have a bangalore on the team any big hills whatsoever i mean i'll take these you have 123. i've got less than you i need energy oh but he's got a divo i see the problem any battery nose for the boy any bats no zero batteries i could always ask any bats oh zero thank you okay can i hear me no no please thank you oh that's huge oh that's even bigger thank you thank you fellow father let's trade him using anything hey offspring hey i'm not going to mess with he's fire and he's deaf so i can't i'm at least listen that's great you know you keep hold of that oh three's more than enough thank you to the big gibster i don't know where he got 18 how many if you could share those four and he pinged another one for the bangalore how many did he have you know you're probably looking at 12 bats plus minimum i'm still i'll be honest with you that bangladesh with about seven shots of the wing man he's living in my head rent-free at the moment trying to i almost hope we die in this game so i don't have to post that one so i'm not proud of you i'm taking a risk though new controller using a wingman like what kind of maniac does that you know if you're gonna play it safe you'd use you know i'll throw one flat line something like that but a wee man in close proximity less than one minute you gotta respect the the courage right it sounds like the longest the furthest away gunfight ever that everyone's just tap firing i'm gonna hold my team across hang on said i can tell this video that i played mouse and keyboard too because i did technically i think we just keep our high ground here don't get impatient these guys aren't really doing anything if we rush a team we're gonna get pinched shields someone killed him we show someone killed him 64. inside the whole of the gangs here i'm getting absolutely beaten up i'm gonna try and sit up top and just try and poke with these guys with the wing man target practice to get useless controller that's today's game plan it's got i think he's got a turbo devo which is just just crazy did you beat me is it being tough no well if i'm gonna pop a bat i want this back everyone chill beating me but my teammates are way closer i guess i'm sitting on the train tracks you know saw my mistake can i get away with this everyone chill i'm playing this that lasts like two minutes i'm playing like a big noob i need to get out of my own head sorted out i'm here man got him any bats behind us too we just eliminated he might be sell frozen if he's selfish and i'm finishing the med kit then i'll still win he's fine i think he might be self-raising listening that was huge dawning now i have to post it you are the apex please definitely stressed i'm stressed what can that car's g is bad it's tough to use sometimes okay there we go nearly 3 000 damage 11 kills didn't ping once for the boys not one time wasn't my fault it wasn't my fault gg is all round one kill for 1300 damage bless him definitely deserve more than that i am fire i am death you've been scammed by me 11 kills let's go
