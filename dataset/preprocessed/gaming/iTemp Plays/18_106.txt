hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing a legend who i think is massively underrated in public games you could say gibby but i think everyone knows that gibby's good but everyone agrees that it's not too fun to play compared to the movement legends it is indeed ash who has gone slightly under the radar considering you see her a decent amount in both the predator lobbies and also even in professional tournaments as well her ultimate is so good you can maneuver your entire team to high ground you can remaneuver in gunfights you'll see a few times in the game today that i used it and you punish the gunfight but you can also use it defensively i often use it to try and get teammates who are down out of there with the assault team there's actually a lot of fun to play and i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i don't have a gun shields i don't know if anyone else landed here i definitely did not really okay i'm just in the middle [Music] whoa him bats oh let me use my passive when i get back in i'll let you know where they're fighting it sounds like uh a like yourself right i think there's something like yeah in the middle i don't see any let's go oh there's the finest likes like right now all things here close range right now right now right now right now uh wait an excellent selection all right i'm on the way i've actually got some pretty good stuff i have a gold havoc so so we've won nice you know big win forget i said anything is here finding them if you knew i was here though i got a bad angle so i might not be able to pick the same time we're coming up though yeah they're going to this little compound okay wonder how many heats that'll get i try and play safe i've only got white could you be respawning throwing frag open oh that need 70 hp closed door these ties bind healing i'm gonna save this side sure you're running okay i'm gonna loot then oh they're respawning the way these two by the way just over here enemy far off on my way 27 people left is olympus the best map ever or other vibes what we're saying i mean we've definitely died like nine times in a row off spawn so this is bound to happen right that's true extended light magazine here level two they just run oh yeah yeah yeah yeah they did it holds up after [Music] let's push you in a bind reach out do we have a look from this angle maybe yeah we're gonna have to i'm going up the other side i think i think they just went up this side i think the other two are over here on this side all right let me see what they are hold on up i mean probably estates right i don't see any it was a while ago so we might catch him on the inside you know rotating oh wait imagine if you could whilst you're in the car and oh and it takes the whole car something interesting taking damage this one up there with you i think i have a 38 energy okay kind of dumb bad there's no no no no no no no no no no that's why that's fine just kidding oh you oh mate yeah i'm a good guy oh you're being greedy thank you where are those shots at oh just this way drawers down here marked my next location the ring is near i think 45 seconds out to the left out of this yeah so yeah 30 seconds on zone ah we're fine i wanted to have it close for 30. big ups i don't need any heavy ammo here an enemy did either have gold or not going um i don't think so you guys go go either way i went to the right is that bad it's good time ah unbelievable you're just a big loser oh i'm over here sharing energy right here energy like a little baby to marvin i'm saying let me talk to me uh two marvin arms in there i've just dropped them dropping marvin armstrong and i didn't think of i'm a demon behind us reloading shields are depleted where's this last time and i'm back in the game this guide about 300 bahts move this way the ring is near conservatives remain yeah they had all the bats they had all the bats on this map i think charging on my shields i'm gonna use the batman recharging rings in our neighborhood it's that point in the game where you're scared to stand still for too long you're gonna get craved you know oh it'll happen got my ultimate ready to fly comparison we're inside the next ring superior positioning i had two gold guns this game and i don't have them i got rid of them that's weird how's your other goal then i had a prayer at the start of the game and i'm tied with it and i couldn't be bothered to go back and then i just had to have it yeah tried it target spotted far off they will beat that oh they're crazy should i miss asheville meet me here some of the windows down low come on come on it's tragedy recharging shields he's dropping he did this earlier moving we killed this team earlier charging on my shields keep shooting at me trying to get you back are you down reloading cutting the face that's the team that killed me at uh finite by the way oh really yeah how about your maniacs you are the apex champions nice nice nice
