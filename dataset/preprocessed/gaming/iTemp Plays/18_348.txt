hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the 30 30 repeater not one of my favorite guns on the game but for some reason this game i was actually popping off with it i was going to drop it but i just destroyed the first team with it so i had to give it a go now i haven't really used it since the buff a few weeks ago which increased the projectile speed and also decreased the charge time by 30 for those high damage shots and it was definitely helping i can't even diss this gun in future because one it's actually pretty good but also this was my new damage record across every single game of apex that i've ever played at over four and a half thousand damage and it was with the 30 30 believe it or not now i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends but they've learned to run away to play for rp a lot of them yeah i think i don't know i can't really see it too much because i don't play rank like i used to like yeah i rank anymore but just knowing what other people are dealing with it's like i don't know i just i'll pass cracks over there she really wants to challenge me like that what a psycho i should be okay [Laughter] i'm gonna go back to arcane oh yeah i can't yeah i don't like being slow it's just the worst especially when your teammates playing like a bathroom in octane like i can hear someone right next to me all right well there you go and says there's nobody here you've been scammed i scan again cracked as well i can't hate this guy all right enough is enough oh it's our teammate oh run over trying to make this 30 30 work and i tell you what i actually did some damage there very three times during my shift i'll level one helmet it's just one of those guns really hit or miss yeah definitely it's really easy to be bad with this gun because the recoil is like it doesn't have much recoil but i feel like it doesn't reset very quick oh yeah yeah look there i need to take my time i think wait he's going back 57 in the octane uh those guys at the start i was just quick scoping him it was great i mean yeah unexpected results from the dirty 30. you're rich and he did get a buff oh there we go oh and the mag let's go i'm hoping for a bat out of this swimming and loot now take here oh mate well it seems to be on you someone's shot them i think there's a yeah i know they're shooting me there's like eight people over there yeah yeah dude it's kind of pop push hands good hands i cracked two oh my god there's no way you are my hero i don't know what's going on i know where this guy went another team i need to back up i need to heal this guy's on me he made it out the door this week i hit some more

push us and the middle team is gonna come in and we're all gonna die exactly what happened i self rest mate i've actually just destroyed these guys yeah pop that finisher to get your shield back i destroyed you run away after after you pop back hopefully they just keep flying for a bit thank you yeah i'm gonna go grab batteries i don't know if they're pushing still sitting now they're still fighting as you can probably hear one team's just made one team's where we were oh really yeah so we're good for a while perfect any guns around here i have a mozam honestly if i left now and ran there i could probably just get my old stuff back i'm gonna craft one back i'll join you in the view ryder die friend oh we're good we're good okay wait why am i dropping those four don't shoot me
