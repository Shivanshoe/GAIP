Hey whatcha guys eat rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some or apex legends of course and today we are using two SMGs well I suppose the re 45 is a business and G of anything but they both receive buffs in the recent season 5 patch now they are the re 45 and the alternator now they aren't huge books these guns are supposed to be on the lower end of the power scale they're not going to be able to compete with the likes of a pub mag r99 or fully auto prowler in the SMG category however the increase in power that they received filk on mice and I mean you can't compete with those guns if you're stuck with them for a little while to start they're both received increased magazine sizes and the re 45 actually got a slight damage increase from eleven to twelve and this may sound like a tiny change but it now takes two fewer shots to kill someone from 200 health with a re 45 now which is kind of a big deal really so again I have to you here please do not judge it off kill count alone that kills will low but these these temps were not my team and I were both pretty much involved in every club early got along the way and we ended up with even damage and a total of 17 kills it was still a load of fun to play and it's a good game to watch as well my teammate by the way is the same as in yesterday's video ending in many of the intro we've seen we actually want a game together and then I decided just to invite him so he could team up it's a solid player I've got really good team work together and we'll play him really well I think I'll do that more in future rather than risking it running solos all the time so shout out to him because he was a massive help such a good team playing of Sigma and the videos that we play together so thanks for watching I do appreciate it in RC ball in five and a half seconds my friends containment to this mimimi goes nearly forgot the name with this place then daddy's take you've got the moment because there's someone else they're chasing me that's a flat line I'm alive I'm alive oh my word the bridgehead must've just thought i teleported away but my bracelet got stuck on the enemy I don't even know what it was on the side of the building and I just teleported in plates I must beat the boss sloper of all time I'm telling you my Lobos act actually horrendous my bracelet skills that non-existent give me now what I think was fluff presently along with the alternator which is right here thank you very much yeah let's go merci skies up they should have killed us when they had the chance to Alec I'm just pines on there listen at lunch or by downloading said it was fine me when I have nothing and he's reviving don't nice what am i doing you might have to eat right back you've never done properly alright weird start of with ab meets a real weird start but we're still breathing which is nice mad furious I think the attorneys all right but I'm gonna try and do this game is use the alternator as like my main assault rifle yeah on the way I need to shoot someone I think I've done about eight damage survive this game I found two fairly bad bracelets and that's been the that's been the start be broke I have no idea what this is I think Dutch named River sensor essentially y6o what I'm not sure that was the team that we could hear okay I'm here we go three things I can eat Papa helmet purple stocking Bop well one time so you have 45 seconds until the ring closes I don't talk about this I am deep worst Lobo on the game guarantee but I'm not gonna give up people I'm not giving up on Lobo target over there we're all outside the ring and the wall of death is coming our way oh my what they've running happy - nice nice to assist doesn't matter if the teamwork that counts on top of us all right well at least I won't talk me to our wants to go I gotta say you know how I used to write my grapples and that just got right to my bracelet frozen and so far we've heard a 0 out of 10 a 2 out of 10 and that one was made like a four you know it's not looking good so far well we'll get it like a six out of ten this is brown money that's the goal six out of ten what we got your battery I've got no kills biodiverse Monson the finality nice tickled I got a kill why did it team unbelievable swings here not a problem that's four assists that's okay as I said team up to face the alternates that just seemed like a bit of a assist kind of weapon you know it's fairly weak the damage per shot isn't high it's fairly slow fire rate it's just that the alternator is oh god I have Sony make its to its L reliable as they would say in in Spain and they do say that because there's recourse non-existent and that's why I'm gonna try and use this game as I said before there's like a sort of like my saw right here that make sense what did you pick the light I'm a backup they do compete thanks Frank very much appreciate I was allowance okay website re I don't know why they drop mine to begin with both of these both of these guns have been buffed the re had a magazine size booth and a damaged birth an alternator I believe had a magazine size book as well I got all that in intro of course but I wanted to try both of these guns ace give him a second shot may 12th Rome in the same video but they all Tainter are you 45 set up hey stop stealing my stuff it's stealing my stuff from Mike hell with my ultimate I've never seen cheap I can't even believe do not let these thieves get away with it if there's one thing that logo just not stand for it's feasible I'm sure it's all the character Levi he's stuck in a storm well here with you we rollin lives we have a lifetime supply of Medicaid's over here unless you stole them all hey Pekin fans running don't see him in the shrubbery Oh must be supremely wait how did we let them get away with it friends how on earth did we let them get away with you they stole our stuff and off they're flying to the sunset park out and drops on me lent we're good but they have gone Herick in the first guy was fairly weak he's prodigious ran safe quick easy this way there's no I he wants to mess about in the storm will probably seem over this way somewhere I got your lame-o as well don't worry I mean I struggling myself but are you blue Evo shield me you barely even better than the guy with no shields incredible finish your move behind that icon here on I'm good thanks I mean this is why we're struggling on light ammunition though did you did you have any more money chance resign your boy strip we got three light and more smg's on the team seconds and the next rings are right there let's get to settle damage with an SMG that range not too shabby he's got one too he knows I'm both about fifty four times here actually so easy to learn shot a teaspoon there isn't there is nothing on the screen stopping from landing shots I sometimes have a difficult time with the UVI 99 sometimes because if you mix with that gun by the time you're back on target you're pretty shot like 13 times like the fire IT super creamy soup really fast sometimes way too fast absolutely borderline disgusting I'll admit what supply of shield sells and so maybe I should have taken the gold shield consider I've got so many shield cells and syringes here that's what you want that's the combo with the gold shields quite as many if I find more shield batteries though I can drop these shields hours it's just horrendous we're now if she'll like healer boss when your body red Evo's have one shield battery I've got a coach for me horse all right there are three but the teams left kind of somehow I only have three kills I don't know how this has happened but we need to fix it something here needs to change and these people are scrappy friends close that's that's you right I can eat dirt wow that's a fence then sleeve that I shot and not as close up of way I saw your way further back friends in Mexico then I mine right away what's true well struggle yeah I'm gonna arm switch just so I have enough time someone makes it on for me and I can always come back after then I'm rushing this type rave enough time then it's pretty the best thing to do that because otherwise if your planner she'll batter on you're ready though there I think you kind of struggling it's on Russia she let the public's anyone you find a different team here be careful it seems flying about the place because it's a preteen of my team is far enough it's gonna be careful I have a safe here that's one of them he's done that a long but look it wasn't a school piece a headshot [Music] I'm 16 Thanks - three dispense I don't like it nice marriage after zero said again I'm so bad you can't climb it to make that whooshing me three two seconds you just one guy I should have turned around and tried to fight him as if you can't get up there like climbing I think I'm too vertical with my Lobert bracelets I should try and throw them 45-degree angles that's obviously the most optimal angle to get the furthest distance I throw them vertically upwards for some reason oh I damages extremely even actually 17 total kills you know what six kills his low bleating feel like a six call game to me I saw for God that I wasn't on that many kills but yes thanks for watching I do appreciate it I'll see war [Music]
