know yeah that little spree that i went on playing gibby loved it the whole time loved it all time you feel you feel the strength and the power like i said it's it's it's like you're an immovable object or what did i say how did i say it or unstoppable force or unmovable object you're i feel bad though just about like i forgot i had an alternator with a digioni in the bank smoke yeah and then as i did it they've just revived and i got the down you work so hard for that damn too i'm definitely yoinking mate i've got 10 kills i'm just shooting people on my wings i found them they're in the air this way i can't ping them that far away they could not be going any further away from us he's one that was a psychological warfare if that's me getting shot like that i know that we're facing a load of psychopaths you know absolutely like what kind of maniac tries to take that shot no scope of the habit i'm going to turn you this guy is going in there they're all cracked i've got i'm nice okay bad oh yeah i'm trying to get to you i nearly cracked the valkyrie no he's nice no it's noise ah quick oh god hemlock i'm playing fuse these guys have played together before the juan clan that kind of rhymes i like it i think that's the thought process that we went into it all right who we got out of here oh god i see the shadows hello that's not gonna be useful to anyone that's huge i must have be here what am i supposed to do here man this is an absolute joke why is my camera like this yeah don't i don't no okay you're dead okay i mean guys this wasn't the technique this really wasn't the technique we're trying to be we're trying a third part like what happened to us you know i'm just gonna get shot on the back of the team they're coming for her but they're gonna capture this let me call stake now they're landing on the ship i said scam i have my ultimate views but now because i switch i don't have my ultimate i think that's a big scam i think i should have my ultimate drugs on you nerds got a frag in there what am i what my frag didn't do anything hello nice all right we're coming back we were only one round down did we win that round huge all right this is the plan um they were the same clan and the octane left where did octane go he left you what's going on he said don't know he rage quit i know what happened he rage quit play this game with that i mean it's just him on that team i think oh no maybe not you died instantly anyway i forgot you're going don't go down oh that's not good that's not good are they behind a piece oh oh that's not good at all ah nah please i want him to try and play a fuse because then quartic fuse we just have massive area denial because lifeline is like she's good for the passive revive but you don't even go down in this mode you just die i said yes we got this we got this huge range coming up let's go team there's some motivational words he said let's go let's go wait was he spawning again over this way i hopped probably too soon all right this is what these guys these guys sit and wait we need to third party this is the plan we need to be close enough so we can oh here we go he's got like an eight times in that bad boy they're not on the ship that on the thing are they was it locked it took this lock to the moment squad on the train these guys might come down now welcome to the pie fuse [Music] we should pop off the train early who whoever is on the train first first dice i wish it gave you your nades back i need some nades here that's huge from the teammate though let's do it that's that we got this come on i thought i obviously showed you on the map hundred meters can i just hop here and i don't want to be on the ship to be honest with you by ship i mean train these guys fight she okay i think that was a whole team so i think we're 2v3 i don't know what team that was because if it's orange team that's bad because now crimson teams are alive oh where's he at though he's down there we don't need a presence on this i think oh he's crimson yes nice good job huge merry christmas amigo that was actually really fun that was really fun i had to pull out the call stick but i think at the start both teams had a core stick but even at the end one of them did right i think oh nice
