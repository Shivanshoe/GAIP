hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are using what i believe to be one of apex's consistently underrated weapons the longbow this gun was op and meta a long time ago and respawn nerfed it accordingly it's still really good and it's always been really good maybe not quite as good as when it was a heavy gun so you could really stack that ammo and you could find the attachments easier but it's so solid especially on storm points so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends please let me down triple bins come on triple bins hello i thought you're going the other one well i got some begins there's an enemy near me she left no please taking shots we needed that kill come on energy [Music] okay i guess did they just pad away get involved team get involved team nice work what the heck's going on extended energy mag here level three i bet we'll find something good here you know where we just came from let us reveal that position and that's the only people there's only people we killed it might come this way we can always fall back to these shields i'm not sure how aggressive these people are gonna be there's an enemy near me barrier here a barrier here let's find it here we go here we go this is glorious this is glorious come on yeah now what oh god no he's right no please don't destroy the shields i can't see that's i think he's trying to kidnap one i guess my shop the attack team of the squad two teams here what the heck's going on here there were two teams over this side the map still and they're like right next to each other i'm really confused the problem is here when you see look you can't see inside properly when you sit out here it's really tough to see people see you are coming home i thought i took a phoenix oh my god careful shoot my teammates oh my god i thought i took the phoenix i got a knife mag i should probably hear them oh nice man they hated me good grief they hated you boy they wanted to seem dead and it was close they nearly did okay i did not expect that many people over this way that was carnage absolute carnage here we go another third party opportunity so close hopefully runs straight to our team mate i could have been yeah i thought he might have gone in there because that's him i didn't see him he was so low with my armor bless him everybody sucks oh they're taking the gravity cannon of doom oh no well they heard us firing i see something and they ran away so i'm quite hopeful okay and i think they might have bumped into people near the side do we take it that's the question oh man i'm lobo so if i need to i can use my bracelet right different way to travel let's make a getaway with this gravity cannon i don't know this is this is the risk but we're going for it it's a while since they used it i guess i know i can do that now i didn't really know before okay teammate trying to whack him in his head i can barely see him nice that's fine definitely more teams like look the mountain up the hill i guess that's a risk taking a fight with someone with the mastiff when i have a longbow at close range fortunately both my shots landed otherwise i'd been screwed magrude a goal 30 30. never seen one before in my entire life i hope i can get some longer-range gunfights so i can use the longbow a little bit here towards the end of the game so i'm hoping that's the case oh no i'm ducking down i'm looking down another team here we go i mean it's another close range fight though that's the problem we're facing can you just climb this oh you can oh this is gonna be this is i don't know if this is the play yeah we want to get out of here that is not the play i'm just gonna get shot by both of them okay i really want that head shot well they have to move in like really soon really soon we've got team behind us as well she probably did that's slightly annoying but not the worst thing to ever happen to us sorry i think the guy used that emp whilst he's in the zone and he just died to me i'm pretty sure what's this happened where else would he go no dodge d let's go solo ow always feels like the charge rifle has done a lot more to you than it actually has we've got 30 seconds to be somewhere else more people this way too they've got a crater so these are the games you want with the sniper with the three times on i think we just oh we can't really sit here not the rock sleepy i'm bouncing up and down the rock don't die oh my god a feeling he can see me we should not have gone that way sometimes you see here we should not have gone that way i know he went down the uh the hole by myself oh no no no no no no please oh i didn't take the heavy take heavy oh it's okay okay yeah she's pretty awake they left me a little lifelong drone too and i don't have do you have many heavy bodies i have 11 spare yeah i have 13 tall thank you i have my ultimate anyway so thanks mate yeah yeah should i just pop my old tail did we just party this yeah right here i don't know okay yeah loads of people landing inside i'll keep the longbow i'm actually gonna oh god this scared me it's all afraid it's just me oh my word yeah i just saw a pathfinder run that way and he wasn't so friendly you know get outside here on me got you oh that's a shield that's the shield that's the shield that's the shield behind us he said yeah he did he said behind us i'm gonna play on your corner careful he's got sheila dude yeah we need to we need to back up so if they're behind us one my controls is connected nice job he's coming into the front door and it's the first for arm switch okay is that coming on you nice the other team is already here rich oh come on we can get behind these if you need too uh [Music] uh very much so dessert uh 700 damage five kills that deserves as far as i'm saying level four i only saw the one you might not have teammates i think i've ride out horizon on the roof did it even five no can be cracked give me cracked nice nice job guys i didn't even see his other two teammates yeah i only saw the bluetooth somebody just came out of nowhere it's probably one of the funniest experiences ever oh there's a team where we just fought where we just fought there's a guy in the bins going on reef [Music] i haven't used my longbow yet i have a long but i haven't been able to fire it recharging my shield oh yeah i mean the opportunity just hasn't arrows i don't have a sniper stock there's a level one sniper stock oh my god yeah i'm deciding i thought they ran back there is a guy right on the door they're gonna red push us probably oh yeah probably hey a path for 110 it's so dark in there another one nice job i think he's on the box again yeah he is i can barely see him i can barely see him up there he said behind us i think he just doesn't want us to get through yeah until the ring closes dude this guy's got a nasty head glitch i'm gonna go loot your or one of these guys and get some more batteries left batteries on the ball yes they're down low and then oh they're revolting they rub off but i think i'm just gonna throw frags at your door and then i'm gonna go loot yep yeah that's the scariest thing i've ever seen oh i need a headshot i hear for 50. what is this nice job i 10 scariest things to run into oh my god i'm blown away that you're playing loba and we're in the end game now and you still haven't found a megaworld to be fair it is me so normally you'd have like eight snot stalks on you you just carry snipers yeah it's like my um like my good luck charm yeah it's all without on back oh they're all on it yeah they were standing still and as soon as i went to shoot they all they maneuvered out of the way that's not the team are behind behind behind i'm coming in nice job one minute until the ring closes and everything you got the last one i want to watch a respawn beacon i'm just gonna keep the pressure up okay all right i'm gonna pull up sounds good i'll play safe i'll just try and snipe they're still they were still on the care package it's three i don't see them moving they're just throwing nades but nowhere near i'm gonna i'm gonna try to get an english a little bit bang one hundred i'm going behind them okay okay yeah i'll play safe still i think they i think they see me they might try to push me so it'll give you a ah storm will handle it good teamwork that's really good on this yeah it's a pathfinder oh i'm looking at decoys mate where'd he go i killed the mirage nice work though huh [Music] fruity ball played
