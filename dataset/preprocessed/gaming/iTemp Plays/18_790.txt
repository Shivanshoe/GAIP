hey guys to treat welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today I've got a little bit of a double whammy for you both games are pretty short so I may as well just throw them together the first game I used to have it and I apologize the reason I used it is because one it's the best gun on the game of the moment and two is because I was so low so I pretty much had to use the gun to stand any chance I didn't realize how much I've actually uploaded with this weapon recently and I think is because when I don't use the gun my win rate is lower and when I use the gun my win rate feels far higher so you're far more likely to see me using this weapon anyway the game's on apex recently have been going by so quick the second that i've gotthe you he's a 12 mini game 12 minutes on boards edge it's a huge map I feel like I don't have enough time to rack up some kills whatever I don't if it's just me but anyway enough chitter-chatter thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right skyhook kiddies my friends it appears as though okay please don't punch me please do not punch me thank you I have to run from that absolutely nothing in terms of weapons here unfortunately here we go should learn engineering said apparently well longbow as well I mean I don't have a body shield yes the team Cityside team I'm gonna come over to you but no I'm a friend if you see any please please let me know because these guys are gonna start tracing in fact was climbing sorry teammate although I don't know if you need to leave the game but I can understand why because where is this blue okay I'll take the habit I have to there we go I think I lose the same but about four times you came to help me and it looks like I've just deserted him but I swear I heard them climbing it sound like though fun that side of the building pretty good if I wasn't so low I wouldn't pick it up because I know I've used a lot recently I'll take the promotion I'm a seller Bangalore I'm struggling is that still the octane is that different it's a different octane the first octane that landed on my box with me to start I think rush me just then hey no quarrel allowed I've let you leave if you stay down the open one minute are they reviving I've only one of them is down I forget that I can't even get the high ground if I knew one of them was down I could have rushed that that's annoying you buy four kills this place been absolutely popping off haven't seen like this in decades I would say humongous crapping the distance though this is these are separate teams there's no ways that team is a Gibraltar lot going off there we go is a kitty ball - all right I've got two options here I've got a I can either camp and try and win or I can just get involved on playing solo I'm just gonna get involved let's see let's go shall we it's killed one of them so scrapping I'll ask the news I've got a rifle set up up top right don't shoot me please no sir my back all right fine I'll just steal all your loot then we get involved all right that's too big you be bubbles I nearly said geeky go balls there I was really hoping they're gonna come back through the portal that's why I saw it find my time not be looting but apprentice crap over here must be incredible because they did not want to come back in fact the scratch sounds like he may have ended I know they're healing this is bad news I took too long I should've went through the portal that's my fault I didn't play the last one aggressive enough so I'm gonna try to cut these guys off instead of running away so I'm poor not gonna win this game you know I may as well get a few gun fights here what are you doing what are you doing your lunatic hey my thumb's licked my thumb slipped and I face-planted the wall I never Gibraltar its besties football he's based his ultimate all you had to do was throw his bubble on his teammate and I wanted now to rush because they would have been what's-her-name you're the least coordinated team of all time you'd even revive the race I mean the race was a bit of a lunatic but she deserved she disturbed him I revised it Dean that's unbelievable I've got away with that one mmm I've got good loot already I mean now obviously it's gold you know that was definitely worth it a digital threads Mangalore is Opie and for public scented like mine in some incredible upgrade that was definitely worth now a big scrap I'm gonna continue and try and play aggressive here I wasn't expecting to make make it this far this there's only 13 people if that's not too bad after all right here was a little solo playing and there is a team behind me if I count down at all I'll get pinched that's great I've been able to shoot them early but apparently I've been walk around with an unloaded habits the last 5 minutes I think I've reloaded reloaded either of my guns yeah yeah yes it's 14 with radiuses domani Pathfinder beautiful just what I needed you guys are absolute bullies you guys are absolute police who know me they did the right thing I mean they stuck together they can't lose that if they stick together no matter how good you are I don't know if I can win that gun fight or a train yard Lisa's me amigos you showered land of top foot there are people getting there fast soon in the meat honestly every time I come here I thought this is the best place pollutes and someone's up top I can hear him picking up the good loot there I was talking late hello friends okay you don't want to fight sorry you can't beat up it then when you did steal my gun anvil rains already I think maybe for sample rains I think is just a single Firefly way one shot beyond one shot nice I'll take that and run I don't think you about to get it without going into the yes you couldn't even get my level one armor I've got no health friend so man we are also life here I don't know I don't know how that happens and somehow I've only got one kill even though I've peppered a fair few people is this unloaded this one no tea I got some health yeah I guess you could use this more than me give me a second way we do have a lifeline though she could just drop the drone unless it's on cooldown the right knee did end around as well so I'll carry these Oh Sal Vulcano just 6:59 space news a drone a butyl drone okay yeah yeah yeah good idea I'm hoping it's just on cooldown because then she'll just be ready to drop in are seconds sometimes you play with people and they don't know what the drone does and I'll be honest I'm one of those people sometimes a friend sometimes you just need a little reminder there you go thank you contact with target thanks um it's got a busy playing I need objects for an LMG I wasn't as if I knows there it wasn't the balloons how is the zipline to get up top here someone trying to arm switch I'm trying to arm a switch my grandpa was on cooldown and he won't let me arm so it shine we are these anyway nice dropped it last one yeah shoot me that's it to Street me on the ground instead I've been fine there if I mean waste my grapple get up top to be fair funny wise my grapple I would have been in a position to even get the kill in the first place you know I guess you won't ape the Wraith got the purple shields which is good consider I've pretty sure I stole it at the beginning of the game jeez any Scouts yeah that's good because the this before you is more of a spam weapon and then at longer ranges I can just try and single fire the for an LMG let's simplify the sky a little bit to try the double tap again I've seen some good players using the double Challenger so I'm down to try it again I'm just a little bit unsure of it and I just really need heavy rain tonight that's gonna need another sight furnace or rifle close attachment for the g7 increases heat by 50% the ammo capacity yeah we should party get out of here pick this up on the way okay I missed my extending back I messed up teammates I messed up okay it's a tarp down he's one shot I missed the boat the boat just sailed without me I'm afraid on my team has come back that's good nice I should nice to I left one shop oh I was trying to flank for me honestly with the storm coming in but there's several things are so we just leave them in the storm here we can just set up up shop Danny's face okay this sounds so far away if I don't have going the storm friends but you came to save me so I'm I'm here never mind what if I press where are you there we go good come here don't shield please once again to save the day drop down that's actually what tape what you know it's another fine here to the storm this is what happens when the hot truck it's on the side of the map and then the zone is on the opposite side of that the safe zone you get it you get an incredibly fast paced start and then everyone is scrambling for the same the same sort of escape routes you know there were definitely people here not sure what you should say this is someone a manager but you loose you just said not sure thank you very much it's a decent distance you know unfortunate lifeline I maybe I should have used my ability to get ahead of the lifeline and then she could have benefit you know but still people are dying so quick yeah on the way I can't see anything not a gosh darn thing I think they must have been a straggler in the storm oh if I had to guess I'd reckon if they were one of the team's people I guess it was just one singular man that was fighting that we left behind and I'll old drill sites or area right we're nearly top ten they know so no Monday tragedy if you ask me I mean I don't deserve loads and loads but I feel like I've done some good damage you know it's time to find that in the next scrap never mind I'm getting kills for nothing name I've absolutely no idea your daddy's it counted as a kill five kills I'll take it the game heard me complaining about my lack of kill prey and it's just gifted me a free kill oh it could be accuracy and the timing unbelievable oh no I'm celebrating - it's gonna go chill twenty guys bow-bow sterilize that might be something good this way in fact I would suggest not picking it up I know I've tacked it I know I didn't tag it that's good it's it's booked at the moment gunfire sounds dead anyway okay it's over maybe they'll loosen up or something Blue Shield's we said we there's no better shields here for you after a humongous scrap with that what can you do it's got a gob bowel stabilize it - yeah it's glitched mmm a lot of you may know but remember when they fix the barrel what's it called left V when you shoot there's a lot of cannolis on this screen I can't even for knees cause muzzle flash when they fixed that they didn't change on the gold power stabilizer because the passive of the gold bowel stabilizer what's to producing but it's how it used to be but now it's better on like a level three our stabilizer this is what there's only two squads that people will find over this way if you want to get involved some way have you got big scrap you monk a scrap one person's firing it's good enough for me pompous my shots give me a second yeah I assume you're gonna die now it's both my teammates play just the cannon fodder go in [Music] go back punish Leopard life I get to go back and we'll game brush my lasting these unsightly supplies fine I didn't appeal French Lucido are you the last guy it's the last guy I want to miss my shots if I didn't miss my shots there I get pretty good at least two more kills I would say it's all good a win is a win shout out the team that was a quick game I mean I didn't even have chance it to shoot people off that time yes I mean how long does that game that's the most interesting static we've got 16 kills as a team 12 minutes a 12-minute game on wards edge that would have been a quick game on Kings Canyon lair loanwords edge six kills for nearly 2,000 damage five kills for 510 what 102 damage per kill what's mine 316 206 Danish and then right with what 209 ish hundred nine point six I mean the damage per kill I mean two thousand damage in 12 minutes isn't too bad I mean if you have that 12 minutes and then you add on another two and a half to three minutes for again it usually goes on I'll probably get a decent game yeah but say what I'll be never or never be disappointed when I win thank you for watching mm-hmm
