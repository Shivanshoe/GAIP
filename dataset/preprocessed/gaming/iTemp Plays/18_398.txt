hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some bangalore today and she will always be one of my favorite legends in apex mainly because of her passive the super speed strafing ability of a bangalore is not to be underestimated it must win me so many gunfights every single game just because enemies aren't used to having someone speed across their screen like she can she was my second ever main on apex after mirage and then after bangalore it was pathfinder because you just can't be a good grapple i hope you guys enjoyed today's game thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh forgot the bangalore heirloom it's outrageous i never got it it's a pretty cool one i saw your vote and it was like maybe one person wanted three people that was so funny i felt so bad for poor bangalore me too i had to give him a vote [Laughter] when you're up against pathfinder though like come on a couple med kids too rich like this is like you're treating me like a chick i am like so incredibly not in funny that's all i'd like to hear fact one up top has a rope reloading on the left there is two teams yeah they're still they're still really big scrapping i think it's still a 3v3 there's a guy down low on the right climbing up the wall one of the teams ran off to the north side of this this could be a third team then bro yeah it could be right yeah yeah i backed up later i'm not gone rage right there are two good times here super time yeah that's like a fourth team that just pulled up full team like completely different unit healthy unit too in the back what is going on here one's up with us there's a door here careful many teams this is supposed to be a safe landing hold on here they weren't that big scrapping until we turned up so many people around here full team over here nice shots come back up wait we're getting powdered on another one three people on the roof again yeah yeah i know it's ridiculous one is not enough one i'm going to try and load a sec bro this is ridiculous how many kids here i honestly don't know we can't even get teammates banner that back up from sucks you're gonna close on me down low bottom right two two two they're going to jump on me yeah probably all these our times me too mate mate what is it another team of three i do i killed some on this roof too he just got revived and ran off there's someone else say yeah what the heck's happening maybe but like how long were they there though like nothing happened until we showed up so i think they're more likely trying to hold this i need a bit of light and a light mag and that's it 60 seconds until the ring closes i will go take some of that it was too tight it's a little too little stacks yeah yeah that's boxing yeah okay juice now we've got 45 seconds if you don't got robotic legs i'm just saying bro i'm swimming in energy now

i'll tend to need to crack they're running away mate we don't have to take these i kind of want to though i don't want to kill them i kind of want their ammo the wraith was incredibly laggy we got a demon on our hands oh the cracks they're gonna it's really too late maybe we could just get safe on this give rope a sec recharging shield healing healing all right a little weird uh let's incoming
