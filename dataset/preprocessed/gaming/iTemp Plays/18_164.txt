hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we're playing some lifeline today and i didn't realize how bad a lifeline player could be until i started playing lifeline now there are some obvious rules with her uh afk revive let's call it her passive you don't revive someone that's in the open if they're just about to get to cover you don't revive someone whilst they're getting shot at whilst they're on the floor because they could use their knockdown shield instead to block the bullets um and i tried to stick by these rules but somehow every time i revived someone they instantly got re-knocked and i just felt like i was annoying them i have two games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends kind of my shoes hello don't i need that heavy thank you all good all gucci time i've seen the heavy i've been eating uh fresh blue in
