the back that's huge what the heck's happening here this is fun i don't know this is great if i didn't die but i mean it'll be better but if i wasn't sitting here after half the game popping cells and syringes it would have been way better i would have been able to actually help you for so much of it ah new team inside oh newton careful then i broke it [Music] they're all popping off over this way reload a second squad adjust your strategy oh my god i'm gonna come back to you then oh what is the chance is there's another full team i don't know what's happening what just happened on me recharging they're all fine back there it is that are there two teams where you are team members i know i killed i killed one full team and then another full team pulled up behind them oh my god i'm scanned it's a 4k20 team too i'm about to rap all the way around because there were two teams on the entrance zone and in this cave too i was speaking to teammate appealing there's no way they chased me so they're going to that firing i have no idea what's happening in this game that was a lot of fun i wish i had more bats the entire time though i've secured a true hero it's you rich you're a true hero oh i can't good one minute this finishes fast they might force end me oh my god okay no i heard the footsteps i was like but it was directly behind so he standing directly in front and i was like wait if he was there i'd be able to hear him or i'd like to see him anthony smells bad listen just don't shoot the messenger what do you think he smells like it's bad just badness you know think of all the badness what would you call like it's like a bad smell do you think he smells like eggs or something just now i reckon it's more like i know actually excitement smell bad look at that look at that i just got it i'm getting both to death ah oh yeah i'm not playing all this in one race sorry i totally just like ripped that guy's ball no you're good you're good i have a massive fancy i wanted the gold to pop less the ridges dude yeah you're good hey do you want the gold to pop your syringes nah i'll pretty much finish man you're good is there someone there there's a blue armor on me okay i can't mate you said cancel that i've turned around attention opening fire enemy who's left over here uh level three i got an eerie feeling that they're all dead level three i got a battery for you quite fast oh no there's a guy to the left i'm leaving i'm putting a bat on the floor for you right behind you thank you hmm but i don't see her i need a cypher my hemlock they're in here they're in here i have a bruiser for you here as well one times if you fancy thank you very much no it's okay i'm looking for a shotgun bowl oh hold on uh you know what that race had a shotgun i don't know if she had a bolt though i didn't look it was on anthony look mate loads of people died hydro like three teams died hydro that probably means there's only one team there though uh yeah you know the next thing we'll go on hydro is we can come back if we can just take the portal and go straight to hammond i can if there may be yeah i'll be with you he's going that way no i want to go there faster faster faster i forgot that you're playing ash and you can see the death box it's so good i hear in front of it do i say that shall this isn't even going to take that far i think i'll save it yeah save it do you need cells by the way i have uh eight cells one back do you want more cells yeah i could take a few yeah how many would you like rich just the four just a little sack how much you have are you me at the moment die yeah yeah it's one of those moments say your number any number it doesn't matter i said anything this map first came out i was so intrigued with this poi because you could grab the tread and ramp off these green things that excite me kind of oh they're in front reloading he turned around and stuck that on you dude close range marvin what's up purple hammers so if he takes one you're good marge is the man now is he a mozam is there one in here has to be sure we'll find one yeah i know right but one time you're looking for it um you see the old uh death boxes i don't see any there wasn't i checked the low ball no i mean um [Music] uh grow towers 70 seconds ago wait we could actually just take the oh it's mars right also would have been good i think your plan would have worked yeah you know we could run into people here too though because i'm surprised even still that there really isn't many people that land anywhere around here it's kind of crazy really good like you could actually just land in terminal look at the amount of boxes here i just see them bouncing around up top on the fencing part uh by the waterfall i was called fountain it's not a fountain to waterfall oh they're going across the big rope enemy at that location oh the portal play would have actually been would have been right now huh yep i'm going to go back to the pool the wretched opera turn around this guy hops are they all hopped early paddy just rocked that guy what was that ready oh that's a big old thank you throwing frag enemies mate there might be a fourth team nice job thank you into the left hand right control disconnected one's cracked over there nice oh oh that's a big big i have self-respect i'm cranking it right here and i might go through the portal it's time to bind you recharge no i'm going in oh my god rich i got shot from every direction oh my god man i don't know what's happening wait this might be cheating oh really yeah i got some bad guys here let's let these guys go past i need to let's do this oh this is every team yeah this is it shields are depleted you saw the guy far on the lga i got a feeling that guys i have the banner we must correct their failure i think he's still freezing run is there a chance i get this i don't know i have the banner we must correct their failure you remember when i said we should go to the portal yes oh my god i do i do what just what just happened i have no clue i i look he might have been killed by a hacker well not killed like i was finished off by somebody else but recharging i got hit by i got hit 199. that's a lot of damage rampage so many headshots like and the guy was super low level i don't know bro i'll always stuck a few things together yeah you know they're quite nice you never you never know but you can always be so often you get beam beamed like that especially by a low level he is good right surely the guy's dead so okay it was the oh uh there's a problem here thank you
