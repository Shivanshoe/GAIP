hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be sniping today something i have historically never done and if i did have a sniper i would throw a one-time scope on there at an absolute maximum and try my luck with that but since i changed my response curve from steady to classic and i also increased my sensitivity from five to six sniping has felt way better way more comfortable for me it's such a nice teamfight opener as you can crack someone and then you just dive in there and full send it whilst they're trying to heal up i have two games for you today the first one i get a bunch of nice shots with the three times longbow and the second one i only sniped right at the end but i thought the pacing was nice to round off the video so i hope you guys enjoy it especially as i don't snipe often on the channel and if you're new here i would love it if you guys could subscribe we are thirty thousand subs away from one million and youtube keeps wiping off one to two hundred subs every night for some reason at the exact same time it's really weird but yes thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends nice welcome back got some guaranteed guaranteed gold is it always uh it's always a g7 uh no no it's like it's just always a gold item one time it was a knockdown you landed landed the middle bin landed in the middle bin under the waterfall on the left yeah yeah hey i got a havoc oh nice oh i got the frag jokes on you i didn't want that stuff uh do you need any shields uh yeah i have zero i got some uh two cells right here oh there we extended octane the ox main he's dead obtain the arc rain i wonder today i'm behind the door but all right um no no no no actually i don't i have two so i've come on nine i'm gonna use a longbow yeah this goes i might craft myself a level three extended like forgot that it's in the crafting thing say that again i'm gonna craft myself a level three because i need light oh nice what are you what are you using right now longbow online you ever heard of uh oh block oh blah yep uh why am i why don't they talk about like he's talking about like chicago yeah yeah yeah i know it all like i just did not think that's what you're afraid you're thinking wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait he's afraid i know you were thinking you were thinking did he just miss say roblox i was like there's no way he's talking about actually i thought i'd throw a curveball what's he coming up wait okay a rope again you don't see any tracks then i do not know i still feel like it's supposed to be should it honestly should be able to should be a customizable hop-up that lets you use it yes should we go in the tunnels you can champion has two kills being delivered oh my god i know you're better than me i have one coming right maybe i don't know yeah is this the fastest way i guess i have no clue car to the right too sounds like actually i think you might be right never actually i think they're literally funny oh my god no i'm upset what happens when you when you leave the pack yep look these costumes oh he just jumped down i have a long bow could have been for like 84. if we would have waited here like five seconds all these people getting killed i try him 83 i wonder if that other team's gonna run up or possibly who are they firing at i think they just killed the team when we rolled up yeah that your blood turned out to ease his knee we can rope up and then rope across there uh-huh thank you you don't see them was that something you saw me using a three times longer i don't think i ever have i think i'll ever use one yeah here yeah below oh this guy on your right like one shot how do i know that i'm not he's in phoenix first three shields worth yeah i don't think i've seen any my eyes don't register oh right here on top of the building recharging shields i actually might go for the number one mirage i mean i'm pretty sure you have a chance i have eight mats i wish your number on mirage has like 110k i'm kind of close i'm coming close to where 1k yeah you're pretty you're almost there he has to stop one day but i will never stop i don't think he will oh you got it though you got it though i believe thank you oh i wanted it was a bit of faith yes i do have faith i think they're over there no that's a beacon i think oh i didn't specify number one mirage in england called richard with a youtube channel yeah okay i think i might have already done it yeah i'm pretty sure you're already there okay well someone whose name i didn't want to repeat is to kill someone i'm not happy with it i must have pretty did it what gabe has been repeatable yeah my name is gabe what do you think of when you hear the word gabe on the name gabe what do you think of gabe i think about arthas i think in the office and gabe norm but the office was first you think of well after that what gabe newell the guy who runs steam or own steam or maybe oh okay all right yeah no i just got one here i just think of the office is your fight double headshot let's see yeah that's what you get for being in my kill feed you slide cracks no reg obviously yes 48 sniper pick up something nades picking up lanes mate that's what i'm doing what did this wraith run where did where's your part about i think i killed it i'm good one team yup yup yo bamboozle already in the next ring i smell victory kinda smells like pork chops i miss all my stuff me too who hasn't saved right only one team no one's gonna kill him unless they jump off the map like we did yep but if we do that we're like the last one i mean we're on like a twenty bombs um oh i had to try well didn't hedge here at the sky though she's one shot somewhere okay hit them with a trick shot where'd they go uh i'll spot her i'll spot her oh oh she's probably healed you're good no but there was no trick involved it was just a shot all right that's fine okay you are there i might be the best player in the world i'm just gonna come out and say that as well i think you are i think there's a good chance i think yeah i think you you might be in your defense i was killing before they even go into your range of sight uh in my defense i was just out of it for this game uh you can go underground here um where do i oh yeah i see i see ac through these doors and then oh wait i was aiming for this is that bad oh no no no no problem one team on your ridge i'm just gonna get i think it's a whole thing oh yeah yeah they did not like me they all just dove on me didn't they usually when you're on high pain it's a little bit worse yeah i think it was with certain guns too i've noticed this with like a lot of the uh a lot of like the semi-semi-auto weapons yeah no wreck a lot actually what's that glitch by the way like where you launch up in the air with the minigun or something you put on a crypto drone and you can literally just fly about like a chomper yeah right in front of me i think it was right in this building blue shield back he's on the back right side that team was kind of weird they were all just hiding in one building again that was scary detachments guys this is the stuff i need so hard shooting smg from this party oh it's two teams 14 14 damage yo ask a question i meant to ask do you guys have like the damage that you deal add up to make a number or is it individual uh i'd love to make a number so i can just tell how much i'm hearing for people like have that stacking up like i think it's just stacking right i think it's just called stacking india and the gameplay settings i need to change that because i'm like i've done a 12 and now a 16. i don't know how people call a with that saying let me change that comes a mess you see on me i found it's cracked there's one down there too cracked on rev i've got that as a yeah one should be here this team is pushing now they push you now you guys got a few seconds though yeah yeah i'm ready i'm just popping uh phoenix i think i'm the old oh i'm just gonna push so they can make me send me back okay taking fire everyone i broke one of them nice i need some energy i'm just going to double check these boxes oh they set up rampage shields oh no i'm not trying to destroy the shields they have to come down they need to destroy the shields another 14 damage or so but a few times are you okay on the angle they've run away yeah i'm watching them i'm watching them i'll tell you guys these last two teams then yeah i think it's a solo the other one one's right here i'm gonna be right in this corner i'm throwing a knock starting on that rock right behind us you guys i broke wine i think it's just a solo i got i got one i'm being shot in the back but that's not the same thing surely there's no way to get there yeah this thing's really sweet i'll come back to you i'm regretting yeah i uh yeah yeah i mean i'm going out charging and then the other team was three i'm gonna try to play against you on the back so there's that time he's gonna get some energy from this guy yeah i see my team yeah you guys got time you're good one minute got no energy i'm taking this triple take with you guys in a sec uh we're gonna i think we're gonna have to rotate behind we're gonna have to go backwards yeah yeah we need to go now okay 45 seconds right there oh yeah can you send us like over here we got to make a big rotation they're just going gonna gatekeepers oh shoot yeah i'm being shot they're pushing i think if you can just uh twist me and then all do we need to get that high ground uh it would be really nice if we could i could rotate through these um apartment places and then i i have a rope if i rope this to this i can take my old bro like a two reps out they're right on uh the same angle right yeah yeah they're trying to beat us up there either up here look nice huge dude that's so good we're gonna beat them suckers where are they they might have gone actually they might have gone nice i need heavy ammo i didn't pick any up over here yeah i'm going to check these real quick i'm going to try hobbies and angle they might be trying to rotate all the way around all right i'm going to uh do what do you need rich um i have a trouble taking on it oh no i just need a few snipers but i'm all right all right i'll find some i think they're rotating around this big thing i think they knew 79 right there i'll scan over here yeah i can hear footsteps i think maybe or maybe not maybe not moving up let me scan let me scan they're going to be set up shields aren't there time him on the right too i know he still froze up this way i don't know what this is back there yeah i'll play through three three just too easy for the squad you are the apex champions see if i broke 500 damage oh a thousand thousand for one kill i might have been yoinking that's sick
