hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and this season there has been a little bit of controversy with bangalore because i guess people discovered that you could smoke your own feet and then you can stand in it and you can see out but people can't really see you in there i don't know there's been one either one second and then yeah now it's stupid i can actually see right the way through my smoke it's kind of crazy now in public games i have really haven't seen anyone even try these but apparently in ranked especially at masses and above this seems to happen pretty much every game and those little advantages when you're playing to the top level can make all the difference now i don't think that bangalore should be able to see through smoke when others can't see that's a little bit cheesy but i do agree that she definitely needs a book elsewhere especially when you've got so many legends that can track you through stuff bloodham seer even mad maggie now even fuse even fuse can track you but she'll always be one of my favorite legends to play just because of her passive it's so fun i hope you guys enjoyed both the games that i have for you today thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds mimi goes mills mills mills we're dropping that one done i'm running danny danny

i didn't get that wait did i get the kill wait what did you go on leave or something like what no i think i saw me and you probably probably left really quickly there's no point alton if you just stand next to okay wait did i get the kill though i don't know i don't know if i got the kill perfect i hate people i think he saw me on his on his screen just insta left i know they are fine this way

of me would be easy the fortnite king oh you're just a big old mean shield i have the literal rare skin on the game so i'll just intimidate people i might get on this roof i think there's a horizon up here there there's one in here there's someone here and this building too yeah i think separate teams give them a shield they might be talking and it's of course my germany shotgun i didn't get any uh yeah okay so uh horizons on the roof and then the the duo's in the building no i'd rather get little cringe there will be cringe i've got uh two bats and a phoenix let me know if you need any best i've seen another team actually under the same actual actual third i think i don't know i can't tell what's going on here i don't know who's where what two and what's who has the signal iq 400. nice yeah cracked 100 1200 i mean they have traps i mean do we even just do we just leave these guys and just go safe like we'll find them eventually i don't even probably get it down with like a charged rampage but yeah these guys are just chilling is there any angles to shoot from i don't know you just made it so they could hear me though they're shooting at me yeah zombies coming in let's just run away from these nerds [Music] they're just chilling at the top i can get them off there with my lt are they they must be inside this one just shot you off wait they're running they're running yeah oh painless knocking at the door there's two other squads left stay focused still we've got a minute to play here otherwise let's go all the way around if you want um yeah we can we can go to the chokepoint that's right in front of us yeah i think he's might still might be in my being 45 seconds often they're not trying to gatekeepers this would be tough i have no heat shields yeah they might be in one of these corners be careful ah we're fine oh beamer shoot him in the face yeah three zero rings close oh no i hear the net why this this guy's vibing this guy's chilling out ten seconds ring's just ahead i'm gonna leave a lot whoa let's get him nessie get him is a purple armor don't don't go over it i think it might be a gold bag too though i don't need it you need either true it's nearly cracked fell down last name i need a med i mean we all have to go to you i'm gonna yeah like down the hill basically i'm gonna get an angle over here you know really i mean they're valkyrie that probably doesn't all right good point that's a good point you've made valkyrie just dropped one i cracked we've got a minute until the ring closes you up would have been a good thumbnail but there was a lot of sugar in the way nice wait maybe jose's [Music] oh he lines that shot the guy's a demon i'm on my way no they're not gonna do now i can't feel 100 taking a knee patching up giving my shields a recharge oh man give me a sec recharging shields healing chasing him he's rising now huh i'm nothing yeah i mean i can't through there not your fault i should have done him to be honest but the stairs are kind of awkward that was my last seat level yeah they're both up up here any chance they get birdied doesn't sound like it only us it's only uh us type of thing you know you'll be all right i gotcha i have some shields and stuff huge oh my word thank you using a phoenix chip i think they're in that uh that one building right here yeah i think so everybody rest yeah second floor one's gotta charge pk enemy i oh i think so i mean there's usually people at mills i'm not gonna call her daddy please call it danny absolutely not sure shield cell wait you can get in that way thank you kind of crazy didn't know that there's a massive window didn't see it say sorry or i'll throw my bangalore up right now i mean you can it's not gonna do anything be good i'll say sorry and i won't i mean that's i'd do it that'd be funny i'm not sorry and i do not apologize i broke the one on the left yeah i'll try and nade him oh he's trying to get out of there okay so i may have baited you but i think you would have died either way oh my hundred percent i was i was doomed for i shouldn't have started a phoenix game and that first time you did say you were doing that and by the time i got there i was a little bit late i was going to tank made anyway you know it might have been the worst bubble of all time but there was there was a knee there was an angel plus at night i hate the night i don't want to bubble the need no that despite use this gravity cannon i mean i could capture by the way you know so out of the out of the cannon i don't know how to do it i've never tried replicator touching down the cannon you gotta tap straight to the right because this uh storms to the right oh that was just moving up why did you peanuts i've got like eight seconds max what am i playing with today sorry my bad it's because my pink is on scroll wheel like when you press it in but my tap straight scroll up so i accidentally pressed it instead of scrolling down yeah i panicked i was like yeah yeah it was a funny thing see your panic tap straight that's why i think i pinged where i wanted bangalore to go you should have listened to my orders oh that's why i've never typed i don't know how to do it using siren he just have to time it like as soon as it it sends you out oh really yeah oh they found that over there back at it again back at it again what rhymes with rope slow yeah big slug um anything just anything with uh you add a little edge to it i fire big ropes that's why they call me a little ropeage i'm at the top of the mountain you can call me big slow peach thoughts not the worst i've heard worse thoughts this guy's got no health he might have shields but he's got no help he call me big sloppy sweater to kill him how's his first mistake confirmed good job right here oh yeah i'm just recharging his kills and he's ten seconds just ahead he's running back that way is it running back he's a running back he's taking it okay 14 14. get over there so his mommy hit a 14 they're doing the same thing they're going to be in the air whoa this guy's been watching my tap strength tutorial from the gravity cannons they definitely painted where he wanted to go you think and the man listens almost broke him i suck reloading i suck dust is happening alternating in the zone i'm not gonna chase him i'm out yeah here you can have fun shout out joey g someone say someone's it front of me i just got it down wait what oh they're here what could i hear them locked all right next to me oh yeah beginning i can actually see right the way through my smoke it's kind of crazy kind of busted right by me it's the octane there are two to come behind you oh i only have four assists so i don't think so okay how much damage you have 1400 okay how many kills oh what was that was that a number was that a number it's a new number stated a german number it's a new kind they've just released it uh let me guess 11 kills eight eleven is elf come make come on man jesus rings nearby it's not even that bad why are you panicking look it's big sloppage says this is a big very big slope it's gonna get loud i'm a religious man they call me big poppage i never know what you're going to say i'll get nervous he's going to say it's good or bad i just oh i don't know yeah i got to keep you on your toes terrible sometimes you know i'll let it slide it slide lettuce oh yeah let it slide oh my god i swear your brain works so weird it barely works let's be honest i just don't know where we are spitfire here gross well i should take that because i have been speeding fire no i don't agree with them the academy denies that one i don't think he went quite far enough they only had to move back there like i think that's far enough without the count so i just wanted to use it over 14. triple elevens i can see him through the fence i know which way you're going to fake me come on oh he's trying to get along wait one's already oh one's already over here oh god no she probably poured right don't know oh if it was a path he's beaming me online i'm here for actually fine go get it kill him i don't trust you kill confirmed attention i was really hoping richard would go so i could let the race kill him maybe comedy classic
