are four teams here cracked one did you say uh including us yeah nice job i'm back there's a team there's a full team with these stairs just be careful okay i'm gonna throw a long uh i mean if there's that many teams here we kind of want to force them to fight like we want to we want to deal damage there were three others but one of them run off you got his own get in there all three they must have finished one of the teams the wraith team that was looking beginning i don't know they were on the ropes at the start they just ran off oh this team was running you said there was a lot of sniper in

each other he's one in that corner lifeline on this door right here climb back up top near the side there up right on climb they're back made up for my mistake in that building bro they were both tucked in that left corner that walked in i did so much damage to them i just felt confident i think they pop back too just about yeah definitely the apex that's all matching too it's in coordination
