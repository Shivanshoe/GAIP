wipe half the server and we dominated every team that we faced but the more important part is the friendships we made along the way every now and again you bump into a guy who's got no shields no hope of survival and he starts teabagging through a window asking for mercy sometimes you kill him anyway but sometimes you've just gotta let him go be free my friend may god guide you in your quest thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos fun i'm going right there this way right on my pinky see just just right here someone else is right here

well oh that's someone wants to watch and stream that i'll let him leave i said the weirdest interaction ever at least twice ago they just like they're running their leave i've done it a few times yeah it's a classic move just my presence that they just can't handle uh it's all kicking off of containment this has been the weirdest game ever would you you spend the whole game fighting one guy i say well you say fine we bonded we had a special connection and i let him leave how much damage did you guys output to uh i have 660 damage it's not the worst but you know if i was there fine you know

one of them had white shield then you know i'm by yourself yeah that's good though i can see in their eyes are we pushing left or right i say left we can kill these guys white shield oh my god popping a man i'm still alone for a while i'm gonna try and help he's he's full sending me i had to drop teammates i don't know where either one went they're both out there it's thirsty though bless that first team that has just oh they find me from that hill with white armor or guys they're just trying to get into their first fight and then they get 30s they're probably just going to play a different game because that just sucks they get one fight they get 30. nope apex is an addiction they're already queued up back in the game they tweeted apex circle addiction whilst they were ready yeah while they were already queuing into another game story of my life uh are you kill leader uh yes okay we have time 10 200 10 and 2 000 even nice could have been 11 but i'll let bluton leave somebody else is fiery what's that great down there i think it's good time i swear i swear down mate i'm leaping down i'm gonna die i'm so far away i'm sure you got a rope somewhere i'm gonna rub this rope coming at a different angle i just heard them shoot like once or twice and they stopped seems like i mean that's fine with me i just want to i just want to fight no but then like ready i'm ready too hmm i don't know if you are i'm ready i'm always ready okay no i'll believe you oh right right below me and they're fighting up here yes he grappled more a southeast yeah they're on the shark tower tower the rate like 86 try and get a top yeah i cracked one inside this guy's up top still oh it's a full team on my head oh no i might be good hit the path for 150 but i've knocked any mike so okay he's one hp he's one oh he's actually one and for like 30 or 40. i think it's two teams be careful no there's a yeah that's in one of the teams is inside this other one's pointing out one up top is i don't have an extended energy it's like it's 20 21 and i don't have one 200 iq right here you're not acknowledging how this is they're all down here i'll kind of get there are they protecting their afk friend or what okay yeah i think you might have been afk crashed or something he might have crashed honestly hello come back greg so come on he's pretty much broken i miss all my shots i'll just reach everything oh my god you're actually oh i'm dead i'm actually going to die this guy suffers obviously nice noise the guy that charged what was it called the rampage and i just i kept trying to quick scope and that was so scary yeah you were one hp i was wait look oh please it's the worst team i've ever seen wait i think i could i could think i could do it twice hold on oh my god you can't teach this okay we just destroyed that lobby i don't know doug dimidom did most of the work
