hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and unfortunately apex is even more broken now than it was before respawn put out a patch an hour ago and the game is in shambles you can't connect to the lobby most of the time and if you do connect to the lobby your legend sort of bobs up and down in slow motion for a little bit and if you don't crash then you get into a game and then you crash out of that game instead it's an absolute disaster i have no idea what is happening with apex for the past week but i can't remember the last time a triple a game has had this level of problems for over a week straight recording apex this last week apart from earlier today when my game was actually working has been miserable at times because it's just such a mess i don't really know what else to say about it it's just broken however i did get these two games for you back when i could actually play the game i hope you enjoy it thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i don't know he's saying something hey he's saying stuff i don't know i always have a meter though so i don't know he said a lot of things mate dude i don't even need to play low by land on a mozambique every game as is it's great for the first time ever natural there's no gun down low here either i mean you've got a mozam okay i've got decent guns man you got mozam what else you got i got a 99 i'm sure oh you're good you're good i got my loadie it's just it's just ironic how i i align on a mozambique every game whether i want to or i don't i didn't mean to interrupt you there i was complaining my deepest apologies what have i just witnessed what are you witnessing i just saw this bangalore walked past me popping a note on the celeron oh that's weird can you imagine that's weird only experienced bangalores uh would know anything about that i might fall send that's a this bad throw come on arm switch wait they're inside so so sorry wow all of it happens sorry i saw you kill me uh not accepted no i uh i was out of bullets anyway so all right yeah i can't teach you better i can't see how many bullets you fired and then i shot i was like one two three four and then as soon as the fourth one went outside still alive man fourth the fourth shot with the mozam yeah the fourth you fired two before that you fired two before that the fourth shot with the mozambique yeah but you fight two before that so i was like so why not just count it oh why are you reset uh starting and ending at four i've reset i definitely didn't forget the most of my six now because that would be a new bear you know okay and i would never make the error honestly if you asked me how many shots from the mozambique if i didn't have it in my hands i wouldn't know it's weird isn't that sort of stuff where you play the game every day and it's little details obvious i need to heal me i'll be honest i didn't heal her okay i missed every single shot it's the worst in my life i'll get you back right away oh i at least finished oh my god she's literally just gonna get rest why would you why wouldn't you finish that so you can get back as soon as possible no kill them no oh you were throwing and you don't just fight rich thank you for the rest of it you're good i can try now and we just eliminated the whole ice how are you alive somewhere there's a bangalore over here that i cracked okay the guy that was thirsting you i just chucked an ark star at her when i could have shot once she was so weak i was trying to stick out i uh probably should have called it up that's fine i kind of i kind of missed all my shots i don't know what that's like level three thank you i have uh i have a solid 104.16 recurring damage per kill ratio at the moment ah okay so pretty good okay i have two hundred i'm averaging about 256 damage per day okay you know so i'm killing red armor babies that's uh that makes sense yeah at least it's a power of two you know no i don't mind everyone you could oh yes i don't even want this can't have it anyways actually you're bangalore i'm taking it unless you want it so dizzy you can see people anyway i need the added assistant plus you've got a mozam you know i mean i rarely idiots anyways we're fighting this way and you grapple that way ah i was just let's self miss playing path and i'll just grapple the wrong way for a 20 second call me yeah good luck i mean if that harvester you could have gone that way actually don't tell me this doesn't go across the lava oh my god i'm literally the worst pathfinder ever dude people's names are just like i don't i don't understand what's wrong with people i didn't see it was it bad i mean it's just so it's just so weird sorry to start to tell you i mean you're going to have to cut it out anyways honestly i mean i i genuinely don't care i don't cuss for you charge with this bad boy so actually it's here let's explore this way to my left i have no crosshairs by the way okay that's huge right this guy's crying nice okay maybe you didn't oh they're back here they're trying to pull him they're trying to pull him he's cracked she's really weak that's a big play for me right there now now we can go harvest them yeah yeah three i was like i will follow you um that isn't zone uh slightly i mean yeah i mean technic if you want to get technical about it mate you know if we talk about technicalities here yes yes but your team will not be so yeah there is yeah over there well that's why it goes mate that's life that's what all the people say flying high in april shot danny may you know what are you insane right now the songs you will know about culture songs like that no i'm not 55 years old yeah it is a pretty old song he the guy's one shot oh his teammate got in the way the team might go on the way amigo oh thank you i'll just pop one i have two more now i've got one popped this garment wait is he not go that way guys do you want a thermometer sorry uh yeah please well i mean i have two and there's two of the squads i might maybe just the one please oh nope come all up i'll try i'll try marla yeah how many we got here thank you i've got bags you want got bag i said you nice old bag that's huge how'd you get those two extra shots did you switch to under the mozam or something it's kind of crazy right it's this uh new buff i vote or something i think that was in the recent patch oh pretty sure it's always at four you are dead bye oh bit i need one shot oh god i'm here still we'll play um okay okay uh it's not no listen listen i can maybe don't think there's anyone shots in i got no my shields a recharge am i hearing that right do they land on the charge turn with the ramper yes yeah i'm getting chased by faulty i'm trying to get there keep eyes on the new kill leader wrapping to you i have no shields uh there you go come on i think so yeah i'm getting shot from literally so annoying oh that way i have to have to go i know enough time to even like switch arms and stuff properly though i don't know nice i'm going to come this other way as soon as your thing's gone she's actually one hp i'm just getting thirsted china i broke him as well so he had like an extra 400 health he says he probably just landed on it thank you it's a team on the over there wait where we were here it's a havoc and uh some concealer something good this way that's one of them yeah ever since now and i don't know if that was them or not they have a charge upset now that's mirage ox climbing up there we go it's cracked out i have one gun popping about nice pretty weight nice [Music] i'm not going to run into that thermite team buddy giving my shields a recharge okay i'm gonna be honest if i was live i'd i think these guys are stream sniping not those ones but the people that just keep running into us well i guess that's just how this map works really well game to be honest with you just apex just like works contact with target yeah i thought that might have been 109. all i did a lot of amateurs guys but i think they finished bats oh you could see is that a different team no yeah i think i don't know honestly oh yeah it is i didn't yeah oh my god i don't have any bats help damage have a slow heal yeah i'll try and hold them up attacking uh i can drop you some put on my flesh i have to pick up these bad things you're fine man you're fine they're pretty far away i've cracked him on blue he needs to snipe himself i love controlling his last squad i think he might just be him i need a blue armor either two times on my r9 i don't know when that happened nice job nice clutch in the beginning thanks man oh mate you are the eighth good great every time we go into a fight there was like eight teams he was never like oh we got a chill little 2v2 or 2v3 it was crazy
