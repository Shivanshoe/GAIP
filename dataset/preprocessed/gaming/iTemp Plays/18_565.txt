hey what's up guys it's welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some revenant here apex legends assassin character he's a really interesting legend to play he has an area a denial silences ability he moves real fast like a crab when he's crouched he's ultimate allows you to fall in for free and he can climb kind of and that's the one buff that i'd give revenant to make him more viable and more common in these games i want this guy to have infinite climb horizon is amazing on world's edge because she can get to any bit of high ground really easily and i think the revenant should have mobility like that as an assassin character he would be amazing but anyway i have two remnant games for you here today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that was great you could just oh was bad no no i die that's cool a lot of slime right yeah oh i'm having a great start today someone got someone jumped into the window so my rush mid level didn't work no no no watches i'm not gonna waste too much of your time don't worry no no worries did i not kill you um i don't know someone's getting punched out in front of me uh he just punched him out now he's running becomes i don't know what's going on over here uh this guy got blown up by a nade they're looting that box right there another watch uh we are indeed alive oh my god he did it thank you i didn't think that was gonna happen can't lie to you good job thank you very much we need to respawn our friend you do indeed wait oh no don't go please uh i have a turbo divo um do you need a turbo or do you have no oh wait uh i thought i'd pick the turbo but apparently it must have been you thank you just faster you're just way quicker uh yeah i'm gonna respawn my friend in here a second because i feel bad that he's watching they're seeing that stuff mate they're literally joining everything they are dude i don't really have much to begin with so i'm kind of i don't really know what to do um follow me oh they're at the at the top see if he jumps out oh this dude just absolutely beamed him i was kind of scared i did he jumped he jumped he jumped thank you well played nice this guy's just going to hoover up his box that's good he has a champion he had a 20 bomb and a 4k i'm not really sure why he didn't face i was kind of confused by that he could just fazed away i'm glad we won that fight yeah i kind of just died but you know oh who didn't ping the level three extended energy come on guys come on people it wasn't me this is outrageous i was walking out here come clean attention oh missed a lot of shots well i'm being forced to use double 99 so i'm doing it hey there you go oh i should probably shoot cells i don't like using cells here we are oh my god i have a sneeze stuck in my brain okay you got two options no no no i got some advice okay if you want to sneeze look into something bright like a light or like a white wall and open your eyes up as far as you can right if you don't want to sneeze lick the roof of your mouth okay i'm not doing anything this is a life lesson now i'm telling you i promise those two things are you kidding me you can look it up those two things will improve your bridge yeah okay are you dead it's could you need it to sneeze mate you need to listen to me um someone's got in your box someone is literally leaving your box yeah i can tell don't worry he's out of here he run off you having a good time oh my god there are people here are there really yeah they protect me they're running they're running up top though i think you've got enough time that literally you just look up here ah let me give my box my way i'm multi official i'll be there sooner or later i believe i it these guys bled out oh my god it took me so long to get him my death protection is wearing out i don't like the two times oh shocking ball i have four med kits this is just ridiculous tremendous so much energy he's got another turbo do i double turbo that would be too toxic i think might as well enemy over there repairing too toxic we were just running all charged rifles like yesterday what's wrong with that this guy's got another turbo we should literally triple turbo he's only got blue shield mate he's suppressed as well he can't even pad away i played oh wait did he have a gold i think so oh you and that's me ow oh no i just got down already i think this is different teams maybe yeah why can't i sprint i have no no there's like eight teams no come on path i'm not with you at all can you drop yeah i kind of funny okay drop it if you need to we're below you're diving anyone's on these yeah i'm on fire i'm coming up the other side if i get a lifeline oh my word oh my god he has a sweaty team i know when he jumped to my head i don't have my i'm 18 on my own this would have been a better time all right i know oh we can take the rope maybe behind this team this way teams on the right i think no we're we're in the best part mate we're in a bad spot yeah so i'm closing there yeah i was waiting for you to rap um well they're right about me right above me let's get out if we make go this way if you can they're gonna be right on top of us still don't have that french are we back frame two you might the first time i'll be with you in just a second oh that's outrageous it started they can't shine on the back against on the back cover out with my naruto thing somebody shot it somebody shot it oh my god we're down low then it's mca look down really though not played there's still another one below us here below here so i see you and thanks for playing nice dude oh made some triad teams make that pathfinder we had a hemlock versus divo ball twice he jumped to my head again it didn't work out the first time and it didn't work out from the second timing i'll throw one i got an alternator i'll just turn up as well i haven't heard anyone wait this is with this game yeah did anybody even land here actually i'm taking that what am i thinking the best find in the game i'm not sure they did they're probably down low already let me go check i'll be the guinea pig uh unlimited gold knockdown send literally won to the top oh wait he wasn't literally one cause i'd already him a little bit i him even more he he's like full health mate yeah this is all mine give me all the ammo okay you can have the ammo oh i gotta i gotta love it oh you're actually rocking it okay oh i have a vault ah well my apologies yeah you should be i should be apologies make sense right nice one let's go was this your was this your armor what did i just get uh yeah i leveled it up because i was just destroying everyone okay make sense okay he's hopped in i'm going straight to estates by the way but i'm down you have what zero shield oh yeah oh people here [Music] oh really you think of that shut you up oh my word okay how much damage did you really need four thousand got to save your life if that guy was literally gonna scope you in the head wasn't he really there yeah i saw him that is what we call a beautiful third party we just ran around in circles just killing everyone i don't have any shield cells and i picked up the wrong thing over this way um i have four extra uh i dropped two and i left some here how many bats you have or four bats oh yeah i can drop you something behind me uh just the one i i have one i'm coming over uh i dropped more than one but now i've overtaken you yeah we'll all manage i'm trying to find out where they were cause i was kind of far away but i assume that uh just follow like my path oh there we go in the open right the open pinky yeah yeah yep wait did they just kill this team they did i'm on the way i'm ultimate too thinking um in front of me yeah i wonder how can you see me uh almost broken purple mate this guy's got the best vision of anyone ever this guy can see nice that was me [Music] um anyone else want to start firing um i have uh 177 spares so if you need some let me know i i just found a box worth yeah i think using that turbo box right yep yeah oh there's even more over here if you need any there's more i should be all right thank you then people are fighting mate we're not involved how uh where are where are they i'm not sure that i just see him in the feed and it's making me upset is it is there already yeah that's good but baby big comes big cars uh turn around i'm coming i calm and miles away where's he going i'm gonna try and pinch him oh no he's going all the way to the back door i'm just gonna go in this door okay the boys are ready oh no i'm almost here [ __ ] horizon i don't like a variable scope so i was in two times but i didn't realize i think two times wait what's up oh maybe that was a mirage that i saw just running maybe yeah he popped his ultimate so probably wait there's no way i'm going to make i don't know i'm running to the next fight or third party yep that's the only third part we haven't like that was the only fight we haven't thought about right there oh this is uh this is in the storm but i i i don't care i uh don't design i think they're in this little oh my god they're in this little spot too no cossack is literally one hp someone steal it sounds like someone stole that all right are they down low yeah they are big children that was a fight that was is that a word i took yeah part chicken you didn't say foreign is definitely not a word okay just wondering it's clean up any confusion man i mean i just i just don't want to use it in the future and then yeah don't say part token definitely partook yes is that a word no no okay like it should be i don't know oh yeah uh what about the urban dictionary that's like that's like a dictionary of words that aren't really words but they're but that are words right i mean language is difficult isn't it because if people enough people use a word that was made i mean all words are made up so when does it become a word if enough people use a word and know what it means it's then a word you know i mean so i think it should be i'm again that was my thesis my phd on urbandictionary.com he lost me at word hi multi where are they um just this way somewhere here right there right there someone's closed the vandals oh my god did you guys really not move oh one's right on my head right on my head i'll try and help got back you dropped out you phased yeah they didn't move they just sat here yeah there they they're indeed vibing on the roof yeah this would be an interesting push i'm going to try and get to you maybe this will be a little easier it's cracked i'm with you i just they're all going to be looking that way so you know nice all right all right then cracked up top broker almost rubbery dive straight to mate they really think actually crazy i gotta loot a little bit you're fine popping a bat one second i'm just i'm just chilling i'm gonna try and get behind them maybe a lifeline is one i got like one right in keys they both do the pull back like i mean the storm though i think they are down racing cracks again just to the left not really out here for 19 but i don't think she could heal that much dude we just third party that whole game literally the entire time you know and then the third party happens run to the gunshots amigos champions okay nice okay nice little game knocks all a little something
