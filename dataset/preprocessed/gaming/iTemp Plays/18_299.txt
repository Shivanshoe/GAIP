hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the game that i have for you today has some weird valkyrie movement tech that i didn't even know was possible and i 1v3 the masters team using this movement tech twice in a row and without that tech i'd have died 100 the only time i do the movement tech is in the end of the first game and i do throw a little repeat in there afterwards just for good measure so basically the movement tech that i did was like a super jump off a rope if you don't know if you uh hold on to a rope and then you just double tap jump as soon as you get onto the rope it sends you flying like horizontally but i guess if you do this when you're valkyrie it taps her jets and it sends you flying horizontally as well as vertically but without the animation of your flying stuff do you know what i mean so i was zooming across the room and i've hypified someone as i was zooming and then i flew off to safety it was just beautiful i'm gonna let you watch it so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends we need to fight the lifeline but i kept missing but yeah uh this is the classic strat where we third party i'm like never mind there's about 12 people here did you see the shadows coming this guy's just punching just trying to punch us out all right on this roof okay everybody lands here apparently oh that was that was i've never seen so many people here i played are we a mess right now what's happening i'm a mess my anxiety hasn't came down from the previous game you know what uh the game that gave me just the most anxiety ever that i just like i sometimes i would legit like i just couldn't do it it was a was a fortnight oh my god yeah because it looks like the eggs oh the build fights were so cause they were so just like prolonged and they were just like so unnecessarily long sometimes especially when it was like a good build fight that game was like all ego too because the build fight made like the skill gap with the building was so big but if you go into a build fight i just felt like i was fighting for my ego my pride it was gruff too so scary because you always had that that thought of like that you're gonna get dropped too like somebody's gonna shoot your bills and you're just gonna get dropped another thing coming in i got my revenge that's the team that just killed me at the end oh is that the team yes oh at least i got one of them you got your revenge he's like what is wrong with who's what guy
