hey we cigar each welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are back playing a bit of Pathfinder as you guys know Pathfinder was easily my most used legend on this game up until season 5 where they increased his cool down on his grapple by 20 seconds I'm still fuming but I've been trying him out recently and he's actually not that bad you just have to have discipline you know you just after not grappling to a fight without any escape routes and you should be ok I got a double whammy here for you today so I hope you enjoy both games if you do be sure to leave a like rating and if you're new around here if you could subscribe to join the i-10 fire of incredible as well I'll see you all in five half seconds my friends as a golf gun in the middle there is a gold weapon I've got myself some armored stop with all gun I'm pre was he the caustic it's you have the gun he's literally six al French he's six health but because he takes 15% reduce damage any of the character part from Gibraltar will be dead here a nice sister caustic is one big guy and he's fortified unfortunately which means in my long but I was doing less than if you damage crazy emotional how much juice I'm gonna be teammate but I know people lend it over there I'm gonna try my best this is not good whatsoever it's gonna make sure they're not rushing you're going to dissuade them from pushing fast no it's 9 I got a sniper and she's fleeing the scene Rhode Island some mug shots or look at that other Varma's switched with I'm pretty sure that level one on the floor there is the armor that my team it must have dropped I think he army switch it out already oh I was a close one I think we might be a bit too lay here when the good news EC scott-little loot since has just been respawn the bad news is I've got a level one of Evo shield here oh come on farm some damage Hostel spotted Hamal d is high on Z's a bit of a bit of an armor disparity between us though I've got 25 armor this man's gotta gotta risky near the edge this guy's got a hundred this one he'll do we go graded I didn't want to challenge these guys too much friend I need 150 damage that's not too bad a bit you'll take three only 39 but I mean I did here my life willing to risk it be stuck on the Pathfinder is probably if you need it I grated my name evil shorter so mental now they are so mental one gunfights and you get off I believe I've you okay who's living up to his name the is @dj IV boss or djv boss or havoc I was right here if his hobby boss in Spanish so close I don't think we need to back up honestly I don't think that's necessary definite necessary we're fine here mind of sketchy I will have meat let's do what hell you are my friend why only known in the trade as suprema root you you literally weren't there you literally went there I look there and no one was there teammate I'm ton about Zahir look and even though I believe the raid Evo is probably better than gold shields if you have shield batteries which I do you can take a free of charge go at the rope over there see me have a 30-second contact with target guys doing thank you is there a bouncy castle over there are you guys you guys had a kid's birthday party you can move in time it's not it's an octane strong pet all right we've figured out the mystery mystery solved Oh imagine goodnight I see ya girl triple sec sniper shotgun there's guys waving my sister does the smoke is peeking through the top okay I move on to that girl it's alright bit of teamwork last squads a man care package on the second storm and this is the last squad things you absolutely hate to hear oh my god oh I'm going over there one because you don't very often see fires with gold Lutz and two because I don't want to be a diving board we let's go this way especially with the trim or tape no it's the ultimate dweeb combination the dweeb machine isn't even that bad anymore okay we've got a new fleet machine it's the triple take I'll tell you what use it as a shotgun there's actually been a lot of fun the only issue with this gun at the moment is that you very rarely find precision chokes you used to find the Quaffle before because obviously the Peacekeeper is quite quite common oh okay already said goodbye you can take this if you want or you can buy some of my care package devotion Hilly's packages because it's someone on your friends list come on got exam bus he was am very sorry chef Jill I had to tell her I'd say thank you for the good loot the gold re force five dreams this is always fun when this one spot left and the circles absolutely ginormous so what's my favorite parts and why do we find you yeah yeah do you round to nearly two hundred damaging combo they're in total these guys are putting their heads back on after we might read George everyone's got a score people we men y'all sit up there I didn't get up there it's a different angle I've got a plan yeah don't worry Dori I'm gonna bring you up with me he sees this is bad this is bad I got you there you go don't rush you more fine I don't know if your flat line is any competition heaven okay mines noise my job will take what is need to go up there together and then they at least they can't - he want us you know you're 40 for another 72 nice this is why path - often these are bad for health I think fantastic one when you get the seen up top that's why one pattern is so fun because you can push people like that instead of it being a standoff and to thinking about it now suppose even worse another diving board because at least everyone can get to diving board I don't think everyone can get on top of these lawn pillars the pillars of doom you could call them sick skip wait six kills wait wait hold on a sec whoa whoa whoa how do we get even kills I need 1400 and five more damage mental Pathfinder swim there how do you feel about yes sir I love it I'm gonna the opposite side because I was lying close so I never get anything [Music] now I'm gonna take a risk in line close and probably get nothing okay jump out if you Nate well there's so many people I have a havoc of one

work with him it'll be I mean everybody's kind of good but like everything you know everyone else is also is a little bit better than Pathfinder huh nah he's still fun that's the best the main part that's all that really matters yeah you got to fly on the map like a lunatic yeah we're gonna get we're gonna get tactical about it that fighters kind of cheeks like he's literally a refrigerator yeah he's he's still big white shield crack back down on the right it's mental I felt bad using you sometimes oh you've already one shot didn't even mean say I just went straight into that yeah I saw the grapple ended you hit the ground and he dropped the portal definitely like frame perfect it was landed I'll sculpt a say if you fancy you know what I'm gonna sit with the hemlock and look eBay I did this a lot too you don't I I'm trying to tempt you with different guns I think you know what I'm good I'm good I'm like you sure we got a skull piece okay I'm weird though like I'm a weird player like oh you wanna know what I do then I pick up guns and whatever guns I land on I just use you just join me I stick them yeah yeah like I never really want my weapons up which I should cuz it's the whole idea of the game is to like loot upgrade you know as the game goes on get better stuff but I don't know I've had any practice to grapple since season 5k mate you remember that one game that I play Pathfinder one me and you play like one game and every single time I hit a grapple I was like panicking it seems like it's such a big commitment yeah well like you kind of you kind of you grapple in and you have like a timing in your head it's like muscle memory but like it's like a time thing oh yeah why do you have your next grapple but I would like grappling commit to a fight thinking I have my grapple oh but I didn't have my grapple out I seem to remember you still calling a Manning site and you're like I don't have my grapple then you're doing for another like 15 seconds oh they're right here it's course it guys I have enough I have my rabbit at all okay - Scott's left I'm gonna set it I'm gonna set it right here what's up boys I was cracked on me I mind his corner if you're near I think he's gonna nice is it going slide yeah she inside I'll go sent back to she's really hurt she's almost reaching it has an auto problem a tree sir he's fine with that thing autumn so mental

sucks for him because officer we got the revenant Holtz just came straight back yeah there is what woody what does the guy do like a situation like that that's what rabbit is easy so good Oh Jenks off absolutely good stuff I see him what is he doing it's really far away and I've just absolutely the spot of this entry I just noticed that it's only round two closing right now yeah and this is on this team I think they're going to containment yes then we're going from left to right I think they're going containment maybe even towards this care package with some thought now when I start down a center are there you go in there come over to the Oh care package or something all the beams I hit the caustic three times three times on purple that's it three times we thought we'd walk good I'm gonna I'm gonna beam this guy through this door right now classic has speedo I hate close ranged if I'm so bad I got one I meant like wow like I hate it he's still weak I think did he have the stop press I'm not sure who it is the other guy does where'd you knock the other guy around he's somewhere like this side this building like that I don't know where he is yeah no about self result yeah I think everything is before it is in he's in the hotties he came in with one else nice job man well I couldn't hear the sofa is going off those like what he had him call the way I didn't know who's gonna come in or what I should have charts keep an eye on that guy they're a close range I'm so bad but it's Kim on my 10 feet Pollock social distancing it's not this they don't come beam people if they're any close on that I am NOT struggling okay regardless we win nice job dude
