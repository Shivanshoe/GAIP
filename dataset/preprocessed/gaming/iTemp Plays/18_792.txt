hey wassup Ghazi twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the game that I've got for you today is going to include some gameplay of the gold Mozambique a gun that we have seen before however we've not seen it like this before it's got nine how do you take nine rounds per magazine you can shoot it nine times and it's an absolutely ludicrous gun the first game that I tried at least I had a beautiful game I didn't use it much and I didn't realize the entire time but these actual variants of the gun doesn't come with hammer points I was trying to weaken them with the havoc and then shoot them with the Mozambique when they're Sheila's didn't really work out in fact I think I only discovered that at the start of this game I didn't realize that it didn't come with hammer points but anyway I'm sure this gun is not going to be the game for too long so if you can jump on today and try and get a few games with it he's a ton of fun you find them everywhere but yes thank you for watching I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends alright sorting back to release my friends hopefully all and I at the same door you show would advise against it but in these circumstances but there's a lot of loops at this place it's actually decent all strategy don't worry this coin going but you stole the gun was that a havoc you stole by haven't then you retreated what Pat find a friend they look up my health fat binder you could have literally just punch me I mean he was now stuff I was trying to get there I wanted it to be a habit don't absolutely Phoenix myself friends all right weird start I don't see any Mozambique's in the feed I hope they didn't take it out already I'm not sure how early I am to the Mozambique fun here I mean I've already won a game but I've barely used it I think I got like one maybe two kill today no this game I'm gonna try my level best uh I thought it's gonna be the world's greatest quadrant I just lost all momentum try our best to actually fine so use the Mozambique more but the first thing we need to do is actually get myself a Mozambique and these guys are these guys have them July calm down chill No so close they're still fighting each other down there oh nice say friend I have no health I've healed I'm sorry I've shields but no he levels thanks friends I really want that gold Mozambique from the Pathfinder so it's absolutely popping off that I mean it is actually such a fun gun to you so I'll be honest I'm never gonna bother healing or rushing this guy we can't shoot all of us at once hey go nice job God havoc ok this is a decent little setup we've got here I'll be taking that thing a gold havoc and a gold Mozambique the havoc isn't a dagger to joke with the Mozambique definitely is there's no way this is standing the game piece an absolute joke of a weapon it's unbelievable I've heard people describe it as and I'd say what their their accurate descriptions I would argue I make rounds in there am i wish i need your aims thank you thank you how's he trying to top the level 3 I'm good thank you friend you take that I'll use the level 2 I'm happy with this these guys could have had something decent when you can stack shotgun ammo up to 48 now so you don't read any two stacks but if you're gonna if you're gonna play today and use two Mozambique's which I've seen people do you might as well have work three stacks of ammo cuz you do sprite still it's got nine shots between the same you can just spray it all there if you want to do only thing that can really help I don't think this will take it out and try I was late anyway nearly messed it up for the team all right got my god maozim our loot is looking pretty tasty zat to level two shields as chin of Tahoe should London appear is that the link look I'm gold Mozambique I could do a look you know no I regret it instantly I haven't used the god havoc in a while and I do need some sort of medium to long range options you know modems pretty good but it can't contest it at longer ranges oh okay I'll go behind wait I seem alright I'm gonna use the Mozambique I was going to get in their faces music [Music] oh this doesn't have honey that's embarrassing I didn't even check to see if you how to hammer points around nice job tonight I've been trying to like to take people shield up and then switch the Mozambique where really I should do this I'll try again but really it's just been a mistake to go there's no how 20 you get nine shotgun shells in there - they brush nice if we can just keep the smoked if you've all got Mozambique you should be okay receipts in a position bounced right through the through the to proto shield safe uno mas some way so did you put some purple shields what was it blue absolutely tremendously smoked this long Mozambique cannot confuse to the body Bacchus though I don't know actually who has a gold item that may be interested in authorized the god Mozambique so I've already got one there everywhere I've got a god Mozambique and a golf haba god thanks French yeah cuz I'm gonna be out after this no I'm not gonna be here I have five five of these males I'll show them off there you go I'm gonna find it so many sealed batteries recently alright five kills two with these little Mozambique shotgun ammo wouldn't go and they say it but apart from that I think we are good to get there mmm freak cancer fear into the next fight oh it's actually landed okay give me a second this is got gold shields it's got three gold shields to everyone on the team actually or devotion here with the havoc I'm just worried I'm gonna run out of ammo on the devotion it's still fairly early in the game that's the only thing with these legendary weapons I don't like taking them when it's like I know that's 18 people that but I don't like to take them in the mid game like I've run out of ammo so soon before the end of the game and then I'll be like one weapon man half man half one weapon you know I don't to be stranded with just one gun is what I'm saying I'm gonna take you thank you Frank now are you I've never done that before but this will allow me to get in their faces with the gold Mose am I don't have to pay quite as defensive okay well this is not safe it seems pretty pointless we should turn around friends let's one a two-piece okay I just stuck that surface I'd give that a 10 a 10 just for the fact that I stuck to the surface always I was going down another shield battery these things are absolutely ever after some reason I mean I'm not complaining personal favorite healable watch this what is so folks someone say another why you are get started I didn't mean to she didn't miss y'all rev the engine up a little bit my doing this is ridiculous maybe it's not his friend I don't know yeah okay well we found where the fight is and the fight is at Planet monster yes all right I'll get it does everyone have gold armor or something here that's three people in a row of cake to spit fire he's not going to stop using the reload isn't even that long so we back to me here in a second if I'm not please don't thank you oh my God look my health bloodhound ultimate as well so hopefully they hunted me down teammate if you can make it to me I mean I could party to scrap it to you here you can around the street Rick wants to okay that would have been the most embarrassing death of the 21st century get back here you hey where'd he go who's of Revenue's height you mister gone outside and even here the doors there he's probably chin on top of the building now people are still fine okay you're back why all right team I'm gonna get you back just give me the cold chill thank you you didn't take the bag but definitely press X on that whatever that's fine don't need the bag teammates crapping on here friends you don't need me I assume that was the revenant need to press that one I'm into preston's have fun I wanted a nice friendly message all right well there's people over here that killed a few people and they will have to move before us are you a cold chills -

my name star there are people Hostel spotted let's go this way I definitely sign that lights let's go this way oh that must be the Pathfinder it's mainly straight back to oh my god I've just done so much damage the hex these are you doing fret that's going on you getting shot at and the race still has a weapon she's literally still holding a weapon this is completely stuffed I'm leaving the Wraith my team is can do whatever they like with the race it's got a drip you seen steady I love it still thing look at this thing look at the damage output here nice job teammates look how fast you can fire this thing's unbelievable unbelievable I don't know what that seconds last team was trying to do if you could leave a comment I mean I tried to leave the right alone I did shoot her a little late but then I thought you know what I'm gonna my teammates deal with her I'm gonna show you the team I think what it feel too bad I nearly did 3000 damage today somehow how did that happen yeah I'm not on that so I was going on but I'm glad that happened because I have a feeling with the high ground that that team had on us that we would have been killed by them if they weren't trying to organize some sort of six-man boxing match or something I'm not I'm not I mean I think trust them because the race still had a good you know I was a loudly on edge and I knew the team started firing I don't know the Mozambique though he's he's 10 outing it's a ludicrous out of 10 that's my writing thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you on the next one
