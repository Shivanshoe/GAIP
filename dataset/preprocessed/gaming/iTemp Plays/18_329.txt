hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the rampage lmg the new gun in season 10 is absolutely unreal we've had some underwhelming gun drops in the past where they needed buffs to make the new releases useful the sentinel for example but the rampage i mean even without being charged up this weapon packs a massive punch you pop a thermite into it and you're laughing the damage is incredible so thanks for watching guys be sure to subscribe to my channel for more apex season 10 content and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends today this is never a bad choice it's not it's not people just come here anyway there's a lot of masters and prez guys in this lobby is that okay yeah a lot of a lot of trails i saw that's the thing with trails you get the the triple stacks uh raises one reloading enemy down sweat she got heals thank you right so he's actually kind of like halfway close to red and when we picked it up because the arm switched can't blame him very unfortunate didn't you just see the arm and i forgot i forgot what i had i mean it doesn't matter we both can run energy i've had like 300 ammo wait he left and dropped all his stuff on the left i think he said to him beforehand this guy had energy teammates so he left us all his stuff and then dropped his ultimate at least he was a nice guy but all right let's see what we can see shots [Music] was there a guy here i heard someone flying oh over here right there bro i'm dead i'm popping uh fred okay wilmer just wilmer just screwed me dude giving my shields a recharge did you see what happened though was it oh it was the pad yeah i went up the road but i hit the pad back i need to kill two of them so that's why they didn't rush enemy taken down oh you know what i did too i don't know why oh giants i'm dead yeah they know where i am too uh you should be host yeah i thought i was oh my god that's the worst grapple i'm on a 100 pin it's weird that's my arc one's ground floor yeah yeah there's lots of people on the ropes dude they're just bouncing around like maniacs not going crazy mate nice nice mate that's literally we're stacking them up yeah unlucky for you is that what you can do about it energy ammo here i've got way too much dude way too much energy much energy this is everywhere dude i got 60 light and over 300 energy i've got a decent amount of light if you need it no no no no no i'm just using an elsa anyways oh here we go where's that oh down there okay yeah who's ready oh i'm skipping i'm charging this bad boy up oh yeah i'm picking up the rear button coming in is oh my god i need thermites i never look for thermites it's going to be so difficult for me to remember i don't have any for you i never look for him i'll fill my grenade yes oh there might be oh dude it's so weird oh there's a guy right here he walked in my own cracked one tremendous oh my god he couldn't do anything i just hit him with my [Laughter] i grappled landed right next to you ignored the guy that you were shooting at just to get my guy you know you didn't need my help i have three but it might be four i'm gonna put it down here for you so you don't have to go up who wants to climb that thank you i'm horrible applying that it's horrendous dude i can't get over like how how good this area looks like they nailed it man it's like the new colors and everything beautiful like even little things like look at underneath here like the way the shadows are underneath here it's like it's so much brighter yeah everything this is so much it's better i reckon before you could hide under there or something not be spotted you could you could all destroy outside the ring oh you can do it with your gun holsters yes yeah yeah someone said i think yeah yeah i'm gonna pop this yellow but i am no okay you got it recharged took out an enemy i really don't think he did that guy explored me he didn't miss a shot that was unfortunate oh just that's an awkward spot for me to fire him anyway i'd have taken the fight he wasn't in that weird spot behind the post right yeah i didn't i didn't expect to just get exploded like that my fault i didn't like the angle we were at because i thought one was flanking so i went down to the right so you were alone for a good while maybe it's my fault i'll show that you know see if he's coming back in business he died no i missed the pad oh there's another one here i had a cool little setup going i've got no thermos left now as well do you have a thermite left i do huge i'm in your box string sorry you have permission i need to try this rampage with rampa oh what is this oh they're getting altered no i think that's them i think they're using it defensively to see oh they killed me oh god i volts but there's a nice little oh my god oh i didn't pick up the finger yeah this is kind of broken if you've got an infinite supply of mites dude yeah i'm using um i got it three times on this all-star now and it's oh okay it's pretty good i found a gold mag and another thermite and another thermometer yes well i thought they were using their their thing as defensively you know like yeah just wrestle and put this down to see if anybody walks in it makes sense but oh my face is all you i'm gonna give it i'm gonna give it a whirl man i'm gonna give this thing a whirl mate in the care package spitfire alternator crater like how can you not check them oh the k package is the most old piece ever been yeah i agree oh the all this is gonna feel so good i'm not gonna hear a fight just that way yes oh i'm excited to use this thing dude oh my god oh they're so far away where they are these are two of the last three teams wait what is this dude i got exploded one burst from a prowler and then he headshot me with a wing map while we was on i guess that was insane i tried them both so i knew i could raise the right behind us though oh you can see me have you got your ability yeah yeah i use it once i need to cracked oh my god oh my god no more thingies thermites oh oh i don't have any for you either there's gonna be another gun for you and i thought no there's gonna be one for you spitfire oh i can't drop from my rampage i'm popping off i'm in there oh yeah dude he's so good he's actually so good that was nuts yeah see it's moved across the elsa is pretty insane by the way i'm not firing it and i'm like destroying how much of a difference does the lower visual effects make it's crazy dude 52 red there's a guy on there too i wish there was a thermite giving my shields a recharge i need a bit of heavy did they have any uh nope this guy didn't have any wait they went in here no come on guys well they're going to come out soon yeah they're running away no shot wait janks we just see up there wait i think we can go in bro i got alternator with disruptors i just use my tactical on them and we just go in you got the rampage but they need to come out of there they use their ultimate their ability already they're using a low bra i'm using my all i'm going to bring punch him in the back of the head yeah yo that's so dude
