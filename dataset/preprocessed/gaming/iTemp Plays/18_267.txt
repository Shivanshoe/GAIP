hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we picked up a crater whilst playing solo and it may just have saved the game for us i also just wanted to take a second here to thank you guys who watched my video from yesterday it was a hell let loose gameplay that i played with so far that i was originally going to post my second channel that i have but i had such a good time recording and editing the video and i thought it was actually a really funny vid i just wanted to share with as many of you guys as possible and because of how well it did and the good reception that it got i'm tempted to start mixing in some other games here and there on this channel probably one a week that sort of level and i really do appreciate you guys watching them and leaving your comments in those videos so thank you very much for that but yeah thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends this star wars music really hypes me up now i've got on random so sometimes it's star wars music sometimes it's like the og apex music thank you for the law there bloodhead i don't actually know what you said but i'll try and keep that in mind all right i've got a good loader here that's not shy caps okay my teammates find someone else oh here we go thank you gondola gondola is the mvp let's let's not let's not make any mistake here i need to help amigo i could have grappled on that pathfinder why is it like did you have a gun they both cracked you just have a weapon hey looks like you're throwing through did he leave the game right so i don't care if you're teabagging i'm not i'm not interested i'm going to shoot you it's my first game of the day i i feel like i shouldn't be using the 30 30. first game of the day aims feeling a little bit a little bit too tight i need to loosen up and the best way to get results when you feel like you're not at your absolute peak is to use spray weapons um and hope for the best where did this guy die because i left he was teabagging up top i've no idea where he went yeah we are pinched he see me i can't stay i'm gonna wrap around we're pinched i'm in absolute shambles i can't lie making contact he got two kills from that but we're the ones that survived because i wrapped around i made it so i was the one that was third partying rather than me being the one that got third partied that is the way to do it i'll absolutely take two times flatline thank you i thought about taking four of these i think the next thing for us to do especially because we have to go this way if the safe zone is just to run its cap the big cap no mind why didn't you just yeah why did you do that beforehand though i don't understand well something tells me this is a terrible terrible making contact trade enemy oh he's pinching them okay i need to just distract these guys a little bit sorry one absolutely outrageous maneuver from my teammate there well played amigo that's the best way to deal with a sheila you know get the the pizza maneuver on the go he won his 1v1 against the bangalore i managed to take out the mobile sheila do you know what i think i may have overestimated the mobile sheila i was almost certain it was gonna get unnerved but i don't see people using it anymore apart from that guy and he wasn't he wasn't too successful i need some energy rooms all right zones closing these guys were fighting i assume they're still around there somewhere that guy's name is covering half my screen so if there was someone over here i wouldn't be able to see them i'm in a bad spot oh my god i was trying to slide please why didn't he let me slide yeah take that my teammates getting involved i have to join oh in teammate nice job there we go bit of energy no extended energy mag though which is an absolute tragedy are these the guys that were fighting over here when we went back to loot because there's no one over this way i mean we're gonna have to move pretty quick i need energy 100 an extended energy oh today's a good day i am what is currently known in the uh the industry is fleeing the scene i am running away from the ring and i'm getting involved in any scraps that are going on in the scrap tool which brings me to another topic that i've been thinking about recently people have been calling for it the destruction of scraptor city it happened to uh happen to school time is firing this way i'm here anymore though it's this way somewhere there we go i hear it what do you guys think do you think they should destroy this place because i mean this game is an exception but if you don't land here often you you can't really find too many fights i'm gonna play this careful because i can't really rush this close team because then the team on stream of building will rush us and we'll get third partied and it's sort of played slow what was that i'm getting pushed through a window i've never seen anything like it recharging shields i think that's the time to get involved go that way i'll i'll pinch maneuver them it's worked for us before i hate the l star i'm not saying that wasn't my fault but what i am saying is that when he started blasting with the l-star i couldn't really see anything on my screen i'm trusting your teammate i'm using my only need for this lucky us we are already knows there's a care package dropping there are two teams left show battery no i'm good believe me i am i'm more than good i'm fully prepared to go for this with how i'm playing i think a spitfire is my best it's my best hope and the craba is my least amount of hope with my current accuracy and level that i'm playing it's first game of the day all of a sudden it's got really cold in the uk i don't know if you guys are from the uk many of you but it's absolutely freezing all of a sudden it's a crater here if your mountain keyboard you might want to take that if you don't take it and we can't leave it here can we what gun do i sacrifice flatline i love i got a lot of energy now i'll take the goblin inside the ring um one of the reasons i'm taking this is because i left a crabber before and then someone headshot me with it so it's not often ending scrap at all i don't often finish a game in market and broken i need energy ammo did i think you guys would have anything you probably died 12 seconds into the game most optimistic death box check of 2021 shields okay oh there's loads on the roof too i need it is that a lifeline package could be a mobile respawn all right i'll come back for that end jam if i need it on the barn i'll leave it pinged i should be good 160 and i'm going to try and use the crater anyway is that fake fight come back up on this at least with the ark stars would have been nice they've scammed me oh my god sorry teammate 150 are the guys basically cracked too i'm dead i'm dead charge your pk hit me like 110 i think we might lose here unless my teammate confirmed by this beautifully that charger pk i shouldn't have kicked the door in i mean my melee missed as well i forgot the melee's like you can't even hear anyone you can't what are you doing lifeline get out of here my teammates popping off this guy's a demon just the five teammate we'll get him we'll get these guys i'm not going to make the mistake again they're reviving honest i don't know i don't even have enough time i just need to chill out you need to calm down i'm never kicking the door into a charged pk again my entire shield was just gone they disappeared okay let's take that okay you're lucky i suck okay if i was good you'd be dead just think about that who's this bad boy that's me with it either right that's how i play no please oh i had to push that one oh my word actually under the crater headshot possibly the first one of my apex career i love celebrating with my best friends not not my greatest accuracy performance but i will take a finish like that kick the door from the bloodhound into a crabber headshot into some revenge on the seer well i dropped nearly 3000 damage i felt like i felt like i wasn't actually i mean i must have been but that game was actually kind of long we started in climatizer i actually did really well i did that a lot i think i didn't do that great come to the end screen i honestly i thought i was on maybe 1800 damage i don't know where nearly 3000 came from i'll take that gg
