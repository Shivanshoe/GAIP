hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some valkyrie because i am really loving her kids i thought her flying could be more of a gimmick but it's actually really responsive and useful if you know how to use it i have two games for you today the first one is ranked on board's edge and because it was my first ranked game of the split apex thought i was still in diamond and diamond lobbies at the moment are full of masters and pred players trying to get back to predator and there was me and so far in a duo and one of us was playing valk and so far was trying to learn how to use the bow and before you say oh you're in gold it was a gold lobby you will see the trails at the start of the game and there are actual pro players in this game so i don't want to hear it okay it counts and the second one was a really fun arena game against some really good players there as well i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends friend masters lobby look at those dogs look at the uh look at the trails look at the trails i'm not gonna lie i'm actually so mad that we're not going to fragment i've never been so mad so i hope he goes down i'll have to i'll take it back i hope i'm in there hopefully i'll be popped off let's go wiggity nice this guy tried to punch me reloading i'm just holding this i'm getting bowed i'm pretty sure yeah well is that you i need to arm switch on it but [Applause] popping off over here i might just fly up here let's check this quadrant big big down i'm gonna get it down here i'm gonna get it down here i'll create one trick oh my god i wasn't even expecting it to be from there but all right i still threw an eight in there oh my god what is happening over there oh the bubble saved him so bad i need some heavy oh no i don't have a lot oh my god what is it happening i only have a g7 dude i don't know don't you don't have to rush in careful there's like four teams here i mean it's just one more horizon oh no i'm still getting shot confirmed yeah i forgot i was lifeline i can't fly he's on that roof i think i might join in uh 10 seconds pretty sure it's on our roof yeah they're closed i need to swap guns i really need to all right this is tragic ah i've got two months you need one um yeah okay here you go get ready thank you thank you thank you he's going this way you can cruise over here actually don't know who's seeing us hit 2 for 70. uh nice look at this one no they're outside this is the biggest value phoenix you've ever seen just dropping all types of stuff using a bow and an ebay that'll entire fire these guys got the work you should've seen my flight pattern call me the 737 max jumbo don't call me that do you do you have any bats um i have three i can drop something yes please just you know that's reno does the uh this doesn't fall down faster does it i i don't know i didn't read the patch notes for her but mates because i never played lifeline and when i do i never dropped her drone but it feels like it did yeah evo shield here level three uh right key so is it just an upgrade to anyone on the team i guess so i could do that though thank you and a bag huge this is huge for me literally nothing from oh well actually i gotta buy i'll drive you about here don't buy me thank you thank you thank you shannon wiggity by the way huh shout out wigadee oh yeah he's all he's holding his own good job i feel bad for uh not believing in him i feel bad for those enemies that just got finessed by the 737 dreamliner i'm just not i'm never going to call you that ever yeah i hope you know you should have seen that like i went low ground because they were chasing and then i flew over their heads as they jumped down and you could see i just i locked eyes them as they were going past and you could see the look of disappointedness as they realized they got finessed by the dreamliner themselves you know you know i i i know exactly how it feels because yesterday i was fighting a uh a valkyrie and she did the same thing to me where she kind of like maneuvered and flew up when i like jumped down and it just broke my heart yeah devastated right wait they know we're here because yeah yeah they are wings up i zoom in yeah these are jets so everybody on the map nose are here okay wings out like that yeah yeah they all know they know we're here there's another team come behind this is two separate seams this is this is a bad this is a bad spot for the dreamliners okay we can we can hold this spot right here now uh we need these guys the third part they went into that other choke point okay there's another team there's another team this is one guy you know you know man for 15. he's got gold let's make sure they're combined remember this is the drop on this is kind of crazy i literally can't i can't cancel my rockets like there's nothing i can do are you kidding me are you shooting the rocks what did they do to you rich that's a huge scam oh we should rotate we ran the wrong way ridiculously hard we should go back through skyhook because we know it's somewhat safe the flight is actually really good yeah i mean they have those mechanics down back from giant ball that's right it's kind of little little i mean they tweaked it a little bit but i mean i feel like most of the stuff is probably very similar to how they did the like the jet packs and stuff in time for time for copied apex though that is true that is true i forgot about that a bit controversy about that i saw yeah you gotta let your community know that because that's that's a big deal i don't know people know well a little bit i mean it's like a bit of both isn't it yeah i mean people play kind of weird and they do they rank lobbies compared to algs oh yes he's definitely different i would be so happy if i could just hit one shot oh my god i got stuck it's such a fair mechanic i don't know i don't remember thank his armor switched yeah he talked to a while i think i'm just flying you need to be me wait i have no healer this is really bad for the boy i have a bat i'm not getting shields i'm actually trying to so awkward that's how i feel uh i feel about valkyrie no i i i'm in agreement because i'm literally just trolling oh there's a team here we got ourselves a bandit out there they're full three stack protein look at these guys see there in the lgs yeah we are look at this spot this arrow though is actually so much fun it's not fair how good and how fun it is okay so we had our kp so we were chilling up here for quite a while in the background i've put together a nice little montage of what it's like being a controller player with a one times hemlock and peaking three professional mouse and keyboard apex players at range with bows it didn't really like it wasn't it wasn't good it wasn't a good strategy but that's okay because we were the dreamliners and we had a plan to use valkyrie's alt to get us a favorable late game position to win this game it was the dreamliner's dream that's not where this works right now where even is that rock dead wait what i died in the sky okay we literally just got focused by everyone everyone i don't know what else we could do honestly yeah i think we don't do that um i was more vulnerable sweet and dropped in all of this okay so ranked yeah so maybe ranked is not it okay our teammates cracked uh enemies are cracked too by the way oh nice gonna try yeah they're actually no they're actually cracked okay so then do i not buy uh no don't oh my god you're rampant oh god i i'm gonna go crazy rich don't don't do this don't do this i'm gonna go crazy watch demon time i think it's pretty good too this should be a fun game you can't change legends can you no which is kind of annoying uh come up to the wall mate if you've got your stuff we need to we need to get there oh you know what i still have to take all of them you can press square what did you not buy into 25 seconds with 500 credits you can buy one gun mate like what i forgot to change the oh i upgraded my yeah i thought i changed it you haven't got six times yes okay 1 12. huge need shields right here and he's not sharing oh you want to decide he's on the cat back 134 on the middle in the middle of one hour knock that guy down i don't have an angle on the other guy it's just it should be just one more reloading i'm going with you are they knocked or like thirsty pretty sure he rests i like giving my shields a recharge hey i told you to buy the extended warranty what are you doing he's up top noise dude what's him in the head76 nice that was just like a game of cat and mouse good great i all i had was a bow and a and a sentinel so i was like how do i play this i wouldn't have died if i had teammate left a bat he took two bats of phoenix and a medkit from that crate and then run off oh my god he's going crazy that guy all right make sure you change his sight i've got a wingman and a vault still yeah yeah should i might go can i i've gone g7 i'm going on g7 vault i'll play my plate thank you thank you i keep forgetting that you can like exit the buy screen and go to go to the wall yeah for me to remember to have it now it's one noob i don't think they're doing this tactics 70 on one nice yes these guys are furious they're on the street get definitely the guy the seven that john oh they're they're so mad right now furious and furious i know they're so mad that i'm picking rapper and spamming whoever's got the 31st of their team he's popping me i think it's the right it's the yeah it's the it's the rate the rate is pretty good yeah it's a funny thing they're all pretty decent this is way more fun when the team's good you know and it's way more fun when your teammate doesn't leave yeah and that team is good as well so yeah when it's more balanced like this it's a lot it's a lot more fun it's way more fun keeps running for this cab like that they might have to expect of course having had shot play form one charging on my shield missing all my shots what time am i in 47 on this falcon i have two bats if you need one let me know um i just use my last one i'll drop one hold on the translating cracks oh he picked a weird angle yeah i love it uh do you have a bat yes my last one but yeah thank you oh my god is actually nasty with the sentinel oh well played that's way more from the other teams like good players you know yeah it was it's way more intense that was awesome dude i know they're so mad at all the shields the shields and the scents now what a combo that's a great combo dude i love it i want to make that a meta unplayable played nice oh you're popping off too
