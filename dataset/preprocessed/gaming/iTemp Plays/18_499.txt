hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some loba one of the last legends that i've tried since their recent changes in season eight and the reason is that her change was so niche and difficult to utilize uh if you didn't know you can now loot care packages with your black market ultimate without having to open it first we did manage to use this new change in the game that i have for you today but i have just one request for respawn in terms of low back both her tactical it sucks it's so telegraphed and slow and the distance is bad you barely get any verticality from it you have this 35 second animation when you land so if you don't look both ways before crossing the road you'll just scrub mcgroad as you can tell i'm very passionate about this subject her ultimate is fine especially after being buffed like three times we just need some lower bracelet changes soon she could be so fun but thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm playing arcane after this i have a horizon already yeah we should have uh we could have full sent them and if i was path we could have done it as well i mean to be fair i could have done it as a ryzen 2. yeah i could have done it as low back but then they would have seen me sitting there for a long time i love knowing where the purple arms are oh yeah skimp dude everything is literally purple for you too there's no white armor on the ground it's so good it's actually kind of good it is you know she is all right you can just find everything instantly i've been first i don't know i'm gonna get some flag for these i've been underestimating the mosaic i've actually i've landed in like four shot people with a mozart it's kind of nice it's not that bad considering it's really not people snoozing on it dude i do i mean eating fast obviously get hammers not saying he's better than any other gun but it's not as bad as i thought it was that's what i'm saying i have absolutely no problem running a mozambique especially with hammers like i i will happily do it welcome to the shop really not that bad for you there's a direct team on your head um i think they're inside you are coming home with me tonight is there a nine in the box or not uh probably um no no there is there are two of them yeah wait so i dropped my bat the heck i need about i have three um no wait [Music] then guys need cracks nice job mate here we took out the whole squad what were they thinking i don't know bro that that bloodhound jumped on my head he rudy didn't even give you a second oh light making the crafter too oh perfect i'm just gonna go back purple light meg on the nine you got a nine two yeah yeah oh yeah we're gonna get a couple light makes for the boys here it is i played with so far last night oh yeah and we had so many really good games but it was like we weren't like really pushing anything it was it was weird man i haven't had an experience like that a long time but you know what we play usually it's like four squads left round one yeah it wasn't hap it was happening but it wasn't happening as often it was kind of crazy sometimes oh someone's on me oh no no no it's a marvelous marvel sorry marvin got distracted by his long arcade oh and his life don't believe her is that from marvin yeah he can leave i'll land live delivery he's earned his day if we landed there and got double purple from him it would have been the best so i hear a rat i hear a rat oh zerg oh my god oh this this poor soul oh let me hear you i was gonna shoot just like one bullet and then it just happened to be a head shot yes that's all it took he died uh there's about there i already have four of them i need a turbo i could give it a go with this i'm going to see if there's one turbo charger here come see the merchandise no extended heavy objects here that's in the care package isn't it that gold um site is definitely the care package wait the power in the care package can i yank it i joined one last time dude that's the first time you've ever grabbed a gold uh an heirloom gun from this yeah yeah because you can loot the care packages without them being open now that's so sick i love that that was the buff it's a good buff it's pretty it's so it's okay i think they need to buffer actually nobody doesn't need the alt change bro if anything loba should be able to take four items from her from i've always said this why is it always why is it the same for your teammates it's my ability it's my ultimate let her take four i don't think it's op i feel like she should be able to take four and then because i think about it man how many times do you have to sit there and ponder and like uh which one do i need to go like you gotta pick and choose right lobo shouldn't have to pick and choose yeah she should have so many options in there she should just get looted for me exactly oh he needs to get there does he get the leftovers yeah exactly or they could just buffer tactical and make it so you don't actually get stunned you know you should be able to just throw it more than six feet low but what was tack is the most underwhelming tactical in this entire game i don't know how they have i don't think that they've ever touched it right i don't think they've ever actually buffed it they kind of nerfed it low key by accident when world's edge came back i don't know what they did but they changed something to the attack and it was it you couldn't throw it on on uh sloped surfaces oh okay yeah i was completely broken on one's edge yeah like it low-key kind of got worse if anything direct not gonna land it on here will that work drive that one dude if i would have kept running in a straight line i still would have been in front of you but i turned around for the 360. i was just checking to see if it would land on there um storms coming in from this way but oh behind literally where we were nice thanks guys shall we go up top and then walk down yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you sound just like the dog thank you thank you oh someone's close oh they're so dead huge i don't know where the wraith went she probably phased something right understand why you came down here this team's everywhere oh hey the back there's another team shooting us i don't know why oh he's honest oh i did not connect don't mind me i'm just sliding yeah i'm going to shop from everywhere people stop this paper towel yeah yeah how are they all shooting you i don't know excuse me they don't hit these i stick it i stick it all day long all day long baby all day long i almost switched oh my god jenks how are you all shooting up oh my god i'm going to kill this team right now they can't be that good i'm getting there they give me a little bit [Music] underneath no no one does rejuvenating thank you what a clutch there's two teams here by the way let's finish that team there's two purple switches in that building because that's where the marbling was okay uh guy right here can we come in we got a runner against on the side right 90 flush rate huge i'm on the way damn they killed the boat scam yeah oh yeah [Music] the turbo as well and 300 bullets i'm so happy that they died nice i kind of got a little annoyed with all those teams shooting at us oh god i might be really good stress relief did you know that a lady never kills and tells did you know that more time no it's news to me oh now you know that's just the love of things dude nobody's gonna think of her own though that's true can do whatever the hell she wants to do and get away with it she can i mean i'm fully looted i don't know what i want from this there's a gold spitfire spitfire here let's go back stay on the ground i think that i think there's gonna be a team oh my god one of each oh my god i think there's gonna be team right here at this care pack wait there should have been there should have been one more team here and they're probably going to loot this if i was a betting man they're going to be right here someone said the enemy over there i wonder what they found they hadn't made the rotation they didn't even shoot me in the open so hey i hit one for a hundred me down kind of going easy on i'm toying with him but like oh my god he destroyed my life i hit him for like over 100 dogs because i just thought maybe she'll back up and then no she didn't she just was gonna kill her yeah of course it was all nasty then you give a little cheeseburger a massive and you can you can pull anything off it's crazy this gun's back yeah that was unreal i thought i was a gunner i'll be honest [Music] it's right here this right here oh no it shouldn't shouldn't tell me right it should it's gonna put more weapons there make it more alien weapons then make it so we can use the crater more than twice a week exactly exactly what's it like i if i wanted to use the 301 i would just pick one up off the ground yeah it would be gold by that it doesn't matter if it's gold the difference between a gold one and a regular one is i can put the side i want on the regular one like yeah because my diva is gold now but i've just got the sight of choice on there oh man hello hello what's going on over here oh my word i just look at that three feet yeah that was my fault though it was too vertical it's so bad they're right here all right you had your chance now you eat all my grenades i didn't hit that guy this was a flawless gun right this gun was on the ground you could pick it up no they just put it in the care pack as it was i just blow one clip in burst mode and he had a gun shield ah nice gg jenks that revived was the the clutches moment i think i've ever seen really oh yeah yeah yeah
