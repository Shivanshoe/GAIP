I'm Timmy Timmy Timmy so if you still need them I'm next there you go is a separate team trouble 10 man that she went up onto the that's the Tower of Justice there this is tricky I mean we can third party to different teams here I guess this wait note this way is the third party the other way is just the it's just like a 1v1 in terms of squads I'm around numbered over that way to v3 these guys still fighting just going on never mind a scratch on this way teammate this is no that's not worth it that's not worth it the middle team went this way so we should follow them because now we're the third party if that makes sense it's a bit of a risk in we could definitely play the safe but I don't want there we go oh my god I press John Partin still gonna bear please stop it friend John I'm not going down there there we go he's like kill credit nice mez I'll take the level 4 knockdown shield moves in here you know Fisher I heard someone shielding up which is why I was quite for it all we need heavy rains I've got a few there we go this must be the team that they were trying to throw a party we go holster hand because she didn't run away there she was forced to either engage when soon as she hears the revive or she'd been then she has to run away how does a few more heavy rains in here if she ran away completely to begin with just goes up at for like three three should be fine for endgame and especially on your guard lifeline with fast heals dropping the shell battery is definitely worthwhile I take this power actually feels pretty good can I tell you why I think it is the one time stage [ __ ] is it's feeling fresh it feels clean on this gun remember trying to use it a lot without a sight and I remember trying to use it a lot with a digital threat as well and there are certain things I don't like certain certain sights on the wind man I don't mind the digital threats by done like the Dalal circular holographic sight I don't like it that little Hedgehog think like I remember blue guess I'll just battery of bento no phoenixes you can drop out that's great because like then I can try and shoot at the same time it's a bit risky but I don't in their aim this way I can't I just can't take a shine thing with this this isn't what it's connect for this is this isn't what the guns designed for it is taken the most amount of self-control possible skin for chatterjee same scope just in case there were something I was trying to go for the portal I really want to get over there it's unbelievable ham self-control is taking how much discipline this is taken watching such a good position because they all have to come back this way I'm like God three spots left between the raphe solo and I think the team is just behind them now it seems of nice and white this one died Hey Oh monitor beeping bamboozled I was literally playing the bongo drums in my head lining it up with the with the uppercut the thick of the uppercut victory a second damage I think she wanted to enter storm good news ease they're not actually safer Beth I need to try this tracks on my team I can get safe I don't think I'm gonna leave these guys I just wanted to focus move anything [Music] I thought we threw it away friends champions I used to finish him move on the lifeline before I saw one knockdown shield she had I just I just thought that last guy I didn't know there was like they could've got around the mountain like that look at that 13 damage you you just leave the game instantly just trying to try not to not miss my RP okay it's about your RP okay know what okay well you party do cuz of course you will anyway shall tear the lifeline six kills 1600 damage clicked up at the start of the game and then I managed to repay the favor with a respawn in there as well 2600 damage 11 kills I'll tell you what I've won with the Prowler we select fire which I'm a little bit scared about because now I'll have to pick it up more often and I'll tell you what thinking about it I'm not I'm not that scared about anymore because it was actually pretty good are we done in one no we are not we are three RP off I think in the last video is about 34 RP off but I had a few rough games I had a few decent games about a few rough games today but if we leave you there daddy's still progress because we are incredibly close to Diamond want I feel like I've said that for last three videos books we've got even closer each time you know it's still progress these are still progress videos thank you for watching our to appreciate it and I see you all in the next one [Music]
