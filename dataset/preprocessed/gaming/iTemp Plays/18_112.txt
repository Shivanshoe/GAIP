hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and this is only the second time this season that i've got myself a vault the heirloom vault from the care package and i've been able to fire every single bullet that he's given to me and i'm just convinced now that is the best weapon in season 12 and this is also going to be the debut of a new feature that i'm doing called streamer replay where i show the perspective of a player who was streaming and in this instance i killed that player but it's not about me destroying ttv players and getting their reactions like zeus would for example it's more about just showing another perspective of the fight there will probably be a few down the road of them killing me and my teammate coaching or them just killing my team backs now on fortnite i could do this whenever because it had a great replay feature but on apex we don't have one yet and until it does i will have to just wait and see if people were streaming when our paths crossed in game so nothing against any of the people in the clips that i end up using in the future it's not about that just to clarify just trying to make the video a little bit more enjoyable for you guys so thank you for watching i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends good all right off that where you're landing mate i'm gonna land he's moving here i'm gonna land here let's go this if anything goes wrong i'm gonna go down the hole from the sky i have p20 again i had a mozambique oh [Music] pulled you out of the dumpster but more fun no i killed duck digger did you just hear that voice was it the dumpster one or was it the dumpster one dude yeah it's a great voice i don't even know the law but it's silicon voice line repairing the next ring is quite far nice big clutch yes just about respect i am repairing myself i'm gonna check the mid extended that's 100. that guy's really really there's two of them obviously i am just vibing like i'm scared man don't worry thank you i've got intimidated and again i'm going for uh flanking over here you keep that pressure the wraith is really weak like she's got shield but i don't think much health i loved it i really do like the mother i was better than the either it is and to be honest it's probably been in the pk in my hands because i look at the pk now where are these guys they were fighting here for like the longest time yeah they were uh i do want hammers though okay i see hammers okay like you avoided my question the ring isn't very good 45 seconds it's because i don't know if it's a canadian thing yeah it's a stereotype the canadians are nice though right yeah yeah yeah i mean i know you mean about steroids because like it's the stereotypes that all british men are like gentlemen or whatever yeah i know some serious from canada i was going to say i was hoping you weren't going to say from england so i thought maybe you would talk about me but no everybody's a gentleman from i thought you'd be like uh just there's a sly dig no no no no no we have ten seconds move with purpose depends where you were brought up you know absolutely no one's absolutely there's some real winners all around the world yeah i don't know there's no skulls anywhere i don't know if it's just a bug or like what's going on here but we could take this and then fly to power grid and there might not even be there anymore then there's a care package landing there people might go free if there are no schools we're gonna have to create some schools you know and this is where we'll create it yes for other ashes to convene you know what drives me nuts you can't change your sights like swap your sights between your guns on a zip line it's right and you know what really annoys me when you're playing octane and you steam and then you can't get your gun out if you're steamed on the line it's weird oh yeah that's really weird the new kill leader friend vault smg here you can run if you want i'll give it a go thank you you got the shocking ball here let's go this way oh yes i will come take that that's a good comment that is good karma dude i this there's a tulip over here and i thought it was a bad guy i just got scanned oh they're inside sounds like yeah they are so you say tulip but we would say chulip schuler yeah tulip why but it's a t yeah but it's a t u it's like the reason we say tuesday [Music] she took it back reloading check marvin he's in there uh this marvin's uh phony he doesn't draw blue he just drops your message i thought you were gonna oh yeah he's his name oh no oh no oh appreciate if you don't call me out on the charge rampage activities okay i've got two more thermites i'm not afraid to use them all right oh dude cranky here i go here's the third grenade here oh no it's thank you i encourage the charge rampage behavior it's not a devotion like a turbo depot i don't encourage that sort of behavior wait there's no skulls over there though they just that's weird power grid they're still fighting in power grid what some sort of tactical battle oh i'm charging you up there there's no shot they're still fighting in the powers range we got a couple teams here and then the last team will be in power grip i have ulti i tried to slide i didn't slide attacking reloading they're gonna steal my kill i'm glad you got it oh i'm getting my shield oh you regret that don't you sorry around recharging they're coming from this way oh they're on the ground reloading enemy taking i'm going for a make it okay is that you that first of all attacking we're doing great only two others there's one guy on your far right right here the ring's close 10 seconds i'll comedy jump off this way giving my shields a recharge ah i know where this team is how great i have 12 volt bullets and i'm gonna stick with it i don't care that's all you need incoming care package i love loot i just want this whole game without hammer points that sucks everybody sucks i didn't do anything until like that fight anyways but still i mean come on give me your boy some hammers you deserve it i'm here i deserve i've been working hard yes around here i deserve it if you get three kills with mozam it should automatically put the hammers on there should spawn i feel like dude ask me your opinion on this okay if you have a weapon and you go to a crafter do you think you should just be able to upgrade your gun with with an oh a hop up or something like yeah yeah why not instead of me why not right like right now the crafters shatter caps i wonder if there's like a statistic on how many people are actually crafting shatter caps right now extended or med kit here yeah there's no one i'd love to see the statistics by the way what is that the third zone care package by the way yeah it's sickening really i think that some guns should evolve like evo evolves that would be cool that sounds like a really cool ltm idea i mean i'm more kills maybe maybe not kills maybe the more damage you've damaged you have an evo evo shield it's like an evil gun yeah so your gun will level up and you have to get kills with that good levels of that gun so you can't just use an r9 and get like a mozam as a secondary you know you have to use the mozam you're massive skin dude what is it i can't remember it's a controller i was nice i actually spent tokens on that yeah and you put a matching gun charm on it yep you are i hate you g7 scout here oh no full g7 taking fire friends i found them they've been chilling in here okay game out of power again went straight into the ps5 can i go for a flanking maneuver what do you think you can do i'll crack the logo yeah go for it go for it i have rampage this valkyrie just went in serious panic mode no i'm so close oh i've got gold bag cell phrase don't worry enemies did you see it is incredible though i would i would go as far to say as probably game of our generation seriously like that good yeah should i buy it near me yeah i mean yeah i play good money for a gun right now i paid 50 dollars for a fully kicked rampage right now another squad i'm coming shooting okay you're the best no i was shooting the gas truck oh oh sorry that's my nade there's somebody out here mate we've got three l stars between us unless you have another one and we

kind of came in ignorant you know yeah the phoenix oh no no actually uh okay hammer point repairing damages oh there's the hammer point images my guns glitch nice he's just in the rope drop down place my gun i literally couldn't shoot really it's fixed now that's yeah there's a traffic damage reloading i can rope for some time he's gonna i mean he's gonna probably jump down i think let's keep

and the guy the other guy that i wasn't excited oh god i thought he's gonna back up contact with reloading i was picking up heavy rounds one at a time but it's because i was reloading my 30 30. i was gonna freak out i was i was trying to pick up 50 heavy and it's like one by one you're making me nervous with how aggressive you're being here oh listen i'm i'm on edge i'm on edge that was crazy he got got goosebumps a little bit i was trying to get someone fired for that glitch imagine if that's how you had to pick up ammo just one at a time all those games all those days back in the day playing mario party you know the the tap x with your n64 controller i'm telling you i've never never i was faster than the turbo controllers no cabbage i got a feeling i believe in you yeah i was i saw i saw a video of ludwig doing the world records amount of button clicks in a single a second what was his i reckon is it like 12 or 13 or something what is it i have no idea it's impressive though whatever it is mine's like 11. i think i think it would be yours is faster i might be okay the way you can dude i'm gonna be honest the way that you like your trigger finger i've seen you click your trigger like your single fire 301 and stuff impressive you know it might you don't you don't do an action like you're trying to press the trigger then you've released it you're trying to press it it's a technique that drummers use yeah you i hear something you um you tense up your forearm and it like sort of it sort of shakes a little bit one's one shot like beyond one shot they're both blue gamers they're both new gamers that's a turbo okay i'm not scared janks i'm what's going on in here no she's she's one she's fine  like i'm 110 ping trying to punch her okay it wasn't i wasn't connecting oh i was like dude i thought i saw you hit her like four you were just swinging taking on all that aggression from that game the apex champions oh that was fun nothing like punching some people in the face i can't wait to see how much damage you did compared to me this game impressive i don't know i don't think i did that much oh here we go nice i didn't realize we had that many kills but you could have got a 20 you didn't say anything well that 2 000 damage 20 rich i ain't saying i ain't even telling you i'm embarrassed with the amount of damage you trying to fake meek you get to 16 you know i'm trying to feed him some kills
