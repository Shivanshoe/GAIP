how does a guy see to reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some a war zone of course war zone is the new battle royale that came with modern warfare it's actually free to play for everyone so if you don't own call of duty modern warfare you can still download it I mean it needs like 90 gigabytes I think it's a bit of a it's a bit of a hefty download but the reason it's 90 gigabytes is because the map is absolutely gianormous there's a 150 people per battle royale Lobby it's not just a base of 150 people respawning all the time there are multiple ways to get your teammates back first of all the first step that you get you get sent to the goo black you get a 1v1 if you win the 1v1 you've respawn you fly back in on the map only with the P store though you gotta you gotta try and load up a lobby and even if you die second time your teammate can buy your respawn back from in-game money not like a real life money that would be ridiculous that would be the biggest pay to win scam of all time so it's not just a base 150 you party fighting like 220 225 people a lobby or something around that this game is incredibly fun I've got a game here for you with
