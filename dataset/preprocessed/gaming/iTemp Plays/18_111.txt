[Music] [Music] shots hey [Music] whoa whoa hello guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i admit it i have not played enough of the new legend mad maggie and i was so excited for her to come out because she is good with shotguns and i love the mastic it's one of my favorite weapons on this game so i decided to jump on and force myself to get used to her passive which is being able to run at full speed whilst holding shotguns because i don't know about you guys but even though this is such a good passive i actually kind of find it difficult to control i'm almost too fast but the only way to get better at that is to practice now one of the games that happened today i did use the mastiff but in the other one i tried to use the peacekeeper because it's so good with the pk as well because of the new kinetic feeder hopper the only problem is i'm so bad with the pika again just gotta practice so i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you so much for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me migos we're back at it again on mad maggie where are you going i'm going straight here here we've got violence i'm straight here got myself a shotgun already it's an either though not happy about that back to my you know i'm changing that i'm actually here we go i got myself a mastiff which is what i wanted hemlock mastiff i want the wingman i've used you so much did i take that i meant to ping it here level two i need a shotgun bolt all right well at least what teammates have armor yo whoa whoa level three shotgun balls i say we go and fight these people i don't know how this is unloaded big ticks all right to be honest nice job let's back up we have two down i just played slow judging my shields oh i really haven't done anything he's gonna fight making contact with enemy reloading you fellas know the drill this way oh it's a damn guy i found the damage yeah purple as well this is tremendous squads all right nice job team i really didn't do anything the first little half of that opening hold oh that's a lot of heavy i'm doing it i don't care i'm doing it i have a spitfire and people are still dying where are they dying enemy over here oh nice shots that's unbelievable here he comes um did i miss my first shot i mean i think i saw him i think no he i think i hit him for like 14. you know it wasn't a miss he definitely i because a mix would have been embarrassing you know i 100 hit this guy why did he leave his teammate to try and do like an emp player that's that's the problem with crypto he must have been the one that they cracked to begin with so i think he just fled to pop a bat and then by the time he batted we had downed his teammates when i'm alone here for a little while so i can chill did they see me is the question one more shot to get red armor so on top of us there are two teams be careful i stood there on the rocket for some reason i saw it on my on my hood but i didn't react in time i guess go crazy okay okay mile's gone when i saw the fences i had a feeling what was going to happen and my worst nightmare came to fruition oh they're down here here's an egg i saw him he can't go that way he comes in oh no he can it's a gosh darn lover and i'm gonna be cooking myself like michael scott george foreman grill i can't use my spitfire i have to i have to run at this guy with the mass defect where's he at i mean he's just gonna load bracelet again hello bam idiot yeah just go straight back to my race yeah just give right the kill i have to get this i have to get this after no please that's unbelievable where's the box i found it here that sounds like a fun time it going behind me no one hides from my drill i need to recharge my shields there you go this you was never in danger i was never in danger and now i'm just breathing fire i've never seen this emote in my entire life are they left already they just raged with that come on team if we don't get a move on the lobby's gonna be dead i'm afraid i i'm standing on what i'm doing i'm going to try stay alive here and just sit on the roof maybe the 30 30. that's the plan as soon as i'm solo like a secret agent reloaded there we go oh squads cocked it nice takedown how'd that feel my control is messing up he's on the you roof know the drill recharging the shields cuzzies i need more than six bullets to make i'm gonna be honest with you no stop it i've made my own purple breathe deploying the variables okay my my plan of the sin of top as a secret agent just i don't know why that makes me a secret agent i think i just wanted the same call to be honest with you starting to regret that decision because it certainly doesn't sound cool but one minute decisions are like a decorative gargoyle slightly less cool but more accurate description of my battle tactics there and the good news is i found the best attachment for the 30 30 45 seconds which is the glorious participants gold heavy mack necessary to say the least oh my god there's another team here enemy over there is moving and we don't i was interested in my water bowl what what my water bottle i was moving my water bottle how'd you have that how do you have that i know you didn't make it because you're just standing there i look at you guys deployed care package on its way here like i'm on the ropes come on let's go get him hit the injector seat hey they're listening that's huge i'll let the uh very thirsty room reload itself drop out there and just try and run fast so i can get high ground on these guys hello who you karate kick different team or recharging shields tearing through i think it's the same thing it's the lifeline right oh my god sorry did i hear 411 body shield here so let's heat for repeat with the pk 111 uh do you guys have any spare bats i don't have any charging shields i'm hoping the course doesn't have any spare mass that he's just hiding from me you know i'll be limited there are 15 people left which is such a shame because we had such a good start but we just landed so late you know let's get more people to fight though let's go get him go in here you lock boom and hammer you guys know the vibes oh they're all flying huh okay we must go this way then go here we've got violence to do we'll approach them from the top of the hill if we go this way we can approach them from high ground instead i don't have any bats so i don't really want to get into a slugfest got an enemy right here you fellas know the drills i'm dead i didn't want to i didn't want to let off because i didn't have a bat i didn't have a bat so i didn't want to stop and heal because it's going to take me so long come on come on thanks thanks thank you so basically i got greedy because of it that was such a stupid challenge for me such a stupid challenge i'm missing i'm not afraid level three shotgun bowl well played team unfortunately there's two teams left victory rises here's a sick recharging shields healing my wounds don't worry about the zone too much stay safe let's go here let's get out of the zone [Music] how can i get shot in the back you know now we just have to deal with this team it's dead how do you get there yes well play guys uh good game good game i can't believe we won that but i tell you what that's the power of the third party right there we delayed in the zone long enough for the other team to come along and shoot them in the back and now it's the tactic all along you know we had to try and survive and that we did that we did one of these guys and samuel saying so i'm going to type it gg what wait 10 minutes and i've got 2800 damage just imagine if that's like a solid 13 14 minute game i get my four count maggie that's so annoying game's just dead
