hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we got our hands on the triple take but it was right at the end of the game and i barely got to use it and this made me think about the care package system that we have in apex at the moment we have the care package special the crater which i doubt will ever be a flawless weapon because it would have to go major balance changes to big ground loot then we have the rotational system where some weapons will be in a care package for a few seasons at a time and i think my issue with the care package weapons is how infrequently you get to use that particular gun you can have a three to four hour session on apex and find one crater prowler or triple take or maybe you just won't find any at all and if they take one of your favorite guns and put it in the care package you're not going to be able to use it too much at all anymore i started to really enjoy the prologue just before they put it in rotation and now i can very rarely use it i suppose with more weapons coming against the game it is becoming less of a problem but with the prowler in the care package i think we are really suffering for a close range heavy weapon option at the moment the only other option is the wingman which i would argue isn't really a close range gun it's more a precision medium range weapon in my opinion so at the start of the game where you have a load of heavy attachments and you're in a city your choices are all medium range now as i said i think this property is only getting better for the game as more options are being released as the seasons go by we are getting another lmg in season 10 and i really wouldn't be surprised to see the product come out of the care package seeing as it's been at least two seasons since it replaced the r99 in rotation so maybe i'll get to use my favorite smg again sometime soon so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i know one of you out there can take the heat all right nice you got a gold gun oh no first blood uh i do what'd you get it's all 99 it's a good day how many gold light mags do i have right now i would like that i don't know if you've got space um i do thanks mate i have a gold gun i have a gold light mag on my 301

the longest phoenix kid of all time next team poor guy perfect you know what i'm gonna two times it uh two times on the what yeah nine give it another go i'm not classic maybe but still who cares ah i wouldn't condone such actions but i'm gonna give it a go you do zone thanks for saying he's a maniac right so and you're playing about 10 cents yeah that's all i think it really works for him especially because he's on higher sets yeah let's go let's pull guys oh i just changed that shot he wasn't even aiming at me popping the finisher i need you so bad that that your guy's got gold so any first damage like maybe 15. where's his box but she wears his box mate that's hard to see nah that's not nice is it that's not nice it's hard to experience too as a player that just wasn't nice all right the two times isn't working it was it would it would have been fine on lc we're not i'll say you know nope gotta switch to lc ridge come on i'm not doing it yeah with the program come on being left in the dust who by everyone by all the zoomers zimas could never kill me i've never died to zoomer faster faster you died of zoomers every single day that's right especially on that's why foreign

really good oh down here we're listening we could have stayed where we were i just stole the blue in here just tanked everybody oh i was really hoping he had less than 50 health definitely another team here yeah oh god oh my god that's actually not your path this guy's running away is this other guy just grabbed a banner it's another team this was handsome this this thing here it's going to turn around and get nice oh i should really go back in first oh he's rising he's right here over here somewhere i'm gonna go back got down that half oh life with the wind man really yeah see my tab straight out the door i didn't actually i should pay more attention i need some light oh these guys are mine they're going up they didn't that's fine oh i got some all right i can drive you like you

this guy's loads mate thank you though yeah it's so many so many bullets pretty sure they're on the same team had to have been right uh yeah that would make sense right can you right here yeah are you going back up oh my god beautiful that is tremendous that's the most strange thing i've ever seen god the plays so confused i don't even know what to call that that's never been done before it's never been done well i guess this way isn't safe ah turn around there's no way that that way surely are you looking for a team um yeah i don't know let's go let's go we can predict these days you know this map is just oh man no actual rotations yes you've always got to go free especially on a course oh come on over 500 light rounds and 113 rounds for his wingman if that wasn't enough he was ready for his he was prepared for his 301 500 rounds too he was prepared he definitely almost went through all that more in that fight so he's close just makes me feel like i'm gonna die in the next 10 seconds i think we did die i think we i think we might no i meant irl like deja that really i just get comfortably confused like my brain just kind of i hate it like it's the end coming up this is giving you a hint that everything's gonna end like i've re i've already lived through this that's a very irrational fear rich only only lasts about 10 seconds then i realized that oh there's no food's over i'm still here you know you never seen deja vu depends on washington uh anything with denzel washington banger who's your favorite actor washington possible no it's not denzel uh i don't know i think uh i don't know i i love heath ledger after after the whole i liked heath ledger before and uh what's something called the knight's tale are we what it's called i think it's called nightstalker i can't remember what the name of it was probably ron but it's like an old uh like an old like medieval type movie oh yeah i just liked him in that one and then uh i mean the joker the joker he was great a lot of people love to miss the joke who's your favorite actor mr bean i don't know how mr bean is all right now what do you mean how would i not know mr b he's going to make speaker famous america i mean uh i grew up watching uh rat race here's a rarity it's not no you're not seeing rat race you know who mr bean is but he's never seen rat race ah that's disappointing kill him of all time we're already in the ring that's not but oh you've heard the chocolate brothers the trick or the trickle brothers that's the one let's see whatever that's what i said right not this is probably gonna be the same horizon you know no wonder getting deja vu yeah same guy okay the shield cell went off and i was i don't know easy 50 shield yes you are the apex champions so who's your favorite actor party dicaprio aye solid choice not as good as mr bean but it's all our choice mr bean solid yeah i would agree with that
