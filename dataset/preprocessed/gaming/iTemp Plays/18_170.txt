hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing the legend who i think i have the least chance of ever mastering and it is of course views now it has been a lot easier playing foods recently since you guys told me that you can change the way that you throw your grenades you know that one of fuse's abilities is that he can launch a grenade across the map if you press down on the d-pad if you're on controller i don't know what the keybind is if you're on a mavic keyboard but you can make it so you can just throw it like a regular person which is so much easier to aim in my opinion however i am terrible at throwing grenades i am terrible heather's knuckle cluster and i am absolutely god awful with his uh ultimate as well so maybe one day we'll get slightly better but i will never master this character and i'm okay with that thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends let's give this go come on broken down let me down first blood only got two shield cells but this crypto's gonna have two for me i had two bats it's pretty worth it [Music] market where are these cryptos teammates where did they go i'm gonna boat please help oh god wait who we bowing they're calling the 747 because he do be bowing everyone i think they're calling that i think i'm pretty sure anyway oh my god please help me as expected i think my nade i think i threw it right up it was a terrible terrible nade i need to change the angle a little bit oh my god i got a three times on no i don't got us a new kill that was the last one in the squad everyone chill everyone leave me alone i'm not going to get there in time am i nope hello can barely see i can see you just so good please he's first three kills he said full head shot he didn't full head shot me but i feel like he didn't miss a shot to be honest with you he's on mouse and keyboard and he loots standing still he's cheating what's he doing okay yeah he's ain't boying this is yeah this is ludicrous yeah okay yeah yeah yeah he's cheating i thought i got beamed come on kill him get him guys oh god the rs45 is too good oh he's got no arm shield now hang on yeah yeah nice oh god no this is a disaster someone is still gonna leave a comment and say no he's just good he's just good you just need to get better at the game you know he's gonna get shot in the back this guy is terrible he's so bad he's look he's got a neighbor the kobe 990 yeah just terrible the worst hoping his pathfinder pat find a guy pat finder pat thunder i'm hoping he's a smurf because he's level 10 but he's got he's got 90 kills come on pat thunder you got to help me out here it's actually my first game of the day i've actually got two teammates so i'm very excited about the prospect of being able to kill people where did our mirage land i think we meet all the man give me all this stuff yeah now we're talking on there here we go first of all today i've got a feeling people landed the other side i don't know the map says doesn't look open just not loaded i think pathfinder pathfinder is fine damn he's good looking over there what do we have here evil shield here level two the way amigo get a enemy here kill that joke can't see is this a single purple do they have two purples like they had two purples there i played that kind of bad to be honest with you but my team was dead i don't want it feel free to take it though any med kits going new zero med kits i'll just chill here and small heal i guess i play that so bad i left myself vulnerable to the um to the roof when i pushed up i push it with no shield thinking i might be able to get across there and get the blue armor that was there kind of greedy but hey birthday good guess recharge oh it lasts so long uncoordinated team i've ever seen i think that guy did not want to bubble wrestle he thought we were going to push though to be fair i don't need those i'll take some more bullets good job you two pat finder thunder hold on you two amigo and and and let me go the the zone hasn't hit any part of the map you can walk on yet you start to be able to see it look and there are 12 people left because when the ship comes from the south side everyone lands antenna and i just don't know why antenna sucks that's the way it is what the heck come on teammate we have mirage you go over here he's coming he's coming my pathfinder can stay alive i think we're okay am i chasing so i might try and like set that on fire they got shot by a different team reloading i'll try and keep him at bay i'm on the way pathfinder pathfinder nice let me down where right careful tonight don't go down nice job maybe we were the most uncoordinated team of all time we survived though just about i'll take it nice work everyone there was another team maybe that could have been them they were the other side of antenna it could have been them they could have snuck past me i don't know i am repairing myself i'm tempted to use the three times here i'm gonna give this a go about eight death boxes in maybe five seconds zero of them had anything worthwhile taking because they must have fought straight off spawn probably punching each other right in the face i'm gonna see how this goes i don't know if it's a good idea especially without a stop maybe i should move the stock onto this it zooms in quicker and there are two scores left wait are they coming here we ordered they're coming here enemy here right no i think they went away from us i can't i can't take this sure they want to take it back let's go this way you actually want to go in there oh my god you're a lunatic okay well i'm here with you i'm here with you to die reload i got waxed hold on let me get up there nice job i need some med kicks don't i that's what i need there's a med kit see it's in jeopardy though i've got back oh last team exciting giving my shields a recharge on your feet i'm tanking it no i'm not a little banner i guess he got hit by the ark size because that shouldn't have killed him i have no health heals i need to go use the gravity cannon here this is my last arrangement i can't stay in the storm with you if you can make it to that graph cannon we can win reach out to me i have no syringes man i didn't think that was going to die to the nade even if i stopped it he wouldn't be able to crawl away in time i don't think so anyway can i even come around this side i can maybe try and get to him i think they must have gone through the way to him though here i go knight is alive yeah they're going to try and cut us off here i need to start zooming we need to go all the way around i think we should go here i need help i should have picked up that medkit when i had the chance but my team i was getting shot at so i just went inside darn it i might have to stay and fight otherwise it might be something good this way i'm just looking for a few ranges why i have some don't need shield cells i need help i'm not gonna stop i'm not gonna start spamming i'll leave is that it looks like people have been there we ought to go here no let's go all the way around i have nothing you better not die one minute hello hello extended supply been there i'm responding so you're on your own by the way i'm please respawning die pathfinder thunder don't do it to me the ring is in close proximity yeah i can't really follow up on that i'm afraid and he leaves yeah it's definitely just a smurf game like i don't know what he's doing i don't know what he's doing i was going to hop in the car and try and help but they're just going to thirst him i guess reckon we should go here thanks a lot pathfinder thunder god yes finally i found some health this is a great day it's gonna get care package that team must be so confused why just a solo pathfinder's turned up god we're not all in the ring he's got a scout he's got any single fire like that get shot at my shield to recharge i can't say i like this um three times that much i wish i had the two times back i thought they were gonna rush my teammate when they figured out he got he's got white but they didn't trying to get angry get this guy up i should have went with the uh the nades rather than the thermites there move from me careful oh he's trying to get his loot i think i need to put some shots in for and try and cover him oh he's gone you're on your own oh my god big nade big nade well played gg yes ha i'm pretty sure i needed myself um i don't know if that's true or not but a nade did fly from the sky and hit me for about 300 damage i don't know if you can hear me so i'll just type it out however i did also nade them for 100 damage and crack them so i'll take it that's huge damage from the smurf there well a well played pathfinder pathfinder really put on a performance with your new account gg
