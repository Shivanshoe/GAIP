[Laughter] no that's my bad bit of a sketchy hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are using a weapon today that i really haven't seen in season 12 at all now of course in season 12 there were two guns that were put in a craft like the flatline and that also came with a one damage per bullet nerf and also the long bow now i think the flatline is worth crafting still if you land a crafting station if you've got some time it's pretty worth it because it's still such a good gun even after the nerf but the longbow no one is sticking around to craft a longbow apart from me i legitimately do not think i've died to a longboat this season i think that they thought that putting in the crafter made it more accessible and people were likely to craft it and use it but i i don't think that's true i never see it i hope you enjoyed today's video i've got two games here for you today i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends probably not probably not how much damage did that do to me i thought i picked up extra i don't know what i'm doing here you're good you're good you're good that's fine don't worry about it i'm really messing up team i don't know where they came from rampage here i don't know what they were giving my shields a recharge they were here i'm the new kill leader any any light rounds i mean i can craft some i'm actually going to craft some before i craft my longbow that makes a lot of sense tonight he's up here contact with hostile let's go get him he's probably the guy that needed me for 300. oh i need some help here teammate let him let him go let me honestly just let him go this is i can't i'm struggling whole squad down now we can loot them target over there i think they're fine inside just a moment this should be right here at this door i was definitely involved i am one time raise the wrong switch there we go hey i've got a sliding longboat kill it's not often you i can say that any more people firing where we came from but this enzyme someone said he needed a better shotgun because he only had an either peacekeeper here there is my contribution to the team you might already have one round he must already have one donnie thought he's been helpful oh here we go here we go we found some people to shoot this is unbelievable recharging i mean uh i'm going to go down we should be fine i saw him in the window don't worry it's in a really bad spot with no cover i still want to see back to use the longbow i gotta finish gonna have to run through no nice we should get high ground quick we can't let them take this throat before us otherwise we'll have to go somewhere else i have an extreme sucks i'm coming teammate it's in a 2v1 let me get behind here got you friend it's worth goldbag i think it's fine i should probably give this lifeline now oh my god yeah just stick it oh god don't worry i'm here i don't have time to keep back if you need to drop if you need it's a drop i can't help him one moment gotta use a phoenix kit oh good shots i knew they were both weak i didn't think that wraith is gonna shoot me in the back hello i think we're both just popping phoenix hello hello what's up zipline deploy yes well play guys gg actually putting some work with the longbow there yes i am yes you are the apex champions but you actually sound just like him yeah i don't often use voice chat either i don't think i've ever been recognized on my voice like that may i love your youtube thanks very much mate ggs ggs thank you uh where are we going oh that's huge i apologize for doubting you although all of us can't land there i guess i should have broke away hello hello hello thank you thank you how much ammo i've got here with your i'm out of light ammo this is some humongous work oh hey guys how are we alive hello oh my god i love you thank you thank you all right i'm carrying the uh the extended yeah i knew the boys were there i knew the boys would come in my fault don't worry oh making me god i shouldn't have got caught i knew that like their teammates were going to be nearby but i just i just thought they're down on the rape first you know i was wrong i was wrong i'm not afraid to admit it and this is why you never see the longboard anymore i've had no opportunities to craft one and there are 17 other people left but i'm sticking to it i'm doing it oh my god it's the gang now already looking for sniper optics target spotted eventually thanks a while come on i wish i had three times more longer but i don't care i'm going in nope that's not a good idea in this range huge we should go this way the enemies are shooting at me this i'm i've never concentrated so much in my life i have some ammo yes huge give me some of this i need this quick i was a whole squad all right i panicked i'm going back doing great only two of it i'm out of sniper ramo damn sean is your name uh i have to respond to that but yeah kind of at the moment it is i don't know what that mean it doesn't mean anything it's just like it's a way of life you know it's like i tend to trump energy ammo here yes look at this asking thou shall receive oh my god we are working i find our thingy too thank you very much i had to go for the uh the longbow play when that ash was pushing me you can that's the thing with like shotguns and snipers if you can peek in and out of cover they are so powerful it's showing off now how you do that you got a double tap jump as soon as you get on the rope it's like you press it like press e then spacebar twice like immediately after i can do tap straight phone though i mean that's pretty good i like that i'm not too when i'm playing mountain keyboard first guy are you ready bam bam look at that into the wall jump i'm actually kind of goated on this on the old keyboard image can't lie i forgot i love the course he can just like tank bullets you know my favorite part of that course because he's just an absolute unit yeah shoot me shoot me good entry frag i'm getting behind these guys let's move this way oh my god no another bangalore's gone down i got one i listen up where can we go can we not go this way that okay we have to we have to try this thing you're taking fireflies which is kind of kind of weird one minute he's won i don't know what they're doing to be honest with you they're sort of single firing that's the second bangalore i've played with today that has fallen off the map there's some kind of anti-bangalore force fields on these ropes i think i think that's what's going on here it's the only explanation i can think of they haven't moved this this is just free loot for the teammates ten seconds what are they doing oh we need to contact get this guy behind life and help me nice nice nice this is unfortunately very very bad what the camera moving get ready help did you see how great i was i did all kinds of really amazing moves to that enemy and now giving my shields a recharge is that is that disrespectful was that disrespectful well that's his backfire because now i can't end the shot and he wasn't even doing some crazy maneuvers i suck i need to use the long bow i need to use the long bow okay listen the longer performance at the end was pretty bad but it wasn't bad before that it was only it was only that long part i don't know what happened i've never seen that lifeline email but i absolutely love it nice five revives five provides and she just left she's got it she's gotta go from the game guys she's she's straight into it ggs
