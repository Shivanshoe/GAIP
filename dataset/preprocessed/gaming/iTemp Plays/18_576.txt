this video is sponsored by ea hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing the newly improved holiday exclusive mode winter express this mode was out last year but we have some major improvements this time around which make the mode far more exciting this was a fan favorite mode anyway it's essentially a king of the hill mode on a train that is venturing around every corner of ward's edge and there are different stations along the way and you have to fight for control of the moving train the improvements made this year are that they are now supply ships straight from king's canyon flying around the frozen epicenter we all know how crazy the fights can get on these things they are absolute death traps there's also a new station for the train at derailment which gives more variety in the fights as well it's gonna be really interesting to see the supply ships from king's canyon onwards edge it's gonna be kind of strange seeing the flown about the place now despite being a very well received mode last year some people didn't like the long respawn timers and it did kind of cut down on the time of you in the fight with these improvements the long respawn timers have been vastly reduced to me that you can get back into the fight into the action really quickly since the last time we played this mode as well we have a number of new legends like lobe revenant and ramparts who have some interesting abilities when it comes to attacking and defending an area which is essentially what this mode boils down to there is also a rewards track with new holiday themed unlocks including skins gun charms and a call matching triple tracker for mirage as well so i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching thanks once more to ea for sponsoring today's video and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends this one is such a difficult one to get to i definitely want to to overthrow i'm going to try and wrap around a little bit here is wraith if i can do the team should land on either side it's difficult for them to get to this site so hopefully by the time they get there i managed to appear behind them one shot reloading i should get my i'm not crazy this is the big this is the biggest boy flank i've ever seen from this bangalore i'm kind of intimidated mean i'm really cooking i'm really cooking them up in for 60. we're just going to pinch them a little bit did we do it yes oh my word what a struggle i got four kills from that one that's a good range good grief the corsets are very difficult to deal with but the good news is when they aren't the champion and they don't like reign supreme on the train they're not too bad to deal with you know if they're in the field it's fine hello friends welcome back what do you have lifeline you get a hemlock and uh okay kind of brutal you've got to strategize depending on which one you land at the problem with this one is that it's very easy for them to land on both sides my flank can't climb can't climb can't climb this is my team i hope it's my team absolutely what it is need some help need some help need some help oh god he's weak he had 200 health mess him up my phone nice they've got a little spot here unfortunately they're capping it and she doesn't really have the ability to get over there nice you're the team came in close right at the end he still has a chance see i told you the problem with this one is that you get flanked from both sides and that's exactly what happens we dealt with a lot of them but unfortunately they managed to capture it right well apparently they're fighting with the team i'm not entirely sure why the team would be over there already but i'm going to sit on top of train with my flat line i actually got a kill for that no way you could ever pull that off friend we're just late third parted literally everyone reloading i think there's like a corset here maybe i need to recharge my shield i had someone like cleaning up at one point they're probably gonna come up one of the sides at least one other squad has to be over near you yeah yeah they work they're really weak nice [Music] i'm on nine kills that's not that bad on this on this uh on this mode kind of difficult to stack up the kills we are rocking up to oh it's falls gulch oh good grief what tends to happen this one is that people will sit up here if i land here and just chill for a second someone might drop next to me oh there's a supply ship this way too and on the far side big 16 damage i'm coming team we're gonna get flanked guaranteed but i can't really contest that but i can test these guys i don't have any nades i used them all in the previous graph did you give me my name back it's actually a bit of a scanner you don't get them back my humble opinion please someone hit this horizon literally everyone's two bullets there's another team on here they're coming over i'm scared oh we tried good great oh my word the amount of damage that we're putting out here come on lantern first they're landing on there well they tried look poor guys cracked i know your cracked friend you have to heal up a little bit you guys have just gone straight in sometimes i don't know if that's the best idea because you get third parted by the other theme yeah you see we should have gone in so soon we were there too early maybe the team's fighting out a little bit we got there too soon we've got that way too soon no matter who wins this if it's not me they're going to get to two rounds it's going to be match point i'm just going to buy my time wait for them to damage each other a little bit make sure i'm full held make sure everything's reloaded then we go in this race seems like a bit of a threat so oh my word g7 shield is almost over just like me and sultry ai voice okay yes we win oh that was a big game boys that was a huge game my teammates are speaking but i turned off voice chat a long time ago someone screamed down the mic and i mean i'm not sure what they're saying i can only assume it's great work out there fantastic tactics your tactics are unbelievable listen a little 3.3 a little 3.3 000 damage a little bit of a 14 kill game there 10 minutes good grief my friends gg all right this is a difficult one to defend because oftentimes people will land on this side and the other team will land on the other side so getting stuck on the train is sort of a bad idea good idea to try and try and see where they drop in across the map apparently line up lead from your boy i was still alive i thought he was dead i suppressed someone that helps anyone i don't know i got teammates that's like a turbo diva or something okay okay i don't really want to fight that too much oh god it's an absolutely brutal loadout on this game that's why i can help foreign oh my word did i win we won oh it's a 1v2 we pulled it off though we pulled it off that was um sketchy good grief that turbo devo is absolutely terrifying and that wingman with the scorpio i mean two guns that you don't really want to face let's be honest here in the grace period in effect crushed i got cr i'm back i'm back don't worry about it don't worry about it it was in fact it was a very smart play because now i'm back and i didn't have to bother using any of my shield cells that that was the play all along you know that was my uh that was my tactic oh hello friend i just going to land on here yeah you've got to realize you can't land next to someone because when you are the people lending in you have to get your you have to pull your gun out because when you're on the supply ship you can't use your abilities and you can't shoot so when you land it's like you're running you land like this you come down and you're just like oh let me get my hemlock out takes forever it's never worth it you've got to land like on these you know that's easy this guy knows what he's up to this guy knows exactly what he's up to right has a flat line with a purple purple mag too so oh i thought i thought she was gonna go back the other way and i was completely bamboozled i don't know why she just kept walking backwards whilst firing no i don't i've never seen anyone do that before in my entire life all right listen rusquad can have one win i messed up okay i've got to remember that the r9 that i'm rocking only has a white mac and everyone has purple armor on these so chances are i will have to reload some big things for the boys one's having that way too i believe making sure they're not that's our teammate right yeah it is indeed we'll be showing that some things would be helpful here we go he's really far away he's really far away we can let him do that actually landed on his forehead guys there's people on the train we may need to shoot them not gonna lie i'm gonna dive on there see what happens train stop you can't let them capture it you know i'm my ultimate sure if you have to be careful because that other team is eventually gonna get here there you go ultimate too they said the team was like behind us you see where they going i don't even know where they are wait someone's on the train they took my ultimate that's thievery all right that was the last guy i should have probably just walked up there all right seven kills and we've won two rounds now i'm just like littering on our train too you're gonna literally do on the train tracks you know this is our train have some respect you look at this that doesn't have it has a massive fire cap on it otherwise i'd have out of uh shame there the old single fire but it's all right this is a tricky one there i like how there are different stations and each one have their own tactics because here you need to be careful because they just sit up top so what i'm gonna do is because i'm revenant especially it's gonna climb up like a genius get some high grounds run off right i'd use them look for that they just kill so fast thank you nice job i shouldn't have i shouldn't be able to escape up top gg gg the games are pretty quick the games are pretty quick especially for one team is fairly dominant i mean we listen we threw that one right but it's all right no contest at my very glamorous bar mirage has the most amount of voice lines i've ever heard i literally did 2000 damage in seven minutes nice but yeah thank you for watching i do appreciate and i'll see you all in the next one
