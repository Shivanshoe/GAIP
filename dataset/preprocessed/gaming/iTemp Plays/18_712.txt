hey was the guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some apex legends of course and I realized something with a new item in apex legends the respawn beak and the portable respawn beacon but before we get into that I want to talk about an increasing trend in my games recently and this does have a correlation with the with a new item so to stick with me here so so people died in my lobbies really really fast I was very Jencks either day and I think he even uploaded the video to his channel we had a half-decent started containment I think we had a total of 7 kills wasn't too bad and then we look at the play account and it's 16 people so 14 or the players on the map before the first ring even started closing the entire map is still safe and will be for some time and there are 14 people on it I'm not gonna rant about score based matchmaking but this is a definite side effect of thrown a bunch of aggressive and high T plays together in the same lobby the lobby just dies out really fast now other barrel games don't really have this issue despite also having score based in their game warzone for example has an amazing pace to eat even though it's got skill base in there and it's because you can be brought back in so many different ways you have the Gulag for one so half of all players the first 10 or so minutes end up coming back for free and then if you die again you can be brought back an infinite amount of times if your team has the money and this allows the game to be faster paced people can play more aggressive and have the chance to come back and you have a healthy amount of plays towards the end of the game and again I'm not complaining about these I do think that it's an increasing issue but then I realize that respawn must also be thinking along the same lines and their answer to this is the pause board respawn beacon beast new item that they're testing in a limited time mode allows a team to be brought back and pretty much anytime during the game and this will help solve the issue of such bad pacing in these high tea at lobbies I don't know what people will say here they'll notice that I'll kill a few average or below average players and say that this isn't a score based Lobby it's not really how it works from experience they throw in a maybe around 10 highly skilled players and then they fill the rest of the loveyou of randomly and you'll be doing just fine you puke in teams no problem and then you'll just bump into a team that has a combined 70,000 kills it happens all the time just for clarification anyway I'm looking forward to the new item being brought in for main lovelies I think you'll have a big impact on some of the issues that apex has at the moment and it sort of happens in the game that I have for you today the lobby just sort of dies and the mid games that be the law but it's a good one still and I hope you enjoy so thank you for watching and I'll see wall into five and a half seconds my friends all right screw it all cities me me me goes and I've actually taken to Lana here instead recently this is a decent concentration of Lutz someone definitely own it that way but the pod is gonna be seen inside lose him for a little bit no point standing around waiting for them the sin cells are tough one because he's one of the only guns that I haven't used that there's been change for ISA nice day had another another buff I've sitting in a few videos icon room before one of you one of the times I mentioned this is actually got into a video dogs uploaded but fun with the sense that the moment so here we go good time to change it is that it record you to sit back a little bit and often times with random teammates they don't like sitting back or you know they just running and then they get wanted food which is fair enough because obviously extremely difficult and they expect you to be there it just takes more teammate cohesion and I try and team up we Swan and then I'll use the new and improved Saint enough that he was seen in the road it sounds like he wants all you send the road what is these I think he was maybe just trying to play stealthy like he he moves I'd know he was there but I already heard him I mean he had a purple skin on and he signed the middle of the streets I mean it's not exactly wearing a ghillie suit okay this is good careful practice shield is bad for health sighs ban is not good washing the pail is ridiculous I'm on no health teammate I don't think I'll be able to save you someone's respawn and right here as well I'm not the one who died somewhere for help and there's someone respawn in next to me I'll tell you some of the game where on earth is his banner why is they showing up he was over here somewhere right yeah where were you did you off somewhere it's not showing up if you literally not showing up there we go that's worked was that that box was it Oh was that box okay I got ya I'm not gonna let you okay listen it's been incredibly patient here i forgiven him for his spanking guinness good we'll get a little bit too straight sometimes but he's being patient here here we go that's not good gun fight with those above us like that sorry do you mate yeah that's pretty thing come you put things from the worst where things I'm taking the meek I'm trying my best here the nose is breached down with some big people scrapping someone's briefs one right in front of us I'm just a little bit scared that's all all gone wrong there we go I should have pulled on so I could get back up top okay gonna kill all of them guaranteed to stop it you've got no shield yeah I know he's he's running rampant oh my God he's got purple I'm gonna got no one just routine to that I think he just accepted his face while he was reviving someone there's been a Gold knockdown I'd only give him a chance to provide himself because he had some evasive maneuvers I honestly don't care that if the loot just disappears I want to give him a chance to get back tell me Punk enough to get him I don't like this tent there's too much loot here it's overwhelming Basti she there are almost too many crates to contain we've I know what the perfect self is here I've got decent attachments I'd rather this go and find someone else's shoes and see our own grain for ages trying to perfect my ratio of the light ammo to throw but I could do that burn I should have I should have stayed and looted crusade and loot if only got one shield battery good I see ask me amigo muchos Gracias Oh at level three except wait you see that he looted his loot came back up top he's got a gall mop down at a wing man and a mastiff this man was a decent player a very decent player and the reserve package in the distance 14 of the players this is the issue even if we landed at a quiet place you know geezer for example just over this hill and we didn't have a kill yet we would I don't know man like it's the pace of the game at the moment is kind of weird people just died really quick doesn't Lane you know I'm going to get the care package it's gonna be um a devotion I reckon I've been having so many devotions lately okay wasn't I'll guess it was one of the first kept back to you to drop he just drops purple stuff absolutely scammed in the ring be something good this way thank you fire sounds like a wingman with a cool piece right now annoyingly good news ease my team I found us off some Evo shields which is always nice that purple stock please stroke grapes oh my word he be flying now no no what Chester during the non moonwalk

your battery and this guy definitely has gold shields because this was the lifeline what a waste at the short battery I need the small heels now but on gold shields I don't care who cares for some injuries I don't have any med kits but some injuries are great with cold chills anyway someone's in here he's rampaging about the place I have to rotate out there the bloodhound I have the blood handmaiden to thank love that get a gold bank as well it's a good job you teen you get the river five off squad how's that happened we haven't even left scraps of City thank you either as well ah I'm gonna keep the golf because I spent all this time collecting small heals our combos have changed all out for them shield batteries he's wasting my plane I mean there was only one squad left and I'm going anywhere I see I find nothing losing this game to the ring thirty seconds left we are we being forced out of scrap Atal the first time that you let's go this way which was the teammate we should get some high ground here because if there stay scrapped all towards the west it will have ultimate high ground and we will buy we'll be able to beam them I miss the old after one drunk do you remember the old r31 it was ridiculous that then it was outrageous now okay partners right okay now's like the first ten shots only a laser beam esque and then after that it starts kicking everywhere and I always forget I'm gonna shoot the first ten then just carry on fired not really sure what to do here friends see him wait I guess I look like the rotating late their back is dropping Banksy it might as well got nothing else today [Music] you're in their sights pretty sure [Music] beautifully all's I've forgotten coming tonight I am seasoned this one no Amy season is fun and the bug ourself rice [Music] you are they aliens as a really fun game oh we didn't leave that's the issue with the world's edge hold on a second what's going on here you've a breached less than a hundred damage per kill what is that ninety-six damage per cave or something and I've averaged just less than 300 but you did good job when I went down and you were extremely patient when I couldn't find your banner so I'm saying that's even I'm saying we did a job well done there we needed each other solid game thank you very much for watching I do appreciate it as always I'll see you all in the next one
