what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now we are running solo today i am playing caustic and this is probably the most amount of revive slash respawns that i've ever done a total of seven and four of those were actual respawns now of course yesterday i was playing lifeline and i only managed one revive that's pretty sad i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends you also landing the same door okay we're good you got that white teammate who's dying we're going call dick these are two separate teams oh come you couldn't on through the door oh duck i was gonna pop a finisher hold on bam i hit him oh man that was kind of close pretty pretty good yeah i was kind of crazy man it was kind of crazy i agree oh god the same idea i'll go bomb full then i guess surprise no one's down here we good squad oh what does it go down here those two guys oh it's just spitfire i thought this is rampage this is better there's no hello why did he run into my gas i need this scythe leave me first i need heavy it's all they need to reach out oh look at that gas canister yeah everybody's just leaping leaping down like everyone's confused i think look at that eyes are open hold up healing four seconds okay what the heck's going on where did everyone go i don't have anything three moments subject down this way okay that guy's down it's gonna revive oh my god you are fortunate oh i know what's going on i have no idea no variable respawning is imminent calm down so they opened the door was like he piqued him and then he shut the door instantly i've never seen anything like it this guy needs to chill out i need to let me get some shield cells and stuff please maybe one of these too go this way yeah okay i mean i think it's one guy and i'm more than happy to i mean there's loot here though i suspect we will find something here i think he's just one guy and there's a lot lou here for i see me i believe in his dave i need help i got you i got some health for you you know not pick up any shopping ammo uh there's nine syringos i'm actually going to take a little bit of this because on the r9 wherever it was i did not change my online skin from yesterday all right we're still alive i don't have the bats darn it we're still breathing caustic is so good in those situations where did the race go where did the quick door peak pk shot race go uh everyone chill come get back in the building you can't see me oh my god back in the building people come back this way what's that guy doing why did the valve push like that she can just fly to the roof i know the best thing to do here is how many are there how many it was just one it's the right from earlier on more than anything all right i gotta go i'm going to go this way for a second recharging shields all right i'm actually just going to get out of here forget this wraith i'm going to respawn my teammates because if i don't respawn them quick and i've had that guy cracked and i'm call stick and i've got red armor and i have a bat so i could fight him but i don't want teammates to leave i don't mind fighting him i'll respawn then i'll run back the first the wraith ran away from uh give me one sec there is a squadron here i hear one shields are recharging this race is gonna be behind me too i only hear these oxygen wow okay well it's just an octane i cannot believe i've missed those shots listen before i went away for a week that guy would have been dead i want everyone to know this that would have been some good loot for my squad as well okay i'm trigging traps i'm too freaking traps i'm gonna stop top supplies sorry about the octane you could have had his loop but i missed recharging shields here screwed mate you're done for when i'm leaving there is bait evil shield here level 2 the ring isn't very far 40 optics here close right now some tremendous lead for the squad oh god that might be the race no it's the octane but it could be separate squad octane is a very popular legend i'm coming back look at me look at that did he run away i heard the pad it's the same dude it's the same little guy little octane peeking his head in the neck it's close and i don't like it which is no no please just if you can stay up it's a it's huge this i've already killed this guy where did he come from where's the pad i don't know where the paddies i haven't killed him yet i'm filming i'm joined what a waste he's gonna face easy what does she face problem going this way is there's a scrap over here and they're to the last squads all right we're gonna get you teammate i'm gonna get you back i don't know if they took there was a blue up there did they keep that white armor or did they take that that blue blue just chilling in a supply come on i feel like the attitudes are different when you're playing courtesy like it's so obvious no one's pushy especially in those building fights this is a risk look at that banks okay creeper here i do not want that got a replicator coming in if i respawn quick enough but there's a black mark in here maybe they can take the crater you know maybe they're a creeper god i'm getting defeated by climbing name never a good sign i want to just hit that low brought to it down though which i have nice teammate get in there oh god oh god i really am so rusty did i kill did they just leave [Music] i know where they are i can't see smoke tends to have that effect i don't know i didn't know that was the last thing i didn't know that was the last thing how did i get my kill i thought that god is disconnected or just left like i don't know which one it was gg shout out to the the boys by the way because they were extremely patient especially when they died that solo rate when they were like trying to loot and i didn't push because if i knew it was one i could have tried to protect them a little bit um but there you go we won the game i had nearly 2500 damage i had three revives i had four respawns gg guys gg that was fun
