hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we got our first hints teasers and confirmations about season seven that have been teasers in the game for for a while but just in terms of trailers and stories of the outlands this is the first one so the information in this video was gathered from the story of the outlands i won't try and show and explain every little detail as i would just do a worse job of telling the story than the actual trailer there'll be a link for that in the description but i will give you the outline of the story of the new legend here so horizon is the new legend and she is the focus of this episode she ended up venturing to a black hole together powerful resources they needed to save her home planet she was betrayed on her mission and sent into the center of the black hole but she somehow escaped she spent a year on this mission but this was the equivalent of 87 years back on her home planet because of general relativity and how gravity affects time and when she got back things weren't looking so good i get big interstellar vibes from this and interstellar is my favorite film of all time so i'm already loving the story now we have some more information about the new season coming next week on the ea page we can sort of make out what the new map olympus is going to look like in the background here it's very futuristic it's very advanced it looks like a more modern version of capital city on world's edge and i love the look of it even just from this little teaser we're going to a new map my friends i'm actually so excited keep a lookout on the channel in the coming week because i'm sure we will get into more hints and more screenshots of the new map and legend and i'll be covering them all of course so the new legend is confirmed as horizon on this page she is described as a brilliant astrophysicist to escape to black hole and aims to use her newfound mastery of gravity to keep a promise if she controls gravity will she be like a mobile character will she have gravity lifts anti-gravity abilities perhaps she seems really interesting i really like her story and there are a lot of ways that they could go with these characters so i'm pretty excited for her and vehicles have been confirmed too the trident olympus is a big place cover ground faster with the trident plenty of room for the whole squad maybe this is why our mobility legends have been capped for a while because everyone will be getting more ability in season seven with these vehicles so these are all the teasers and confirmations coming from today i have a game here with jenks and candy roo this is the first time i've actually played with candy and he's a really nice guy i had a lot of fun playing with him and i really hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends is the guy on the roof here 90

way rich would you ever consider streaming i'm sure you get asked this a lot uh not apex like i am not consistent i would i'm considering streaming wasn't on my other channel because i i feel like i'm just way more consistent on that game on apex i don't know what it is about this game i'm not that good like honestly yeah we're pretty good i'm all right but i feel like i'm way better on war zone like i'll just get on with the the feel of it on controller way more but i did stream i did like a season six stream and it was really fun i mean we only won one game it was when everyone was disconnected but it was still fun i think for me it's very easy for me to look so bad on this oh is this yeah are you guys where are you guys going uh i'm going to fight this guy that was showing us

rising oh they left a nade for me i'm got my scan haven't got my scan nice job that was my favorite part too that's what i always did back in when i used to say stream all the time i would always record my videos off stream and then i would stream every day on top of that but i wouldn't record anything that i stream really why not because that was just me hanging out with chat like it wasn't because back then it was all about the gameplay there was literally this guy's headlock yeah i know you make jenks taking a moment hey hey oh there's his friends to the left we can probably rush this
