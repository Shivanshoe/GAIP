hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing a legend today who i think everyone needs to put more time into to try and perfect because when things are going wrong in apex there is only one legend you should be playing and that is gibby because this man does it all there is a reason he's almost 100 picked in the algs tournaments it's because he's completely busted but the thing with the gibby is that it's actually kind of easy to be a detriment to your team if you are bad with your bubbles you can actually help isolate one of your teammates for the enemies and that's something that i do quite often to be honest with you it's pretty bad so i'm pointing more time into gibby i'm trying to perfect him because i need this as my secret pocket pick for when i play ranked or if i'm just having a rough session on the regular mode so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends what is like yeah a massive purple bolt this is a dream come true let down severely let down oh yeah i'm good i'm alive i'm looting now back a massive rampage car smg here is that a car no it's uh i took that comment i'm sorry that's okay i'm thinking all right let's do this thing right there now nice i might be dead i took so much damage from that

loadout oh every morning you hear that is it car on iso oh i got car 301 this game but when i was running the car before i would always run a car and then a shotgun reloading but it's literally better to just not run a shotgun and just use the car like as the shotgun slot oh yeah yeah i 100 agree you can't treat like an smg i don't know where his teammates they respawn back to the right somewhere i was looking around i didn't see anybody but maybe they're left too started over there reloading only two more squads good work skills champion we ghosted them nice oh i see one right here over there
