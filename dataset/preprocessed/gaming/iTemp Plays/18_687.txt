hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are mixing it up a little bit because we have a drawers game here with so far and then a duos game with jenks right after that and i know that a few days ago you guys said that you prefer the longer videos with fewer cuts but i'm telling you sometimes it is just not possible you will see in the second game there were 16 people left and the first storm had just started and it was world's edge which is the bigger map so what i did was i cut it up and it allowed me to throw another game on there as well so there's a load of content for you guys and i hope you enjoy it if you do be sure to leave a like rating and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends [Applause] that's the best amount along with mirage's little remote when he dances with you yeah two re-45s maybe that means something do i have to rock to the rd45 all right i'll do it possibly this one gold in the middle what is that i think it's a red shield oh you like that oh no he's gonna get it oh i barely got him i don't even see him attract him oh who's this shooting me dude i want your heart thank you yeah they're pulling over that literally point out up top to your all right yeah just keep looting you're good i'll find the watson she was in here oh please don't go down drag out yeah they're playing like that for a reason i have no more shields yeah i don't have anything behind them there's a team oh yeah they're getting third-party it's perfect i have 18 bullets all right just let them get third parties you've got an else all right yeah oh my god thank you i'm pushing that i'll come with you watch out for the new kill leader friend on the top no armor that's so unlucky nice oh my god let's go you're so much better i'm gonna stop yeah oh my god what did you do did you do one of the bodies i measured luke the guy inside really quick oh my god no huge play my take is a diamond board i'm done i'll be there in a second all good and my grapples in case recharging shield i still have an l star by the way i was hoping you're gonna get something good from that oh no i fell off oh they're in here as well all right all right i fell off uh oh my god no i thought i was caustic uh they're in the bunker they've got a watson and a lifeline now i'm not gonna move for me all right we can just go and put another team i really want this you want any skills i don't like them let me let me try and uh make my way in here all right they're kind of focused you guys doing that's the definition of a dying boy you know the really annoying ones done in my apex career i just bounced him right back out oh my god that was that was the pinnacle i don't get better than that was that he's there yeah it's an octane too it's an octane two going around the side jumped off i think he jumped off you beaming that much yeah he just dipped he's like all right i'm out okay it doesn't get better than that i don't i think i just go downhill from here he dropped in and just bounced right back out he's come back up he's going back up the main board he got down on him too i
