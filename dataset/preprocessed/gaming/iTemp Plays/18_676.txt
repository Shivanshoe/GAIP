hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are trying out the newly improved hemlock this gun has always had a bit of a court following because the single fire is effective and satisfying to use but the burst fire which is the primary use of the weapon has always had uh it's always been a little bit lackluster for most players myself included it just kicked a little bit too much and when you compare it to a fully auto gun like the r301 which i think has always outplaced the hemlock on the assault rifle tier list charts it just wasn't quite as good however respawn have made a number of gun balance changes here in season six and one of them is for the hemlock and here they are so we have a reduced vertical recoil in burst mode we have slightly reducing a recall pattern on the second and third shot so the first burst kicks less and also and this is a big one the burst mode time between bursts has gone from 0.32 seconds to 0.28 so not only is it easier to control because of the double whammy of recall reductions but it's time to kill has also been improved quite significantly thanks to the fire rate increase as well and you always have that single fire mode for long ranges to fall back on as well i think it may just be the best assault rifle in the game for season six let me know what you guys think about this and just before i get into the game i'd like to say if you're new around here please consider subscribing we are so close to one million so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i do miss the dolphin dive though because i feel like i added an extra level of skill and getting down to the ground uh yeah i'm not going to have them by the way like when they're just not there quick enough i decided literally for the last second so you left me to die i'm back top give me two seconds oh on me i mean is that the guy with tough trick in the drop down yeah i think so nice job hold on here we go there's a scan where is he all dead oh nice just due to the legendary backpack what does that do uh when you're revised enemies

give you a little bit since you're popping off my friend it's not loads but i'm sort of lacking through i'm afraid no wait don't worry i'm just getting this as long as it's a big fight over this way

few more recon things yeah i'm glad we got this session in though just before uh get in here um probably not there's another team shooting though can you scan or is that i can in one second there you

uav it's actually insane good end especially in these old barrels sorry yeah he's so useful and he's a good utility player i feel like am i going the right way uh nice i've got a god weapon now yeah it's probably one of the best guns in the game to be honest i would probably use someone just called in the supply drop care package they've been using they're trying to learn from jump tower if we can get high ground on them then they're kind of yeah i've got my alt for this a crab i'm just here and you're on your own oh yeah brought by the supply drop and got shielded they've gone away someone
