was gaming merchants but i'm not too sure but some people have been setting up some of shops in apex legends often in bunker they will drop a load of loot in return for safe passage you cannot always trust them however i have two gameplays for you in this video i hope you enjoy them both i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends used to uh just the pc game player okay that's good yeah that makes sense um yeah so i mean i think it might be the pc it has to be the pc i think yeah that was me i kind of shot all good i saw mastiff through the window and i got excited all 301 last if tomba oh what kind of gold did you find on those oh it was a massive right yeah always massive yeah is there another gold one or is it just this is just the master it's just the massive in this one but there are other bunkers i just don't know i never went with them because never never gone to get the loot got my ultimate as well i am pretty much looted i have my two to four r301 what do you think of that oh um what do you mean what's that reaction it does not get i honestly i've been using the the two four time on the on the hemlock it's not it's not that bad i don't know oh yeah on the hemlock it's nice on the r301 it's why is my gun looking this ball i've never seen a gun look this ball before it's my ffa right oh you're sniping i saw you take the sniper ammo oh no i did i really didn't even notice i think so just sort of oh i saw you i just i'm one of the i'm just one of those i'd literally pick up everything i see and then as i run i just emptied it out i'm just like a hoover yeah just leave a little trail of 301 here trail of stuff following me nice random stuff here it's still turning there on the right yet uh broken oh nice job i am bad too much war zone dude i play hyperscape and whenever i play another game it's it's not good i don't know how you play that game on the controller that game is really bad i've played two games on controller oh he's starting a little sharp oh no i needed not going no don't oh all my words i'm not here burning oh no oh look at this teammate look at his teammate come here oh no oh that's why yeah wow that's why we're gonna be on ready.com it's a good i'll tell you what i've got trusty shoes name i'm on your side just just maiden you never know what's gonna happen how dare you you would just debate i would have fallen for it i'd have been ready like uploaded by now to be fair i kind of deserved what that what that what that caustic did to me but i'm still pretty upset about that i cannot believe it you know what they've put all the loot here for i hear people i hear people oh my god it's going to happen i'll get them to come in i'm gonna see if i can pour it and then get him to chase me over here oh these loads is really low you can always switch here oh my god i'm going to do the same thing i'm going to get on top of that that's not good though oh they all did yeah all this loot is actually coming in handy now it is right here i can't believe that i almost got scanned that's why they didn't do it i've just realized i've been fine he just i just stared at him for a second he stared at me pulled out his spitfire and put it in my mouth are these guys yeah it's a revenue right yeah they did have alt but it's just gone i think they were like that way they're so funny no oh don't no why does everybody have snipers what the heck yeah i think so it's nothing so good on pc it's got some shield cells for me here we go thanks friends thank you oh i want to come in they're making their way scan me crack oh my god absolutely shredded nice i'm not with you this team's dead but the team is like oh my god down nice mata neither guy just more to the right splash more people have taught eyes why does everybody have snipers i don't know dude there's so many snipers yeah i have one shield cell oh my god i got use the shield cells and came on bass i'm out of action for a little date you're good you guys they're not pushing dude pc players are weird oh like on on playstation people will literally just run out oh yeah yeah people on pc are so like they are very passive how can you see me i'm leaving the yeah they have a low bolt up there they're big chilling that's seen in all my shield cells there's a team behind them too they might get they might get uh started i i see the shots coming over the hill i think they did i think they got 30. i'm tempted to go up i have one shield right there they're still right there are they still looking i i have some for you oh yeah they're looking here uh you're gonna have to pick them up out so thank you you're gonna you're do you want to go straight back through the thing uh yeah these guys have like the craziest high ground on us yeah they're being weird too oh my god i hate them so much check everything's reloaded i have one spare shotgun round but it's fine oh they just oh and i think they're looking at us again this is another team they're down low they're going away nice max on the mirage crack nice nice i shouldn't do that i have no hammer okay she did she did you guys get i have two phoenixes what do i need i don't know what i need that's good i think whatever i don't care you guys are annoying i kind of want to push them i think they're occupied god broke that one back there oh god oh wait what i'm getting shot from behind so awake one's gonna fall down another you know we unfortunately took us to like the middle of the fight yeah that was weird i was getting shot in the back wow i was getting destroyed by a pk too oh someone had to peek out god yep oh god dude there's the pk here's some above us too be careful okay i should be dropping down on them or something come on [Music] oh someone's up yeah you're right i'm gonna fall down and i thought maybe they dropped down being stupid and they they just sat there up top not even flanking the team nothing man i know just me i don't even know i'm trying to figure out what else i need to make i need to make more i'm just i don't want to get shot i'm scared oh no when you put your arm in there it's terrifying it really is when you click him when you're trying to just pick up the ammo and then you click it more than once and it puts you back in yeah oh my god have you how many times have you tried that um i have not found it in the care pack once you're not oh yeah even even when i uh look at the care packs i never find them oh no i i've seen it in uh people's boxes that's all honest i'm watching i'm watching can they run off a little bit i forgot firing on subjects right there in the back is low here we go nice oh my god nice don't feel a little bit bad i was close and it was in the end i might as well use my scans yep under the gold barrel stabilizer oh more quickly okay separate teams they all have to come this way yeah i need to use my diva for that no oh we're uh we're in the storm too yep i'm going to put some traps down here are they tough still um i think so i don't know where they are follow me okay i'm gonna get this uh 242 what was mine though like i don't know if i've just dropped one that was close to being red i feel like i did oh like the armor you don't know yeah i hate that i don't even i don't even bother anymore i literally just swap yeah i could show that yeah this is 52. like they didn't let me switch back to because it was weaker oh man they should put it next to it i think here you want a gold i think they're called i know i'm okay thanks i'm 52 on fred you like uh you like the red a little bit more than the gold oh yeah definitely yeah i i wanna i wanna like the gold more but it's it's hard to and it's only 75. i know it's worth using until you can find something that has red though i think that's that yeah i can go peek at this fake oh they're right there he's just running in the storm oh they're in the storm are we behind one's low right that guy might my recoil is the opposite way where i want it no nice guys oh god let's go before we go yeah my recall was all the way to the like the rice wherever it was and i was desperately trying to taste jenna can bring it back so many shots i feel that tiny bit astray remains it really does but we got to do it how many times that happened to us today too many i wonder if it's a solo oh hopefully obviously you just want to win vk if you fancy uh i'd rather not throw yeah let me see i know what doesn't mean that's the problem all just means yeah and he's probably going to have one and he won't yeah that's the promise shotguns like i'm missing you do nothing at least if you mess with the fog you're next but it's like half a millisecond after that yeah all right are these guys just cracking his life away quite possibly these care packs been opened uh [Music] watson and a bloodhound he added a bit quick bit of calculus all those years in math finally paid off yes it did i think why didn't she just put the ultimate down anyway i don't know i don't know i don't know she had 55 fences that might as well have yeah she put it up afterwards um i was yoinking kills or something but gg we wanted a good job we did a good job out there
