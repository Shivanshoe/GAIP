hey wassup guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today I have a nice long double whammy for you the first game is one where I was going for the good badges on low but in ranked 420 kill the 4k however as the lobbies are pretty easy in gold so I just wanted to try and play aggressive and see what happens because I don't have too long left until I reach platinum and then I won't be able to go for this team ranked anymore and the second game is a nice old Joe as well ahead so I hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah here goes nothing indeed my friend here goes nothing indeed right laughs they should be a bit of a hot shot because that purple shields nobody's not there's a purple bag nice to Havoc's multiple habits let me switch out loudly how's my Blue Shield's yeah I didn't mean to give the play Sheltie okay good there we go I'm good I got my own blue shirt back now just give me a second to mix give me a sec I just want to know base I mean I guess I should have been really known here to be honest have you got in a blue I'm not sure I can take this at this angle ask my old body shields that's already hit and I have to just go back through and try and take the high ground from these guys I think it's the only way actually managed to win this fight I think I should have rushed out of my teammate I think guys a little bit late their team cohesion wasn't too good and I think it's my fault I've got a double hammock bow which is uh is that illegal it's easy loading ramps or well I'd be reported for GT you our story it's not fair goodness literate it's not fair he's Sheila's team oh I'm not sure of us anymore but I was I was when she was going at me with the Mastiff unfortunately a wraith time/date it takes so long to kill a team of three sometimes trying to reposition the secret to 1v3 is I slaying your targets each one of those gunfights there was a 1v1 even though there was three of them and one of me if I was even shot by two of them even for two seconds you just get beamed it just makes it so much more difficult I mean the dog what havoc isn't actually fair like this gummies I don't know how it's so so good they nerfed it but it's still an absolute laser beam they didn't actually fix many of these shoes in my opinion to avoid game reported here we have to leave it behind I keep again and they've moved this respawn beacon to it used to be up top oh okay what a start two full teams done unfortunately the right these fall that the octane has a little second chance here and I have my ultimate so they can get some armor before they go down like save some time I guess I hope it's mellow as well so I let my team I just take the rest of the stuff she just pulled up with level 1 Evo shield you haven't even hit anyone yes yes just getting angsty I've got a Korsak no unfortunately that's his ultimate okay kicking off with a wingman I wasn't even the me we know is that the scape I'll never know what I want now what was he okay was that we met I was saying beefing even if the digital not the didn't have a school piece Ronnie excited beefy these three full teams they've just been a demolish three teams faced three teams demolished here and there are 32 of the people named they're scrapping teammate already say were was that the sound of a low proximate I think I've actually the sound of a low prospering here and white still be looting them no gunshots anyways coming over my bet we'll find something there's someone over there is it gonna come up on one wire is coming over I'm just gonna brush mate this isn't good actually this route isn't good okay please don't I'm struggling here teammate my talent is literally fighting a different team right now he's flown right over the top of this thing talk to me Amiga yeah I know another squads attacking at you how did you fly over my head oh this might kill me this would be the saddest end I think I'm okay if I got killed that resonate with the first clip storms looking flying but it's kind of slow moving at least now I have high ground and at least now I'm the third party rather than just facing the team alone no I need your aims that's all I wanted I guess I was too far away from the boxes I have 16 shots are you not getting shot in the back no I'm glad because there we go they're not stealing my kill but this is a different team down low they were fighting each other how are they not how they just let him sit there chin behind a rock life flies reviving people don't revive my kennel hey go sorry friend don't need your gun whatever you may have I have one weapon right at the moments what have you got for me let's be fire tremendous just what I needed with no sight in it why do you use all my word what is this I incite Michael Schell please goodness I have some reusables here I understand and look for too long because I'm on the edge of the storm and I don't have that Loeb is gonna look down at me it just wasn't worth standing there I mean I assume that she's just gonna run he makes banners dead but you go she's getting out there can't blame her storms coming in I decimated a team we don't have too far to go but I'll just nervous of the fact that she repositioned she might got high ground on me and then just killed me it would have been the second saddest way to go after after dining the storm I can that would have taken the cake it's over inline hammer though would have been nice to be able to have more time but what can you do we'll just kill more people hopefully or I need eight kills and there are 13 people left and people scrapping I know this isn't good no one's gone down there lead-out that's a squat down after these teams a little bit weak I'm just gonna run in this isn't good okay I'm dead I'm dead I'll pay that so bad I'll pay that so bad I have to play aggressive though twenty kill badge on me I messed up I messed up 12 kills that quick what's my damage looking like two and a half maybe possible I don't know oh good game still goes the game alright diving board at ease my friends are back at the board of diving nests and this is my word oh good grief Oh Scott visit big fan of a school play I don't know why this is making me talking slow-motion - but this isn't an issue with the video that you're watching this is literally for game like apex legends quicksand edition a friend wins have a look found no Rick play six those likeness of the server it is my game a little bit easier though because the people you're aiming at can't move just don't get caught don't don't finish my teammate I'll just kill you instead then I'll get you both come on you go out of that work out for you you weep okay teammate I'll get you back don't worry okay this I've had a game like this before and I've stuck it out and it lets you it does fix itself eventually after that's the same for this lobbies well because it would be horrendous if we have to play like this the entire time I think we're good here we are you often this isn't good I tried see me but the service or fix yourself which is I mean it's not perfect calm down it's not perfect but it's better than it was Hagen chased them you give me in an advantageous spot see ya thanks for playing guys I appreciate it these guys didn't even hear a little brainy from they just they've Rudy wants to kill me I mean I can appreciate it but the caustic branding still she listened see a table when you've got shield batteries it's probably worth just putting the battery on it doesn't take long otherwise he can just turn around three Buffy with the women right another successful good fight as four kills service or fixed itself a little bit now i think the fewer paper are in the servant viewer like the lesser demand ease so it sort of the lag sort of fix yourself only you do not it's all good where's the live and I like is diminished oh they are scrapping this way it's a big market scrap I find out the last toiler on here is anything yeah that bear up top to me I I don't know why I didn't expect that nice tremendous okay I like it I think we would be okay but I don't know where that other team is I wasn't expecting them to be up top and I wasn't expecting to the Permian it's go up there with no weapon in my hand expect me to be fine friend quick revive in the shrubbery always good trying get some high ground what's the life that's French yes go grazie - all right there stop throwing grenades each other here so one of my shots was eaten up on the rainy and that's not fair at all hey Amy threes for get me Jeremy through the portal gab me a delay there's another like three teams is converging on market for some reason coming for you I think I'll forget your friend he just revived me I need to get him off the roof I need to stop one of these ravings cuz it's close enough so they can hear it and they need to turn around them and beam me on the way up this gives me enough time to sweep so yeah that's all I wanted all right what happened fighting each other we've just the treats absolutely looking they're French absolutely nothing with turn des I went down nearly twice and then you went down and now now we're in dire straits this isn't good whatsoever Soph open a care package has a weapon in it there we go the old devotion I'll take it my wingman I'm afraid it's not the one I thought I thought it was gonna be the one you know when you find school peace with the star the game with the wingman next to it you think it's a sign but that we man it's not for me I'm over that now friend of dropsy I'm no longer part of the wing man damn I'm afraid you're thinking about past some people are some people are not and unfortunately I am NOT these guys are still a co-fighter mcsweats always you still going absolutely wild sorry can we just try we can try again round two of the big markets crap that bosom isn't okay these as though they've moves out to my teammate how's your purple shields teammate I've never liked this whole time I think I'm plate okay I don't camp there's like eight of you if you're all in the same spot it's gonna shoot all eight there's a matter if I get bamboozled seven times when you're that close to your decoys I can just fire all of you at the same time and throw an effective strategy yeah probably appreciate that all done fire dance technique yeah I'm going on that the old circular run technique they'll still fight him and market it's been the last five minutes it feels like I'm coming back with this tie got a Devo instead of a wingman far easier to use scream pray rather than precise headshots with a skull piece a wingman absent tragic accuracy I think you've been actually sure you through that my friend okay you can choose for that one it does hold that for a second please pharmacy damage but that wasn't it's your teammate down or something it was two of them in their old strategy they asked that's that's brave do you know what I think I think she thought I moved because I only show myself for a while so that was actually that was a bold play I think she thought I dropped down behind or something soon as I was and you know I wasn't thinking she thought she could get free high ground wasn't the case he'd look like a stupid move but only because he didn't work out it was actually kind of smart it's the diving board waves they're back at it again on the side of the diving board for some reason I find the sight air of hooligans are you sure we're supposed to do about this I've seen on a teacher friend now ran off and damaged their week like a this is our third time back here are frequent residents over decided the map backed up so they can use their Scouts on us he's got a peacekeeper yeah I can't change that the man's got a peas keep any sound diving board well not in what he was he was sound dragon board and also it's a robot non man still apart from that it was a cure information enemy inside another 10 tap these guys again little by these smoke grenades it's on the roof design this house this is I'll do that I was gonna say I'm not dying to the diving board weed it's not happening it is not happening and there you go that's that's our reward we win that bone believes it's most elongated fights of all time it was unnecessary unnecessarily elongated I couldn't get on the roof if I could get on the roof you can fire through the little holes in the wood and you can you can murder on through that mm damage still considering we were we're being tatis half way through we have to sort of reset I have to respawn the teammate yes it'll revive me which would have reset that's not too bad nice or 10 kill wing thanks for watching I don't do pretty shady and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
