hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back playing some solo ranks and one of my random teammates turned out to be the biggest lunatic i've ever played with i'm not sure if it was him trying to rush to reach his 5000 kill milestone on bangalore as he was on 4970 or so or if he was just like uber tilted out of his mind but this man would just run in like a psychopath at every opportunity i had to throw any sort of reason out of the window and i just waited to see where he wanted to go and i followed him the problem was that i ended up stealing pretty much every kill from him not on purpose listen sometimes it just works out like that and he was not best pleased also my g fuel code is currently 30 off so you can try the new shiny splash of flavor from a drive for a massively discounted price this may be my new favorite flavor it's tremendous it really just tastes as good as it looks there's a link in the description or you can just use the code item at checkout for 30 off so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right the big rotating fan of doom it is my friends i hate landing here when he does that to you and it just like pulls up a little bit too early because you get too close to the fins of the fan you need to find a good old armor in that that's devastating friends are coming oh no armor huh okay three people no i'm in between them and now i've got myself purple this is the actual dream right here i 300 damage and three kills actually maybe a little bit more because i thirsty the crypto i think that counts maybe 400 damage still 300 damage to people that are actually standing up and now we have this place to ourself and we have a crafter so i can get myself some gold barrel stabilizers so i no longer have to miss any shots this game that's you're already at hammond labs think about we could craft he's scrapping though he's not gonna come back i'm coming over we should probably just push our advantage i can't see there's a load of smoke everywhere i've got a sneak tactic though if they come out this way this is the bangalore on both okay you guys are still you gotta stop meeting with that twelve health between you good grief goldwing man i would pick it up if i could land a wingman strap but unfortunately i cannot so that he's going to stay in the box there's a bangalore on both teams and i i don't have a digital threat so i couldn't even see what was going on in that fight i would alluded that my friend we should probably go back listen there's a crafter right here a replicator can get ourselves some gold barrel stabilizers it's ranked there's still 40 people left i am looking for an extended energy magazine are they up there or you just i don't think they are hey he's okay he's found someone else to rush is he oh he's got like 5 000 kills all right that explains it he's just a big kill hungry i get it he's trying to get to 5 000. he's on like 4 900. and i respect it there was a replicator here we'd be laughing we could make some shield bats all sorts of stuff i need a better bag as well this is drastic hours over here extended heavy mag here level two he was just rushing like up top and hammond labs he couldn't have heard any gunshots because there was no one here uh but he expected someone to be here i mean i respect it we've probably just got back something good i have six kills i assume that i think might hear some assist points between them still seen someone oh he's not pleased with that one i didn't mean to steal that can i understand my welcome okay oh we got his ultimate off now i can't even see anything yeah thank you for taking all that stuff i'm going to get to this loot am i i'm literally not going to get to this look in time oh my word level 1 extended energy did they have a better one than that did you switch your level 1 out for that or what what's going on it's better than look nothing are you sure sounds like a tall to me this is dead this is definitely in the tunnel bangalore if there's no one up here yeah it's down here something good this is gonna give yourself some kills this is the way to go i've got every single kill so far which i do feel slightly bad about but you know nine kills i mean that's ludicrous the amount of damage that i've done here eleven damage i did to one of those guys french hey you got him all right well there's my first assist i mean to be fair the best way to lose is to kill other people so i do respect it there's actually someone there yes there is okay i'm never quite sure with this bangalore i've taken under the kill okay at least that was 51 damage it wasn't 11. 11 was a little bit insulting but 51 is like no it's like a core of his health i'll do that i need a bigger bag i hate not having a purple bag because i love carrying about 12 sure bats extended you know recharging shield and this one you could stack three shield bats because then i could carry like 15. where you going class is trying to wall run there isn't time for friend that was fun for all but mostly us i think somewhere to go but i'm like it'd be pointless i'm just gonna wait for this guy to make a move somewhere i'll follow him i mean i could get 10 seconds off my ultimate here there's only 12 other people left who barely played this game teammate smoked it out for me so no one can shoot me hey come on jackie's angry man i think he might be upset with me for taking his kills guys trying to get to 5000 and i keep nicking him listen i'm sorry and okay well it's the second ring in ranked i don't know how this has happened to us sometimes the ranked games go on to the end all it takes is like two or three squads that are really trying to get placement points and then the game are gone for like 22 minutes because it's so difficult to push a team that has like a gibby or a caustic or you know watson something like that but then other games are like this one where you've got kurichi 89 there must be about seven of kurichi's this game one on each squad and everyone is just full centered and then it's kind of not boring there's a little bit of a mid-game law so to speak oh here we go look at this look at this for a spot reminiscent of uh world's edge it's sorting factory joking if i didn't move anyone would see me honestly i think this is the strat oh little care package this is going to be a problem and i'm going to switch it out to this vault no it's a gold helmet you know what i'm pathfinder that's still pretty good little care pack is dropping oh i'll save it this is gonna be a pro but i took the last one so this guy can this guy can get this one i've stolen all his kills he can take the care package luke you know he's literally walks right past it there you go probably told you he's this is scrappy of course of course he's not stopping he wants to get he wants to get involved this guy's cracking me up energy ammo here he's got like one gear go that's it go full send it get him she just walked straight past the care package to save what like three seconds i found him contact i mean they were fighting a second ago here we go i missed a lot of shots but i saw him for like 100. careful yeah there you go that needs to use this at least squad can't see this is where the one times isn't that good we could literally just keep them for free but if they're big scrapping i'm i mean i don't know what you guys want to do we just need to like stay out of it until they scrap until they get into like a building scrap and then we can just get over there sounds like they are there we go you don't want to be too much of a threat you want you want to let them scrapping out first oh my word or whatever i've seen one of these in ages god this is a mess i think trump a lot of damage you get involved i'm coming to help that's not good thanking my teammate i mean i cracked him i think we just thrown i think we've literally just thrown don't tell me we're just throwing this game it had to be the lifeline that i left alive didn't it so if you can just get a free raise on the pathfinder i mean i down two of them pack the other one i mean what's going on smurf5995 and smurf55241 nice oh i should have just switched the armor out for the gibby on the floor i just walked out there with white thinking they were both one shot and they were not i should have just taken an extra two seconds but my teammate was getting shot at and i felt bad i ran out there like a lunatic 861 damage and no kills listen i'm sorry i didn't mean to take them i got 14 kills myself we listen we took out 15 people as a squad that's still pretty good 2300 damage i had a lot of kills at the start on people that didn't have any armor so that's not like i stole every kill you know i still did a lot of damage let's get the record straight here but i did just throw at the end i i could have yeah i could have revived the lifeline i could have army switched to a better armor i could have just shield batted my red armor and i probably would have been all right but you know it is what it is it is what it is did we make three plus one two four we did i ranked up good for me that's all i care about ranking up thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you on the next one bye
