hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i don't see this tactic being utilized enough when playing revenant people don't use his ultimate to retrieve teammates banners enough you can get them risk-free in the second game that i have for you today i used this tactic and had a mobile respawn placed on the ground back at the totem it was great i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you guys for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends wells edge and then when when it's not world's edge we can go back into ranked that is a very long time of apex which i am not committed to you have me for one hour okay and i am gone it's one hour one hour and that is it there are people over this way mated only me apparently i got no visuals there are a few of them they're according to on ground floor two teams oh my god mate i just randomly jumped onto a nade okay do you need that uh i'm coming

with you yeah i'm just trying to force this team out because the team's just uh trying to push it behind us i think it's just one he switched we have like a few angles on these guys now tim has got a charge rifle he down one as well it's great they're getting shot in the back he's committed over there i broke up valkyrie one drop don't drop no job nice job body shield coming in with the with the support i'm gonna have to see if he hadn't i have 18 in my i mean there's loads of death boxes there'll be some light rains 236 there we go you just see the charge driver coming from over the top that's great wait i just picked up this is this is meant to be i just picked up someone else's vault and they've got the crocodile skin that's crazy why is this meant to be i used to use the crocodile skin on the vault because it was so ugly before before this season where they had the t110 volkswagen that's when i changed it but before then i was well known across the apex community for using the crocodile vault skin and i've just picked one up i don't know i remember people using that no literally no one's ever used it it's just me i remember i remember other people like talking about that well yeah because they yeah only because they saw me use it you know before before before me i'm just playing i remember i'm the best course you've ever seen i think so yeah yeah yeah those that that's got me killed before that one behind the box i know you've never i don't think you've ever stopped talking about that i mention it at least once a day it's a highlight mate it's in my mind it's on the montage it's both the opening and the closing clip it's the same clip it's the same clip yeah i'll just play twice just so they don't forget it i feel it how far is alpha oh no no it's like how how can we hear this this is so dumb oh they'll be here as well i'll go to this one across the map wait your mom at let's kill someone subject spotted here all over here octane on my head this is uh yeah this is a whole sweaty team too they're gonna push this building for sure i don't want to like open it on you 60 seconds left sorry switched there he's okay yeah yeah i'm going to go this left side mate here i'm just running up the side of this the horizon up i can't even see this guy i think one's inside this guy's one my punch missed what's that he's gonna die in the storm yeah yeah bank has gold that's okay thank you mate i'm still trying phoenix uh i'm good i'll just pop this thank you that my punch my face was literally she was she was biting it you know and he didn't connect they're punching didn't they didn't they like do something in a punch i don't know it might be my 120 ping oh that's possible oh but i ten i play on that three thousand ping oh it is true you're kind of complaining it's crazy i'm kind of yeah i'm kind of sorry i have three bandages i have one meds two bandages you can craft some minecraft you're mad i will never do that ever you'd rather die i'd rather die in the zone miserable i've been alone i'll be here i'll get you banner drop me the bandage oh thank you that's huge man that's a big drop hey yeah where'd that come from uh i was just in my inventory for a while teammate might be dead he's going the long way he's still all the way back there oh he's going a long way around oh he's up there oh i should send you further it should they're so they're so underpowered just like where are you gonna go from there everything that's the lowest point and everything around it is like raised in higher ground where exactly can you go oh they're buying gold guns that's what's happening oh dragon oh man what oh they are they make careful spotted subject over there 95.95 i'm [ __ ] this guy behind i'm going to try and get him i don't know where he went he grabbed away today i didn't see him though stop it a state to these mimi goes we are back at it again i have a marksman and a sniper and a bow and once again i forgot to take the arrows so i don't know why i always do that that's i always do it with that's not that team there are two teams here i always do with the bow check i take the bow check itself forget the arrows leave them behind it's a character flaw i need to i need to work on it i'll be honest everybody trying to rush us uh in a bit of a tricky spot here don't risk in high ground let's see the guys in the middle like both of them all right perfect we had enough time to peek it was a bit of a risk attacking that angle because i got shot in the back but and my teammates my teammates level 13 i'm not sure if he's smurfing maybe he's actually new maybe he's good at other games in his own start playing apex but he's got a wingman and he's playing real aggressive and he's level 13. look at him go guys a psychopath i lost him i looked on some people i don't know why it's so satisfying oh my god you've got one as well always good to silence uh by flame when you have their teammate down because then they can't do the afk lifeline revive you know might catch him off guard and i am just we put this bed here is this what it's like to play with me this guy is sitting every 10 out of 10 graph well that's not like it's not like me to 10 out of 10 grapple so the answer to my original question is no that's not what it's like to play with me whoa where'd you get the momentum from guys just zoom in okay well rest in peace double headshot just in case you never know who's trying a third party here at the fainting get back in the distance no one on planet earth has any energy ammo attempts let's be honest it's probably going to be purple armor but i'm hoping it's an alternator because i'm kind of low on energy and the alternator eats incredible i i miss the alternators groundling i'm going to say it was such a sturdy weapon to land on didn't need any attachments you could easily one clips on with it because the fire rate was so manageable if you're off target you probably miss one or two bullets this guy's gonna beat me to it please don't i really want to know please please i was one who think this uh dropped his shotgun as well didn't me so that's probably a he's probably got an automated this is just that time i mean i can't really claim it can i he got there first they're up there all right i've got my lt might be a good time for it playing an immobile character is pretty tough i'm just constantly chasing oh there's a triple tape oh come here let's mess him up i can barely see this guy he's invisible he's opaque don't want me i'm just just climbing the wall i just need to keep this guy off him so he can't thirst my teammates what kind of strategy was that what was the plan was the long-term goal what was the five-step plan involved oh what's honest this guy his ultimate is a complete waste of time how is it just him hello having a good time got a teammate somewhere hey what was the gold thing it hasn't got any gold armor or anything there must be an attachment he's one of the blood times teammate yeah i'm honestly i'm fine for you to get the mana i've got no energy ammo i'm missing every single wingman shot i can't really fight i don't know why i'm so struggling to see these people when i've got the wingman i don't know what it is i gotcha these guys are distracted they're fine he's got a spitfire which might prove to be troublesome i've got a lot of med kids i think you may be screwed magruder amigo and they've give you all to you i've got a plan though i've got my ultimate really soon all from here grab his banner come back don't leave see me i've got an ingenious plan i should lose this guy yet every energy put it going this is genius i didn't reload i should have let them kill me to be honest he would have sent me back i'd be respawning by now i should have stood on the bush and let them kill me kills they still might be work i've got five med kits and there's loot up this way i honestly think this is this is an achievable goal here this way there's death boxes everywhere here here they're looking at us this way i'm going to try and go more to the right i'm going to try and get a different angle so my team has some time to flute or whatever i missed once again i'm missing a lot i'm going to say the triple safe i don't think my teammate can even get this loot that easy i've got a minute until the fourth ring it's fine i was gonna problem anyway i see you oh thanks for playing that's how you use revenant ultimate well there are many different uses but that's one of them that people don't utilize enough getting in there and getting your teammates banner safely it doesn't matter if they send you back you can just cover such a large distance that you'll just run off afterwards it didn't go completely to plan i should have let them send me back admittedly but it was still a good tactic 10 kills 2300 damage we had absolutely no right to win that that guy was the kill leader he had eight kills and a spitfire and they were both holding us from zone and we still won gg outrageous game
