hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and uh with the care package takeover that's happening on apex right now i thought it'd be a fun idea to only use the care package weapons this isn't too much of a challenge because they're really good off spawn they come with level two attachment across the board but we did have a nice variety of guns in the two games that i have for you today i hope you guys are having the best day of all time thank you for watching this video i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends blueberry smalls just reminds me of blueberry flavor oh this one yeah that's a nice one i don't know why it's just a nice little summer jab came out at the right time too like right at the beginning oh god i lost just launched her into the air i was so happy oh yeah she we landed the same one i threw my tactical at her feet and just launched her into there she couldn't get the armor it worked out perfect where are you doing oh what's going on i'm looking for heather balls when i know they lose the care packages which don't drop in the board um yes or something rifle uh no uh yes i am uh no and there's nothing you can do buddy get over there oh my god all right bring up jerry oh there's multiple things here oh god oh god rich 24 in her she's off that thing i was turning on me i should have armed why didn't i armor switch what another armor switch oh you don't need me i'm saving you my charge rifle's gone there's a 301 right here i know white armor it's like if i get my charge back probably i mean yeah why wouldn't you tell me something did you uh my brain just doesn't even find something there's like a certain tier of weapon that just doesn't register in my brain massive g7 alternator g7 just doesn't even register basically every gun that you like i'm graphing up top if i die one i tried them once in the face and i see you it's like a down person you didn't say that i thought she was crouched healing you don't understand she was burning so she managed to jump over that to get to cover so it really threw me off okay i lasered her and then she ran into my terminal i really appreciate if you stopped that i i mean i was dead and you were literally shooting a down person so it's really he's really fine that was uh that was the longest thermite i've ever seen she ran through it and then like 10 seconds later she got down yeah she was kicking away uh i'm going i've been saying my charge rifle combination okay i'm not with you for a little while so don't worry you lost you lost just lost wow i know this time i got this that's just right beneath and i'm coming with this hard drive his name was you lost oh rather imagine the confidence oh that is the most beautiful third party you've ever seen they're all dead i did about 20 damage and now they're all dead that is tremendous oh my god we just win all of this what is um i've just all these people just got scammed the mechanics of an absolute demon so yeah oh my gosh oh that's funny they jumped off the track i'm not with you like at all i'm really just not the other one's broken [Music] i know i'm fine by myself won't like it but who's getting shot now sir wait i think one's pushing i just want to heal i literally can't see anything near the size of a fridge don't worry i fell back don't i'm using the charge rifle i'm gonna pick up this devotion because why not so brutal can't wait to get one tapped by craver oh my god dude i just froze no you didn't oh i wonder if you are now i'm okay uh okay i gotta close up with my spitfire charge rifle combo this is gonna be oh i'm just gonna have to return you wanna try oh god i found him you'll win this just win this i'll be back i don't know if i can oh i'm shocked oh if they get a crater no she spotted me come back so far i need you come back one minute before the ring closes [Music] he's got a crater the ring is in close proximity less than one minute this is rough guys i sharp the rings you can't speak so far you're not connected to the game here i go [Music] uh recharging shields a recharge [Applause] yes where are you so far i'll save you come on hello yes i'll push you back into safety ex champions wait you're still are you still protecting me no i killed him they're dead oh you killed him anyone yeah yeah yeah but you get a blue one straight from the get-go that's the crate yeah oh nice behind as well you space somewhere oh i gotta get an armor give me two get down get down thank you i have a wingman i have a evil or a spitfire and uh last thief i swear on did you kill batman um yes there's no way there's only one armor wait there's still a care package oh there was one on the other side too on the other side of this big team here we go it's cool yeah i don't think there wasn't anyone i'm doing back at german weapons too here we go it's actually a struggle oh it's fine i have a habit alternator yeah but then once you go against the 99 it's just kind of like no people mace they really though yes right here right on this oh he's literally just doing it see he missed oh this is a different guy um i have six i don't want to go back and check that box i don't want it to be true that i mix them you'll you'll find out in your youtube comments okay [Music] you're yeah you can kind of play around it's you can kind of do some little plays with it stabilizer here level four right here all right same [Music] broke one oh okay so i okay so i should have done that so well i left for you but then you left for me or did you just troll me i like i saw you and then i shot him and then i missed but then i saw him just stand there yeah he was just he gave up so then i just kind of stared at him i was just like okay are we trolling now and then he turned and then he turned and he shot me in the face that's why you just can't throw them in the andy it doesn't work you're looking like a good 1v2 because usually i mean i'm dead when i heard the devo start spinning up i got a little scared i was like oh no this is i just threw again i had a little bit of there owing all right so do we oh we should probably go purple right we gotta upgrade our weapon yeah yeah yeah oh whoa whoa whoa whoa oh you see that look at those mechanics never seen anything like it kind of crazy triple take what we got um i got a little 301 picking it up looks like alternates there i'll throw one i'm gonna there's there's another three or one in this one all right i wanna is there a fly line oh yup i gotta fly all right flatline 301 that's quite the combination it's not too shabby uh i don't think i should take this comment but down low as well he dropped on this side this is prime triple take he's done someone and i don't think they're selling cookies one on the right is almost dripping that one's really though it's a leaf line she's really though there's no aiming so i'm give you with a red armor attention delivering replicator yo come on boy he doesn't have power we could just dive on him oh he can show the back charging space back in that corner 102 on him he's rising uh two teams two teams are in the middle of both of them they're still the team to the left i'm trying to hold off this team they're not pushing we're just frying each other there's still this pathfinder he's behind this he's behind this night this thing's so difficult you got that right no where is he still in there yeah i think you went down there oh i'm not gonna chase that guy whatever i need uh like i can never use this site ever again it's so difficult is it rough it's like i don't know why there's no aim assist on the sniper scope but it doesn't make any sense to me it's it's really weird how they're just they just don't work the danishes makes it look really bad right to the front door entrance really last team what are we doing rich are we doing another scenario uh yes we're getting right okay um i'm i'm not gonna pick up the crater i might but today from my triple take shots so far it's a really bad idea yeah i'm just not gonna do it it's hard it's hard to uh go against uh mouse keyboard players is that right rudy's they're just it's just so much more responsive not fair i missed the should i miss i miss my charge rifle that's what i mean did you just drop it like two seconds ago i don't know all the one from a few if you remember a second ago are a few games i mean yeah that would have been an easy solution okay did you see did you see those i whoa you actually just stay there just don't even know if you look at the lamppost look at that oh see that's kind of cool it's just the best one you've ever seen um oh yeah they're up here they're high ground is so much more impressive are you kidding wait what are you doing we're supposed to be farm damage from a farm i'm angry about them let me push in get out of there yeah i don't know if they're going to push that oh red it's right in front of me it's literally right in front of him oh i'm going i'm trying to get the ones in front of them yeah i i have credibility another pk another pk and red armor where are you guys where are they how are they gonna hold like that and just not push pretty make any sense yes dies i'm swapping again armor swaps all the way over here oh that's not fair okay that was really fun i wasn't recording the apex champions you won't record it no you
