hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing watson i didn't do this on purpose i need you to know that we were playing ranked i was octane we got into a new game and the random teammate that we had chose octane before me i didn't realize and apex thought it was a great idea to put me on bottom because i play it all the time and they know that now i don't want you watson mains out there to hate me because i am on your team she needs some love from respawn and fortunately improvements are on the way i do understand what respawn have said previously which is that watson is actually a strong character in apex but she's not fun to play i kind of agree with this but she's only strong in very specific situations which when compared to bloodhound cb and octane just to name a few doesn't make her strong at all also i am possibly the worst watson in the entire world i have maybe four games played on her since she came out in what was it season two i have no clue what i'm doing what i do know is that she needs a buff so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends where are we going because you're going diagonal it's making me feel sick just ping why'd you leave you're going diagonal it's making me feel weird i'm going this way i wasn't though you 100 oh i left a whole accelerant on the roof i'm so stupid oh yeah he's in that small room right there this gun is like actually terrible a sense no yes yeah like versus a longbow it's pointless oh yeah it's worth the time pointless of everyone's time um i believe i i believe i think you got some hey there's a load brought up here they're on the low bro i'm not gonna shoot him okay well 70. i broke a brokerage nice you could have headshot them if the r9 wasn't popping off big 70 another 70 on lifeline oh she's looting it imagine being able to pc loot my phone's cracked i don't have an angle you're by yourself oops i'm still kind of behind trying to push too much 70 on ray yes she's in the lifeline he's not the guy's right here trying to watch ignore those fences i don't know if you saw them but don't look at them please do you know what happened my right my right thing got i was trying to throw my ultimate down my right thing got broke like stuck what am i watching no it got like it got stuck i just placed three fences down this is a gold lobby if i've ever seen one imagine imagine coming across that and then seeing me oh that's funny i'm sticking i'm sticking the center i don't care you're popping off might just whenever you get into a fight with a guy with a lambo it's just oh there's no points you're screwed um can you do me favor and let me know if you see any extra bats um yes do you have any how many do you have one okay watch this defense okay okay there's literally no way to get past this at all correct it is it is impossible i want you to know that i just jumped over um yeah it makes me sad it's okay my fences were rock bottom so anything after that he's fine you know only gonna get better wait there's a lambo here do i pick it up rich oh they there's a team here yes you do pick it up okay i'm also an idiot i don't need to craft a purple mag oh they're on the crafter ah you are watson's cracks buttons on our own i'm going to go high ground that's any cracks but i'm also needy cracks went up top oh he canceled that's big wait is already somebody up here does he know he's enough i got one i got one but i mean he shot from behind uh new team boston's cracked okay i'm fine you okay hey i'm on top oh how do i miss all of those bloodhounds one night was that an audio glitch right here right here there's a octane rocket oh i'm just looting a little bit i don't know nice job i just need the basketball octane is right here and there's a wreath right there 101 let's try oh my god i think he's just running there's a pad here he's running like west oh you're here over there yeah uh there's a little tunnel over here i'm just gonna leave for once again this guy had all the sniper targets one minute you guys are good yeah yeah oh there's a mobile over here that was the solo um that was just the blue tone i don't know where that lifeline went different team that lifeline was it's gonna get some cells have you already got three times or you're not using it uh i have other time yeah my lambo's already completely decked huge lumbar's actually so good it got buffed somewhat recently didn't it too so that's rarely sean i just usually don't have the patience for that oh yeah that big rock 60. might be other teams here gotta be careful yeah cross across over here over there 48. is it broken oh if they're tough on me and then the other one i think one of them guy's just closing everyone he's like that's his job he's crazy i'm trying to watch his watch is back the other one was over here that's my fault i thought that would look down low we gotta there's there's still this enough is over this way i'm down to leaving now because the hair glitching with the rampage that's very tricky yeah when he's trying we need to try and force that oh this way yeah i think that's the bloodhound 48. uh i think we have to follow them i think something like that the team's holding uh the other choke point it's just two of them give you people attached that's uh that's a sear although that's not their team good point yeah they're gonna be right on the other side of this i think on this curve there's a team on the right team on the left come here i'm gonna shoot the guys up top that down because i've got awesome accelerants yeah i think we gotta we gotta move uh we gotta move this way this team is gonna they're gonna set up shields yeah well they have to move so they already have a shield back there how is that not hidden behind they're fine obviously we can move this recharging shield tracking on top if you can that mom i'm gonna get up top get up top oh there's another team another teammate team we're just hold up here we can i don't even know which place fancy so i just feel like they're useless that rampage that round oh my god i'm gonna try sniper 141 find that here i'm going to try and close this door oh no the door is gone for before it's not i guess yeah i have to drop my i could drop myself he's cracked he's really weak one of them died in the storm up there mate i have zero bats i'm just trying to look for a bat all right i found one there's one down from both teams remember to push these they had to revive someone i have to i have to pop a phoenix are you good mate i think we have to fight this team outside south right there bang on 50. just here all right i'm gonna push i'm gonna push is yeah there's like four teams holding that uh holding that hill let's get inside for a sec someone's in here yeah i think it's a path i can solve a path holding down he wants he's cracked again i'm down to run yeah we gotta we gotta go now we gotta go now we're gonna get we're gonna kind of zone okay i need to bat as well this is the last two teams they might be fighting i heard shots all right but like you wanted to go around with that we'll go around go around and win yeah we got time i got my birth years my damage 1763 now 1994. 1763 oh my god you're so much older than i actually imagine yeah what is that 200 58 or something i don't know i mean that's possible i'm going to bat i had one down from both teams but we just like pushing is so difficult we couldn't push the first team because the team of three yeah what i'm doing in the zone one of those guys that pushed from the right that we just steamrolled there died in the zone because i shot him when he was on the ground and he had armed oh we could come over oh this is a big crazy win just can't take too much damage from this team because oh i got scanned i got scams they know they're trading they're gonna kill that team 14 14. and one yeah yeah it's on my fences mate i mean what could they do if they got a beer look at this look at this they were terrified that's why we why there's all these yeah yeah yeah yeah they died in the storm because they'd rather die to the storm damage than be electrified you know come on rich speed it up get it together we're moving hey i hate mine wait i'm let you know i need you guys oh why are you throwing what do you mean i'll go this way first why that doesn't make it any better so you guys decided not to go this way well we're still looting rich oh i thought well you guys tweeted tweeted you guys ping those i saw a tweet on my timeline saying there was someone close to that's a very inefficient way of letting me know but thank you where is your head right now get it together richard ah i don't respond to shouting talking about tween no i'm not tweeting at you well someone tweeted at me uh i bought you a gift i'm really hoping you don't have one already because i brought it all this way it's possible [Laughter] okay hopefully you don't have these probably do you have any of these um i do but i'll take them okay thank you are germany bats have zero bats ain't dropping one extended heavy mag here i don't want that stop trying to give it to me oh big fights big fights no rich can't pad on to it we push it assess the situation and then make what are you doing okay well this is why we are gaining zero rp why do i have to go back when i'm doing this oh oh if i would have hit that i was trying to hype up the first one to maybe hit another one oh run it's what happens this is what i'm telling you run go back over here i hit two of them i think i collided him getting shot by i'm getting on the bridge what the heck they didn't go to the fight they just run across the hill there's no way you're actually fighting me reloading that carry on running this way uh careful they might be over there over here over there i can't zoom this in i can't shoot from here i can't speed press b they're literally all hole enhancers no i think they're actually one player controlling all three they're moving like a well-oiled machine generally like they're just they position him for like two meters away and then one guys is controlling him like a mirage decoy yeah and then we have you just jump batting into every single fight i've done 41 damage mate i know what i'm doing i just hit the uh the shot of the century look when they don't run off now the gunfight's over they're just like out of there everything's all quiet now so it's just so bad there's still a lot of teams over here i hate him mate i'll just hate him oh we got this we got this rich come on i'm taking i'm taking over igl i don't know people ask i'm just checking my twit.com feed all right apparently we're good get off twitter why are you packing again i want you to get on this roof part you can respect that actually this like this this gun doesn't work this week oh does that see ya oh no up here oh okay this guy's weak by himself i gotta pop a phoenix don't let that guy rest please to the top of the stairs i'll go look on me this guy's just gonna be annoying so going i'm pushing the other guy okay and he's running he's running into another team wait this isn't this is the same team hello oh my god i hate this game do anything i'm doing a thing you ready go crazy mate come on come on open the door slightly firing [Music] deleting this game after today i don't know what i'm doing i'm bouncing again you know what you're doing because i don't know what i'm doing he's all my creeper shots on one team you landed some bankers though i heard yeah yeah i was yelling one more shot where we came from point five blue oh how was that matter here point five blue nice is this stuck on the roof two down two down yeah one on the roof who's this lady all right well you turned it on there yeah we're kind of a mess some kind of a mess this is just the ring experience i think this is just how i was just talking but when we needed to turn on we turned it on uh yes you kind of pat it into like every single fight there but yes yeah oh wait i'm obtained what you want me to do recharging shields yeah i guess you stopped them from hearing you know i've been headed over they've got blue shields i do not know my friend him on me i swear i heard something that was weird what was that can you help me oh it's not you yeah yeah there's someone level 45 back here under the patch i loved it i'd just be a solo i think it is because they weren't aggressive at all i hear them oh yeah they're up top this way nice thank you hit me a little bit so she upgraded her armor to purple so now you have a better arm switch okay okay small all the way back there but that's mine smart just run back if you need to yeah i mean you could pop it or you could just run there i don't mind me that might be faster nice all right we're moving we're gonna mess today what's going on absolute mess this is just kind of the sum of howard and my adult has been on some random skin all day okay it's one guy yeah oh they did he really just turned around and shoot me oh he's going stupid man wait did that does see her actually turn around and shoot me and i think so trying this again does it work probably not cracked wherever hp whoa get
