hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more warzone of course so we are getting closer and closer to more reveals for the new call of duty which is coming in 2020 which i am really looking forward to we've also just received a road map for season five reloaded including a new warzone mode which is called kingslayer we've got a new gun in there we've got new trails a new operator and a new ground war mode which we will be covering here in the introduction and i got the following information from charlie intel a link to the page that i used will be in the description of course now let's start with new warzone game mode it is called a king slayer this is a large-scale tdm on a battle royale where the team's fights have to earn points by defeating car star players the circle doesn't actually collapse like usual instead it rotates and moves around the map for a battle on the go the top five team's top scoring player will be marked as a king on your map and you can eliminate those kings to get additional points to be awarded a free kill streak it sounds like a fun game mode i love that warzone brings in these new modes which allow you to have these these massive uh large-scale battles i'm a big fan of ground war in the regular multiplayer so these types of modes are always really fun to play the next big news here is that the new weapon is being added to multiplayer and war zone as well it is going to be called the thin lmg now what's interesting about the description of this light machine gun is that apparently it blurs the lines between assault rifle and lmg it is described as having exceptional full auto accuracy whilst also being lightweight allowing for a unique play style so it's a lmg assault rifle hybrid does that sound familiar to you the 60 round brewing a1 despite the nerf the bruin is still incredibly good because it has the lmg classes low recoil but the dexterity and reload time of an assault rifle i wonder if the thin lmg will be released and it will mix up the meta a little bit more alongside these updates we also get a new operator called mort or morte i believe it's mort who looks sort of like a cowboy we get a new multiplayer mode called ground war reinforced which has a picture which reminds me so much of war from world of war if you guys remember that game mode it's incredibly fun and i'm hoping it's the same sort of vibe we also get ourselves some trials some new gun cameras a new gunfight map for all you gun fighters out there which is based inside the verdance stadium and this is all coming tomorrow so you can expect some more warzone gameplay coming soon with the new weapon so if you're new around here be sure to subscribe for that new content and i'll see you all with a full game play here in five and a half seconds my friends quite like this area of the map as well it suits your uh shoot your camera a little bit better oh no you changed don't mind oh wait oh yeah that's a good point did i change my skin i think you changed your skin away i can hear people right next to me but i know [Music] i'm dead killed two people nice i've got two as well you're one so that's a complete line oh mike are you good i'm coming i'm coming come on oh my god these teammates shoot me from across the way oh i got two down these guys sat in a window you're so boring get involved here i got killed by a sniper oh i thought he was a shotgun i thought it was a shotgun gosh damn it ma'am i was that star was crazy yeah i shouldn't have landed there when i heard all the things but you can always have it yes we've had where we don't even get one i feel like when we don't have a gulag you often like win because you're just playing really well yeah good yeah exactly if you don't have a goo lag you have to have one because you always get a coolex that time to earn your is soldier still 130 targets for us to eliminate so it's all good oh you just started let's go rich nice little flick there we go we've got the contract nice even with your teammate lobbing i know that same thing here i'm gonna land here and get some guns and return to the contract okay mate yeah that makes a lot more sense may just go over here this has been losing much loot really uh yeah i can hear a chest in here we like to bolster up our stats with an early game easier to do they're coming over to you i'd hide like let them get close you can get like a free kill you've got a p90 they're aiming at me so i'm gonna try and back up and just let them yeah they're on me i'm gonna let me come in i'll leave ollie move on down one down he's his teammates really far right you're fine sounds like here i see movement contact come down a little bit [Applause] oh can you see him no shields damn dead hey we played that well i knew they were gonna go to those buildings i'd stay back so they thought maybe we can just sit in a window or something someone's just respawned there mate okay that's the lighting on him i'm just talking about my life story here no i just just thought i'd call it out whilst i can see it my plan oh we could go back and complete the contract if you wanted to yeah yeah let's leave them alone it's all good shield you've got shield yes nice good spot on them coming over because they uh crouch walk through my entire building yeah we every time we get a little bit excited we find one someone's further back too look there yeah yeah did he go behind the tree where did he come from no he's behind the building mate yeah okay probably in the building now more than likely contract updated new objective identified yes on the roof mate on the right side of the roof keep your eyes open and go hold on he's got a disgusting little uh knee i this knife sold i'll give it a go from back here don't seem up there anymore no the thing is you could go back in that building on window peak no that's a problem you could run like we need one more for a search contract we get a loadout as well it's not worth running without a goo leg broken a window top left i think it's in there isn't he yeah he broke that window i'm off this way hold cancel there another window out the back this time i could try and do a really wide week if you can rush him yeah where is it yeah it was in the top window nice job great cool let's go there's a nice little jump spot back here as well so ah nice do you pull that off to get the get up to him no no he he was peeking the window but i did a lot of flank let's go there's a bite here as well get that load out yes yes let's go all right what are we saying richard we could make our way down to tv potentially oh yeah there's a guy a little look down there oh he's not wait what oh no yeah forget that oh he was down that's like this is big span well absolutely nothing on my screen done about you there's a bounty here does anyone need this yeah let's let's go for that mate you might put it on no one in the ring oh wait yeah i'll just parachute i'll come back he's still rough to push i don't see him but yeah i don't i don't want to push me it's fine he's doing it's fine let's leave it see ya please there's a team rgb moving here apart from that i don't know okay yeah yeah we're playing well oh my gosh why don't there's someone closer that's it [Music] kind of wait probably gliding right i just got he just got a king he might just hop in his car though oh yeah yeah from left to seat yeah he probably is isn't he yeah he may come down this road should i try and cut him off oh nice so at least we've got one kill from it yeah yeah worth worth worth now where do you go back to the buy yeah i mean you can't chase a car no i think i'm gonna rather going on oh see that on the buy oh we're right red dot just appeared i think it's glitched there yeah they're in a gunfight i think some sort of fight see cluster street going down yeah i got my you have to get closer we could push right because the plus is on this hill yes yes yes yes i'm gonna mark that oh is it oh yeah you mean so maybe you're teaming those buildings in the team on the hill yeah potentially yeah enemy uav overhead have you got a uav i do should i call him ghost on so you just got a free loadout oh yeah i do i'm traveling i'm literally chatting the team on the buy in the window but yeah on this hill there ish just further up behind these trees let's we can flame the line yeah he was looking more to the left other two are over there by the way they're like literally standing in the open but there's someone closer yeah nice now let's down hill yeah yeah down here we'll run rummaging around doing something remember they didn't have i'll get this knife and they're sniping us yeah i don't even know what i'm looking at there that's a bit of a rough one we try and go i have a cluster strike which might disrupt them and then when we're closed we can pretty hardly grid i'm down to give it a go i'll just close the structure you can push up that if you want i'll go around a little bit nice nice that heartbeat will work if you have one yeah i should have picked up a heartbeat they're probably gonna be saying inside without smg so i think if we can get close yeah i'm gonna get into this closer building and i have a hard base let me let me try eight i think someone's in here maybe rich maybe just sound like it and that's not my heartbeat yeah yeah upstairs says he's safe i've got a frag here i could just try and yield it into that window these guys must have backed up real far do you think they jumped off the back i could have made you can quickly get a uf yeah but they did get these loadouts they may have used it to get ghosts oh they may have just just giving all scenarios here me i'm going to go for you up though definitely i could view a little bit friendly [Music] where where are we even looking here which people are closer yeah this guy's up top he's flying to the right maybe like oh yeah there he is i'm not gonna fight with that we've got a team up here wild yeah i don't know i do not know am i getting another uav uh yeah can do mate i've got a precision yeah which way do you want to go sorry up this hill yeah they were let's uh get up this ridge to this building and i'll cool it in just as we get close to it okay no no screw it screw it just in case they're in yeah oh he's flying what he's probably trying to get to his old loot maybe we're inside scan for movement oh my god it's got sight from somewhere did you yeah 100 percent bit of uh brick just blew up next to me these guys do not know where yeah that's annoying isn't it before i'm getting shot from there i'm not even kidding i'm getting shot from the top of fire station hold on there's a guy up here acting i might try and fly off [Applause] okay flying hit one say that i think i'll do haha see ya i'm gonna go this guy's armor i mean ammo even that's all right i have a munitions box too so if you need it at any point i'll come with fair play to me did hit me where was his loot did he like land on the like jump a little bit further than that i'd say oh here we go yeah yeah nice it's nice got everything you need i'm gonna get ammo as well yeah i know what you mean even in fire station if i knock one he gets the res yeah it's it's basically pointless isn't it do you right up top across the damned i wanna many we've got to go back no i don't have a heartbeat i'm afraid oh oh where's that that's there in that building probably things we really don't want to go down there rotation's horrendous what about these guys in fire aren't they gonna have to come past us at some point do you think so that's my fault nice mate good shooting a bit bad for him there's definitely another team there yeah the five people unless they rotated down because it looked like they were getting shot up by someone at one point and they haven't peeked from that tower every time i've looked so i don't think they're there still oh no they're over here still oh my god he's right here nice and one nice make nice it's nice watch out watch out for jeff yeah safe he's one really weak really weak it's setting charge yeah play it carefully mate [Applause] then one nice that's like oh we gotta go we gotta go we gotta go are you gonna eat are you good no no no we'll find someone always panic eat it like on the 26th of august 1984. oh that's a classic panic yeah you're going to be doing that i hit wait i just hit someone with something where did i i literally threw proximity mine about 35 minutes ago in the last game i swear it's got a heat mark with it in the last game it's how long ago it was who were they firing at shall i get this mate quickly before it goes in the storm to see where it takes yeah may as but you never know yeah i don't know if you need plates i've got seven thank you though there's anyone down there they're so screwed i think we may have saved them they were getting sniped and we just came in with the with these oh okay you are a lunatic mate did he what what i'm so confused is he trying to assassinate us wait i don't know it got quite low before it warned us too fair yeah you're right so every time it says that and i'm looking vertically upwards i'm looking at the wrong angle yeah you're looking up whilst he's coming in to assassinate you with his bird he's russell crowe just checking these uh these hills they're gonna be ratting around here somewhere aren't they oh no i've had an ending that like that was the power of spot so what okay um just i don't know if it always has like these preset ones but yeah it seems like you do get very similar endings you know what i mean yeah grab this spare loop after these buildings they could have been running around there still as well shots we've got oh you hit that snipe to our left dude it could be pretty far but it could be these buildings mate i'm hearing more shots yeah close maybe yeah yeah there broke your shield nice job i'm flanking left two two two two two i'm behind him down down both down got self-resistant finishes on this one nice job mate great one oh jumped around the corner and they were both looking at me i'm like i'm out of here who are they who's they [Applause] nice mate good job he had no shields i don't know what he was doing he's still he's still final shield jack we've got this point we can get a uav yeah yeah last time to buy yeah that's probably a good idea right i have eight players as well so i've just mate you can buy it okay oh sorry you've left yeah yeah you go for it you've got it cheese my wesley's rest of my money oh there it is wait sorry is it left somewhere the money i dropped was like hiding so should we call in early or there's only eight people left if we know about it okay this guy dropped a spare plate wait close close close i'm tempted to uav mate okay one guy he has the right he's like by that tree if that helps at all get rid of it it's kind of in the way sorry yeah i was close close sniping by that tree still still by that tree therefore the storm your gas mask there's gonna be another team i think one of them's got ghosts one of them doesn't relocate is there enough a little bit so one of those nights teammates run off i think yeah another one close another one close rich i think i killed one close but there's people at the statue yeah i don't have eyes uh they're laying down prone and they're right they just went back if they're getting pushed in the back as well mate [Applause] pushing at the back there bet yeah close close close down the hill downhill coming coming coming for the challenge i thought i had staff right here no [Applause] orange marker come on oh my god he's weak he's screwed surely you know he has no place right you know he has no our plate you're fine you're in a good spot louie if i get his search contract if i get that it'll have to go on him yeah just trying to just try and focus because if he snipes probably writing for armor plates and stuff there is on the left on the left on the near that rock near that okay little bit right a little bit right you're fine you're fine where was he like this way near the edge of the wall he just ran more to the left i think yeah just play it smart up here yeah yeah just rotate to the safe zone yeah yeah he was behind that there that wasn't your fault i was unreasonable so i just tried to get lightning on him oh let's go you get i think 13 i think you got 11 24 yeah especially for where we were too but you are back in action baby call it juicy where we came from [Applause] oh yeah i like this bike incredible yeah so sick oh my gosh if that rpg had come and pummeled me out of me let's go i think i kept spotting him because the spectators there's a slight delay so as you turn i could still see i was panicking oh my gosh let's go thank you
