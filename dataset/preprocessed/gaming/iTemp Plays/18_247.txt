hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we just got the gameplay trailer for season 11. the new map the new legends the new weapon we see them all in this trailer to start off the wait screen was actually two minutes of a showcase of the new map storm point which you can see some of in the background now the map has more man-made areas than i was expecting which is a good thing i thought it was going to be largely jungle and foliage or something we see the prowlers we see the swarm of spiders chasing lifeline this map has so much wildlife on it and they are dangerous you've got to be careful otherwise you're done for storm point also features gravity lifts in place of the balloon towers which i couldn't spot at all in this trailer the trajectory of the gravity lifts looks very telegraphed so you can ambush people to the side but the person flying through the gravity lift was able to use their weapon so at least you can land ready to scrap next up we saw ash tethering someone with her ability slowing them stunning them and then taking them out poor watson and then what i assume is her ultimate is indeed the portal it looks like a wraith portal that you aim and it's instant it's more of a teleport ability than anything else she actually looks insane to play we also have the car smg showcase our first one which has the unique ability to switch between light and heavy ammunition i assume that ammo types change the weapons values you'd expect the light ammo variant to have less damage but also slightly less recoil compared to the heavy variants which you'd maybe want to use at closer range i'm not too sure i did pick up a few more things from the trailer as well we did get the tridents back in this trailer which is great because the map does look huge i assume that these are going to be our main rotational tool which is kind of scary because jumping on a trident sometimes especially if i'm driving ends up with me driving off the map but i'm not actually sure you can drive off the map on this one which is good for me the reactive battle pass skin also looks like it's going to be for the prouder this time which is interesting the prowler of course being a fan favorite weapon and definitely worth completing this time overall i think the new mac looks amazing it looks completely different to the three maps that we have already it's got so much life on it and i'm sure this would be a different experience playing this map compared to the ones i'm glad the new gun has a unique ability it's nice that it's not just another smg though to be honest i'd still have enjoyed having a new weapon to try it even if it was just standard ash looks amazing the true assassin style of play she's going to be a fan favorite she's going to be so difficult to play on day one you won't be able to play it unless your first peak so what do you guys think about the tread i thought it was incredible let me know what your thoughts are down below thank you for watching i'll see you all with some gameplay in five and a half seconds my why do you have friends teammate did he leave us he left his mate he's like i'm not playing with the fuse we've been having a good time today having good games yeah there's no way this dude gets up they're not getting back up from that easy win good luck so far behind the wall it's kind of crazy there's no way that bounces over that all right now that's pretty close you stop watching that play so much worse just stop stop for a second you're right you do play worse when i'm watching you suck suck that was awful i would have killed him way faster yes i'm probably taking no damage as well okay only respawning [Music] now you're going to go

player in that but you your looting skills your ability to loot is just not as good as mine there's no way i would love to have a poll on your on your youtube on how good your looting is from a scale of one to ten yeah you can't trust people i get berated for not taking a boosted loader oh something reasonable here for not taking a boosted loader when i when i got no shield and i've been shot by three people i just went to get some shield cells so mate knows i'm still angry should have taken the boosted loader you've got no ammo you've got no ammo you got no ground and it's popping off over

gold plot line and a turbocharged havoc going crazy uh yeah i have 12 spare heavy and a triple tape that i'm not landing any shots with those are the vibes and those the vibes are sticking with it
