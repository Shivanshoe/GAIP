hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we got another sneak peek into some content coming in season eight now if you aren't aware we are getting a gameplay trailer tomorrow for season eight so if you're not subscribed to this channel and you want to see my breakdown be sure to fix that as a big red button beneath the video but in the description of the premiere that is scheduled on youtube apex wrote this fuse arrives in season 8 and is packing plenty of attitude we know that and things go boom pick apart the opposition with salvo's most popular weapon the lever action 3030 repeater we knew that as well explore an obliterated king's canyon reshaped by fuses of rival look out for gold magazines capable of automatically reloading holstered weapons now anything that automatically reloads guns such as kryptos passive on his drone cases itself to weapons that have a long reload time because you get more bang for your buck think lmgs with a load of firepower and now think of rampat with lmgs with gold magazines in there now i think this is great too because it opens the door for more gold attachments which have unique abilities because the barrel stabilizer or the gold barrel stabilizer reduces the recoil the same amount as the purple one but it reduces the muzzle flash as well this was like a unique passive that it had but it hasn't been useful at all since the muzzle flash free work which happened quite a while ago now but what if it also made your guns quieter well if it was a suppressor there are so many things that they could do with gold attachments in each slot and i'm glad that they are starting to explore this as well let me know if you guys have any ideas for gold attachments and what they can do in the comment section and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds with some gameplay my friends voyage or something oh voyage oh maybe i don't know tomato tomato data data i don't know what it is just their words words are dumb yeah i agree words aren't done words suck i mean it's definitely data but there aren't any guns oh god oh i i didn't go with you i'm sorry okay i thought we were going to broken i don't mind don't worry about it oh i thought you were committing to your favorite oh i missed the flash play hold on come on i'm scared i'm gonna mature beans don't worry about me i think i've ever seen a game where you didn't i know i'm always broken oh these i'm getting the worst look ever there wasn't one single gun in the triple bins and the one down low that's four beans if you're counting heatbox i'm very uh so fat dude i have one bullet length with a vault so if there's any guns there please helpful please let me know taking absolutely everything picking everything someone did land at full story boy okay perfect i'm good loads of energy here on the way classic guitar floor i'm on the way i'm gonna bro i'm gonna grab a look oh he has canisters a little bit earlier everywhere i don't see him up top he's just chasing me are you he's down all the way down all the way down i think we killed the last member hello thank you another team back at uh broken okay i am inbound i'm inbound on the way too hold on can you kill them right there's another team training are you is there more people there or are there more i full faith but now the benefit is you got to roll back because there's people are trained let me know if there's an extended energy um someone said you cannot see one i'll get it for you if i see it let's try to rise on me so i'm actually kind of mad at them i gotta loot for one second you're good you're good i'm okay no i'm not chilling no i'm not there's a big okay i'm taking every single kill and i'm very sorry there

see you guys nice dude let's go they had a chance to but yes yeah they had they had multiple challenges and every chance in the world we just finessed them finessed everyone absolutely demolished everybody uh energy here a few shield cells i don't know what i need that's huge ah thank you very much sir you're good 10 people left goodness knows where they're going to be um i only have about 45 pounds here and then all the roads all my ropes i know i feel like roping from here to somewhere else just because why not this they're all connected right on the beam had your chance no clue i think you did i mean like we just sent that part right so hard what can you you can't react to that they had their trends we're just the mo we're just two mom ball for him we're just two queen i know every single fight is just like scam grapple stimple this is fun it is i think this is the most i've ever seen in my life oh look at this i feel like tarzan oh i just can't believe that on the way wait he's got no shields i took them all beforehand that wasn't the team out of here no that was another random wraith i don't know what she was doing that might have been the teammate to the pathfinder or no no no i got killed by caustic oh okay nevermind that's part of him he's got a brawler where would they have gone there's a respawn here i feel like the classic might have died who killed him oh maybe they did i don't know i mean there was multiple solar wraiths sir yeah but it is possible entirely possible it's been a really weird game where people actually survived for quite a while yeah and if i'm actually getting consistent fights it's crazy okay i chose the wrong one the the idea was right but the location was not right well let's let's give it a little look let's see if it's uh dude you killed the pathfinder yeah yeah yeah i'm gone i'm stimming as much as i can i'm gonna get there with no health i appreciate it where's this pathfinder they went the other way they can't go either way oh just one time massive to me she's waiting to cracks the crackers that's such a joke that gun is a joke where is he that would download she's at my door massive dude right nasty huge that's the culture i was doing right now come on i don't think this works i have a gold bag i'm sticking it i'm thinking thank you i put that pad right here i'm at my mat no i'm not i cracked him not this again not this again no i see you good job mates oh my god i had a flashback of that pathfinder standing above my purple knockdown shield i should have just grappled i didn't think they were in there already no i mean that situation was just so rough that's difficult nice job that was kind of crazy the one time we get a game that doesn't just die instead we have this farm i can't believe i cannot believe he's killed me again
