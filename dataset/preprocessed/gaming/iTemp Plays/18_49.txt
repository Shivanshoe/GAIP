hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back it's another video today we are playing some more ranked here on apex legends of course this is the final episode of the solo to masters challenge we do in fact make masters this game which is great i'm happy i finally did this because i have said that i was going to do it so many seasons in a row and i sort of lost interest so at this time i've proven to myself and i've proven to everyone that i can do it it just it's a little bit of a time commitment that's all i hope you guys have enjoyed the ranked game play on the channel it's mixing it up a little bit i'm definitely gonna be playing some more ranked next split as well so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends champion out are we 13 or are we just like straight up fighting them because if we're trying to find them we're going to lose because the loot up there is so much better than where we landed they're going to have at least three blues i think they're fighting yeah i'm down for this using raffle okay i've got a few arcs i can throw a pattern of time there you go he wants to find him again enemy over there mark star out first they spotted me oh no there's another squad attacking i'm giving my shields a recharge yeah uh three teams here be careful though watch out another one nice on those ones come on come on game someone huge okay back up back it up i need ammo and stuff i'm not gonna i don't want to fight too much here that's not too bad i guess recharging shield was he facing i was pausing this time i'm down we go into this team like this i don't understand the point of that it's on minus 17rp i really can't fight hey unfortunately the thing he went the portal jesus jumps that's fine i'm not going to respawn him here desperate need i am repairing myself i don't reported on those guys maybe i should have ported with them i think then they got distracted by the other team who start charge rifling in the back oh it's a struggle all right well minus 9. this way don't get caught in the field they just they just um balcony because that that team behind them respawn someone i think these teams are distracted i think we're okay they valcultied on another team that respawned so we should be okay he wants to start i guess he wants stuff he said go go go he's been back for eight seconds i've got an evo shield here it's cool level two okay do we have the resources making contact with them why this imagine if i had any cervix any mag nice teammate nice he redone him but i'm not going to get an assist for that okay okay this is ridiculous man are you feeling okay we should go this way a broken enemy shield reloading cracked an enemy shield i got you friend spotted double timing it reloading making contact right obviously the one you don't apparently not i'm not trying to go in on the break here because i have thrown many ranked games in diamond but if i just played with the bangle here we would have been far better off the wraith was playing way too aggressive and the only reason i took the res is i thought the guy the bangalore downed was the valkyrie that i was fighting and i didn't hear her come back in inside the building and then she beamed me but it's okay because bangor is one of the greatest players i've ever seen they clutched up they revived us both and we were back at it over there let me guess you want to get involved any spare bats enemy spotted target over there i don't have any bats let's go this way you guys maybe fighting i can't really get shot too much because i have no bats recharging there friends last two teams are firing i'm pretty sad because i think if i get max kp this game i i make masters but it hasn't been a great game for me at all if we win if we're going to win i think we will because this bangalore probably has like 3 500 damage right now okay so this is this is the set for the two teams this is the setup of the two teams we're working with nice i'm telling you this bangalore is an absolute demon on the sticks oh my god i'm a genius did you see what just happened i shot the door open with the wingman because you can do that and because it went into their watson fences it destroyed the door enemy over there give me a second heavy one minute ring's pretty close i think they're doing that for cover i don't know if they're actually going to use those i mean i can't see are we pushing that gonna use this i've got a decent bit of cover here but if i got more nades i'm kind of screwed how much we got over this way this bank must have a gold helmet because i am seeing so many smokes nice i need to recharge my shields okay i'm pretty sure i'm getting masters this game and i've got one kill and i'm getting straight carried by a guy that's gonna get a 4k game pretty sure that's what's happening right here which is a bit sad i'm getting involved huh get involved nice oh my god i'm sad i'm so sad bangor is top 10 best teammates i've ever had honestly this bank must have done about you are the apex i reckon she got a 4k i reckon she or at least she was close i mean she's even got the cheese what is that it's not a trumpet i can't remember the name of it it's a b-tech trumpy i mean she did shitty 3600 i did 2100 not too bad i got 7k p which i think is enough i wanted all the glory to get to masters i really did and now looks like i've got straight carried it looks like i got straight character masters i mean i did in that particular game but i held my own in the other ones does pathfinder not have a voice line for these for when you get masters no is that just you just you don't get a you don't get a voice line for that that's sad oh ggs man that was great ah that was a really a really fun challenge to go for i'm happy i did it thanks for watching guys i'll see you in another one bye
