hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and earlier on today apex released a trailer for their new monsters within event which is starting on the 12th of october so next tuesday you can see the trailer in the background here we get a bunch of new skins the return of shadow void out which is a game mode that we had last year where you turn into a shadow after dying and in that mode you have amazing movements including wolverine it's a pretty fun mode the main part of the event for me though is the new arenas map which you can see on the screen at the moment it's called encore and according to ea's website it's located on sears home planet called boreas b-o-r-e-a-s i'm not the best with the law on apex legends but as far as i'm aware that is away from king's canyon world's edge and olympus it looks very different we have somewhat of a tropical theme with palm trees and sand but the weather is quite moody so it's not all suntans and volleyball it's actually kind of sinister looking really but i love the feel of it and i do hope that our next battle royale map is in this theme because if you look at the past releases of the maps we'll do a new battle royale map actually kind of soon so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that's in your mirage and ages you can be like my old mane all that those don't work for me those titles you can all right i don't know i need a clickbait i need a clickbait it's the only way it works oh nothing i'm afraid i'm not quickly so nothing springs to mind i am i'm gonna i'm gonna be a top tier clickbaiter give it like a year oh you've gotta i'll accuse the clipboard the other day because i did a video and the thumbnail was me saying like unnecessary nerf but film now also had a vault on it and i didn't really think that people would think the vault was nerfed but they did i mean it does make sense there's nowhere now i'm gonna have to leave i'm gonna have to leave goodbye oh please give me a god oh why did you bring him here i'll i'll double kick for ya i'll kick it okay weaponry why is this eve right not reloaded i'm in a corner here to save the day i'm gonna try to rose i am so bad at this video games i thought i got thirsty for some reason mate i'm so bad i don't have a bomb i'm bad at the israeli overall but without a bolt oh my word it's a tragedy i'm going to answer you that's cause you don't hit fire obviously firing well you don't you only do it when you use the ebay like that's going to and then you do it like once a week that's the optimal practice fruity i'm charging my rampage jackson taking them out with a uh yes or no oh i don't know how i'm getting kills here i'm going to be honest with you yeah we're playing different games but that's fine good luck recharging cut these teams dead well dude are your what are your stats looking like eight kills 900 damage let's go okay let's go i mean i told you i don't need to bring up the story again you could just you could just like replay i'll just help you guys you know don't worry about put the clip in the people know what it is anyway i know the vibes i fight back too if you need any bats let me know if you need that recharge i have one but i am already here are they instrumental oh there's one person here any cracks up there okay recharging one of my 18 bags oh it's all kicking up over here mate i'm nearly stick um multiple squadrons quite a few squadrons somewhere yes got all the time in the world right here oh god i'm playing i'm gonna pop it all right thank you by the way he's uh like 58 but he's popping a battery it's just behind him chris what's on blue sorry did you want any of these kills give me a breakdown give me the breakdown what are we looking like right now from top to bottom um i'm on 13 kills not respectable and i want 700 damage well you're not i have damage how much damage are you on i want 700 712 no i'll send you the guy also right now are you on set right now all right 1600 i know you're lying that's just like two that's too much you went too far with it i just want to know if i could convince you you know i'm not even close why do you not do this in the kill race mates because i thought i tell you this you tried so hard to like change your play style in that in that kill race when you should have just played the exact same as you do all the time because you always steal my kills as if a factual statement without lots of tangible evidence to be backed up by i'm gonna have to do something about this damage i'm gonna have to put like a little you know what i'm on sponsor i you're on six kills 2500 damage no it's not it's not it's not as bad as the last game okay my last game is worse what you want i have nine kills uh six assists and two thousand damage wait you have nine kills as well yeah we've got 20 kills between us um yeah wait i'm on wait i'm on 13 not not 11. we've got 22. um yeah we're kind of cracked i'm not doing the math for that so i trust you i thought for some reason i thought i was just on 11. uh guys are there if you want to rotate friends anyway it's a big rotation probably take you back to capital something i don't know i'm going back there we're in the zone i think people are firing this way on my way for teammate dude i was not about virgin mates i don't think they are what do you mean i heard a g7 no i meant with my no i thought i threw him too no you said you know i stole her live on air so i stole all these kills no i feel like i mean he's been there but i don't think you're really taking his kills i think you're just taking mine just fine you took my gun to the start of the game so i made the decision to just not give you anything this game oh that's the smarter decision let's be honest i'm farming neither of us have a gun world war z yeah but you took it you took both good you took both guns me and you we are getting pushed by zombies yes uh who are you giving the gun i'll give it i'll give it to you because i don't need what i don't need i've got a melee weapon i've got a chainsaw are you gonna do your little tiny hands got a chainsaw mate you're just gonna pummel them with men farming damage so it looks better 1 1700 now yeah but we all know the truth so it doesn't matter what the end result is like because we know what we know what it comes out to why is the team on me hello it's two teams [Music] now the horizon left and i don't know if she was part of a separate team to these boys yeah she had a knock down oh sorry that was the the ring's moving on see ya uh i just got a lifeline yeah i think i think it was saints oh she had a care package going i think oh spitfire oh hold on all right i have nine bats 16 cells and two phoenix's i'm ready man i'm bunkered in i am bunkered what are you laughing at what are you guys up to we're just having fun while you're over here sweating your life away trying to out damage me i am having fun that's what this relationship is never mind there's a dude on him already [Music] so nice gg all around from the squadron a really even damage to kill ratio from the boys and we don't need to see the end screen oh teammate left yeah let's be honest okay you might have ruined his entire week and you are just the absolute worst person nice damage noob wow dude oh wow and and you're roasting him oh my god you are the worst type of person i'm roasting you me no you're roasting him that's we've all seen it here live on yeah i need you i need to drop the 20 on your head that would be embarrassing that would have no that 20 would have been embarrassing that's the that's the issue
