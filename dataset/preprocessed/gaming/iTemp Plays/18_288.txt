all right i am hopping in the trident i want to prove that i'm a better driver than you twin while it lasted okay hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing sia and my question to you is whether or not you guys think they over nerfed this legend now see it came as in season 10 as one of the most obnoxious legend releases ever his kit was completely stacked and he definitely needed nerfing and respawn did indeed nerf him a few weeks after release in many different ways mainly affecting his ability and his passive i still think sia is incredibly useful he still has an interrupt mechanic on his q his ultimate is untouched which i think is an amazing ultimate for you and your team in a building fight especially and his scans still last for eight seconds which is so incredibly long i think people were too quick to jump ship because his kit is still amazing and so useful but bloodhound's kit is easier to make use out of and maybe that's where people see a bigger payoff between the two so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm going over here everyone's going over there all the teams are going over there just actually took him over there and then just left him no i followed your pink if he shouldn't have split from the leg over there no no no i didn't actually just took him over there he's gone he's gone oh you are the worst what do you mean you made a call to like not land there so i didn't exactly you pull him over with you you you spam pain you say run you say get out of there and you just let just let him go die watch out oh my controller is really bad right now no we're good mate get back on steady go go to steady uh i'm good another squad are you kidding me okay i'm here i'm just i'm just casually running i'm gonna get sniped in the side of the head all right hey rez i

she's puffing shield cells mate i've known you long enough mate okay i tried to head shot she ducked okay she dots do you see her idle animation she like ducks down to the ground like she's picking up a penny picking up something shiny off the floor yes yeah yeah she's like a she's like a magpie but she was trying to stealthily gail up she was trying to pretend to be afk right before we're about to end her life she's trying to just play off like yeah i might have gums but i've got automatic shield cells on me this is automatic heel i hate twitter hi i'm like debating not the way in it i yeah it was a good while i didn't log into twit.com at all i don't often go on there it's it's horrendous mate can i just pay somebody to tweet from me and stuff oh my god just saying just unfollow everyone apart from me wait that's weak they're all holding hands like hardcore yeah i'm just healing [Music] yeah they're behind rampart shields i'm uh this team is ridiculous the rest pushing the slide right

tanks everything over there no i was tracking perfectly someone's going to accuse me of hacking and then i fell off the top of the building man right when i was about to shoot what is happening i tracked someone through a wall i could predicted when they were going to come out either side the tunnel and just as i was getting ready to shoot i where are you where are you guys hello you just ran off instantly see ya okay that doesn't matter we're i was like chilling looting and talking because you have 400 and uh heavy and i have none so i needed to look for something yeah 200 you said you had 200. no and then i grabbed another weapon which requires more heavy so i need more regrets more more more so selfish mate yeah yeah no what he's up to can't see he's going to hop on me getting punched i was mid reload she's healing somewhere she got another one of those with the doors get back here i knew you're going to challenge that stop this waste of time never wasted so much time sprank is the quickest army switch i've ever seen spranky that was unreal me fair play so i thought i had more teammate support i knew climbing on them was a bad idea but you know when you just think oh i've got teammates though but i didn't have any teammates they weren't looking after me you know okay that's a hundred percent of your fault um i should have checked them out to see to see what what you were doing and i guess yes i don't know you were just having a campfire when i go 153 i don't ask for help i just do it yeah i just i pushed it was a bad push but it was because it was 1v3 you know spranky was trying to help but i don't know what you were doing was it me i took a bad angle knowing that we were rushing i knew that we were the three so i took a bad angle thinking we can just overpower them no no you're so far out here 1v3 and i don't need well well played mate i literally did that so i could go up this way and you know i've no i've been playing for eight hours or
