yeah i've got to change that we need some new tactics let's just wait for the boy that's all that's all we got to do we just gotta wait for that i'll tell you what that listen hey at least i'm not critiquing but the boy's been taking a little while today he's been he's been lagging behind me who i am hello in my plane no no no no i am crypto though like i'm embracing crypto i'm looting i'm not i'm not listening your comms i'm going afk to use my drone like you're not going to just get half crypto when i when i use a legend i go full blown to be fair you can't even hear my comments half oh this is why they call me the gram i see ya i don't even need that three times right there that's all mine doing it's doing better rampage is the best iron sight ever oh no not true it's pretty good though where are these guys they were up top they were up top like uh on this building or maybe all the way up top i think they i think they moved all the way up i'm gonna use my uh here we go crypto oh they're let's go did they have a bangalore did you show you is that ours no that was not me said that am i you actually oh rich that is not our bengal or i've realized as well the setup that we're running has zero spec respects for any doorways we can just shoot through those that is true anything about that i've already done it once to the octane earlier on i think i've only used this gun when it's been charged i don't think i've used it not being charged this game that's the way to do it oh let me use my beanie i need to put an emp down and use the charge tower going around here okay um right flaps i need to pop my uh thermites sending reboot he's not low up there nice job sorry i always forget that you have to come in with that it takes you like five seconds to shoot that gun i think yeah i'll try no they're up here yeah they're both on me there's a pat here they're you saw that thermite yep i have it yep it's on me octane's uh almost broken thank you i'm popping this real quick and i'm talking about this team's a good team yeah they're not bad the horizon and octane are together yeah yeah plays off top i just can't like with that mobility i'm gonna try and pick the other one giving my shields a recharge i don't know what's popping about though there's no way dude they're they're like on a thousand pain i didn't touch her at all did you turn the oxen i think he's self-raised that's unfortunate yeah he's suppressed dude they're like on a cozy bean i just died like five feet below below this ledge oh i'm one hp i'm on fire mate hold on i am charging juan giving my shields a recharge uh phoenix kit would be great i'll go i've got a you go thank you enemy uploads and in my freaking face what is wrong with my healing it's broken it's actually broken you're just watching it just doesn't work it doesn't want to uh choose the heels that i'm trying to use i hate medkits half the squads left mate say what you want about king's canyon it lasts so much longer than this um yeah i mean it's just my thing is when you like compare it like when you compare them to uh world's edge it's like it's like night and day different like both of the maps yeah like king's canyon and olympus are just night and day difference from world's edge i honestly don't find king's canyon that bad wolf's edge just laughs yeah better than yeah that's for sure that we've never ever on a map that we've never been on i'm here i'm gonna use my old do you have a dog ah no you are hearing things that was a weird sound oh there we go let me say fighting at least coming in she's cracked well 88 on her are you guys below me i can't get that oh see you really yep controller done nope you're the cue leader i'm watching you been there done that okay 12 people left oh that's a velcro behind this try and shoot see if they come trying to apply this i don't know it's not gonna work is it probably not probably knew we were over here and that's where they're running yeah intimidated by the rampart crypto duo something i just think we're playing it's not every day we do this no it's not often your game is blown up trying to hit me with this tactical while i'm on the road you're dead let me know i didn't see him drop sorry 143. nice careful this one's coming up this one first and then i can get big damage look at this how nice of a guy i am i appreciate that there is damage i wanted that one too you know oh no no that's been that's been too nice i was gonna farm loads of bats in here two times in here yeah i got my two times i'm chilling thank you oops sorry you said let me know if they drop and you're like they dropped i didn't even see him drop i just see him on my drone while i'm playing i'm like oh he's there i'm a good teammate gamers that's the fuse same thing same thing oh i guess wrong that was the last one in the squad inside his animation but my reactions have been like he's the pathfinder is weak i could have challenged him with a different gun i don't want to pull this bad boy out charge that again uh maybe that would be a different different thermometer it's gone mike come behind us uh now that he grappled back i'm gonna make him angry by lobbying a thermometer this guy now he's furious he's popping another thermite he popped another thermite just holding this glitch okay she means that gun fight i'm wacom have to pull back he's one hp the lovers one no they're running no guys uh the boys are running they need more thermites i played that was actually a good bait i honestly was i was about to slide down there yeah i didn't expect the logo to be at that close right needs to go back up just not been able to tap shave i got mouse and keyboard ready first time dude dude right here close what's that touch dude i was already i was i was looking over here i didn't want to watch the thought i don't think she had are you diving everyone's coming around that corner i don't know why i tried to finish it why can't you finish people that are popping this already i think you should be able to ah that's that'd be too too much pm i actually tapped straight i'm asking people okay did you really i missed it i was too focused on the actual uh fight at hand you need to see it it's kind of crazy oh man what a struggle it's been to get this game play i know after all that after all that
