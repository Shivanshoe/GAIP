hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some battlefield 2042 of course and i've played a good amount today and after some tips from my friends so far i have found such a fun way of playing the game firstly i use the grapple gun class as you would expect from a pathfinder main like myself and then i'll use this to get on top of buildings on both of the delta flex in the middle of the map to capture them to defend them there are a bunch of fights going on in the middle of the map all the time so it's such a good vantage point to have if i need to get across the other delta flag i'll spawn in an atv which has the greatest gun option in the second seat it's unbelievably good you can use it against tanks against infantry against choppers everything it's so good you're also seeing this gameplay that i'm actually using iron sights on my weapons so far told me that for him they felt better than the other options and at first i was skeptical but honestly i agree it's weird but it was working out so i didn't want to change it be sure to subscribe to so far in the description he gave me a lot of tips which helped out massively i'm sure he will upload some battlefield as well on his channel so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends what do you mean feels good what's your thing by the way i'm on a smooth 80 which isn't bad at all i'll take it you're on 80 i'm on 60 hours i wouldn't have 60 on east coast this is my home server well maybe one of our things is mine yeah i don't think the team is back here i just i just nearly died reviving a bot please do you switch off the grapple guy no i mean it also switches off me every lobby oh yeah they spawn oh they don't know around the map are you oh get out played there's a certain range on this game but i'm really bad at shooting same i got kind of like a little bit further than medium range right yeah just a tiny bit more for some reason i think it's because of the iron sights though it's more difficult to keep that clear vision on them but the eyes are too good not to use yeah you kind of have to the sights are so bad in this game there's one person on this flag with us somewhere i'm just kind of forcing it around uh movement's really starting to grow on me in this game i like a lot yes 100 especially on mountain keyboard it's just like it feels fast the game feels amazing on massive keyboard yeah i see that are you really going to play them now there's no way you're going to play on a ps5 controller you can't even use your paddles i know that'd be tragic you it will be the worst experience you're going to be playing on 1080p is it uh the next gen is it 120fps i don't know i assume they'll have that eventually eventually i mean no 1080p 60fps no no paddles ps5 controller there's no way no i'm staying on pc i'm staying on pc all right all right i just need you to wake up because i need to get it together don't i gotta wake up sometimes the boomers do suck but honestly just all the things that you have to do with those consoles ah now i'm popping off some of that i know you mean that oh you are popping off now come small on me are you dead there's redeployments on me it's like an ongoing battle over here they're trying to kill me so bad okay i'm going uh can you hide can you hide i'm hiding i haven't shown anyone in ages no one can see me i'm chilling i'm about to spawn five seconds though no i got a snipe i'm okay should we get soon wait no i landed in the helicopter next to it i'm gonna jump out okay i can't jump i had to change to the third ammo type wait let me jump out i was 14 on one oh my gosh no no getting that middle part like this left part there's no covers be careful but can you smile there's a few of them over there there's one right in front of you quite a few of them get this grappler going to go look at this look at the distance this is fun this is a good time oh we can't get back over maybe if we spawn in these chopper and instantly help out i think i did but i got stuck in there i'm gonna uh it's like bees popping too sometimes i don't know how to mate i thought i killed this guy in the there's no what's his health he's on 12 health i thought i killed him they're up here i'm there's more to the right there's a lot more here the activity still looking in the exact same place be careful he's he's re he's tank he's not that healthy i don't think i needed it twice i don't know okay i don't even know where that's at don't go don't go up top you can see right over the um the little helipad thing i'll kill a lot of them in here no i accidentally press b oh oh no reloading survive oh you did you die i'll stay alive no no no no i'm not i'm alive i'm like okay that's right next to me there's something might be if this atv's just taken out out that was an actual bricks in the whole time i thought that was a dead body oh he's still in there hold on hold on these guys are trying to piss on me because they're all sniping oh i finally died i'll stay live outside life i can't see with this thing my screen is shaking behind the leaf ah just do your thing i don't know ma'am i'm okay atv i think he's still up there once he's thrown outside it's actually all the way up oh yeah i already took this one you are throwing the game out that's unbelievable i know those are out there i don't know i can't know all the strats you know i'm giving you most of them i'll i don't like pushing this side i'll try and like come over to your side and see if anyone's camping your stairs i don't think so atv is gone okay i think it's all right we're fine we're playing our entire team is on this roof yeah i'm about to fly down to d let's go back to our spot yeah yeah they should stop yeah behind me the tunnel got one i don't see anyone else over there though not too many people here neutralize flag [Music] where's everybody i do not know we got a free flag cap so i wish i could check the map i know i don't know why it's disabled seems weird to me where do we go the other day i might spawn in atv to get across i'm gonna go through the tunnel i was born in a tank vehicle thanks doing good damage to it though i don't know what this one does why can't i shoot it i don't understand what's it do anti-aircraft missile oh nice please okay now it's all popping off we've got a tank behind us as well oh yeah it's popping off all right rocky's going off a rocket that is a very loud rocket what happens to the rocket i don't think i've ever seen we've gone off before i'm going to shoot it this is destroying that rocket that's a tank are you shooting me while the rocket's going off behind you look at it watch the event where is he coming where's he going i don't know i'm dead no not that guy i'm looking at the rocket oh he's zooming me he's zooming you can swallow me if you want uh i already spawned okay orange people down low i need to change my ammo oh my god what is happening okay where else i don't actually know what's happening you get a single thing lock on that guy oh he's passing on me oh no i was reloading that he's so sad he's on my roof just in these bushes wait guys a helicopter right here oh god oh god oh god you okay oh no does it sound like you are this is this is not good at all oh god i'm up where's my truck i i bought a charger this is somebody jacket yeah probably it's tough knowing what's going on the only flag we don't have his day if we get all these flags we can win i got serious on my way over there we have captured there was one above is that over there though i think oh yeah i died to him the sixth wave on this objective trying to destroy the tank the best by the way actually saved me so much kind of nice right we're all good health i can't slide for some reason i am getting focused so hard every single time this guy's trying the craziest move over the scene i'm actually getting trolled right now i'm not even playing where are you though i'm literally dying every single time i get spawned in like i still can't slide i'm being scammed reloading american troops there are a bunch of people beneath me i don't know if you're anywhere near nice have a on this flag at least back up here i'm on top of the bay back right back right i'm getting shot on the side too though watching this left side over here oh he's got a shotgun yeah he's got been running around with the shotgun there you here oh my god there's no one else up here at the moment right i'm spawning a transport vehicle to get across and then i'm going to get out and grapple on their roof this is my plan this is my story um i'm up here oh you made it you made it you made it driving i'm thriving they're coming for me though i hide oh make this this thing is crazy oh my god that just scared me i just i oh brought this armored truck over and i'm just murdering everyone the gunner on it is so good ow don't do that again please i i should have hopped i really should have heard my god i spawn in there and yeah no that's your fault though that's weird no i was fine until you hopped in i'm just saying beat strange bit weird that's all i'm saying that was great though all right i'm flying over there again i didn't pull your parachute that high no but i wanted to no you don't understand the tactic no you don't get it you don't get it i'm not impressed so what do i have to teach you how to fly in this game too what's going on you should have seen my parachute pull earlier on that guy's mine i got him we need to spawn in more armored vehicles it's so broken and you destroyed chompers with it it's just the best oh yeah at least for our teammates oh somebody up here this the people beneath us too this is the loudest thing i've ever experienced oh she's up here he's in the back left corner like no he's got a sniper on my buddy i'm i'm dead i'm dead oh okay all right can i call in another armored vehicle i absolutely can don't forget about your doggos too you calling the doggos did i call yeah i'll keep again i'd rather save i don't know how it works i'd rather save the points and spawn one of these bad boys it's my new tactic okay my truck is upside down they spawn me a truck and it is upside down i like that how does that work no he's getting rid of my oh my god it makes me so angry i i definitely missed all my shots oh this is our hill nobody please no did please play with the night yeah oh nice i can't aim two people on this objective once in a ditch i can reload [Music] i'm gonna hop in a second i should probably call in a little doggo guy he probably helps out a lot it's not ending me is that a cooldown or what i don't understand uh maybe there's too much stuff in this guy there are a few people on this objective i don't know where though i'm gonna get back on the roof let's get going i really want to grapple a plane all right do you want to come over with me in my in one of these two e flag to the rocket uh where are you i'm on the back side you see this green arrow he's coming in it's coming in hot you can be the gunner if you want get a load of kills let me know when you see people i'll i'll try and slow down for you or something just let me know see a whole lot of nothing there's off top of them on eight you see him on the stairs okay he got away on his left side need the stairs here on the left got him i'm gonna try and reverse back up oh there's a guy right ahead of me i need to hold on he had a rocket launcher he said on it in his head becomes a sensational okay that's not a person that's just a floating man a floating ghost it's the worst that's not a real human being i don't know that looked like sheer panic to me on the left here good work definitely not real that guy doesn't definitely look here they're like up top as well i might just get up top here let's go see look at how long i could sit in here it's they're so they're so busted it's crazy oh that's an enemy i just made it a tank i got four kills did you really yeah i love seeing people fly that don't know how to fly and just instantly i relate so much that's not 100. all the people out oh i think the uh the thing is gonna it's gonna go up soon right though i think that's why it's beeping oh we're actually winning i'm not trying to oh you're going to shrink it i'm not trying to jinx it but we are winning a game of battlefield.com i don't know where to go they have uh their only flag is a i might spawn in a transport vehicle oh mine's in play oh my doggo's here oh this guy must be topping off thanks guy oh get him doggo oh he has one too oh we're so much better than you uh i'm in a new squad i found some new friends they um they saw me walking down the tunnel and they were they started they stopped and they beat the horn to get me in the atv random stuff happened to this game oh i am about completely out of ammo i'm currently vibing out to a radio i can't turn off yeah i wonder if that music is copyrighted it doesn't sound like it is but never know this could be like some radio bangers yeah the early 2000s it could be is the best i'm gonna try and spawn him in unavailable is it because my other one's in play i think it is there's like multiple running around it's awesome i love fighting in like these uh like this tree line area it's nice yeah this hills fun that building that we like is fun the tunnels can be fun fighting inside of b for the roof is fun if there are no choppers that's what i feel like conquest is like you find some areas that you enjoy you want to spend at the least amount of time like moving between flags as possible and that's what's great about the spawning in the vehicle thing yeah you can move around the map pretty quickly yeah objectives i don't know why he's on the radar but he was fighting jesus that sucks i don't check the radar i need to check yeah every night if there's nothing going on oh cheeky fake mate it's like it's something if there's nothing going on just give it the quickest glance if there's no orange you don't you stop looking at it yes we did it 45 kills and a six that's not bad uh the 40 is the bottom number this is i don't know i know i think that's your place in terms of everyone else like i got second in the lobby i think that meant okay so then i yeah mine was first so 47 i had 47. nice i stick with 45. if you use the pink multiplier i might have come out on top though you know uh 45 years of battlefield experience don't give me that i'm only 50 years old that means i've only got five years not playing battlefield in my life come on man uh-huh is exactly the point
