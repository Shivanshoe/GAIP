hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i am using a really really stupid setup because the chances of finding it as early as i did was so low that i took it as a sign it's a double g7 scout setup where i had double tap on both of them i found the two guns and the two hop-ups in literally the same building it was ridiculous now i love the g7 i use it all the time in the channel but really it's only good at one thing medium range domination where the enemy is either standing still or firing back you know when they're not moving that much if the enemies run away or if they're far away they're really hard to hit because the travel time of the projectiles is actually really low and they nerfed the double tap attachment as well there was a time where this setup would have been ludicrous and overpowered but now it's not that time my friends it was a fun game trying to adjust my playstyle and i hope you enjoy it you guys have got to go and sub to so far as well his link is in the description of course so thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends nice interactive though that's mine yeah okay you got your g7 yeah there we go [Music] i have two double taps i have two door taps on two jesus do you really no way there's no way you do from one building here thank i just you science now um i have a right here okay i'm lost wait i've lost the play one more thing there's something uh i i i completely forgot where is that where is it somewhere in here and there's an h card i don't know if you saw that yeah yeah right in this building opening fire nice one more okay i didn't reload my gun i'm not gonna lie rsmg here is your barrel what the what is this barrel that's so did you throw it try throwing it through the way no it didn't i did it would have been it would have been clogged look at it this is chilling it's just hanging out now it was close though this is a little bit too wide i just love it i've got a gold barrel double tap oh my god are you serious here's here's more light emma thank you let's go this way i'll be doing ball to get through 300 but we'll see what could happen thanks let me know if you're eating it if i find another gold barrel i got you take these out for like yeah that's the plan double double gold barrel double uh purple light mag double time can i fire and then change weapon really quick and then fire again oh if we had like a uh like a swap like a faster swap some type of perk you could animate if you could animation kind of so you could definitely do it unlike cod you think that sort of stuff it's one of the big building but there's obviously a big scrapper market as well oh wait what is this guy always follow me give me one sec i broke both of them nice job nice oh my god what what what was that there's so many people oh i didn't have a helmet that's probably why i took so much damage 10 syringos the world's worst cereal there's there's a lot of light ammo if you need it uh oh yeah another thing there by such bad things he won for 36. nice we're inside the next ring i can't remember which gun has what on it i can't remember if you've seen single fire or double fire or what like this is actually kind of weird do you have them both on different yeah i keep switching with depending on what range they're at practicing that right now before yeah yeah trying to get you back hit the pass the bus stop one team got finished but there's another one i'm burning one nice i broke one i shouldn't have run off i think he i think he's over here yeah he's right on me whatever as quick as i can young with the purple nice got him we made the right choices hey swat capsule so fun oh my god dude that was insane there's so many people i don't know what's going on here i'm trying to keep my distance obviously because because my concept yeah you're low that's not i think i need to pick up another close range just so i can make yeah yeah i'm gonna pick up this alternator that was fine for me last game i wasn't getting any kills but he just i don't know it just fires so slow that i can find for ages it's like one of those guns you can do you can do a lot of damage you can take everybody's shield down but you're not going to kill them yeah yeah because they know they can tell when they're getting too low they're just like getting together turn around and yeah turn around and one clip you with a 99. can i not climb on this what's going on i'm not where's the next where's the next graph do you have any that's by the way i zero um i i just picked some i just picked one up actually everyone's fine i only have the one yeah i can't find any because if you're using a product i think he was like i definitely am nice yes okay so you're still you still got the double g7 yeah yeah the double cd7 double double tap hold the one quadruple oh that's great it's uh it's not it's great for content but yeah it's not for you it's nice if i had 99 then i could have gone in with a lot more confidence but it's working out you know wait i hear people oh i think someone just took it i don't know yeah i heard that i heard that i have my alts all right oh pop some shields real quick so they can't flank us i just broke him nice man that you didn't do anything i i probably should have called that i was flanking so you didn't have to think i think i oh you doing it and i i still wanted to just in case i didn't i didn't expect you to be able to take both of them from full health but yeah i mean they were literally standing like right next to each other and you know when you have a crawler it's kind of this part is so bad yeah it's so broken right now and i'm so sad because i loved it so much and it didn't need to be uh buffed the way it did it's crazy oh imagine you could put a digi on the g7 oh that'd be so nice i know he's still broken one of the reasons i've been loving caustic he's cutting visibility and i'm just going to the prowl with the digital did you throw yeah it's so broken oh um in this building i think yeah in this building hey she was trying to hit me with it oh my god they've got the bloodhound bangalore combo of course i have tgg so i am why can't i climb dude i can't come out that way i literally can't climb upstairs they come on the back i messed up i got them nice in my gas a little bit they're outside nice oh is this they could not do anything with that gas is people firing down low it sounds like safe yeah i'm sure you can hear that yeah i'll um be right there also pulling this callback all right on my way i'm going to cross all right left oh no i'm going to someone's behind here too yeah there's a team up here on us i should not have dropped him you're just chilling here i'm trying to see what they're trying to do though i still think there might be more than one team around yeah right there behind the bin right behind the bin they're revved up top they're reported they're getting flanked though oh god i'm good i'm good is there a way to get up to you nice um i have poured out how i messed up punching a tunnel i'm okay you're the best i should not drop down it's kind of bad typing but they were good practicing oh they saw the kill how dare you do that for me that's on the right my bed white evo yeah i'm about to push over there i'm just trying to finally grab some bats oh this is the last team i cracked one of them they stole one of the other kills i cracked i mean oh we do have to move actually like right now and my best camping donut i have no more big hills but we should be okay yeah i don't have um port i have a i have a battery for you nothing they spotted me i'm taking shots recharging my shields they have top side no literally one shot we can just take this opportunity if i can uh yeah if you want to run over i'm not foreign i didn't get him i get him g7 so good uh right on the railing train tracks above us yeah you could just fry him when he when he pushes his name is trying to wrap on me ref silence he's pushing left where are you going oh my god it's so slow at firing the buddies are so slow i'm going to punch him fight on him look at this on his head i don't know he's he's literally one hp oh it's so close to double tapping him but their bodies are so slow revenue runs really weird too yeah he's got like an apex check he's got a big box in total but his little legs are so scrawny it's like me it's like a big octane nice double double tap for the win uh has that ever been done before i don't think that's ever been that way it might be
