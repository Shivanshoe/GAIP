hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i have another 4 000 damage game it's on pathfinder again so i didn't unlock a new badge on a different legend but what makes this one a little bit more exciting is that the setup that i was using wasn't really meant to be high damage now when i drop 4ks i'm typically using like a scoped or a 3030 or a charge rifle or some sort of long range gun and the reason for this is because the gunfight's gone for longer and there is less danger when you are engaging at a further range but today's 4k badge is with a flatline with a hollow on it and a peacekeeper i never would have expected to do this much damage hopefully you guys enjoyed thank you for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends who talks like things man who talks like this what the heck am i reading what the heck am i playing with man what's going on i'm landing here oh my plane team give him the chimney how [Music] died jeez this guy's these guys are characters uh i think i have a wait i can check i do i have a phoenix kit for him here you go what is he doing what was that noise yeah what do you think i'm gonna do my grenade now fight with us don't fight by yourself come on man just us left i mean i need a gun give me the guns there we go that's one of the guns on the game contact i'm a little bit enemy i really wanted the stuff my kill i'll be honest if if i'm being completely truthful i'd have liked any of this stuff oh that'll do did we get the last guy i don't think we did oh we're good we got some stuff i think we even get out of here let's go amigos let's roll out gank we just eliminated the whole squad exciting nice kill they never saw it coming extended light mag here level three i had four med kits recharging like me i think we just go over this way get into a gunfight and shoot some people it's a three-step listen this is not the best cover it's not always necessary no i went to the three-piece but it's okay you switched to pk4pk giving my shields recharge not be able to reload my pk i did that because a okay but now i'm gonna have to change the camera on it so ultimately could do some bats do i take a second to craft a battery or two here they crafted an r301 oh god there's a team here separate team back there is he just thirsting okay i should have reloaded i'll be honest i got a little bit too greedy i need help the drum would have been good but it's okay his car's just loaded everything he's not even interested all right i've got a little bit to answer but that was fun that was fun no you got on me i had to go for that i had to go for that i got kind of messed up because i didn't think the shield was going to carry on into narnia i was going to take a few pop shots there and and then use the shield to poke in and out of cover with the pk but it just it kept moving that thing was moving like me it's just the guy was just having a great time thirsting are you how do you not have enough you've looted everything oh they're fine each other this is good this is good this is good this is good let's third this let's third this guys they'll find each other what else they were over there ah not anymore i guess they're not fine anymore recharging shields might be something good this way lifeline's gonna get lifelong's in such a bad spot lifeline can you wrap around to us nothing on the back making contact with the enemy throwing the game third go go go launch those missiles that's a plant i'm getting my first damage today enemy taken down god this guy's far away i thought we're under attack i kept trying to arm switch because he felt like i was a lot weaker than i actually an enemy was it's just a solo guy i'm going to lose i hate me i'm unhittable i'm on here ball my rhymes are inequitable my accuracy is indistinct indistinguishable oh my god he's got a turbo devo not like this gotta hop up here okay i want to use that i have nine bats i'm using one of them all right what do i need some throwables would be good i'm taking this back i've got a pk so i've got extra room how many throwables did he have i think he used them all i think everyone used all their stuff this has been such a fun game flatline sometimes i feel like the flatline is better with a one-time sight on it in this little circular hollow thing i don't know doesn't seem to recall as much you throw it three times on i don't know i love the three times all of the two times i i guess it depends on what kind of mood i'm in contact with this is why it's kind of known as a humongous scrap and if i had any throwables i'd be launching right now i'll be throwing all the throwballs what's this guy up to dodging every one of my bullets that wasn't my fault he dodged him hostile where did that come from the whole time i mean obviously it was but where did it come from oh guys are god do the team kill them i think the guy down here now so everyone no no it is it's crafted a heavy mag for me which is tremendous this guy knows what he's doing thank you definitely feel like i'm not playing my best i feel like i don't know my shooting's okay but my movement and stuff at the moment seems to be what's the word labored i can't explain why let me get in front of your lifeline i've got a rope big rope each big rope angle actually going to use this one i guess this one's fine recharging shields where is he in the middle he's in the middle but i've got a call stick so actually no it's gonna be them it's definitely them how far did they back up did all of them back up how many are there huge dodged i hate you caustic and shopping with the team i think recharging shields one minute the ring isn't far one sec healing up like this even though i am deceased back up there's a third team back up back up back up back up back up back up back up come here just come here because the other team's caused it's inside even if we win that fight oh my god okay i guess i'm fine right whatever this is so terrible i hate it he got abandoned enemies oh my god man like that didn't need to be that tough it could have just backed up and he said we're pushing the i mean gg in that situation never push a corset team when you're getting third parties it's just horrendous that was way more difficult than it should have been but i'll tell you what i'm glad it worked out like that because um it was more difficult but it was also more fun let's be honest that was a good game hey i got 4k i got a 4k nice yes
