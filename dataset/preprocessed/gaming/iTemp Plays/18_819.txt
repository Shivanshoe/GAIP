it was a gauzy twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now some of you may have noticed that since season four payments finding Luke these have been extremely difficult impossible even and that is because for whatever reason there are no longer any loot vaults key carrying drones on the map apart from one which is on Mirage riaj now I've really enjoyed London here since it came out but now it has two extra benefits first of all it means that winning gets you a vault key which is going to get you fully kitted out but also you know that whichever vote you choose to go to will be panned open so you can take your sweet time if you wanted to now I'm not sure why these keys aren't on the map at the moment maybe it was a mistake or maybe they're trying to change the way in which we get the keys I'm not too sure but anyway I hope you enjoyed today's video I mean I don't technically lunge a mirage for yardage but you'll see why it still makes sense believe me thanks for watching I'll see you only 5 now seconds my friends no this is too late Nancy started you can see the teams that's three that's three different teams we're gonna have to detour it's an absolute if you've got to lend us some web it's such a hot drop you have to be efficient you have to be extremely early advantage so then oh god bang well I believe in you double-time it and get the hair can freak out oh they don't have a gun I do not have a weapon any spam please something for your boy this is a shame because actually it's so good to get a weapon down here and just rush up there with a jump Tower thank you appreciate that ja Fiamma thank you very much I mean I do like the Sentinel but I'm bad with this weapon as the only issue teammate don't give him don't give up on us hopefully add some decent loop and he's being looted right now it's going on a tonight he's running away he's terrified get him two shots in a row take it down never-before-seen be fair my tit or being firm Atos did I get any of those light rounds I did a lobby my teammate we can respawn you angles being patient at least I need let me just check one I just needed a little more light ammunition because there's a decent chance of enough to fend off some competition here it's off to the respawn is incredibly loud it did sell out they were fighting over there before hands and ideally I would like them to be fine some more because that would mean they're preoccupied and likely wouldn't come over to try and try and first Bangalore straight off the drop II just say like they're still scrappy that's good news it's a shame because I love landing and the rise voyage because of the vault cake and you get yourself some gold armor hopefully anyway I'm doing a better recon Gibby Gibby bubble someone's coming over do you have to me instead of the guy dropping that's good they've jumped off the cliff safety they're gonna be they're gonna be on the cliff please crawl the other way this is a terrible place for smokers a little bit later we spray on all ends to be honest oh my word I can't I'm horrified with this amount health one of them is not purple oh we had the vault key as well beautiful we can still achieve our dreams if you're if you're don't may be cheating realize which way the the enemies were gonna be coming from but if she crawled behind the building I mean all the banker will use the smoker I believe the smoker you not pull them though I put a revived a little bit early May listen it's work tank pretty sure this is the only vault that people are opening right now consider it's their only bulky on the map let me be a good of the idea to try and stretch the other ones sometime but for now with our teammates on the ropes who level-one shields there's no time for messing about we're gonna get ourselves some gold Armand hopefully of God he'll me in there too and we'll be laughing I feel a bit shaky I should have eaten something I always make the same mistake I always like when I play I wake up a little bit most like an hour and then I jump on and play but I haven't even eaten anything today so my hands are all like shaking you know like low blood sugar when I'm playing it so stupid and they end up trying to snack whilst plane inefficient so if you see any bad accuracy it's because I haven't even properly I'm near a looot fault I have the key solves that's a callback we've seen gold on and a gold helm in their team beautiful science field here oh nothing so just do the whole thing chill disco quad gold I can I should extend it here what gold now on the needs is like a gold weapon amazing Antigone weapons will be laughing I mean forward laughing anyway enemies that first test point a Lanka up there then I guess and him as a shame because I had them cries well I had the Watson crap I skip the arc star still I need the sight on this thing good grief I stopped one more uno más these throwing haymakers good vitamins dangerous one times on the honor tonight is gonna help a lot that wasn't even shaky hands I'll let you just couldn't see what I was you know they I need a solo the guy's a Lindsay why did it even come from people are flying in our thing which makes sense because they've been pushed from the angle there you go teammates you know got gold shields I'm gonna give you a fence kick I think the team flew in my teammates on the rope so far they just heal up here absolutely ammunition very much thank you no I'm the trainer look at least they were looking like they were trying to go on the train yeah they are oh that means it was unlooted I was a full team are we go shooting to be honest good news these I don't think they'd want to challenge against someone that's just south top like this as long as they're not rush you know the problem is they may be sucks because they know if they know to choke points they can easily see directly which you just rotate around if we do it early it won't be a problem they could easily just be sad the other side of that long tunnel frankly still on blue even though this octane had on the heads right seven kills five for the squad to remain in fact every single squad is a team of three no one's even lost a member it's not often you see B's they're scrapping the scrapping and I'll tell you where it is insider information here it's in the distance someone's gone dame that's good news and bad news we are too far away assuming it is this scrap to take advantage of it I've got my ultimate if he helps there's a race portal this is the scrap pits in the tall building this is good for that fine I can get up top easy it was least he's down hopefully someone comes to revive him it's not gonna I got a gift Marcus expected this may seem like a waste but I'm trying to take a different angle to my teammates just in case their company they want company it was a waste and for the entire time this is our lucky that's asleep that's just the effect of a third party then your team may win the gunfight but if a fully stacked team that hasn't even taken any shots rolls up late it's extremely difficult to win that there you go for an extra cup there's another scrap in the distance all right I'm gonna take the discs off threat I mean leaving it behind recently because I feel like I'd shoot better with just a regular one time stage [ __ ] but we have a banger on the team and if she uses her smoke I still want to be able to shoot people that's the plan George a man's involved half man after obtain many vault I see them jealous same guy I thank you twice oh I found them I thought that was a I thought you'd be able to sit on the window frame sometimes you can note names you see windows always forget I'm here ladies protect the stache teammate all right once got left we were actually the ones getting third party that time we should be looted our home out of our minds man one of our teammates has got a golf bag sorry I'm at fault helmet from the exchange I already had every gold item on the game there we go okay I should have tried the anvil range there every time I pick you off there I wanna I just I forget the fake completely change the repo learning mm respawn that's a shooter don't let them restock Alden I don't care about the care package I have everything everything I need sticking the Ring of Fire over this way any Tuvan that does not follow us are proud of you good you are you okay the shield less that's the power of the Luthor my friends because there's only one key at the moment gold armor is far less common when season 3 came out I feel like everyone that I thought had one member of the team with God armor but now there's only one key of course you can still find it around the map on the train for example but look no want that we fought against their I 12 kills no man that I shot had gold arm Rock I had every single God item that's why I'm a variety eyes is the best drop at the moment if you win mirage voyage you are kitted unless the loot vault is disappointing i mean i've gone in there before and it hasn't even been purple armor let alone gold but still pretty decent thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed that one and i'll see you all in the next one [Music]
