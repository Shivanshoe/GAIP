this video is sponsored by ea hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing apex's new game mode control and i have to say this is the best limited time mode that has come into the game it is so fun if you're unfamiliar with this it's a 9v9 respawn game mode with three flags that you need to control to score points over the enemy team you have all you need for some high octane gameplay you have infinite ammo you have automatic shield regeneration you even get care packages with the heirloom weapons in there if you prefer to cram people and of course i'm playing the new legend for season 12 as well mad maggie thank you once more to ea for sponsoring today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i was gonna say i don't know if lifeline is the play but she does have the drone and it's so slow to heal up with syringes but the biggest part of keep that afk revive is impossible in this because you don't get knocked you just you just die i'm gonna try and keep them upbeat i'll try my best oh my god they're here i've got one of them she's fast with the shotgun didn't she oh my god ah please i did so much i did so much i killed three people and captured the flag they can spawn on b how close you spawn to it oh that's busted these four guys had to run for spawn where did he get gold from lifelong packet there's a thing combined are they hopping yeah they helped oh that's unfortunate oh we have a we have b oh sorry we have b and c so they should just be coming this way everyone's in this door so i'm gonna go here instead anyone around for me to shoot honestly i think the drone might actually be good especially when you're with a load of people you can benefit the whole squad in one go it's a lifeline not necessarily the most obvious choice here because you can't get knocked but does actually seem pretty fun oh i'm dead goodbye if i'm gonna spawn here if i'm gonna try and do this tactic of trying to cut them off before they can get into b i maybe should switch to a triple tape class i think but then i miss out on the that's a tough one oh that's not fair that's not fair all through the rock maybe no no no no pick me up teammate pick me up teammate no if you can get a flag that's outside i don't know if there are any flags on this on this mode that are outside but imagine if you did you just give the ulti eight people trying to get it this is a terrible idea this is one of my worst ideas ever they neutralize the zone push them right no please okay i really should have changed um i really should have changed legends when i switched classes tonight so i don't have a shotgun and that's i saw the point of playing mad maggie oh you get the gold armor that's actually so smart but how often do you get the lifeline out i need to use my ultimate i keep again oh should maybe wait for team ac i think we just got cleared are we going in let's go in i'm kind of scared though i mean someone this is such an awkward push no i missed i miss way too many shots we can go in the side i know i don't have the mastiff now everyone's inside all of a sudden that's unfortunate timing through the wall on this guy how he came back i know what that's gonna do it's gonna hit the wall oh god that was a really bad ultimate i'm not afraid to admit it i'm messed up off the backboard does someone have a craver by the way why does it sound like a crater this is a bit of a risk but i saw about eight people running this way that was someone right next to me i'm gonna leave this behind no i'm dead all right i got my massive back because as soon as i put it away it would have been perfect you know but the triple take was fun it definitely is a good low down hemlock mastiff comparable oh now everyone's outside again tremendous come inside guys come inside can't really see oh you can't arm switch but it's on the floor i don't think you can this mode's really fun this mode is so fun get him bam oh my god i killed it that killed him he did two damage oh there are care packages that spawn in is that why someone's got a crater oh oh that has to kill him no no so yep i don't even need the shotgun i'll just use this big old speaker speak up massive god i'm quick why is everyone on their team a master by the way to fair we do have more players we have two more players than they do i got 17 kills still though all right gg everyone it's kind of unfortunate they had two more players than we uh two less players than we did definitely made a big difference but i still got 17 kills nearly nearly a thousand ratings in there as well that was fun i had a great time with the massive 3400 damage in there as well huge oh we should rush b team get over to b we can't just leave it flip my whole teams just we don't need everyone to capture c this is this is the real map control here these guys never played domination look there's people coming over i'm actually just going to sit up top for a sec i'm going to appear because they're just going to take b i really can't stop them by myself i'm gonna jump down that might do some damage we managed to stop them from getting b but i'm not sure how how long that's gonna last for nice team that's really well played really well played there's a guy at the top i'm playing fuse because i thought dudes would be fun when there's nine people running around and i'll just keep lobbing my fusibility and just being really annoying you know it sounds like a great idea we'll see if it works out though he's throwing outside that guy's cracked him a little bit trapped him i guy's dead i i sense that i'm being slightly annoying to these guys i think i'm being annoyed that is the plan i didn't go as far as i wanted it to that was a really bad fuse ultimate i get unlimited unlimited ammo too ow ow who was that anybody do any damage it seemed like it did nice teammate thank you oh do we all have mad maggie's passive why are people showing up when i shoot them oh god that was close i thought he was early i thought he was this way they're against sea and neutralizing it oh that that is some bad shooting from me i am just eating this aren't i i don't think i was in the range anymore but i guess i was why you come back octane someone padded on me and i don't like it i need to get to an objective all right first impressions of this game mode is that it's actually so much fun like it's it's about as much carnage as i was rude i was as i was hoping it was going to be there are people everywhere this is why i chose fuse to be really annoyed with my regular ability i wish you could choose a scout i'd love to still play with the scouts that sounds so fun have a fight for b flag but i think we're okay i've launched that way too far yeah we all have mad maggie's passive it sounds like drop down drop down drop down what happens i need to get back into b flag i need to play more objective here i'm already helping the squad in terms of in terms of flags you good nice i'm capping it they're fighting down this way i can't sleep i'm getting so many kills starting but i guess it doesn't really matter oh my goodness here they come okay i only have five kills apparently that's a big scam yeah so many points playing the objective and i want to finish top of the team so i'm going after every flag i got my ultimate who we shooting who are we shooting i don't even see anyone i'm going for a flag i need some points i'm not standing for this yeah following me having that many kills he's just not true i'm not getting any assists triple kill onto the flag cap triple kill flag cap it's the ultimate way to get points neutralization oh i should have won that gunfight all right we are back i shouldn't have lost that gunfight there was a blue tank come behind me anyway so it's fine but seems like a good yeah that seems like a good legend to play octane seem seems really fun as well because one has got the passive health regen so then you'll pass the feeling on both aspects which is always nice where's this guy oh i'll go behind me i might have been able to get him why am i getting i got shot in the back x ring moonborn that's my teammate off the top once we get getting on this oh my god that was close where on earth was he i'm capturing this flag yes loads of points on top of the team now i am going to go for a flag there's a lot of fighting over this way at least there were this is not a good spot to be in oh my word hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah calm down a bunch of people going beat flag there's someone in the middle apparently i might go for the middle guy i need to i need to keep my high ground i'll jump down too soon there nice camera in here right like that guy was last time on me oh jumped way too far that's a little bit too far uh we only need 15 more they're not even coming for b flag i'm trying to cut them off but they've sort of given up on this objective it feels like you're shooting that way that might be an enemy oh my god oh i've got a hammer point on the p20 i know there's so many people here i'm getting scanned too careful that going for us that is unfortunate 19.99 i don't want my screens like this i think i've pressed the the wrong button there we go nice a victory victorious fuse is a good legend to play i just remember i need to remember to use his ultimate wall and you get hammer points all right 11 kills nearly 3000 damage two captures not bad at all gg
