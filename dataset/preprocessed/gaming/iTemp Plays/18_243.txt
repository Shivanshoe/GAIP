a huge thank you to ea for inviting me to this early capture event of apex legend season 11. hey what's up guys twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i got to try ash early thanks to ea she's so fun i love the playstyle that she encourages and here is just a quick overview of her abilities if you haven't heard them yet her passive lets you see death boxes on the radar and you can scan them to see the location of the team that killed them her ability is a slow-ish moving projectile that stuns nearby enemies and her ultimate is a portal that she sets up where she's aiming which her teammates can follow as well now for some reason i didn't use her ultimate in the games that i have for you today but i do have footage of it here in the intro clips so thank you for watching guys i do really appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends what a wheel it is me migos this place is now known as the water wheel because there is a giant water wheel that's why and if you don't like to listen if you don't like the name we can change it but that's the name too bad i'm back here again i feel like i've been been here about i've gone up this particular road maybe eight times in the last hour i don't know how only play like four games five game mate maybe more than actually but i'm always here i guess it's just the middle of the map that's the way it goes i mean kind of got the spiders on the right the spiders don't attack you unless you attack them they are protective of their little spider eggs as you would expect so uh you can't just get destroyed by the spiders you know didn't even have a bag what am i doing scrap big scrap okay at least we've got the high ground this time that'll do that's the way to get it sorted these guys are a bit aggressive considering we had a 45 degree angle high ground on them not really sure what they were thinking there you can't blame the man for pushing you can only push the man for blaming it's just listen it's one of those situations we've all been there i'm not trained to look for the car smg and there's a big scrap over this way unfortunately i saw it after the command center we go there are a load of spider pictures on the map over this way here if can i shoot the spider eggs and then make them aggressive to other people if they're closer probably not right you'll probably just no i reckon the spider will just know who shot them and come over and kill me so i'm gonna try it hello friend eliminated i actually love ash's ability that's two kills i've got for me now brisket it's a little bit more for myself keep this guy busy this guy's really weak though his choice was either to heal or to shoot me and as soon as he started shooting me i knew that he was just going to be one shot just like this guy stole that one seems weird seeing a triple take with energy put it still it's like a throwback to season three but i still appreciate it a nice spot teammate sorry apex cap four three four reloading one less enemy grenade there we go that's worthy into the command center here we go unloaded someone's here though finding them i didn't realize he'd gone that way that he's slowly looking ah nice try target acquired here there's about 80 death boxes 80 skulls on the radar and as soon as we get here it's quite in dane and we've all got white armor at least the scrapping name enemy down reloading it's not worth me jumping down i don't think the enemy is moving in recharging shields i'm dead oh i've downed one and i've nearly cracked this guy eliminating i think it's a 2v1 we're outside the ring like intact [Music] when lifeline went up top instead of coming through to tap but i think it was a bad position for her to fire at that guy so all is well then ends well you got a drone yes he does gracias amigo muchos gracias they're all benefiting look at this recharging all right there are uh eight of the people left they're starting to start these lobbies with um 30 people instead of 16 because there are fewer people online at the moment getting in these lobbies so it's kind of tough for them to start their lives up too quick the good news is we're top 10 now i'm happy to walk away with that with 700 damage from that gunfight though like so many people were dead by the time we got there question there becomes which way do we go to find people i don't actually know could just wonder off that's always worked for me oh is the gravity lifts it sounds like a respawn ship emerging i think it's the gravity lift there's one over here i took it earlier on and died it was so sad enemy here disregard that always looks like someone when it's coming across the rope the edge of the zone marked my next location i think they might actually just be beneath us because it was definitely the gravity lift this is a huge ultimate they're all over the place i don't know idea valkyrie's passive isn't picking anyone up i was trying to predict and go on the gravity this way moving here on the mini map it looks like there's a little tunnel there or something that's confusing but there's one squad left and we did hear the firing but it's uh by the time we get there they're gonna have arm switch and stuff it's just more important for us to get safe i think no need for us to to rush in this map is gigantic but there are some really good rotational tools and there will be tridents as well uh in the full release well i love it honestly this map is great there are two deaths here i think this is where the fight must have been then with my passive oh my god fire surely i can't oh there we go at least landed one shot kind of sad for that guy he's in a 1v3 but what can you do a win is a win oh my word on emotes sensational i mean look at this victory screen look look at it look at the foliage on show here it's tremendous remember this was only a 30 man lobby and we didn't see anyone until there were 18 people left so i reckon that's actually a pretty good game gg's all round
