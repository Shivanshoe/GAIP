hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we got our season 8 patch notes coming through on the subreddit so i'm here to read through them pick out any interesting parts and discuss them with you guys directly so the first thing on the agenda is of course the new legend fuse i'm not going to talk too much about him because i did do a video about his abilities i think it was yesterday the day before but his passive he can stack uh grenades one more per adventure snot so to put two per stack his tactical is a knuckle cluster which is a cluster bomb that continuously expels air burst explosives it's like a stun grenade and then his ultimate is a big ring of fire and then after this we have the new weapon the 30 30 repeater this is going to be a heavy ammo lever action repeater you can charge it up it's got the disciplined trigger finger ability on there as well and it increases the damage when it's fully charged now some parts that we've already had sneak peeks of are the kings canyon map update this is going to be the obliterated king's canyon in season 8. as you can see this part of the map back here where the ship crashed into the mountainside is an expansion on king's canyon regardless of legendary magazines which are available for light heavy and snipers and they reload your stowed weapon after a brief delay we did know about this already as well now some quality of life updates we get a damage counter we have now added a damage counter to the hood this was highly requested so we're excited to allow people to easier tracking for chasing those badges and challenges i'm excited for this one uh we could have pinging ammo pinging weapons or ammo on your eventually displays your current ammo account along with player wants ammo in the quick chat it's going to be useful for people that you're not cued up with that you have uh communication with uh because they'll see how much ammo you actually need we have a colorblind update hill and gown reviving world now follow colorblind rawls when colorblind settings are enabled which is always nice and then we have the lore blurbs on canon skins some of our skins are canon and some are just fun for the skins that represent an important part of the character's backstory we've added a small blurb to describe the significance of that skin in the legends life now on to the good stuff the legend meta and down below we have some gun changes as well rafe is getting the pathfinder treatment with her hit marks as you can see from this image right here her hitbox around her chest area and her thorax like this sort of mid area and her legs has been expanded slightly so the description actually reads that she has a slightly larger hitbox than her fellow small legends which is interesting she no longer has the smallest hitbox in the game which i'm very thankful for because if i die to another wraith mastiff i'm going to lose it next up we have some rampant buffs so sheila angle has been increased from 120 degrees to 180 degrees as well horizon's getting another small increase to her cooldown on her ability the 15 second call down time will now start when the gravity disappears so those things are no longer working in unison to make it so you can spam the horizon queue which is nice this is an interesting one with octane he's getting a launch pad remaster many players may have known about octane super jump that was possible with a well-timed jump while hitting the pad once the double jump option was introduced there was an input clash that led to unreliable usage you've got the octane jump pipe glitch which was horrendous now if you hit the pad from a standing position it will launch the players along the high arc which is the old super jump and if you're going from a crowded position players will launch along a low arc meaning they'll fly lower but farther in the horizontal direction which is amazing if you're trying to escape but you can still do the super jump if you want to get a little bit of height on there if you're trying to scale a building or something it makes octane more versatile and i'm all for that because it's an incredibly fun legend to play next up we have crypto you remove the ability to stick arc stars to friendly drones i didn't know that was even still in the game i will be honest with you along the looting side unopened care packages is now visible with eye for quality and and accessible through the black market boutique that's an interesting buff you don't have to wait for someone to open the care package and steal it from them you can just put your ultimate nearby and collect the care package loot from the safety of a building all gas now dissipates as soon as cor16 is eliminated i think it should be as soon as caustic is eliminated maybe not i guess he's already placed it down it makes sense it's a nice change any nerf to corsica i'm playing him in the gameplay after this as well any nerf to caustic is good in my opinion mirage decoys now create footstep sounds this is going to be absolute mayhem when he places his ultimate down uh this change was mistakenly mentioned in the fight night patch notes when he was in fact coming with this patch mirage decoys will now have footstep audio in a limited capacity so they're not going to be full volume by the sounds of it don't be footstep tornado if an enemy mirage or nearby but it should be slightly harder to pick out the real mirage from audio queues alone okay that is that's nice to hear because i was getting a little bit scared of his ultimate now the gold guns have been rotated the wingman the center of the habit of the g7 and the alternator have all been removed from the fully heated rotation and we get the r301 the 30 30 repeater the mozambique the longbow and the spitfire in there now and they are also removing the gold barrel from the loophole which is great because i'm pretty sure it was useless compared to the level three um barrel stabilizer double tap has been removed which i'm happy about an anvil receiver has been added to the loop pool which i'm also very happy about the vault bullet damage has been decreased from 16 to 15 and the alternator is going the opposite direction going from 15 to 16 so slight alternative a slight vault nerf and the spitfire uh its bullet damage has been increased from 18 to 19 but the reloads has been increased kind of dramatically 0.4 seconds for the reload speed and if you're empty it goes from 3.3 to 3.8 so nearly half a second there as well and i believe they're doing this because of the introduction of the gold extended max and if you combo this with a spitfire i guess it's going to be more useful on this weapon now the eve rate has had a small fire rate increase from 2 to 2.1 this is great it doesn't get to see too much usage especially whilst the mastiff is flawless and then we get a bunch of bug fixes in there as well so some interesting meta shifts hopefully the mastiff hasn't been touched i was really hoping the pro was going to be flawless it's not um but those are the patch notes let me know what you guys think in the comment section down below and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds with some gameplay my friends i'm down not to go there listen uh i'm we can walk around for the first 10 minutes of a game and have a crazy ending and i'm happy you're still good to go yeah but i don't care couldn't care less i'll land i'll land lava fisher if you like here i mean i

the one attention let's go jump on their head absolutely when you've got no shield you have to commit otherwise you know you can't engage in a war of attrition when you've got nothing to heal up with you've got to land exactly and that's that's exactly what i'm doing a hundred and fifty on the balcony 103 on the i think it's low back oh i'm going to reload dude that was such a dude yeah you

around here because you killed a loba and a bangalore right i killed a low baron that's it there was a horizon i remember the there should be a horizon on one team and a bangalore on another team any of that fight well at all i guess we just run safe whilst we can oh no no no now what do we do we're actually gonna die at all the traps you're such a little weasel i know this one's kind of bad you're the ones that were behind the rocks i've got killer credit from from those before someone's running in the store they're trying to heal up yeah i just like ticking for a little bit of damage well that was a performance what was that where's my aim assist ready yep what were they doing little we don't know maybe they're the ones that liked my uh my banner i knew it was horrible transfer or
