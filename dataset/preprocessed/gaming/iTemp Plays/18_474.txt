hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be using the wingman i know me a wingman who'd have thought but they did give this gun a much needed magazine buff now it has one extra shot which doesn't sound like a lot but this helps so much especially early game when you have no attachments on it and i think the wingman should always be in a decent spot because it's a skilled weapon it's not a spray and pray you need to be precise and it takes talents to use and this is the exact reason i can't use it but i give it my best shot here testing out the new buff on it thank you guys for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i have a purple extended energy if you need that what are you using yeah you're using that even a vault there you go got an extended energy maker thank you thank you i'm a good guy i'm a good guy on my way probably should have taken those sniper rounds i saw because i have six shots in one long though alambo okay i didn't find many guns can you tell oh yeah clearly that's basically a wingman okay i'm gonna stop playing this i'm gonna quit i'm playing i'm literally not playing one minute don't throw it arcs on me you mouse and keyboard player i just wasn't ready for that dude i'm i keep telling myself every day i need a new headset yeah you see i keep telling me every day i know and i'm just like just so used to the audio being terrible that i just deal with it but i i genuinely think my headset's just starting to go out some of the speakers in there maybe it's just plain stereo is that the word mono mono i got a solid solid 116 damage for your boy you're getting straight bored straight going up on the board guess how much i have uh 200 oh someone said okay i'm just actually i didn't hear my disorder is there someone behind you oh my god i'm in arena fire whatever shall i do in the ring of fire that's actually perfect for me because i could just find out where he is by painting him okay this takes 45 minutes to go away you just got to bite the bullet and wait they didn't challenge no they just wrapped they also just like i didn't hit any wingman shots believe it or not i know you heard me blast him but i didn't i didn't connect i mean they saw me you know hit about two three bullets out of about 60 and they just didn't want it makes perfect sense they thought they these guys must think we're playing on the switch without accuracy right there i mean don't knock the switch i was frying yesterday you were actually playing better on the switch than you have been on pc recently yeah well that's what happens when you play on dirty you see you didn't hear this and i'm i'm literally running towards it so goodbye well there's someone literally right here me cracked one i cracked one of the wingman i cracked one with a winged man have you ever seen me do that before uh never they're running off points it's probably the same team forget it i'm going to the third party i can't be bothered okay okay okay i'm finding damage on me and he's running off see this isn't even my fault as to why i have 144 damage it's because i'm letting you lead the pack that's the issue um you were the one that got caught by the writing i always want to have to save you oh wait wait what are we talking about when you started your headset being broken you're panicking you were like three half yeah and how many shots that looks like all right hey the first fight on the left reloading he padded maybe i can land a shot i don't know where he went just giving myself a little you know a little motivation oh that's a oh tree below healing i think let's get back the other one's one the other one's one right right in the right in the zone he was full actually nice work okay rich you hit him with one shot you thought about 14 minutes don't you put that on me it's how many shots you take oh okay let me just go myself hold on i'm sorry sorry sorry oh no no no no no no it took me four shots so he was four shot so it works patching myself is that how you can't do it yes look i've even got a beautiful little uh wraith port as well there's a lifeline pack crank in this phoenix in about four seconds i'll meet you on this side oh this has been a very productive somewhere i don't hear anybody he was in the shrubbery i was like down low and stuff there's a lot of strawberry involved not really yes does no one have a scorpio all of a sudden all i'm finding oh god we need to get out of here we're gonna die watch your path ring flare is opening nearby i wanna find his turbos yeah i like it i like i like mining turbos oh shoot damage looking like damage to kills oh my god oh no this is not it that's not it's not it i am we're running the same direction sorry um this game has not been there for me but i hope you're doing good i'm doing all right i just hate the pace of these games like i'm just i'm actually losing my mind at how these games are in this mode when the game's not going great it's uh wait is this one up there no maybe not i don't see him is he over here on this little thing no no pretty fast that's his teammate i think uh i would hope so this is getting chased oh oh they're dead we're fasting i'm being aimed at shot on me are you having a game how many kills are you on i'm not look i'm on six and a thousand damage not bad but i'm using the wingman so that's like fantastical oh oh no oh right above oh my god i'm good i'm good i'm good i'll say that anyway because i've done it now all right i'll get it to this truck big value i thought it's gonna be a longer journey i'll be honest oh see ya i mean he's going to get a free rest but why don't you use the team by the way uh they're still over here in this little entrance so we can't even get up here like how do you no i think they flew i'm gonna leave them he's awake 10 seconds to the ring it's close at least don't grapple to safety oh i nearly got that from yourself i think i did all my damage at the end of the game that was a huge poor play by me in fact that that five feet paul was i think game saving you could say yeah they used to give me so mad all right i'm using the spitty again because it's absolutely insane this way oh my decoys just being sad oh dude wait what's going on there he is where oh he's below he's below there below oh go get that blue mate it might be something i might need to go and loot something so i have a p20 either please give me no nine i love the online placement r9 yes come on here was that no no he didn't have he didn't have one either oh no yes thank you oh oh wingman okay if you see a extended energy i'm sorry light heavy or one times or skull pisa okay that's a lot of stuff or any spare shield bats i can't help it i'm going in i might have one bet and two cells i have three cells okay definitely took that hey i mean when when you come in this hot you know it's hard to stop it appreciate that reloading on those kills someone here all right i'll just try to slow it down you know let's know how much damage you did for those kills but it's all right you didn't know how much i've hit him for you know how much damage you have in total right now 300 okay that's not enough you first did my crypto kill that you actually saw absolutely not i mean i'm i'm on mirage i'm on i got a spitfire lots of things are gonna happen oh sorry i thought you were charging oh i mean i already have mine oh yeah of course yo back every 30 seconds every fight there's ten of you the ring is oh i thought i heard something she literally just missed every shot why would they throw that at me i'm not i'm not shooting though that's why you get sucked by that horizons cracked i'm playing i'm playing her friend just left i didn't know where she was i thought because her friend left i got a seat and i thought that was them there's someone else here and shot nineteen why don't you all right an enemy i'm gonna chase him for an hour and he's literally gonna double back and just come give me the kill watch that would be very sad i mean old pathfinder yeah but your new pathfinder nice chance i was um why would you how do you get hit by two arc stars by the way like can you not just move like what's the deal what's going on there maybe he was on the sewage stretch you don't know we need my armor still keep dissing these guys yesterday and he's in the spitfire is just he runs through so much ammo it's crazy he's still hinting about the goldmine um you know there's this bug there if you there's this bug where if you don't shoot the guy that i've got 16 health that i get the kill instead of you know i mean there's this bug where if you hit all your shots uh people die in one magazine this is bug where sometimes i can't find an extended man so even though i've landed every shot i tank it like malphite with a thorn male and a warmog's armor what are what what language did you just switch to i was league of legends jesus i'll never do that again here i sounded like absolute jumble of words that make absolutely no sense you know i've missed pat playing path i've just i didn't know who to play and i was like wait path is back i took my own advice i watched my video i'm glad that you inspire yourself wait that wasn't clickbait no this is what i do this is my play style rich and it works out great oh god i missed everything please don't die recharging shields get out there yeah bats now right reloading um i'm good recharging shields [Music] yeah i tried not to shoot you tried not to shoot and the bullets that you didn't shoot still hit all right that's that's how that's how talented your teammate is is i didn't even mean to shoot and it just connected dirty headshot instantly can i have your bat's place i thought you were i thought you were asking me um i see you just walking though i've been getting shocked sitting up top with a wingman i'd see you running low ground just fine just like in no man's land you would have been you'd have walked over the trench straight over to the germans in numbers and you'd be fine and i would have one clipped everyone on that side i might have been in the back with the sniper scope trying to look over here and someone would have sniped me let's see you're playing as i'm saying you're playing the wrong game rich come on should be playing yeah you're here how are you playing wars though they need to do something very nice i'm telling you get me involved i mean that'd be great package over there i can do impressions i can do i mean i can do it all oh you know what you know a great idea great idea right here uh it's patented uh verbal herbal patent cannot take this no one can take this um you know did you ever see that thing about like i think it was in new york in the subways they had a bunch of different um like a uh celebrities and just different uh icons voicing like doing the voices and like the boys didn't know that they should um they should do that with all the creators have all the creators like a bunch of different creators do like voiceovers just one voice on each and then just randomly throw us in that'd be great that they wouldn't invite me in you oh yeah we definitely would not get invited it's not it's cool a cool idea though that is a cool idea they could just do it for an event so it's not permanent you have to listen to us there's my idea though so that's the scorpio i was going to say that was the score person you didn't think it rachel you friendship with yourself for like 5 000 games i thought i don't even wow 10 seconds changing you run further you're playing the wrong game get it together an absolute fabrication of the truth once more drink it in fellas these games won't last long oh man seven assists
