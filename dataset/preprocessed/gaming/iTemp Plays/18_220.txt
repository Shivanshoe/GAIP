hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and one of my favorite guns in the game at the moment is the rampage this thing is so good at the start of the game even without thermite just because you never have to reload to kill people with it i did a video on this not that long ago however when you get to late game if you've run out of thermites you are in for a terrible time as proven by the last gun to fight in this gameplay because it will let you down be sure to check out my other channel we have uploaded four days in a row on there now and the last two have been halo videos and i'm loving ranked on there at the minute give it a go link in the description so thanks for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i mean may or may not you know it would help every time i get my alt i guess oh i landed on a i'm landing on everything i got so late i'm not with you it's fine got some good stuff though gonna have to pop up i'm gonna pop a phoenix it's probably quicker than doing that we just eliminated the whole squad exciting uh i just this guy was instead thought i heard somebody behind me oh my god this is the worst a problem in a bow i don't have a rhyme page in a probably do we try and grab the rope and would you like one of my three bats um i have a one bat so hey uh here you go adding it to your collection thank you sir that is okay i'm going up how long keyboard what that is the worst thing i've ever seen i've never experienced something so bad in my life you have exceeded my expectations you never want to do that again uh like the time it takes to go from like aiming directly up was to aim directly downwards it's way too long of controller like odds when you go past them those fights are so pointless on controller yeah i feel so helpless i started swinging i'll be honest she threw a tactical at me and i was just like oh i can do that too okay i'm going back up why can you not pop cells on him bro why i don't know you could probably pop like eight on this rope as well i'd be fully fully healed by the time i got up here yeah 30 seconds remain recharging shields because this is the way we don't really want to go do we save a big gravity cannon yes as well all right beneath me two people keep going i'm not there yet i'm just chilling oh there just beneath me right in this building hello hello saved my three backs okay i gotta start using the prowler recharging shield i swear thirty thirties are non-existent yeah it's a shanks i actually really like the 330 this season such a good gun for this map yeah i keep turning around it's thinking it's the gravity lift it's not dude i know it's so annoying i think it's a gravity lift i think it's a rez i think it's a valkyrie yeah yeah and it does nothing if it was like a scan like a big scan room or something you know that'd be fine that'd be right maybe like it charges your old or something but no it's just loud for no reason yeah it's low uh no reason about that know nothing about that don't get back they're gonna crave me please oh i probably have a g7 i reckon it's possible i hear when you swipe over there she's ultimus she's probably trying to get to the gravity yeah i can't really i'm not right i know you're fine i'll go did you kill a teammate he left instantly fast that was fast his body didn't even touch the ground this guy is an experienced rage queen and you know what i've got a lot of respect for him that was impressive he actually like he didn't even hit the ground he's level 10 and he's rage quit that quick i don't know that's weird what game do you think he came from yeah yeah he's probably a multi uh multiplayer yeah multiplayer player multiplayer player multi player player place multiplayer squad yep is that someone no it's a rock what do you get from the whole i've got a gold bag should probably give that to you let's be honest oh no the way i've been playing today oh bro i don't know he said that was another team oh really are they not on the same team maybe they were maybe it was weird because if the other guy and their team wasn't dead i don't know um yeah i don't know i genuinely feel like we find more people when we just chill out for a second after we have a gunfight get over there i can wrap this across if you come up they're gonna have ultimate high ground on us good work team well done this is we just camp this gravity lifts until the end of time recharging this must be the most common used gravel i think it is i think i actually think it is and as soon as they land you just destroy them because they can't really move that much you have me scared that sounds just like an iron 45 to me i don't know yeah sounds different from like uh from the outside like spectator yeah very sandy the car the car is really hard to use like a range but close range it's so disgusting yeah i fully agree amc seems weird to me yeah it's a little odd oh my god i'm telling you we just sit here until the end of time it's the strategy that's where we've been going wrong yes yeah we're trying to rotate we can't we can't rotate we just gotta just gotta wait let them rotate to us i'm looking for some thermite grenades if you happen to find any uh not in here that's huge nah listen okay i only decided i was looking for thermites after i was already in the box uh you were just like nope nope nope you don't stand you don't know you don't know how to loot like me by looting can be pretty bad oh here you go oh yeah that's the one that i dropped i gave up it's not on the starters for this game no i'm gonna sit here okay so i can get we let two people respawn or you could donate two of your kills or something i don't know just transfer them over i don't know how it works no i actually forgot i was about to say are you saying i was going to say look at that gravity lift how does that take you up there and that one like they don't know what they sync up at all nope you should be able to uh i think we talked about this right you should be able to turn them yes like a cannon you should be able to be a human cannon and if you hit someone direct it they splatter and die yeah they just explode yeah just disintegrate much nine algiers i don't know why not fortnite just does crazy stuff like that let's do it yeah if you too if you hit someone with that fair enough maybe this is i love rock i think i it was the cat package i don't know soon over here i think angry now i think what are you gonna say i don't know what was i going to say i interrupted you again sorry there's a low bolt over here yeah right there okay you're trying to steal they're trying to steal the package this is the strategy i'm telling you just use the i know you've been too but i charge up the rampage for the first kill grappling and kill him with the power it's worked every single gunfight so far is that the strap it's the strategy let's try the sentry oops i thought i was in the box i wasn't going to get back why did they not take it i hadn't landed yet oh got the only 30 30 on the map yep and he's popping off with he can't lie he's going to alert high five let me show in the back i think so and it's back up there back okay the other one's further back the triple take okay you'd be disgusted i know you i know you'll let me kill people but oh my god my oh my god there will be other ones already on the right he's already far right was it worth it nice job i hope it was worth it octane why did he thirsty died doing it ah there's a good heat shield though yeah yeah you like that one threw them off through them they're like they're looking at the radar thinking zone coming in like what's going on can i revive you here oh no i mean just just crank it i mean okay could i 30 seconds um i mean i'll probably die but it'll give you i don't know if you will will you you probably will man i'm going to save i'm fine honestly no i'm literally so you can rotate in you're not going to be able to rotate anywhere no not right around that corner no you're going to die that way okay i literally just started like that last last uh yesterday can i sneak past oh yeah you right it's literally just one little thing oh god don't worry the idiots put i just saw a heat shield disappear these guys are absolutely clueless actually clueless uh there's there's a resin launch pad but that you have to go straight don't get past these guys they just watch me leave that way no win stupid octane what was he doing i mean if he doesn't do that i probably don't kill him nice that's such a bad angle too holy this is the most horrendous angle you've ever seen he just absolutely destroyed me okay the difference was you tried no the difference was the first time i had a thermolite and then it ran out yeah without that it's night and day without a thermite i should have i should have got to go there uh oh good nice try i think you probably could have res me too what respawn during the thingy uh-huh i probably could have i think i hesitated too long not good down there no he wasn't
