legends of course and today we're actually playing some crypto because i feel bad for the guy i feel like everyone has forgotten that he exists him and watson have never been too popular in regular games but they at least had a place in ranked and competitive play uh now i don't even see them there it's so sad crypto is actually pretty fun to play because ian pink a massive fight that's going on and hearing this big damage is one of the most satisfying things on the game so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i've got a big emp for you this time right this time oh they've seen me oh no are they getting shot okay okay yes get him an extra pair of eyes all right i'm going to attack up is the time yeah yeah go up go up i'm good to go i've got a pad here i think he's reviving him just in this close this down here over here gold you guys dead octane's here somewhere still i think he's down there i think i'm he's full health now fulfilled with me recharging my shoes nice oh this is just the one so if i've only seen the lifeline i can hear a teammate though throwing grenade nice should have waited to grab myself yeah there's his teammate the animal got a little bit there's a few somewhere else two teams here oh my god i nice it leaves some damage and i might be able to fight him i gotcha i gotcha watch your back i hello oh i killed the octane but there's another team i think are they fighting yeah they are you've got six seconds on your i can't even get they're right on your rock i won't be able to i don't think i can make it in time i'm back blogged off my drone i'm gonna do my absolute best to try and help they kill the pathfinder there's a box if you if you come back inside to the right my drone has been destroyed these guys were killed earlier might be able to just pick up a few things they look down though i don't think anyone knew where you were okay give me a second so this game ends up with the two final teams stuck with their back to the ring with us gatekeeping and with one jump pad everything changed they jumped over our heads i got completely muddled up with what i was doing and we died i put one down so yeah was she inside yeah she mentioned it oh she tried to stick me i think this is another thing yeah oh that's he was nowhere near when he threw times by the way right space him but there's nothing pain's cracked a man in there as well okay okay a minute you're okay i'm talking here okay hold on what 60 seconds left the ring's very close that was the last one that's why the mastiff is ridiculous i'm just gonna leave my drone here okay let me know when i should take it save yourself no she's got massive dude uh she is low but it doesn't matter let's keep coming you gotta sell first right i'll just start the selfies i'll just go there do your think yeah get out of there i'm scanned he's one for two with an eight throw my grenade they backed up a little bit and they're just taking out luke which is honestly fine won't be with you for a little while this doesn't matter i think it's a fuse no no it's a blue chain for 56. i mean i pretty much did nothing when that guy went crazy over your head trying to make some play i they're separate teams i'm going up the hill gotta get up there get a pound off from tyrone the outside on the back right 51. whoa i'm

just surviving over there making them reboot oh come on i cracked the guy that's reviving nice it worked another emp was a little bit over the top for someone that's reviving there but i was finding that for a long time you know i don't care i'm using it now this game we've got gate kept at the bottom of the hill and somehow this team that was gay to keeping us didn't get third partied for two minutes straight so we died again unfortunately a little slug tv a ttv crypto versus i temperino the not tv yes the ultimate crypto it's the crypto v crypto face-off of the ages yeah who's going to win if you have to breathe you must debate them i will and i'll get my drone and i'll team back with my drone yeah ultimate crypto disrespect dude t-bag him with the drone there's so many teams
