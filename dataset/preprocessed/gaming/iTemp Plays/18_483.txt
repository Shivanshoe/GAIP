costume that was so annoying i know the nades and all the nades i got greedy trying to push a corner i've down the horizon with a massive i should have just went inside and healed but it's all good they're going to third that fight we know he could we could go push that there's not that many teams left so no we can go push that or at the very least take their spot out gotta be careful with uh
