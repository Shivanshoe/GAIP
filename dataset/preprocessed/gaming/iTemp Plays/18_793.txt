hey wassup guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now like recently in the videos that I have posted I feel like I've been using the hover an extreme amount that it's because it's arguably the best gun on the game at the moment and then the game that you're about to watch imagine a fully deck out of heat waves 20 to be the lure sidekick alongside to happen it was a beautiful combination so hopefully enjoyed today's video thank you for watching I hope you're all staining site and washing hands obviously but thanks for watching our sea wall in five more seconds my friends a school at all cities my friends I only have one T my gosh is a PCB and there's two people here alright all this is tremendous it's like the busiest I've ever seen scrap it's all City never seen so many people went here at once someone he - that's fantastic please let me jump good great thank you I don't get a gun I'm struggling I don't have a good well this is okay well one of these is on note C for some reason rakish angle of smoke they say someone self talk as well yeah you run off it's pretty scared of me just as much as I'm scared of him team out I'm actually weaponless French I've got nothing I'm struggling okay I think if the bank law wasn't a race she wasn't expecting at all i'll or drop back boat team are honestly on it useless at the moment I mean I've got some boxing gloves can male people but apart from that this is a struggle tame at the moments bitter hammock when rains oh that's beautiful sons Nexus to this actually the best gun in the game great all right let's go get him my team it doesn't know that I've got a hammer points they shitless so much I know see ya Bob Jim is but he's got a house oh my word what have you got for me oh you ever have a guy this is my load a I found my load out already I've got a havoc and I've got a Peter in 20 we have Lorraine's I mean this is a beautiful loft setup especially considering there I can't believe we've won a we've won a gun fights I mean I've got so many any dreams I might need to even drop to the drop of you here well you bet for you you heal up fast on I've got level 1 shields I'm not really gonna make my shoes out now I wanna see if either people have appoints them to peacekeeper all right I say we got to apply some people because I've got a sudden burst of confidence here I'll load it's looking beautiful confidence is high life's good a skins are bad absolutely despise the Halloween Havoc skin there's there something about T so now I've never used it once more if it's a legendary skin and I cannot standing fine I'll get different I mean I know our drops and your ends for narcs are earlier but it's just I don't know I don't know if I like grenades that much anymore considering you can have one per stack in bit of high ground here it might be the place let's do the water compliancy way to make a mistake this guy okay he just wants to loot nice this is hard to control it out range on here I got sure absolutely melts it the habits the best on the game I mean that's cavity scary as well I'll be honest with you all right however these guys push over and then we can just fire them from above nevermind I have lost the ability to graph in my absence from this game apparently we the scope man okay third pie - oh it's so difficult when then move into control recoil did you have to pulled it whether it is you have to pull down on the on the thumbstick and then try and aim left and right to it I don't know it's pretty tough I'm this is I need to get a little bit closer I think I'm I can't rest I don't even there's someone post although a little bit closer game trouble took us nice teammate got my back this is what the habits good at so that's their close to medium range II really should be trying to keep it go and fight a little bit closer but it's difficult when people that far because to get closer is to commit to the gunfights where where enough I should use the right ability okay what do you do here what's going on Timmy I was missing up give me your eval shields please there is another team they are truant okay they've got an angle this is extremely messy right now but somehow somehow we are still alive which is a something I would consider to be a borderline Christmas miracle how are you looting my buy are you not getting shot er I guess they can't really see anything here okay we've now made a gold P 2020 have a point digital threat purple if they like make an absolutely beautiful log weapon here who is he who is he level 1 shields level 1 shooting by me except I go shirtless I can't be there stop pushing I don't know if that's his teammate or not I'm pretty sure they were also shooting the other team yeah that must be a third party good news is that we are safe now we are going to move fairly far away to shame how about they what is that sense to damage I think this guy man struggling I dunno why he's gonna put why is he push this I've no clue boys push this he's put himself in a disadvantageous position he should have tried to curse off it I think oh my God he's got a mastiff while he had amassed if he's dead now I'm not taking nothing I've got a gold piece worth 20 for those that is a scary sound to hear my word oh no level to death so bruiser my favorite site on the hover future like the one times Hedgehog on assault rifles but the hemlock and the hover extremely good would be the two times we go this is why my aims been a bit dodgy at longer ranges you know I'm lacking on the engine around deployment oh it's got none so I want now I've got a digital through I'm good I'll be second hands thanks Frank yeah that's why my long-range accuracy has been a lovely shaker here I've got you know I didn't have a 2 times bruiser so I hope you know if we find someone at longer ranges I feel about to pop them annoying they thank you I don't have a select-fire either listen Jencks he's out here desync the select fire on the havoc and I've not a clue what if I if I deselect fire there I would have [ __ ] everybody however what I will say is that my recall control of boss a little bit what's a little bit dodgy I will say that much I should have bought them anyway it's a scrap in the distance my face is he carrying on there's a second one hitting me over there well there's a third one it's a full team are you guys gonna stay up there you're gonna go back or carry-on or what's going what's the plan here I don't want to engage if they're still moving on the map especially because we have to go this way we need to go around here there's no way we can condense this way I don't have my ultimate yet the storm is closed in 44 seconds that should be enough time right I mean it's moving pretty rapidly give you shots of recharged friend we should be up there here but lifelines I've got my fast heels I have my ultimate here in a second as well you can take one of these if you want got a 5 mm I don't think I'm gonna have to use my ulti here I'm gonna save it because scan up top on train yard is far more important you've been losing a little bit of healthy you can always get back just to make sure you're not gonna die in storm because I know I'm fine here yeah train yard without Pathfinder is absolute zero photography you can do these yeah we should go somes coming in my box get a better position if we leave a little bit earlier I don't want to move out of train yard at the same time as other people and mind these guys are scrappy unless let's just get involved in this it's been a while since I've five my gun here friend and I want to get their hair cupric involved is what I'm saying we need to draw that team over hopefully this long it's thought gunfight brings them over a little bit another so shooting this guy inside no you don't even you've stole my kill thanks Kiki Jackie why is his Octane's teammate is the question we need to be asking ourselves here these guys aren't moving a muscle finishing the kill that's fine we need to draw this team off the high ground I can't I can't complete this range without Scylla fire yeah yeah keep joining widen your push us Oh cut away for the double there that would have impressed them so much that they never would have pushed if they saw the double wardroom I don't know I'm sure it's possible I don't know if you have the momentum available yeah I know I've been annoying take his shield off when the good news is they have to push off this hill and they have to push past Asit I'm pretty sure as well I'm 99 is using desperate times for this man ready the shield perhaps melty shield - I'm pretty sure that this is the tenders trying to put gate keepers as well we're to rotate all the way around because of this team song I'm do not care about them I'm scared if I could lend a shop apps fancy no my few nights flanking these are the distraction tactics the distracting me shrill Tovar it might be time might be time to get involved here these guys might be friend defense because they don't really have anything nice teammate chiki chaka stole my kill another lifeline TV chatter someone kill well your honor where's the teammates that's the question I was trying to sleep-train nice job teammate this is the last one then I took a little bit more I get to use hammer points stupid mouth Mel beans please without their they say goodbye to you moans French there we go with gate kept the gatekeepers here and there's another squirrel wrapping the distance to which is nice you can rotate from our own scrap to the new scrap recharging shield through the squads they say it's a safe i this is good it's building safe weaken them a little bit we gone for the pinch maneuver Nolan does of course tick in there now is plenty more traps I'll be kind of getting here either I put an old saying jump up there he had to run out that door there's no idea who might be starting on the drum pad I think this aim was a supporting actor Mirage nice I need his stuff I have no energy rounds I'm useless [Music] I'll say light back enough to take it off my knee 20 annoyingly have a name defendant not sure how I feel about the two times bruiser on their honor tonight I'll be honest Karthus is violating community to begin we we self-rising after after noting about students i said when it's the high bank do you think you're gonna stand and fight I'll be honest I thought you're gonna run off eh [Music] I didn't really do much for two of the good Faisal worry I mean I did a low B I tickle them a little bit I didn't get killed credit for it but I did okay you know there you go look how even that game is two five ten damage from me 2647 damage from the lifeline but I've been getting some good teammates who think I am not used to it look at this nineteen squad kills between us just the duo the duo in trio zombies come out victorious and to think that was the game that we started with nothing in scraps or sitting I was I was literally it wasn't called scrapped or City because of all the fights going on it was called scrapple City because I was looting the scraps in in this situation and we've come out and somehow we've cleared a third of the lobby and we've won tremendous shout out that the lifeline there the teammate of dreams thanks for watching I'd appreciate it and I'll see you on the next one [Music]
