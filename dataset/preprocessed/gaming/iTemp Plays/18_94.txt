hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are busting out the fuse and fuse is a legend who i think doesn't get the respect he deserves i think that fuse actually takes more skill to play than a lot of people realize and it isn't his actual kick that is that difficult to use i think the knuckle cluster and the uh the big fire ultimate that he's got are relatively easy to use but i always find myself throwing way too many nades when i should just be shooting there is such a balance to strike with this legend and the secret to planing well is knowing when to shoot and knowing when to spam nades if you can combo him with like a horizon that is when you're laughing the most or maybe a corsica or a ghibli if you can get them trapped in your ultimate it's amazing i think i did decent though and i hope you enjoy the two games that i have for you today thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i want to um i'm trying to start streaming again but i'm gonna like do like an hour or two of apex every stream and then boom on to everything yes yes cycle you know we'll escape no absolutely not more than warcraft like actually look it up and see what it is but everybody is obsessed with it it's just a word game why is everybody so obsessed with it there's a million more games almost there down there yeah in front of me though please let me know your machine and they're fighting uh meat market there's an ebay eight that's the same thing right i dropped it for the pk if i die here trust me nevermind i see people over here yeah they were fine here i already said it oh i see them it's the first time we've seen this wait what did i just wait who did i just down what just happened what did happen there's another squad she just shielded that whole time just to get cracked by me you are furious okay so i think what happened was i was shooting a pathfinder and he ran right by somebody that was getting red like a little bit behind him and like down the person it just was so weird because i couldn't even see them you know there's a little casual three or one colato yeah they're in here on the roof i think contact some in here too all right two teams then they'll find each other i'll come inside i'm trying to help you i'm gonna die small price to pay thank you thank you for that small price of paid for the team you know i appreciate it man oh phoenix nice a little light edge light ammo here the light rains on offer uh i'm i'm surprised you didn't ping that sooner yeah sorry disappointed where's this other team that you were talking about there was a there was a valkyrie team up top i don't know where they went i'm going scrap cave i don't know i hear him scrap cave double light and i have like 80 bullets but i'm thinking about it try that one time i kept trying to get you to come over to loot the light rains it was literally one bullet remember that feeding for free just ignored you so annoying nice he wouldn't let me can you get up can you get out the way all my damage can you get out the way reloading yeah reloading it's my decision the horizon's one is there more than one yeah like three there's one coming up on this left side somewhere that was close oh my god are we killed enough you'll be right now we're in the bad spot damn it sweet for yourself see you well i don't have any big hills and i'm left behind gold shield so let's make me kind of say the enemies [Music] did you take the two bullets or no if you didn't then you can't complain all right i'm finally here i'm here i'm i'm here my whole existence oh dude as soon as i hit the best grapple of the century well that shot's behind did not hear that yeah there i think it's over here on this little downhill part i was trying to figure out if 70 was less or more than 400 sorry if 70 is less or more than 400 did you just say that yeah you say that correctly mess it up could be worse come to you but there's there's a team coming to the left okay like across the big rope and someone's read pushing careful yeah i'm scared hold that guy you're going behind you i'll come to you i'm coming to you that's way too far okay i should just be shooting honestly man what am i doing wait did i wait did i just walk off mate there's a brace she's the last one i'm getting finished i'm getting finished how did you get all the way over there oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no you have red [Music] okay okay oh nice try man nice try extended life here behind joker right here on the back how many people here now man this is ridiculous there's one outside on me nice took out a joker there's a lifeline somewhere her teammate [Music] killed that joker launching me knuckle cluster i have no hp deals i have yeah i have two syringes i can drop your bat as well it's my only shield though i down the first thing he did i've got a lot of respect for that i might do the same you know have a flat line actually every i know i always say this but it's always true every time we land the fight is honest yeah i've told you why though right recharging shield or two we're too aggressive yeah true we just pull everybody towards us nobody's willing to fight as off the rip like like we are that's true so we just like we bring everybody to us it's kind of our own fault you know but the rings sometimes yeah i think it's a good point because if you hear gunshots at your pyr you're gonna run over there yeah i'll literally land on one loot loot spawn and just fight yeah you turn around like caveman spongebob yeah well i'm ready to go you know especially his fuse just launch some nades of them yeah you don't even need again be honest i have two just in case but i'm mainly about the needs ah you don't need to drop them i've got a secure package coming in i'm actually crafting a flat line hang on i think i hear people on playstation i'm going to put a rope on this right side i love that that's the official call out still oh yeah i mean what else could it possibly be i don't know he's just the playstation it's the best call-out and you guys you got to say ps5 though because playstation's too you know it's not specific enough that's yeah it's gonna be a lot of different things like this thing right here could look like a look like a playstation you know like the cs2 or ps1 yeah that's yeah you need to know which console which iteration of playstation we're talking here yeah so i don't know which one you're talking about space five we could just name all our call-outs oh behind you budget behind the ps2 at the ps2 okay i know exactly what you're talking about shields there should only be two in the middle horizon i think it's still down here okay oh you couldn't let me get my first damage could you unbelievable one hp i'm one hp unbelievable repairing i hate people ps5 still yup yup shout out to sony for this uh sponsored video i've got one battery doesn't even sponsor people do they no they do they need to well no but most companies don't need to yeah i mean ea pays me to play their game don't tell them but i think that's a waste of money don't tell them well it's an insult when you say it publicly i've been saying it behind your back you've sent emails to ea i've talked to them every day what are you guys doing when i was dropping he's really weak on me he's gonna try an arm switch on him i don't know what i'm getting i think blue i'm gonna i'm gonna bat i'm doing it oh like that i like that i'm here give i want dropped okay i'm okay 157 so yeah it's classic ps5 behavior 10 seconds what do we even need i mean i don't know what i need here i hate this time of the game where are the nades at if you see any names please let me know i have none i'm fused i have two thumbnails okay and we're not inside yeah they're fighting on the other side of this okay the other side of ps5 you know exactly what i'm talking about enemies i don't have a grapple though so i'll be there shortly i'll put my uh package oh dude that's my rap name as well no dude little rope each full rope i like that it's not what it sounds like well they were just flying what were they flying uh duo val called it away i think there's another team in here let's find my first extended energy mag okay why didn't i just go back in first and that was my kill as well all of those damage where's this where's this valkyrie team hillary but i'm just launching i'm just launching stuff i i could have i could have helped you but i chose nazi oh i mean that's because that's the whole thing you're playing views i thought why would i shoot when i can throw a thermite over here set the building on fire who are the apex champions that was a fun game that was a great game you did like 3.4 i know you did okay 3 000. i'm not the worst not the word i feel like i was down multiple times no was i just down once or was i was like once i think once at the start
