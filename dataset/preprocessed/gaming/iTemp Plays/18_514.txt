hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are testing out the new legend fuse we have gone through his abilities before but just to quickly recap on them here his passive is being able to stack two grenades per slot which he can then launch faster and more accurately with his mechanical arm his ability is a cluster grenade and his ultimate is a ring of fire now because of his cooldowns i was using all of these in every fight that i got into which is so nice he's a really fun legend with interesting mechanics which can be used offensively or defensively now let me know what you guys think of him in the comment section down below he's probably my favorite legend release that i can remember if you are new to the channel be sure to subscribe to help me reach 1 million subs in this season of apex and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh they're going crazy down here there's a team

you the other one's on the left too still one more team the other team just okay they're still here yeah i'm backing up sticking i can't believe they didn't rotate why would they all fight there that's why i was kind of confused because i saw one run to the far left and i'm like well there's gotta be a team on the left and a team on the right so one team's gonna come towards us i didn't expect both of them i don't know why they would do that nice job dude i'm i'm falling in love with this gun like i really am yeah you're popping off with that let's go nice
