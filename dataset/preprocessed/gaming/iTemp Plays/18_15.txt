hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are using a gun that i refuse to use when i'm playing solo queue when i'm just cueing in from random players it is the sentinel and the reason i only use this gun when i've got a teammate that i know is an incredibly good player like janks is because when it goes wrong it goes horrendously wrong you miss your shot in a gunfight and you are screaming grude on the flip side though if you land a charged up headshot you're landing 158 damage shots the highs are high but the lows are very low and that is what makes it the funnest good on the game without doubt i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends there's a million people here i'm running here okay i'll under either one i'm good dude [Music] i have heavy for you if you have a little bit of light i have zero light sorry mate you're good i'm gonna say here i'm i'm dropping i'm dropping a stack of heavy thank you that's huge it's going to heal up i don't know where all these other guys are there was a lot of people there was a right here nice shot back to him oh this is the one you i switched it's only one i only hear one no i hear two valkyrie right here for the pk still here with the pk i hate sir but don't

wingman and i just lost on a site and i'm like she flew to me and then she was like no psych she blew black how fun is the sentinel though oh it's amazing i see that guy for 158 uh just so you know we did go on to win this game but it was very anticlimactic the last guy was afk look look at him just just not even playing not even holding his controller his mouse so sad oh you you absolutely mastered that i'm leaving a nade i needed myself nice all right do we dare go up this rope i'm i'm dying mate rings i'm gonna smoke it fast folks can't afford to lose all right let's go oh perfect

not bad shooter yeah this is a different i don't know if it was a different team that was shooting me with the wing man but it was kind of like kind of ruined my plan seven to eight seven to eight it kind of ruined the vibe there with the trolling coming in oh we'll be seeing you oh this guy just got world stars so bad supposed to have to kill that guy so fast oh so incredibly bad he got world started where'd the tron guy go was it our trident i thought no that was our tribe was yeah there's a team behind the trident too oh i'm gonna fall down is that the thing behind so hard bro i'm dead

just in that fight i don't know let's go kill these guys i'll give it a go they're under another hey that guy's a dog with the flatline apparently make the bow and arrow guys probably one of the board's best so these teams yeah another team right there oh yeah oh they killed one on this team we might be able to make a move okay i'm gonna alter the right okay and push right 80 cracks on the roof i'd say on that one 119 oh didn't he just grapple a red armor on him he did dude wait bow check guy don't tell me this is the same oh there's no way he's good though just bowman [Music] if it's a solo ball man i'm gonna be so disappointed i think it is also oh again i don't know that's not bad guy is it i don't know i'm charging my sense of mate okay carrying a boat you no he's just running away hey dude is he solo i think he's solo he was so low he was so low i think he wants to box that guy was such a nuisance he was so good i'll do all that to lose to a boxing match sorry you are the apex champions wait that email is sick it's a cool emo that's a cool emo i don't think i've seen that one really it's it's an exclusive i-10b mode i designed it nice
