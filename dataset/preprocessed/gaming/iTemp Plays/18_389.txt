hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i was playing some solo and i found me a legendary bow check bow right at the start of the game and i realized that i haven't really used this weapon since it was nerfed weeks ago it was overpowered on release but i think the bow is in a great place now there's a clear play style that suits this weapon and it's just to third-party people and take advantage of how quiet the arrows fly you can watch a fight from 50 meters away and just steal kills and be annoying and normally look at you the whole time because they're still so focused on the team shooting them the times i struggle with this weapon are when the other person is also firing at me i've learned to avoid those kinds of engagements maybe reposition and try a third party them or just use the other gun that i have but my engagements with the bow now are way more successful now that i've learned this little technique it's a whole lot of fun as well so hopefully you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos uh all right i'm pretty sure i've got a full team landing on this side maybe i should have gone to the side please don't punch me oh it's the boys i mean i haven't used this gun since they i mean it's not a gun per se it's a weapon haven't used this weapon uh since they nerfed it are you gonna get that you've spied it okay that's fine i haven't used this weapon since they nerfed it i don't really see many people using this gun weapon i mean that's i see a lot of people using the spitfire though and that's why please thank you now we're down here right 14 or three maneuver my teammate got that one at least there's only one one kill but an enemy team stole from me i know you weren't gonna repeat that i killed an enemy around here my ears a little bit better than it was uh but it's not perfect so sometimes i can't tell which which way things are coming from i mean no one's shot so i assume we are good to go 700 damage i mean i thought i'm sorry nearly 800 damage i first had a few people but i had a few a few kills joined you know i guess there is a team here because my teammates are getting shotter i'm bringing the whip over for a faster oh god they must not be very good for a a fast uh getaway that getaway vehicle she's gonna keep flying or what oh there's land down here where did i leave the car didn't fly off into the sunset did it because i did hop out mid-air there it is i'm going to look for some right rounds first i need light ammo i'll just try and use the bow i guess not again i was nowhere near that as well nice i'm so hoping there is actually no one at the states because there's a full team of three i'm not sure my 50 lie rounds he's going to cut it i'll have to stay back and just use the bow i actually i really enjoy using the bow but whenever i try and use are we we hopping i can hop i'll look for some hands but whenever someone's close even with shatter caps i i just can't i cannot use this weapon but long range good grief there you go snatch your bullets big scrap in the distance as well i mean this is without a size as well hostile over there got them this guy's mocking me all right well you guys stay there because i'm going to get some high ground on you we'll see what happens i think they're retreated okay everything okay light rains i don't want to over commit to this if we can keep these guys down low eventually they should get shot in the back 120 damage that would have been 140 uh pre-nerf up i've committed and i missed after all that time there's something so satisfying about just watching the fight unfold i mean does that team out here with us he's getting shot by another team now this is switch two to four for the bow i have so many healer balls this is stupid this is way too many healer walls i need arrows thank you what's my two to four on this i cannot put the you can't put the two to four on the bow there's a team right next to us as well you can't put a two spot on the bow why not it's a marksman weapon enemies oh they're not fighting they were getting ready getting rid of the fences let me focus on my teammate up front now i've done one in here where is our rock thing i think he's just doing his own thing you good there you go one go left don't worry i'm here well all right this is actually going pretty well got all the light range we need three times for the bow i still don't know why you can't put a tooth from there seems like a bit of a scam to me oh god watch this here we go another team and this guy's got teammates inside i may have over committed to this i'm not sure how much i can help you here teammate might be something good this way giving my shields a recharge i can't there's a there's a team down low and there's a team up top i just need them to start fighting each other maybe i can just third party with a boat i mean it's real it's real quiet drop top still this is very exciting oh my god he's gonna fly on you that's fine so i went to my teammates banner obtained spanner's got a long time 50 seconds recharging shields honestly i'd much rather have a mobile than a heat shield you can do whatever i don't care i'm going to respawn my teammates it's right near their boxy still uh this is going to be a third ring so it's gonna hurt a little bit but i assume they have hair levels in their boxes and we're right next to the zone anyway just slide down the waterfall if you have to here it's so easy when you're in a death box and you can't see your health especially towards the end of the game just to overstay in the death box and you can't there's someone here making contact with the enemy i need to buy time for the teammates that's in the ring i was trying to draw them away by going this way i mean i had to run away anyway to be honest it's amazing you just got absolutely played i know i could have used caps but i didn't want to take my thumb off the lefty i have no arrows i can't even get the ones i'll shine to the lower this is a this is a sad day i i'm pretty sure this is this might be a full team as well i've got basically 100 white rounds and no arrows i didn't have a chance to get my arrows back i need to i need to isolate the sniper his teammates are down low oh you've got one too it doesn't matter but he would have killed me with any gun there that is so unfortunate man we were doing like we were doing so well we are their first kills it's a three stack we definitely could have killed them i mean 3 000 damage with the bow we definitely could have killed them man we could have we just got someone for if i had a bow i could have maybe headshot the revenant and then pushed up but i had to get closer to use the r3
