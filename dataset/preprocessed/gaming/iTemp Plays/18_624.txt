hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some more acoustic and we have the most outrageous early game it was a never-ending scrap and when you are fighting in an area with a fair few buildings around i think caustic is by far the funnest legend to be playing also now that his heirlooms in the game i can't help but start swinging the death arrow bags a few times this game i found myself throwing my ultimate all my gas traps around and then just sprinting in there with my death hammer and just start swinging like a madman that didn't connect it feels like it does 250 damage i mean it doesn't obviously but it does feel like that it's just so powerful it's a fun game i'm sure you're going to enjoy it and if you do be sure to like rating and subscribe if you're new around here to join the item pile where you're getting closer and closer to 1 million subs thanks for watching i'll see you all in
