it was the guys ditch which welcome back to another video today we are back playing some more apex legends of course and I don't wanna sound so happy today is a an extremely sad day actually it wasn't today it was yesterday or the day before I even know what day it is anymore but our boy Pathfinder the most fun a legend on the game spider-man himself has been nerfed into oblivion they didn't just nerf min love beat you know make those a little bit more annoying to wipe your breath they nerfed him into non-existence he's a walking freak with an ultimate and that is pretty much eat and also he does have a passive so you can still see where the next relocation is that sort that's right that's fantastic news seen as every game is over by the third ring I'm sure you're aware but if you are not his grapple went from a 15 second cooldown which was admittedly maybe a little bit too low considering how powerful the ability was all the way up to 35 seconds that's an increase of 133 percent I've never seen a nerf or above beast mental before on apex legends to give you an idea of what some of the nerves of buffs are like they changed reporters don't they change you from an 18 to a 12 second uptime not not called aim reduction or anything like that the amount of time is actually on the map that's the reduction of 33% 33% is a decent nerf there but it's not one hundred and thirty three percent easy it's not and without being possible reduce lead by how much because he would won't be on the map but you know what I mean I think it's quite obvious why they've done this one Pathfinder was a little bit annoying but too low but is now in the game and her ability is essentially what plat find disease with a little bit less to be fair you can't go as far it's not as good as a path - grandpa but I wanted to see if I could play him again today I haven't played him yet because it just made me so sad and I tried my absolute best to be disciplined with my grandpa's listen if I have to wait 35 seconds for another grapple no more fluffy grapples no more of accidentally forgot to press jumpin I'm just going through straightforward none of that stuff okay eleven out of ten grapples only before the video starts I just want to say that my G fuel cone is 30% off once more I've wanted to get yourself a tube of G fuel my personal favourite as always is tropical rain of course and there'll be a link in the description if you send me a tweet might even give you a little shout out on the screen just like these people feed so thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed our sea war in five and a half seconds my friends all right new school town it is me amigos we are back on it again we thought this place was deadly it's called town but it's not okay this is the new school town and I've got a charged rifle in a dream here and a wing man it's all do I'll do as well one magic if I clipped a head shop there okay great fantastic first scrap what is absolutely horrendous didn't even get me up top I might need some help in my grapple was exceptionally floppy it was a zero out of ten have you moved oh he's got a terrified are there any of the guns other than this charge rifle they've looted this site that's entirely looted sorry can I climb this please no there we go goodness me I've got my mic and I'll start something I try actually best not to use the havoc even if it was knifed it's gone on here French what are you doing you're coming up how was it the floors at the corner already I just want a peek back into cover literally the worst Michael possibly of all time they won't even let me find that if there is probably a good thing didn't let me quote servants Tiffany animation and that's another thing because that's how hunk we were fighting oh I just keep backing it up I'll try to hold them off these pop these multi I have 10 shots with a wingman and a charged rifle and a 35 second full moment on my ability and there is another teammate just please be patient friend just let me go away let me loop some stuff hopefully these guys start fighting intro there we go there's some lanes going on I'm gonna I'm gonna loot these supply beans and I'm going to come back to you I faith in the plan French we can do it please give me a different gun just anything anything I'll take a Sentinel over the charge rifle note oK we've got some more bullets that's all we need I've got a wingman a naked wingman with no sight no heavy bag oh okay they want to pop a photo strongly don't get my boy back yes oh they weren't even up top they must be really close to me oh my word back it up haters least I've got terrible chills I want to get pinched a siani issue realize he was looting take that oh I knew he was looting I owed of stead in my shop for half a second flew out of the door wait I missed my first like seven shots horrendous sorry teammate this is up completely haven't you happen to watch this I suppose with the same logic I should also apologize to you guys as well so Pontius vet it's been an interesting game sometime for a probably of the wrong reasons I would assume and there is no nearby I don't have to go back on I Donovan I was trying to ping it on the map but I was you missed roofing lame around their scrapping I've nearly got my ultimate again just try and be annoying and get my boy back he's been waiting so long it's been so patience I assume there's a decent look here - oh good grief what a start I've got two kills from that imagine if I'd like an honor tonight as my second rate instead of the charge rifle I need shields from nothing I don't want thinking if you're not even on the map yet but just then you know that I don't really have too much loot pushing hey that's my child rifle put that down please he would pick that up it's not nearly as much as Pathfinder Prowler SMG here this is a regular cap package yes of course it is because the lifelong one didn't do that I'm a fall or what are we hoping for here like a care package weapon we've great because we're both struggling for weaponry um actually that's genius not genius that makes no sense it's useful extremely useful school piece there and of things keep that could not have gone much Parrish Lee thank you care package extremely useful look at these good stuff teens elites big scrap its charged rifleman dweeb machine man as he is more commonly known and there might be able to participate what there's a little bit far away so it's nice to get a look bit of an advantage point so you kill absolutely oinking just like you young to my child rifle it's not a shame you showed fly in here but I can't it's a terrible choice even though they're fighting each other I need an escape producers have readjust in the fire suppose Cooper I should be okay yeah sep 14 2014 deal with drill team man unfortunately they're all out in force today our we've got good shields though inventory's got a load of space I don't wanna have to drop stuff fast on be named up by a sniper I've got two kills out that actually not too shabby hey I can't see I don't know what I'm aiming only hit me a little bit but incoming care package I kind of kind of stupid I've kind of stupid by pushing okay sounds like it that's good nice you're shirtless both shirtless both absolutely Sheila's here in Seattle they get you on the back shooting me through the foliage apparently he's got a perm or Saipan I think we just try and get some high ground here weaseling down grapple there we go shine on his face didn't register it on his family because we should list you just telling this guy my tear was moving with me we need it to to be one that Portia I landed a woman's shop and went to my life you good it's gotta have a devil there in a second kind of my name that's why friends oh I tell you what though I'm surprised how much discipline I've got in my my graphic here usually I use it just to jump into the final straightaway and then immediately regret II and then sort of have to delight or 15 seconds and then and then try and get the hair can freak out of it that's usually how my engagements ago I have so many men kids good grief Oh God so many here I don't even know how to do half a eatables Oh someone lazy that did not draw here when we were in a fight that's my Oscar in that looks like a little person that Peters alright what we're hoping for what happens for God shields aren't incredible so it doesn't matter who don't get them a piece kit would be nice actually that's perfect it's pretty much the L star but better in every single way makes no sense not to take it to of the squad's left and we are there's no way you've made it yourself someone knows we're here happy to help friend that's quite all right I think someone's targeting me they still look like the same team who sees a separate team what's going on here we need to be careful not to over commits until we know where both teams are on pristine 62 for school peers a headshot 62 what have been a Christmas miracle imagine matter if the fat grain is perfect and it knock them both off the of a platform my word my wingman skins going crazy it's gone absolutely wild this little wingman skin I don't know if this is a good spot the buildings are still safe we could just go back over there mmm pretty means we'll get less of a chance of being shown a bathroom the lease is covered nearby like actual building cover if we needed it if these guys are Santa I wish I could rush you Brock Kahn's 15 seconds on my graphic and even then I have no escape the next half minutes I reckon the last scenes for your solo somewhere has to be there's no way they won't get involved in this that Minds my friend grey minds so sad it's also bad to miss metal grass let's explore it this way contact cement grapple upon this ok I got a kill I'm trying he died in the ring when there's literally no one there the man oh that's tremendous are the good news is we have one person there and there is and he's got his ultimate peace party probably all of these ultimate purpose here in a second which isn't good tres Oh like oh my god I can't believe we missed it you know teammate careful I cannot believe we just gave him this hybrid back I didn't mean to be we've lifted the high ground and it's a caustic it's been not end up there oh my word did you throw the trap nice good job by your friends it's going to contain pretty good idea for me my semester Peter can't fire but at the same time it's great to come down off that as well nice job to me we could have ended that so long ago if we didn't give him that high grain but I'll tell you what a win is a win especially with Pat Reuter at the moment the walking fridge freezer with a huge hit box Ling shots do the same amount of damage as a body shot a 35 second grapple to fair he's actually still playable I was a three thousand damage game apparently okay I did do a lot of poke down to the start and didn't really get too many kills for it and at the end I managed to go low to poke downs with the old wingman score Peter - yeah still playable you just got to walk around a lot more which is kind of sad because the reason you play path find is to grapple every way but I'll probably play McGann it's just you know a shadow of use for myself thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
