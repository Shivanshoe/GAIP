hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course we are playing some watson today and i didn't hop on intentionally to play watson i was trying to play someone else i think it was bloodhounds and in one of the games before these ones they were about to see someone else play bluetongue they picked them before i could and uh it put me on watson duty and it became so close to win i thought you know what i am going to play until they actually get a win and unfortunately it did take a little bit longer than anticipated but i hope you enjoyed nonetheless thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i am playing watson oh god i never remember the layout of this building for some reason i don't know why let me down i'll go through these ones i assume this better look a better loot up there but what does it mean not finding any dates and guns today it's been a recurring theme in my three and a half games that i've stabilizer played level two maybe a shooter nearby oh drama there's a shooter nearby where's the shooter oh found the sugars and they haven't shown anyone yet this is presumptuous i'll make sure they don't sneak up on us bring back uh what you call it uh what's it called when they take more damage i can't remember like wraith lifeline watson pathfinder they're all i can't remember i remember fortified but i don't remember the other one off the backboard charger bam [Applause] 45 seconds there's an underground what there's loot down here oh thank you teammate there's luke down here since what is this since when i didn't know this ultimate ready i have no light rains zero like baby wow don't do that i'm trying to shoot your teammate who's stuck in the oh careful here are a lot of full autos they near oh my god there's a guy up here and be careful nice job teammate i never want to use that again i never want to use it one times two times an hour night time ever again carefully perfect i'm on the way [Applause] yes how did you get him he must have just not been able to get inside the bubble i guess what played teammates a bit of a demon both teammates are playing real well and you got me with my one times two times r9 that's all i'm looking for here it's my only wish in this life is to replenish my light rains oh my god i can take i tell you what i'll take this i got this bam bam bam like this and if i see a vault i'll take it so i'm not using the l-star i don't care if i've never done an elsa obviously i don't care i've maybe done one but it was completely busted but even then i didn't like it i was just bad i'm terrible with the all-star and i don't know why i really can't tell you sad sad time actually low profile that's what it's called low profile i read your comments guys thank you i i do appreciate the comments here oh look at this get a package over there well let's say in france i'm surprised watson doesn't sound like that that's like saying in french 100 oh we got blue armor or digital threat oh oh okay repeater here i like that pop any single fire don't need that double tap nonsense oh you got to do this when you're playing watson i'm bam if anyone passes through here you'll know i've got no offenses left johnny contact with enemy oh someone's here they're sending a replicator down if you need it i think she's just excited about the replicator i can't blame you he's an exciting proposition with my 25 crafting mats i'm going to be a team player here craft a mobile respawn beacon just a moment i honestly i think mother respawn beacons are completely opie i think they're so busted and under-appreciated they're so good and heat shields are very very good very useful too but give me a second in a mobile respawn beacon just late game you just get to spawn them in it's a relative safety who's with the box he's back in the game you know hello you got a wingman on your wraith what is this 2009 okay i'm dead i'm dead i'm not dead i'm fine what the heck are these teammates or what i'm too good i'm too clean hello i played i don't care i don't even like the all-star i'll do that again they're coming darn it he let go quick enough [ __ ] him i need to bring myself up i'll be careful the stairs yeah yeah we're good that is a fuse third team oh he said i said i didn't know when did he type that everyone trying here twenty squads hold on like this not the best fence you've ever seen ice cream i assume you've seen their fences but i don't care whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what's going on here 126. this why is the scout so good i wasn't expecting to be able to go across that i'll be honest i hate this stupid gun i hate everything about it i hate it you guys okay i'll heal here so i can try and help possibly oh god no i have 20 bullets this is my fault because i took the l-star [Music] i'm judging my shield oh do a synchronized client guys do the synchronized climb technique they're not bad i did 25 i did not realize i had 2400 damage i'll be honest i thought i had about 312. sorry i was eating crisps i'm back there's some time to get in either eight oh okay you know what ebrade he's terrible need to recharge my shields teammates new things about this map there has been more people here though attention we gotta be careful why can't i put it there eyes are open though thanks teammate god sorry screwed enemies in that situation you've just got to help the teammate that's alive oh god just stopping off my shields yeah hold on let me help you i don't hear anyone else i think we might be okay i'm gonna get teammates banner try and get him in but yeah that's all i'm saying you know it's one thing trying to defend the guy that's getting first on the ground but if your teammate's getting shot at and he's your only team understanding up you just gotta help them you're gonna make a a split second decision please parkour without climbing on the way i don't have a full bone again extended heavy mag here level three you munger scrap over this way absolutely ginormous scrappage is occurring at a easterly 105 direction oh they're running let's take care behind this rock beginning ring countdown no he's not what's going on i'm not trying to play too aggressive the team on here look over here they're shook i'm not trying to die i'm stuck on a log might think it's just me what's the left as well i think maybe now oh we're dead oh it's so like this 14c all of a sudden we tried these are all the teams these are all the teams can't catch a break cannot catch a break the worst team is going to win but only one of them has more than 100 damage all right the mill how long are we going to say live here my guess is 15 seconds let's see he's taken fire gold helmet [Music] i defeated an adversary don't leave i'm coming heavy ammo okay it's a life although there's another team here because we've got bloodhound scanned and they were from this direction didn't it wasn't there like a vault here with like a purple energy what happened to that i thought i picked it up wasn't there a purple energy why am i misremembering what happened possibly any heavy i need heavy ammo i guess i'll take the blue patching myself doing that that'll do let's go let's go get him i spotted why can't i aim properly what's wrong with me who knows it's like you've done that before nice oh no no i could use that i've gone please be escaped please be escaped or any care package weapon i'll take i'll take any of them and just go back not bad i think it was crafting so maybe we want to chill out for a little bit here they might think it's safe to come back but what they don't know is that i am watson and i'm going to put a load of fences here like this look over here that seems like a terrible place to push from enemies guys jumping down he's not dead i guess they both just left didn't expect that to happen i thought for a second maybe uh maybe the wraith got that guy the uh the back oh there is heavy here i have seven batarinos which seems a bit excessive this guy's got no reason to come back now right he went this way this poor guy that sucks he can't even come back with banners or anything someone's fighting prowlers to be honest with you i just want a win at this point i want to win one thing my generator can't protect me from is prowlers imagine if that imagine if they counted us a projectile when they were flying through the air there's a guy trying to stop fighting us right in the back they're all down there though oh that covers blown [Music] yes yes there was oh my god no imagine good job team imagine i refuse to ever go down to one of them honestly it can never happen it's too embarrassing i knew i heard someone behind and instead of popping a bat after doing that rock climbing i decided to look over and with no chills and be like wait is he over here or not and he was and he shot me like what did i expect oh my gosh darn fall oh we need to go we need to leave baby let's go i'm so stupid and also why did i shoot the pathfinder when i broken i don't know who it was what sort of something he could have got banners if uh if his teammates didn't leave he'd been fine actually i need a bit of heavy i need a heavy ammo oh oh another team another team seems like a bit of a waste to be honest this is a bit of a waste to me too this way let's go don't get caught in the zone let's just back up we can't let's not fight through that choke points let's go this way oh my god it's lan ibrahimovic that is crazy that team's dead he was just a duo we need to get on top of this building i think i've spotted an enemy nice job team zero p oh my god zlatan rage quit zlatan you can't rage quit like that your team needed you i'm not really sure what you could have done on the ground but they need hey hey stop it gg amigos apex champions that works because we got the high ground first and i hit the rate for like 140 something when she's climbing up you know what played guys i played hey we've got a win on this game i haven't won for like three weeks i think it's been a long time ggs
