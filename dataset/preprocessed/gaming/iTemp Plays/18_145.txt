hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the re45 which i already think is slightly underrated in its current form like of course it's not an r99 or a volt or prowler but it isn't that far beneath them in my opinion if you are right up close and personal with people it is so easy to track them with this gun as you'll see in the gameplay that i have for you today i'm doing 120 damage sprays without even an extended bag on the weapon and according to gamespot the re45 is actually getting hammer point rounds in season 12 which i can't really wrap my head around because usually hammer point rounds are for the p2020 or the mozambique single shot slow firing weapons it's going to be really weird to have hammer points on an re45 i reckon this is going to be as big as the disrupt around uh introduction that we had i think it was season two or season three it was astronomical that hop up it was it was crazy i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends there's no way you've done this what's up there's no
