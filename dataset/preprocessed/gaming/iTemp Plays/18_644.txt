hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing with benny once again we even do a little cut to his perspective for a little while and uh these two games that i have for you today just go to show where i see a lot of kings canyon slander on the timeline lately it is just one big third party i mean the end of the game on king's canyon it is always just every team turning up to one location which can be incredibly fun do not get me wrong but you guys know uh that you can very rarely get a straight squad v squad fight on this map and that is why so many people hang back and and they just snipe you with triple takes now that's what i've come to realize that is the new triple take man tactic they will just go to the third party but they'll stay three minutes back taking your head clean off but yeah thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah i'm gonna go for left to cancel that attention oh i wouldn't get it i didn't get a gun yeah that's the problem surprise are you good babe right on you there's one it doesn't have that much ammo so bring it to me yeah yeah come back go this way honestly i'm just yes i'll execute him i'll go like oh you got me too yeah you're good give me your gun scumbag i hear them yeah i'm nice we're inside richard i've got shield tails i've got shield styles if you need something okay there you go thanks mate they just they're just here how has he killed me there that might have been the old uh just keep keep coming back i need to use this shield just keep just keep going keep going i can't believe i don't get how i didn't kill but he killed me i was around the corner it might have been the nade no i didn't get hit by a lane it was like a stray bullet right they might push they'll hear the res only two of them remember well played rich well played well good mate there we go we bopped him got g7 there it's level up your shields too yeah actually i feel like that i reckon they killed him and then went through that tunnel [Music] could land in the trees oh yeah there they are red man red man half man half red [Music] oh emergency down fight wasn't what i wanted but it helps yes team where did raymond go we're getting popped 240 they actually find a different team i think maybe i'm getting i'm getting involved i'm just gonna pop this dance party actually really helped dance party's outrageously good uh they've got major high ground on us yeah we just need to flank right i need something he's gonna try and ping this one i'm just gonna long range distance capabilities yeah i've got a g7 let's get close and then we can wrap around i'd love to get the high ground on them are they popping that or they're popping our team out i think yeah he's getting some shots in they're shooting the turtle missing everything i literally missed every shot these flat lines got horizontal that guy's down it's so weak that sky's green he's untouchable all right let's go rich let's go he used his dummy thing but then he all stood around he's of the dummies so i could see things just landed i'm nice nice nice big plays from you there rich you two mate they were like kind of weak mate oh i think there's going to be a couple of people over here i needed like a med kit for some case uh i'm gonna take these two times i'll give it a go unless i was hearing my dance party now that don't make any noise down this hole then feel like i definitely heard one yeah you're right they're ready for us i'm turning around snipers i can't contest that yeah i know there's a power i'm not even going to throw my knees actually kind of point wait i've got a scout i can probably just head glitch peak high but they are sliding careful let them throw their names burn their stuff yeah yeah i'm not even throwing mine pointless keeping on our back and then hopefully they're the ones that get sandwiched it's like a 50 50. they backed up only two of the squads left i might just back up wrap around to a bear angle this is just bad do you want us to hold this then can you see that can you see them still they're not there still i'm not sure if it's waiting for my saying mate no i feel like they backed up i feel like they might have just gone for the wrap around themselves i'm you know what i'm going for the uh supply drop i want a crater they're all in there all right yeah i'm going i'm going to wrap around to the right and go for that supply drop i just i don't know why i just really want to use the crater i need 50 damage from my thing so i might just turn this into a single phone try and get a few shots on these guys i fell down all right here we go here we go here we go are you ready for the the lucky roll what do you reckon craig or r909 probably only nine i reckon i just can't believe they've run off this far oh oh there we go oh it's going i think this is a long range fight it sounds it i can hear snipers oh yeah there's one all right they're not going to see us i don't think we're in between two if we go this way then i think he just walks straight into your fire mate uh someone did just here behind you careful kept careful pushing that oh no i met that there's a guy beneath you if you can shoot this guy rich that one on me one yeah i can finish this guy for us i'm gonna climb up top i'll come with you give me that have you got a name no i have no names why am i doing this do you want me to push him from the bottom i don't know where he is going up the stairs now coming upstairs now i saw him at the last second i'm down oh my god they i don't think no i'm down they're gonna hear this race hold on so i've got full shield i died to the gas yeah i'll heal you and now i think i've got my alt as well i'm gonna go up top maybe i'm just up in this you can climb i'm making a move we need to get ahead of them once cooking still yeah no i'm sorry teammate that's another one all right we got this i'm healing ben he can cover if you can i see i'm healing i'm healing healing nice rich i'm just popping out quickly i'm gonna pop my um i'm popping my arm i'm off in the phoenix this guy's okay last guy last guy yeah i think for 13 to 1v1 he's coming on your right he's reviving surviving down there just push him i know you can't you can't you can't you have to play aggro though i don't believe it yama switched no we've got one hand left he had one hp left i don't believe it he had one hp oh i got that is wow [Music] [Applause] what what do you know that's green that people don't like broccoli it's good for you you don't really like what's good for you grass no who hates grass maybe they're allergic you think of that did you yeah i know i that was my instant reaction but still i i think they probably like i tell you whoever has an instant reaction to grass people are allergic mate that is very insensitive of you i'm so sorry it's like the freshly cut grass it needs a public apology is that airborne if you're like you know when someone cuts like a load of grass yes would that irritate them i'm honestly not sure because that's that's that's just like a chemical that grass releases right to tell all the other grass that it's like dangerous something i don't know why they taste is that effect because that's actually true i don't know the grass smell yeah and then what they do is they get up and run away obviously wait do they warn all their friends we're getting cut i'm not really sure what the point of that is because it's not what they can retreat so maybe they just fold over so they i don't know they don't get caught nice smell of freshly cut grass i'm gonna think about that next time i'm like oh no they're all screaming at each other that's just the yeah you know they say that some animals can smell fear we can as well congrats i feel like there can't be a scrap going on without us getting involved oh of course not and also we're going to be the delicious third party that just right oh i have no fear guys i've got no body armor at all they've just finished the fight they're part of like they for paradise last game no mercy do you see them i'm just gone upstairs and one's in your building i think oh there's there's armor up here as well if you need it yeah i'll go grab that because that's my worry right now one's got her player here all right i'm going around either side wait did he just drop his arm yeah i'm switched wait he did that so we didn't get the plane no no no he just arm switched he's got purple he'll have purple on the floor yeah no i picked it up and it had no help oh yeah because he drops it oh wait there's a reasonable right behind us he didn't need to try out players but i honestly thought he just tried to be like all right you've killed me but you're not getting my armor where is this fight just there on the right hand side oh yeah my audio is like oh god no that really went very badly uh yeah he could have done if he had an arcstar just like dunk goodbye hey like that mate mate where is this where is this yeah like i'm on you're wearing the headset the wrong way around no i've done that time wait mine is sort of glitched wait he wasn't in all the way he wasn't in all the way there we go i wasn't like mono so it's like all the audio is playing through like the same i've done before oh they're right on me i might need you to go through this thing you're going towards me yeah i'm pincing are you ready for me dance party there's two red dummies i've been absolutely baited i've done about 4 000 damage there we go let's go hey i don't know what you're on about i definitely did all the damage then oh where's that coming from oh yeah over there are you gonna fight them or you're gonna go to the blue light no we're gonna get a crater and then we're gonna shoot them in the face sounds good to me i'm gonna try and farm them for damage because i want to get red if i can wait where's the blue light gone someone there no it's just the other thing came down oh well i guess we better go kill these guys are you ready i'm gonna stick him i'm gonna stick him ye [Music] let's oh team's dead i don't know what i'm doing really you're just interested in here i appreciate the backpack good night i'll try and get behind them he's just seen you i think risky from me boy two people i picked shots down hit one for 18. retreat i'm good mate oh my god i literally just go oh you got what did you get i got the dummies i'm just losing oh i mean healing yeah yeah nice i'm doing that they're getting shot in the back mate we can get involved back up with me [Music] gg i feel like we uh cheesed that a little bit literally every team decided to fight at the top of this hill they it was you know that was the hill they decided to play on their flag all we could do is turn up and fight yeah i i feel like i do a lot of damage for every kill that i get yeah actually no that one was even that one was pretty it was pretty even yeah like 200 damage per kill is pretty much standard anything more than 200 i think like they're like backing up annealing or you're getting assistance
