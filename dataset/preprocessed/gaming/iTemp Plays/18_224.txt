hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing watson we all know boston got like eight buffs in season 11 but i don't think we got to see her full potential on storm points because most of the points of interest are outside there aren't too many buildings especially when you compare it to world's edge i was going to say king's canyon king's canyon as well a little bit but mainly was edge and mainly scrapital city now the game that i have for you today i dropped a ton of damage and i got a ton of kills but i didn't actually use my abilities to the utmost potential and that's what actually what i appreciate about boston's kit is that it takes some practice it takes some getting used to there is a skill cap to watson's kit and i'm nowhere near the top so i'm going to keep trying to play keep improving but this was a great game to have i'm sure you guys will enjoy it thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh the dead slade we're here in scraping i'm playing watson someone that i've wanted to play onwards edge for a while man because of her recent buffs uh in my opinion she doesn't work too well oh i should have i should have went for that whatever i can always oh here we go i know i'd be rewarded if i just came to old broken rsmg i might be the worst car smg player in the game like i don't even think it's close definitely the worst but i can give it a go i wonder so bad i'm doing it oh that's a lot of that's a lot of bullets i need energy ammo i think we go to this graph we've got good armor i mean i've got good weapons like my teammates do as well please get involved here i think if you're thinking all right this is what the insta pop whilst my teammates come over look huge make it through oh my god and then just go as far as i can so they can't hop over this part because the amount of times i hop over this particular part here just hop off the top i got a kill crate for that tremendous where'd she go that's gonna put down as many fences as humanly possible i have none on call though off call down even one minute lang's close by this place is just crazy for people that just do this they have two bullets left i'm sure they're not too disappointed we got a crafter over there i got two fences back already i think we just go over this way i'm pretty sure this is where the scraps are happening i would love to craft a bat but if i stop to craft a battery everyone's gonna be dead we just have to go all the bridges on looted this is not limited there we go not sure that last fence is actually going to do anything but maybe i'll throw it down as connects all the dots oh here we go 950 sorry guy sorry you're the to pathfinder very awesome i am using your ultimate right in front of your face this is going pretty well actually like get my kill on the path well there we go i did now that nade did 150 damage i think the 50 was on some of those down but still hey i got five kills i'm not the kill leader who is this guy uh i think we clear capital there we go there's always someone coming in late i can't see you i see where the bullets are coming from ow yeah yeah yeah i have 12 shield cells i'm good someone's up there already this isn't good nice teammate good trade didn't quite get the knock there we go but just the trade backing damage there was perfect no that's about as much shields as i had to begin with it's low brow here there we go that's another team give me your two times and give me your needs that's not going to destroy my fences who even was this guy where did that come from oh yeah i mean it can't have been them though surely we all have to move that building's kind of safe in the corner they're shooting but it's probably my fences they're destroying uh it doesn't seem worth pushing to be honest i think we just leave them try and maybe get ahead of them if they don't see us i mean would they ever write my fences wait who you who you fragging guy they're gonna have to move i really don't fancy pushing half a building and i say half a building because usually if you push up there at least you have like three dogs to work with i have all the bullets in the world here it's the same shoes right now beyond one here i'm 100 gonna die i'm trying to dodge how have i survived i'll scott that he ran into the ring with no health nice team wasn't really a fight we needed to take but we got him uh we got two minutes we've got a choice here we can either run straight down to harvester or we go and take the risky option and run thanks guy thank you okay never mind our decision's been made for us where's he off to where's he off to oh there's a few of them what's going on why are they in the zone come off free kill freak now the launcher needed us close to me that's the problem i can't see i think we just i think honestly i think we go maybe not we got we got 55 seconds to work with none of us have any movement isn't very close 45 seconds and this zone is gonna be quick yeah i think we move i have no med kits either my four syringes no phoenix kits oh no oh wait they're there close i don't want to get caught in this zone i really don't want to die in the zone i'm gonna have to type in a second hold on i have i have zero medications this is a mess i've gotta i've gotta go let's go that way panic typing they are trying to come behind us these guys have been running in the zone for so long i don't understand how they were in the zone for that long crazy i've got to get safe there's a box there could have a med kit in there potentially i wish i didn't jump down the mountain med kit no neck it's actually a good amount of stuff though there's this team and then two other guys two of the teams even i see an enemy so we're not missing out too much they're just crafting more med kits who is this team they must have landed climatizer or something yes there's an enemy here too oh god now i'm just thirsty where's the guy that's the guy killed earlier on i think so bam so the team's trying to get involved i've actually took the balloon and now they bumped into another team all right give my right back i'm popping a phoenix i that was a sloppy fight that's uh someone i killed earlier on i swear i killed that guy at train right there unless everyone in this server is called johnny i killed three john is this game weirdly enough all right these last two teams and they're actually firing each other this is what we're doing oh sorry guys look how fast these look how quick he is though we can't we can't match this pace it's too quick i'm walking he's here destroy him was that nash ultimate not sure what that noise was yes i got a knock i assume in the lava oh god this other team's getting involved though did that guy i was the crypto that i downed earlier i thought he was going to die in the lava he crawled off and got a revive because of this team that's slightly unlucky i need to loot this guy stuff hopefully quick yeah no light oh god i don't think i should have come down this way to be honest we just go this way he'll be able to rotate if he needs to this guy's a crabber unfortunately this isn't the greatest spot for me to utilize my we need to commit to a team here we're just so split we're split and pinched but i think he might be two solos or i mean that means he's over here sitting in a drone so not anymore i didn't see him no okay i say no please where was my slide we're the worst organized team of all time friends i mean down on this guy as well what the heck was he doing he impeded himself so it also lost the shield i mean it was a it was a good effort you know he was trying to problem solve on the go but i'm not sure it was the right play now what happened to the last team oh they've respawned oh gosh the longest game of all time i remember the last time the game went to like this said 95 that what you're here for what's the 95 me so many kills he's on hello all right step friends to winning good job target over there oh yes nice gg amiga amigos my typing today is absolutely under horrendous how much damage is that as watson 3.2 i think apex champions nice game nice game kind of difficult for me to use my fancies there at the end 3.4 with 14 kills i tell you what i'll take it what an absolute performance here on watson what a performance you can rely on your fences so much more now with the buffs as well it's great gg is all round
