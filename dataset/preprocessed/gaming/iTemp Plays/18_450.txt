to help that was we yeah that was just unfortunate we just all got separated really quickly i'm ready i mean i'm kind of kind of throwing already because i'm using mirage not to put the pressure on but when me zeus and i10 played we won like nine games in a row just saying well what lobbies are those in there don't put that around me iron and we won a game of like pred i had like no comedy we got stuck into a crowd yeah not to put the pressure on so far i'm just saying like nine in a row so you're wait where in the hell i don't i'm on autopilot right now i'm gonna be honest i see you bro i shouldn't be jump master when i'm streaming now this is like i can't multitask i'm running right here oh there's actually a lot of teams coming here and i scuff my drop so i'm turning back hopefully nobody landed turbine what kind of jump master was this all right you know what let's be honest it's your guy's fault for allowing me to be john master all i'm going to say is there's a there's a team

back of his brain that he constantly just throws out randomly and then he shows me the origin of like these quotes and it's so weird jake's like that i don't know how to do i don't know how he finds me bro he you like pulled a news clip from a tweet from 2009 and he'd be like this is the funniest clip i've ever seen 2009. how did you even find that on twitter it's been it's been 15 years but this clip is still stuck in his head and he just can't go there's no way this guy is actually hitting me with that enough 26. i mean that push is just terrible yeah we're not doing it no i'm here for 26. get over there we're like aimlessly walking around in the middle of everything opening pills like what am i doing we're just the most casual ranked gamers ever no kidding dude you guys are doing no damage you gotta roll bro you got a ride i need to shoot somebody there's a guy up top okay oh never mind i'll take it back this is i did a lot of damage i need to back up so far he's in there oh yeah

him 35 the ego on the them 26 26. okay watch the rope anybody leaving your teammates are going to go with them his teammates are going to go with them watch the rope we could just rush this guy running back now they're they're running this way they're running right okay really yep please solo then this team in the uh behind me is so annoying where did these rolls are go they're not uh they they went this way they went this way somewhere somewhere we must not let him get away with his crimes oh no his team landed right there oh i'm coming home i wouldn't do it i would go back okay listen

glad i got some kp i have two bats which is pretty good i think it's fine i have volume i'll take it i'll take it one more minute uh if you guys can make it to me i can pat us in the zone i think

close proximity do you want me to get it at best fighting zone does team fit if he wants this team is this thing's we have to fight them now while we have time i set one up there i'm grabbing this prowler nice we don't have to fight them yet but we're probably gonna have to fight them right i now we can go into energy bro we can go into energy we know there's only going to be one team team engine team behind the team behind us come we can play the left side here we can play this outside here nevermind safely okay you're close walking the door i'm blocking this door not letting him in
