hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are in flashpoint it's the returning game mode that we had before on king's canyon and now we are playing it on olympus if you've never played this mode before there are no healer boards you can craft a phoenix kit if you're being cheeky but for the most part there are no healables on this game mode the only way that you can heal is finding the flash point like domes and then you passively heal inside them and it's just carnage we had a game earlier on we won it in seven minutes the fights are ludicrous it's actually so much fun when it goes your way hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends
