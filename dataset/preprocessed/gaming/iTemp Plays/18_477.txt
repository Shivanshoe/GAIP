thank you to ea for sponsoring today's video hey what's up guys it's welcome back to another video today we're playing some more apex legends of course and i wanted to talk to you guys about the chaos theory update that happened yesterday because the update is huge and it's brought a lot to the game now first of all the new area caustic treatment this place is amazing it replaces water treatment on the south side of king's canyon and brings a breath of fresh air to this side of the map the fights in here are brutal largely because of the walkways with the toxin underneath and you can actually drain these toxins to reveal the legendary loot there so if you're brave enough to land here you could be walking away with all four pieces of legendary loot setting you up for the rest of the game only if you survive though next up we have bangalore's heirloom which i did a video on last night it is clean it is sleek the animations are amazing there is something about running around with an heirloom that makes you feel more powerful more in control and i'm not sure what it is i love that when you are crouched bangalore crosses our arms just looks so menacing the games change a lot now too because of the new ring fury escalation takeover which periodically brings isolated parts of the ring to what would usually be the safe zone cutting off escape routes forcing enemies into tight corridors you have to adapt on the fly to survive and that is where this new item comes in as well now you'll see in the game that i have for you today we have to use plenty of the new heat shield items to survive a late game of gunfight now you heal and revive faster in the heat shields but only if it's protecting you from the ring so you can't throw this down in a safe zone and benefit from a sub three second battery for example along with all these changes comes so many updates to the legends and weapons on apex legends and the one that we are focusing on today is pathfinder my old main my favorite legend he's been updated to take reduced damage thanks to the removal of his low-profile debuff he is back to his former glory and he is so fun to play once more now there are plenty of other changes to legends and weapons so make sure you're still to the channel to watch my videos on those coming soon i hope you enjoyed today's video showcasing the new item takeover and also the return of my old mate pathfinder thank you once more to ea for sponsoring today's video and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends landing right here oh good yes at you taken down my god someone else took me that's not good no it's not i'm gonna close you at least here is that okay i'm gonna help you clear this team inside is showing that might be them i don't know we'll see i need to decipher my g7 desperately oh there's a purple mag in that box and there's a two timer oh thank you oh mag but that was a heavy one give me a second recharging shield that's what you meant wait what did i say he said there's a purple mag there was a purple yeah it was a heavy one is that what you meant yeah oh okay yeah yeah well what's happening what's that because i said i had a g7 so i thought you oh you know sorry that was poor timing okay hey yay that's my favorite thing to do no oh no starting again i don't know ah that's pretty bad i can't lie that's pretty awful i think once one person does it they're like i'm doing it that's nice it's like you know it's like when somebody honks their horn everybody just starts talking it's like oh yeah you want to be annoyed this way let's go this way i'm so sorry i missed three massive shots octane's really weak though i i saw panicked it's fine said i was with you i wasn't really with you oh my god there's somebody in here ladies [Music] i don't know i think that pathfinder thought that it was a gimme bubble oh and he wasn't firing or something right he was just like adsing and just staring at me and he wasn't shooting i think he thought it was a gimme ball it does look like one it does 100 percent i turned and i was like wait this pathfinder is not shooting me when you live what a great guy oh he's very honorable you have to be looking at him doesn't shoot anyone in the map this guy that's a very very honorable man going from a no mag to a gold mag is one of life's greatest pleasures oh that's the dream oh you're dead okay do you want to hear some crap the race is like really weak i'll tell you after that no no the race is really weak behind that box it might just be that one she are facebook i don't see a teammate i mean she's not healing she's just zooming sorry to ask you for syringes again but you have this one uh yeah i do wait she's right here hold up uh yeah three so my controller keeps darting to the left a little bit like it's broken mm-hmm and i'm like i ads to her and she went behind the beam went to the left and it darted to the left and it like basically locked onto it look honestly yeah you're making excuses okay for when you post this video in the future and when people accuse you yeah yeah packing just preemptively making the excuses ah you'll see just jump to the left it's weird idiots like whoa my gun just annihilated this guy it wasn't me i swear to god where's my recoil it's like i forgot to cody for me that's funny i know that bomb is just pretending that i didn't know gotta hide the wall hacks right yeah yeah absolutely i don't know but i need to stab somebody in game get this guy yes that is the worst feeling ever i feel so bad he might turn the game off for a little bit it's not his fault really it's really not they shouldn't have put out an heirloom those this cool fun it's actually amazing this is the most satisfying heirloom to hit people's lives by far it's just plain three yeah people were complaining that it was like uh it was too it was like too small i guess and like a little bit basic but i don't understand clean about it i mean i love uh minimalism so i think it's sick yeah my favorite heirlooms uh banggood is a good one like bloodhounds is really good because it's like an axe just realistically yeah bangalore is good i love race too yeah everybody's good doesn't sound very excited right i don't believe it i mean it's been it's been around for so long might be something good classic though what do you mean that's terrible you like classics or what rich i like one times classics that's it i see that's the class it's behind that rock right where we're going yeah yeah yeah that's perfect something good this way i kind of am it's crazy oh my god this dude has a digi on the spitfire i'm going to grab him that was such a massive yeast they just don't even care about you they didn't see me i don't have any bats so i am
