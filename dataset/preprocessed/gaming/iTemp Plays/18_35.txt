hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i dropped my most amount of damage so far in season 13. just shy of 4600. i was using a 30 30 with a three times and the last time i used this setup i also dropped a ton of damage it's the damage farming machine this game is full of drama it goes right down to the final zone i'm sure you guys will enjoy it thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends right big fan i'm a big fan of this big fan especially this inner ring here actually got a decent amount of loot i'm not pk i'm like three times shotgun bolt i'm gonna do it i'm gonna use the 30 30. i missed the scout so i'm going to use this gun all right i think we just goes to the firing and then because he's kind of busted at the moment every single ship comes from the same place so everyone just hops out of the exact same place fight night power grid and if you're not involved within the first sort of minute and a half you're going to get no kills that's how olympus is at the moment it's a bit weird hello having a shield are we this gun he's busted more enemies no it's not busted it's just good it's underwriting underappreciated so i need to kill you before the team comes over if he saw what i did to the revenant he wouldn't have challenged like that he would have been terrified he'd been grappling to king's canyon if he saw what i did no that was my shotgun ammo giving my shields a recharge if we rotate it look like he scanned someone that was weird let's uh let's rotate to fight night can we get the heck and freak out of here that's a good thing though it's fine at the reef thing but i hate fighting there i don't know it's it's such a weird place that rift the void thing i don't know doesn't feel like apex i can't land on him death sentence my new role is to never challenge when i'm scanned it's never worth it that was a really bad grenade that was top three worst grenade throws of the 21st century and i'd like to apologize is get my name back i've got a second chance with your nade contact with target that's not fair i was gonna sniper stock challenge me again i've got the boys here oh that was the last one okay well i feel bad now and he's using a bow i've been seeing the bow so much recently people are loving the bow which is really annoying because i'm mouse and keyboard at range you throw like a people aren't missing and it's annoying i'm terrible with it can we push this i mean they're gonna have to come this way anyway right the scrap gun on a docks another cheeky peek oh there we go yeah they're not going this way we need to go around this way we can cut them off they're probably going to come out around here let's explore this way i do i wasn't going to push then i thought well i can only hear one charge rifle so by the time we get there they're still going to be fighting and then it turned out to be a complete waste of everyone's time so making contact my apologies my control is really annoying i'm really trying not to talk about it but it keeps jolting are they gonna are they gonna go all the way around they're not going this way oh purple there amigo look at that that's a double check it wasn't shack caps my least favorite thing on the game terrible you suck i'm real bad show you down friend get him out of it oh good grace giving my shields a recharge recharging i'm gonna have nights the second team my teammates are gonna get shot by these guys if i don't help bo burnham he's back what did i tell you about the bow i'm telling you like people are so good with the bow neck i i don't know when that happened it was i thought it was a bad weapon but apparently not apparently everyone's really good with this weapon apart from me i suck i stuck with a bow check team i don't think so i remember a valkyrie being on the team this is a fresh squadron messed him up it's just you and me friend let's try and cover the bloodhound if he comes this way let's come to me we're fine i'm trying to sneak up a little bit okay teammate could have easily just walked to me be honest this is such a bad push i don't know what to do yeah i know but you've died in the worst position of all time he managed to get even closer to the enemies and further away from me so i couldn't even cover him when he was getting looted or anything yeah just leave that's fine whatever unbelievable i don't know what kind of i don't know where the strategy was there there was no strategy we can just sit in the zone three kills let's go this way i know there's a i know there's one closer here but they're fighting on it and no i'll die we will die a horrible death all right 30 30 has been putting some work there are still 13 people left luckily it's not far it's your butt level three shotgun ball okay okay it's very tempting to use my ultimate my control is a complete mess skipping everywhere man this is like two weeks old i was having control of problems before i ordered a new one and a new wire and this one's got different problems honestly 30 seconds well i can't even always talk about it cancel that i'll get the ultimate you know but then it just means that other people can rush you quick so it's kind of pointless it's a bit of a bait because we weren't going to push off it but it would be nice might be enough to first thing with the grenade and stuff you know and they're too far away that's what the team i'm getting out of here the crypto he's just sat in the drone it's a 2v2 i've absolutely destroyed them but against china back yeah we're good people in the center i have 65 crafting mats i could make three bats please don't cry to me although it won't even kill me man they nerfed it which i'm happy about because i sucked with the crater so that's fine fine by me you go amigo free of charge uh battery here five three that's fine if we can third these we can loot them as well then we'll be looted mcrooted as they say many people have said that horizon has escaped death once again not you again it was a good attempt i farmed an 8k damage game off this one horizon there's no way they have many shield bats left mind you they do just kill a team over there wrong way guys probably running straight into us like this i'm not going to allow it your big drone now you can see me shooting this horizon hates me with with a burning passion that's that crypto got a gold helmet how is he getting so many drones we should go this way recharging shields i wanted to sneak around the side here oh my god play that idiot i don't know if i can make it to me i thought she was looking at me i might be able to get to you they're popping a respawn that's probably the team i killed probably the course the car that's why the caustic guy killed in the zone don't push me you left a guy back here did you i don't know i'm here if i pop a bass it makes too much noise i can't respawn teammates so it's not worth going for banner yes i'm inside the next ring i am repairing myself i need bats oops it's trying to get all the way up top easy another kill for team 10 patron he's too far the zone is knee i don't have heat shields and enough healer balls i need help oh that sucks why'd it kick me off oh you probably can't go up there anyway right i think they fixed it just trying to be annoying only one minute until the ring closes luckily it's not far what are you doing he's glitched out i feel bad but at the same time i don't care i'm a solo i killed the enemy okay i don't think they're gonna look at this gimme stuff mate oh that that feels bad for him for me i don't get i should have landed more than one shot but i guess it doesn't really matter that much i never would have killed him i think this is there's two beneath me because that was the octane's team the horizon there horizon corsic on that team caustic valk on this team i think just 2v2 v1 i think that's a team of two back there it could be a team of three so i don't really want i don't want to mess this team up too much i still want these guys to fight but i can't not shoot them i want 4000 damage i've already got the badge but it's still nice to get a 4k game it's not worthy i only need uh three times 330 might not be the best option here i got shot from the window i think no don't come up here why does that not why does that not count to horizontal i should be able to grapple out of out of the here i might have actually it might be smarter to let them revive but now i guess i've got i've got armor switches just 10 seconds tick tock says the clock okay i need to get back to the armor because they're just going to use it as an arm switch now no stop looking at the windows how long are you going to sit up there for you need to go okay flat lines busted first this guy again another arm switch oh i had no bullets maybe i should have thirsted that guy oh those don't even get him did i grapple him out of the zone all i needed was one more shotgun shell that's all i needed how much damage did i have i did 4 600 damage the bloodhound went on a solo mission didn't get a single kill there are so many things watching this back that are annoying if the horizon didn't have a gold knockdown i'd have won that game because i wouldn't have had to you know use my shotgun shells mind you i could have distorted the horizon with the 30 30 and saved the shotgun shells i could have picked up more shotgun shells why did i grapple the corsic back out of the zone he was literally in the zone and i've saved his life just to give him a high five i didn't even punch him if he wasn't fortified and took 15 reduced damage i win that game there are so many things that could have won me that game i am unlucky but it is my fault because i didn't loot any shocking ammo and i didn't keep an eye on it it was still a good game all right i'm so happy with it 4 600. come on that was a good game
