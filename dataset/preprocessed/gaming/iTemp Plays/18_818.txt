it's the big fiery pile of doom oh nice my friends it's been a little while since I've landed here I don't think we're gonna get contested because this is one of the last drops you forget there's a bit of a mix-up with thee there you go I've with the jumpmaster allocation I think we gave it up about 15 times me included flatline g7 scale I'll make this is what used to be one of my favorite jobs isn't all nights lying here if anyone I could keep this third at for the rest the game father - it's technically two assault rifles of one of them he's good at medium range and close range near the one it's good at medium and long range so I think it is it is indeed and my friends are sprat from the distance stars are not still scrapping the tray looks like it could be unlooted nevermind Tom it's my gold armor oh it's my gold arm my gold off real one [Music] I need a cyclist g7 otherwise I'm fairly ineffective sorry friends oh yeah let me finish the kill looking for a sight I'll take anything at this point was he there the whole time or my I can't think I'm not going there I could hear him extremely close and he took me that long to see him train the train stopped I'm pretty sure it was unloaded but I couldn't really see maybe he came from the Train I'm not sure oh he's running off to the scrapper yeah he is a scrap died down there I'm still willing to come over copy that I mean this one supplied me if they you pinged at one time stage cod I guess he needed it never mind I still got the fun line I should be fine oh they brought three great guys Gibraltar tonight any scrap sank like she's not even firing it and other people are still firing that means there are two of the squad set this is good news I'm gonna talk to her bolt I'll come up now you're talking try and lock sure that's gonna do usually they do absolutely nothing never mind 105 damage advice damn nice I swear the guy did 105 damage d you got stuck with my friend it's been a while since I'm gonna have to say that absolutely sticker so that's that they are different squads because this guy no way that he would have a Christian in the corner bless him with I had no choice I can't blame you I need a few more than just a few shield cells our phone enough batteries are the teammates are too nice that's the problem here we go perfect you sure when you say I need shield to you get either no response or one or two shield cells come take your battery friend I've got three of them I'm sure you got enough my perfect two times bruiser and thank you and level two extended mag for the g7 I'm sorry I level 1-x a mag it pretty much easy level to xn in Mikey gives you five extra bullets gives you 50% extra that's impeccable I'll be annoyed if that was a level three cinema that would still make sense to me what you gain from this care package rent mold shields we have level three body shielded of our minds are we okay oh there's a decent chance that we have the flute pop P here the vault okay I can never say properly but I don't even know what to call it I can never pronounce that word properly thought I will say vault wait is that right I'm idiot I know I'm saying but we potentially have to keep because those guys definitely were fighting at Mirage oh it's open that's devastating news there we go you can probably see it for yourself my name that's that close they were that's in the wrong gun I believe my teammates I reckon they've landed a few shots in I'm going in for the kill I think there are a few friends double tap ease the double tap he's not big enough T and it didn't need nothing but good grief that was awful surprising I was here hey thank you very much a pre-check where is his teammate this is the last parting let me get it let me get Miss East are two of them I'll take I've got to them and I've got myself a goal knocked down and I've realized that I should never use double tap ever again I'm going to leave you my gun but I'm gonna leave you off and the reason I'm doing that is because if I pick up another one it automatically puts the gun on daughter and I never use it again the time between shots he's not worth it at all thank you are we making a detour fleas care package are we going to scrap that I heard in the distance these guys have definite look at him look at him what all on the same page I love this they hear gunshots and it is since their you know what they're saying they're saying there's a scrap in the distance that is literally what they're saying right now and they're off kill hungry blood blood thirsty I appreciate these teammates we've just got to get the hair King freaking volte unfortunate that it sounds like the scraps on hold the herd is coming like a rampaging elephants poor guy I mean what can you do in that situation what can he do these teammates gunned down here here and he had one teammate and then he has to try and 1v3 I mean I have been in that situation so many times so many times and it's not good it's not a good situation to be in this is a breath of fresh air though playing with teammates the flame lease aggressive they want to get involved hey friend what's that pay like a pair of decorative gargoyles look at us we were thought huh I will say it's very tempting to push you off this building though that's a scrap its triple time man listen to the response I got from that Pingree report said okay and Ray said copy that and roll Stampede and over again this is beautiful this is like been a different game gonna kill race I'm surprised I'm co-leader there we go fandom you over there the hard ground this way is long way I've done about 3,000 damage their teammates they are dead to rights that shirtless in Seattle they're being third perfect someone's just done walking I'm pretty sure these are more people that you Officer of the century I don't mind I'm fine with that I'll just need ten damaged or someone I think I've been 12 the torch approach that was sprinting for the post it's still making me laugh I could almost hear his internal screaming as he was running for that portal all right two squats left I have seven kills all I want is double digits if I can make double digits I'll be happy like I'm excited then I saw it was gold time I've been doing some gold armor number-wise this is gonna have a gob army charged rifleman leave machine man where are you yeah this guns fair yeah yeah to balanced weapon well you'll take know of ice I'm gonna Missy I'm missing my shots I know I know how to play the reason I took that is because I knew there was a purple range and I know that my teammates have already got purple the summit there's so many purple I saw you in a bad the purple okay you might as well arm a switch if you know there's better arm around anyway because if someone third-parties you've got a little bit of protection all right well this one squad left and I'm one off double digits hopefully I need to check it goddamn it know how I'll just get one kill hopefully I'm at least involved in this crap I'll take an assist I don't the worst thing is when it's anticlimactic and you're not involved whatsoever I can do that watch this watch this watch I learned how to do it it's actually the easiest mechanic on the game Wow it's a waste of grenade there's a decent chance that campaigner never but I'm not going to check did you know if you're on these ropes if you just hold square it transfers you automatically you don't need to jump which wastes time so on already said that and I had no idea but that's a little tip for you there just hold square if you want to switch ropes I don't like you buddy snidely stone and I'll tell you why because when their last team doesn't emerge when the other the last two teams are fighting makes me a bit nervous that it's just one guy and it's gonna be exciting it it's the weirdest corner you've ever seen that's what I don't once please I don't want to be up there anyway we're going towards it's get package nice wire agent down that wasn't an empty Bolger already mastered it was but I didn't even make contact you right it is my gold shields oh my god Felipe no the least two as well back it up two of them I might be stupid I might do some stupid I think they're both in this little hole hold on okay use all three of them mess em up t make some come to watch mess them up get him there we go how's the noise relax game oh good great you put that there came out of nowhere you are the apex champions 10 kills we've got a double digits item play says gg gg my friends that is what you'd like to see right there that is it's like plenty different game when your teammates are good honestly I yeah I don't I'm saying that was his chill though I had no stress there I that is something I never would have done rushing I thought there's only two people it turns out there were three I never would have done that if my teammates weren't good I only did it because I was so confident they would clear up I even like to watch I wanted to see what's happening thank you for watching I do appreciate it it's a fun game I'll see you on the next one
