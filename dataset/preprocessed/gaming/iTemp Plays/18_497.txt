hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today's two games were taken from yesterday's twitch live stream now the way that i have these streams set up is that i don't have any alerts or anything on screen that let you know it's an actual live stream because i want the recordings to come out clean i want it to be so if you stumbled on this video you wouldn't have been able to tell it was from a live stream i talked to chat and i thank subs between games in the down time and if you're watching yesterday's stream you really remember that i had maybe three or four games in a row where we just died off drop it happens it's about royale maybe you get bad rng maybe your aim is bad like mine it happens only happens a few times in a row i've got a foolproof plan to get yourself another victory and it includes picking up the mastiff because it's ridiculous everyone thought this gun was going to get nerfed in season 8 but it never happened and i still don't know why hopefully it does get nerfed in the mid-season update but until then i shall be picking it up on every opportunity and it will carry me to some wins that i otherwise wouldn't have gotten anyway i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends but if he finishes the rest completely then it should have like at least like a 10 second cooldown because if they get uh downed again instantly then she just keeps cranking it and quickly and creating i agree 10 10 to 15 seconds just some she can't do it loads in the same fight i'm on down low um i'm dead as well with that got blew him a little bit i have no ammo oh nice jumping i got you back if we died off start you're good he survived i'm gonna use a massive this game first time today you gotta use it sometimes yeah i mean i have it i don't really want to use it but i might i got a white vault are you spawning with the whiteboard that's the 1v3 weapon oh dude when i see clips of a mastiff i i know you mean a little bit cheaper right oh i'm no i'm so impressed whenever i see those the most impressive it's like the easiest one v3 gun because it's you can be 10 health and you can just two shot someone that has red armor oh it's too much rng for me uh i'm a little bit behind but i am offended so i can catch up i'm literally gonna be here by the time i'm fighting you're right below me i think if there's any energy ammo not too far uh they didn't have any let me check this um no definitely not any in there all good yeah your hands like pretty weak i really wanted it first i did a massive 13 damage there so i deserved that one definitely did they didn't have purple did they give me a sec um i think so there's like a lot of purples up there there's like more purples up there i need more i want to make my own one i have 12 damage off so who needs it one there too i mean i may as well grab this one it's right here come on rich get it together it was worth a detour oh it's happening huh they might go that way you need shotgun ammo i was walking around with like 64 shocking jimmy when you could carry 64 shock and have a per stack and i'd still probably carry three stacks i know you'd still find you still have people who fill their entire inventory with shotgun just in case mate okay you never know oh give me that knock down shield okay oh yeah thank you f5 bats yeah that loads like you're one clipping everyone um maybe i think he's in 301 a lot recently over here so good kitties take my i'll make my 35th i was going to say it's at the time of your next video the r301 is a beam have you guys tried this weapon right here stop underestimating the r301 classic dude never go wrong it's honestly a good title and it makes sense as well because every now and again i do forget the arthur one is the laser beam i think everybody does everybody goes through that little phase where they just it's just that weapon that's just kind of there you know i haven't used it today i'm gonna be using it a lot today i'm just kind of following you that's probably where we're going wrong on the icd i agree huh the bad guy never heard that voice line in my life what are you saying i don't know why the bad guy's got to try to blame that's what he said okay what happened on the road they used to be here why did you get rid of that it was too ugly nice bro myself i don't see him um just her nice oh there's the rev team of course charging up my shields that was a mess i couldn't really find anyone and then a bangalore came in yeah that was mine oh was it okay i was hiding from it i should have called it oh i'm sorry i thought we were just not completely i still would have hid from it because i don't want to get stunned yeah yeah very nice oh my god the pad oh my god it's just tremendous isn't it i think of you let's read my chat this is absolutely i have a pad yeah he's right at this uh this close cover oh if this one that's not close close to me i want to use the charge rifle it's too far into the game oh look at my health i was kind of distracting him i'm pretty sure i've made like four right now yeah i'm using one of the ones you've donated this one to me i don't have a package yet oh that's all right rifle works hello yeah this one here too if you need some extra all right i'm happy again now like i don't like dying at the start of the game where i feel like i just didn't have what's here i have a turbo now one off and that's all of it a grenade pretty good someone would say tremendous you could say if you wanted to um not in my vocabulary you could say that no only if you wanted to go wrong it was good it was it was good it's from downtown too just right over one second stop we did it very nice it's nice to get a win after a few rough starts that's just you know that's just how the games go this is about real that's just the nature of the beast you know this is what you're dealing with you don't need to know that too you know the fans need to know that we don't we don't just have good games all the time sometimes i'll play for two hours and i'll look back at the footage and i've done nothing i've done about 12 damage just kidding don't get one video sometimes it happens like that drops to 99. oh there's two of them that's why i was gonna say actually attention he started me thank you i thought it was an easy an easy challenge and i got blasted i mean this house will never let you down what would like no maybe it wasn't here was on the other side i think yeah so i have five left i'm going to throw them they're right on my door they're right on my door okay why would they turn why wouldn't she turn around because that other team's probably gonna compress she thinks she has to look at the door to like block it or something someone didn't even push they're just chin up top i've got r9 massive so in terms of usefulness at this range i mean we can make this quite close range i'm gonna go right recharging shield he really just he's chilling [Music] i'm it's impossible all right all right i'm good i'm good i'm good are you good i'm good i'm man i'm good i've been good give him my shield charge now if i have more people this way let's go here i'll find out ah this might be would you lie i may have been lying i didn't mean to well i'm not sure we're actually gonna find anyone i mean there was no one on outside of the map right yeah yeah never open across finally oh i have eight bats okay i have eight bats 14 cells would you like any of these um i have six bats so i mean i'm kind of chilling i think oh there was somebody there where look at that look at the instinct oh he's sliding down he's over here i barely him i kind of broke them is in your face that's what i'm doing that's my tactic hello everyone last team where are your nades kind of see there's just decoy notifications everywhere i'm going in i'm sorry i thought that guy ran off for that i might have been tracking one of your d chords i think you may have just bamboozled me all right then my clip is done nice i got it hey hey baboo's on the other side [Music] that's kind of a really slow game we started in map room killed one team and then we didn't find anyone until like eight minutes in i think
