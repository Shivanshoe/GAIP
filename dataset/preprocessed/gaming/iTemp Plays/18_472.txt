hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and unfortunately apex is currently broken in the recent update respawn introduced a no-fill option so you can solo q in your games unfortunately it doesn't really work because no matter if you tick this box or leave it unticked you are not getting random teammates most the time anyway sophia and i are playing some trios here but both games that i have for you are just us two it's just us two against the world no random teammate to help us at all i hope you enjoyed both games thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends they have they may they've created such a cool platform for this game to really do anything they're terrified of releasing guns for one yeah they don't want too many guns in the rotation they don't want certain guns to be too strong certain lead too many legends too many maps are like too many choices you know yeah if they went all out i feel like the game would actually landed on a gun this guy is a army switch next to him so pretty scary i got a purple side don't even care i'm lagging lagging tough as well um i think that too but it's not even our fault the increments are wild too heavy there were better uh increments we could i would definitely raise it a little bit me too i calmly bothered with lc no both my guns are actually just naked it's great ah going on the left oh no okay get a total of 20 how much time did you do there um like [ __ ] shields okay but i just i understand because i beam just so quick you know yeah yeah it makes sense make sense i don't i don't because when you play octane i can sort of keep up not fully i don't know well not least i'm there you know if i'm playing watson i'm just i'm so far behind right now yeah it's just not a good time it's such a difficult video to record wait i think they did they even get ready so is it just that yeah no they definitely i mean i did like a thousand damage to him oh no they're through a pad right next to him oh my god [Music] i don't know i was just punching people out in here oh saw it alright we got about 20 seconds oh my god they're all below me ready thanks nearly crazy oh i have a level one extended energy it's just actually really sad oh trios my squad yes oh my god dude what a game jesus that's what i thought it could have been a solid game oh see ya oh that's the spitfire yes and it is hurting me broke one guy i downed one as well the spitfires are just raining they all had spitfires wait i found like the ultimate rat spot i'm in a tree although they didn't want us to have a teammate they don't want to see us winning i mean oh my god a bunch of people in here yeah i don't have a gun i don't have a gun don't have a gun i always land over here no one lands on that side yeah somebody someone did somebody's landing there careful i don't have three bins no gun no armor the door was open so unless they just found it gonna run out i got a triple take oh yeah there was somebody here i gotta think that's it oh i've only had a nade there's a vault this is all looted follow me mate i'm gonna buy someone we got this this is how we survive i gotta look at an armor see nobody lands on this side dude this is the this is the spot yeah it actually is hey good friends there's a treasure pack here thank you thank hey you of energy here havoc here um i'm using an alternator i'm gonna use triple taker as well okay i can i didn't get scanned i probably just think it's just you they're over here in this middle part portion why did this just get knighted oh no i'll see ya i forgot this was cheers i need to i don't have any shields i need to get some okay i mean trying to protect you i have a kids the hollow closing in one minute they went down all right oh is that that's not purple not with you that's another team i was cause they didn't hit us 45 seconds left on the clock the ring's close dominating myself i kind of did i'll play i don't even need a team no in fact if they were here i tend to go away but i'd say to him i said get out of here my four cells in a drain i'm going in i have one bat six cells it seems like solid numbers i mean they're firing each other from across the canyon so we'll see i kind of want to kill those guys first see i think that's maybe the play because they have their look they're shooting long range so they're gonna third party us oh yeah these guys needed to go first octane's broken which way i've done the revenant already one run this way it gives you the octet that you cracked already giving my shield i got one shield sound left here i'll drop this one okay did they just like rotate um they might have i think so do i go do we go this way oh yeah i'll follow you horizon there's a team this way too but i can um i can go in with my all okay i'll wait for my grapple i'll heal up a little bit nice trying to get behind them it's up top somewhere i have two back seven cells oh they're pushing on us pretty sure that's the that's the revenue i killed earlier there that way once climate behind it is the revenue i killed earlier okay i'll drop you something here thank you thank you i don't know we're here yeah i don't think did they know i think it's only two of them yeah definitely just two this way the red octane push didn't work so they were like let's not do that that's the only option they have they bought that blue i think cracked one paddy to the right oh god it'll be so hard to follow them other ones left i'm trying [Laughter] you know his teammate was screaming and discouraged he's freddie shredberg oh don't just switch this one needs 750 oh no no it's wrong oh my god why i saw someone on twitter someone's complaining about it and they acted they replied they were like you guys don't know how to rotate what do you mean you can see where to run on the on the map you can run right through it if you want to doesn't make that big oh not with you mate i'm good i'm good i'm good oh yeah what's going on what's going on i'm just hiding inside for a second [Music] i got some stuff did he have heavy and i dropped a phoenix in that box i have no long range anymore okay um i just need to get cells i'm gonna get some right now i'm just messing up 20. hold on this is a terrible fight for me i don't know how they're not getting third parties they are there am i going a bit too crazy no i'm with you i'm with you all the way up there players nearby they rest oh god dude [Music] this is ridiculous this is a kind of a crazy game one team left and they weren't involved where could they be question party in these buildings right i got my little decoy over there they haven't shot him so look at him go and it's very realistic too yeah he's just you know he's trying to get off the wall all right oh here we go seth gossick trap off in this building mate he's caustic trapped every door he's in here he just locked his ultimate i'm not even inside the building are you kidding me i'm burning him in the corner all right over here i can't get over this blue armor i'm literally i don't even care well she has some nights who's going on going in okay nice come on man i just don't know the caustic isn't that isn't strong enough anymore yeah that's true it's only five damage i i keep taking it doesn't increase so you could just awesome if it's one i mean it's an easy kill that's very true you had one to see solid just one assist yeah yeah i mean i tell you this all the time rich when you just one clip everybody it's impossible to get this there's one assist in there just one oh no no jordan i don't think you've stole my kills i think two or three people that i've done managed to get a race
