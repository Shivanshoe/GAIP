hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back in ranks because ranked at the moment is a ton of fun we've made it to platinum which because it's at the start of the split uh actually feels like diamond at the moment at the very start of the split it felt like predator because all the predators got demoted to platinum but it's been a few days so now it feels like diamond now the video title may be confusing at the moment however it will become more obvious as to what i was talking about towards the end of the video it gets increasingly more obvious so you gotta stick around for it so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh this is uh this is a bop move right here is it this is a bad move where would you have gone oh god no i'll embarrass myself you know my gold to experience would have taken us to somewhere a little bit safer oh my god this place is safe there's only one team flying to the rig it looks like sucks so good what are you talking about that sucks you're crazy high rate of fire that's a carbine there if you need it never caught a carbine before my entire life i'll throw one a carbine it's copper did you just call a carbine did you just call it a car i'm looking for a vk-47 if you find one a vk-47 yes that's the flat line you know that right yeah yeah a little pdw action that's pdw he's the private uh you have to think about it that's kind of cringe i knew i was losing i was trying to figure out my loot can i just focus on one thing at a time you know i have a turbocharged havoc so if you see any energy i would like to be fed energy oh you are baby baby baby baby what are you talking about you gave you an re you wanted two bins yourself are you why are you just following my loophole that's the last bin that was the last thing in the entire place it was mine but both of them were yours were they yes i look crazy we're looking for energy ammo if you go down first fight i am not playing with you anymore today or for the rest of the week listen i i told you on twitter i said i'm gonna give you one free carrot you just need to cash in whenever you want you haven't cashed in yet when you cash in i'll start playing serious that's crazy i don't think i'm ever going to be able to catch that in yeah man i was only joking thank you there's too much pressure on me now there's no there's so much pressure on me thank you he's playing but if you go down first fight look it's gonna look real bad i sleep jump why don't you super jump your way into some kills rich huh how about that extended heavy mag thank you level four i don't deserve that but thank you someone said close down first fight i'll try it's gonna look real bad i'll try i'm nervous i'm nervous i got a ball nice just slide down the hill towards i have to pop that i have to pop this uh medicare first oh i disappeared at the last second that's actually so tragic recharging i already say she's so far away damn it yeah i was obviously at the time a kind of i'm taking an absolute beat in here yeah they're backing up too we do some research in this area okay they turn around and hit me for 73. these are my last three shield cells what i have three bats though so it's fine jack not gonna let this right with some shield cells there was there was nothing in there was it not i mean uh actually uh you can check i can't remember actually i don't think i don't think anything though no not really all right that was first gunfire didn't go down that counts so i'm allowed to go down now it's not as bad yeah nope still bad okay we're gonna get rocked upon this is two of the boys unless there was a third one that split but i didn't see got the positional advantage which is almost impossible perfection one only had blues well i know i've only got blue so it's right below me right below find this a6 honor 4586 it's almost to the right i think valve yeah that's my gas yeah they went right i think is that feral might be away maybe oh there you go i don't know yeah it must be replicated are you having a laugh get out of mine man once um okay i'm stuck in a corner okay i'm fine now dude what is happening to my game maybe your controller is messed up too the the return was here find that conduct right yeah he uh they backed up right here i don't know what's going to be though i'm gonna get this ban here oh but shields things that saw i need cells uh did you did you you didn't take the ball did you no no no it's not bad if you want it you can have it but i'll swap on it i'm good night in the back by another team enemy shield cracked by two different squads watch my back a variable shields are recharging i'm under fire reloading said we can stay on this right side now okay opening fire just getting my armor back this team's sort of like putting us off a little bit i'll be there okay so i might cut you off a little bit no yeah we're fine here that big scrapping up there i think we just wait for then just alternate one of the buildings across i guess because that's where it's going to take us surely no we're fine okay lots of teams they're they're fighting okay they're about to they're split though i think one of the one of them pushed recharging she's going around okay do you go with that i guess so right i mean if you want to um i got a decent angle for if they try and cross they're trying to corner us i think this team backed up came back they yeah they backed up they back up okay yep on something one's the one going on they do what do they go that way for 90 damage there's one block beneath you follow me right pvp look at me please oh did i get it out of there oh mate i was a star i knew i couldn't get down so i had to just pray and brain you know um i might not have got a single kill you are there let's see yeah i might not have hold on let's see oh there's no way no no let's see let's see let's see no way now there's a chance i might got one i might got one yes i think that's something i'm sorry how did that even happen i don't know how did you know sometimes it happens wait sometimes it happens no only you doesn't happen ever i'm like a dyslexic james bond 0-7-0 [Laughter] that's actually if you would have told me i don't need to kill me i was trying to get zero no i was so desperate for that last one i was so pleased
