[Music] ah am i supposed to hit that good because i am i am able [Music] i have to drop i think tim is going to get him nice there we go helps you guys to twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and recently i've been trying to play more apex i've been trying to play solo more as well just because i'm trying to i'm trying to get better i'm trying to stay at a particular level and i'm also trying to spice the videos up a little bit as well the problem with playing solo sometimes though is that it can be pretty difficult to win a game and then he dawned on me i'm not doing it correctly if i'm playing solo and i'm trying my hardest there is only one legend to play and that is wraith so i have some good games here for you today i hope you enjoy them all thank you for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends let's go this way i'm landing small room target landed near me wrong choice come on small room or something like that okay well enemy shield first blood and some more arrows nice that's certainly helpful devo i mean it's better than a bow right i mean ben and the l star surely i'm don't switch in front of the sniper just dropped all my ammo like an idiot and i might need the lights sentinel devo what kind of setup is this that was better in my mind just us now using the decoys he's got [Music] purple should be taking the purple what am i doing i forgot reloading you guys good they should be fired nice job last one nice work well we survived and we should definitely definitely be going the other way we should be going [Music] hustle right here where's god come from contact with target opening fire enemies last guy you got bamboozled can't let you die your biggest fan would never forgive me brings out too far i assume she's got she must have all by now surely spotted broken enemy shield in progress ring one second we got this is this possible i mean i could pause to say here but this might be a nice little chill place to here look healing portals ready that was like an eight squad coming in let's explore this way we can go back there try and third them try and get some more loot that's my plan anyway i've got a weed set up here sentinel r301 i mean i'm not sure what kind of psychopath uses a setup like this but apparently i'm one of them thanks foster right here loud and clear reloading i downed an enemy throwing arcstar [Music] careful and we get the pathfinder kills the question but make this easier opening fire i'm coming contact with target they spotted me i'm taking shots enemy here throw my grenade nice job nice job this won't hurt hold on good job man good job nice work nice boys healed cheers mate this is really well reloading i saw walking around like a headless chicken for my slap fight these guys were kind of kid too it's to start the game both angles at the same time know i want to use wing man but i don't know if you guys think of it yet i really don't i mean i love you i'm using it i just i love the wingman i love the wingman i can't i can't lie i can't hide it let me take some of these go like that and then switch this to light for a little bit making contact with enemy pretty sure there was someone on there yeah he drops me here an enemy shield reloading i downed an enemy need to recharge my shields he's got golden bear watch out nice faulty as well for the team i need to get it around the corner that's the problem the abilities i should have done the port sooner i just wanted them to come out in cover that's all this won't hurt hold on you can heal up they're gonna want to try and get this valkyrie fortunately she died in a pretty bad spot i thought i was stuck healing up give me a sec i'm taking shots we should go here i don't know someone left him dead there nice job oh my god i sort of left the gibby outfit to dry there oh man i gotta come back in i guess enemy shield broken reloading picked up our teammates banner void running recharging my shields eyes are open though that rings far i know i'm dead literally sat on the top of the rope i'll never understand why people like landing at cage this place has zero loot there is nothing here all right well i'm gonna try my best and we see it too he's gonna contest the note luke with another team i don't have a gun yeah i need a weapon yeah i don't have a gun firing shield getting shot nothing no no no high five crafty mess get out get out give me a sec i'm not crafty here you know that loot that cage is bad when we're pinking p20s that's how you know recharging i don't know what octane managed to find to do over there for so long to be honest with you grenade deployed stir my grenade out there my grenade out hopefully he comes up the rope lame [Music] aldi are they here what the heck is going on here man like we're just pinging in all kinds of directions in every direction possible but there's just pings going on this must be the pathfinder surely heads up the package setting a portal yeah my bad my bad i was gonna send him backwards okay well i have five shield cells i've only got these five cells making contact with enemy grab your stuff why do you put this here i need to recharge my shields obviously there's another team i don't have an extended mag either oh my and i saw her pop in a shield cell with gold armor my life was flashing before my eyes that's three bats i don't need these big heels as much as my teammates do shield battery here this is the craft iceland bike mag in the crafter it changed on me getting hills oh down here i'm going that way but look at it smoke that way oh come in heard that i'm in a bit of a precarious spot recharging my shields going to phase it's two teams it's two teams i think we've got another sport let them just get behind the choke and let them just get hit they backed all the way up what's going on is every team get this right i messed up not far one second we got this just they can't hear it you know probably worse i need a i need a lineman so desperately i'll do did i not grab it hello i should have taken some more light rains i think how have i done so much less damage did that guy just do nothing to him i'm glad you phased because i did not have my pk reloaded recharging my shields reloading say that i did hit one of them over that way a lot it was the bloodhound i think i think i double headshot him for like 100 each time at least when i use the pk i've got a really claw i guess i've always got a small hitbox but avoid jumping close range it definitely makes a big effect you just peeking left and right you know of the demon strafes on there what are we hoping for here i'm hoping for a vault because i suck at the pk maybe a crater because it sounds like a fun time yes peacekeeper here i've got the last one i'm going to take this let me tell you what it is though do i do it thank you here we go i got my old cell back the scale fault i can't believe it we've got another care package landing i mean this is maybe just a solo that survived that fight or something i don't know what's going on here i don't know this is ludicrous then you need a bloodhound scan every building contact with targeting [Music] it's go time there's two of them there's more than one there's definitely two maybe three if he didn't get stuck he would have killed me 100 he deserves the finisher for that he deserves finishing for that literally for making us run around when there are two of them fair enough he was just that guy in the corner if he's just a solo it's kind of scary out there alone but come on come on you are there i guess you need to check your corners even on apex i need threw the game there for the team nice good job team
