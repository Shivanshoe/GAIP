have we sir Ghazi twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex and legends of course and I've realized that I am main 'less but I sort of like it I will play almost anyone on ethics legends they're the only characters that I don't really enjoy playing on Watson crypto and Gibraltar and the rest of the characters I have a fairly even killed distribution with them this season I'm actually going to show you each of the burners for each of the characters and on these banners I'll have three trackers on I'll have games plate kills and in season five kills and then once I've shown all the burners I'll show you my overall stats alongside my season 5 specific stats as well so quite pretty to bleed the character that I have played the most with this season is loba she's the new character of course I have 203 kills in 45 games played and after Loba my most kills with the character in season 5 is octane with 93 and then he's Bangalore with 88 I don't have a character apart from Lobo with over 100 kills of season which is quite surprising really because 100 kills isn't isn't massive it's not that many that's because of two things one I don't play that much and two I switch character almost every single game that I play so those are my character specific stats these are my overall stats for those that are interested I have 2800 games in total 435 wins 5.5 overall KD with 11,000 kills and I'd say 98% of those games have been me just go any solo as well my season 5 stats are 200 for games 30 wins 700 kills with a 4 point 9 KD which is lower than my average KD but you know school based my season to kill death ratio was 9 point 4 3 as you can see here I was having a great time that season yeah I thought these stats were interesting I'm officially main nervous let me know who you guys are playing in the comment section down below as I'm quite interested actually because obviously one of the main characters in the game Pathfinder was goodeed so we're all switching up I think so yes thank you for watching I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends I'm paying revenant I wasn't even taken out I'll literally pay anyone miss purple arm and therefore you Romania wasn't real that was you that was land Xena I'll just gave I'll let you live that the same thing jumping out the window a seven-speed fire never mind I've got an online let's be fine it's between my Navy fancy I have me a wingman good cuz I was an Army 45 oh I like that though there you go the only problem we switching between pirates is I'll eat you back to try and do a scan if I'm plain revenant eyes have to stop and think about it for a second yeah yeah you know the worst feeling is when you're playing a race and you're used to playing like Gibraltar or something I don't know if you use randomly be phasing oh yeah right arm around lifeline tough words and there's a radar bag I think it's all raised at least on this one by our silence that cannot do
