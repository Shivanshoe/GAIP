however some guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing small apex legends of course and today we are testing out the new and improved single fire hemlock I used to love using this weapon in the early seasons of apex legends but unfortunately they changed it in season 3 the changes that they made were reducing the fire rate of the weapon but also increasing the damage I suppose they wanted to shift it into more of a stable like a long-range option for the hemlock because the burst fire mode isn't good at long range whatsoever now the damage increases they upon the hemlock was actually quite hefty it went from an 18 damage shot to a 22 damage shots despite the increased damage however I never really got to grips with the newer reduced fire rate so I didn't use half as much as I did in the previous seasons fast-forward four months were known season four which gave us a lot of changes in the weapon stats Department and the hemlock was buffed the fire rate of the single shot mode only was increased from a five point six to six point four now I assume that this statistic is shot per second this is around a 14% increase in fire rate or one in seven they're effectively firing one extra bullet every 7 of you shoot now here's the best bit even though they increase the fire rates again the damage increase from last season remained this may be a gun but you want to pick up an experiment week because I know a few people back in the day used to love a single fire hemlock hopefully you enjoy today's video if you do be sure to hit the subscribe button to join the eye 10 player and on Sewall in five and a half seconds my friends all right the beak planet harvester of Douma needs my friends look my apex legends apex predator trail there is another team so quickly careful mighty nice Landers making using beat I've got a three times site at least I can I'll put it on my boxing books and I'll snipe them I know they're spring-loaded where is the load in this place like towards the end of the corridors there's actually not any loose okay our why Lacan I have no idea when I've got this digital threat but I guess I've got one I knew the supply room is here my teammate so despite someone I'm a little bit scared though teammates because I do not have a weapon my friends might tell I'm actually just wait a sec there's a weapon here I'm good it's a wingman being chased I can't see what am i doing there we go good grief yeah I get to get me off this wing man down okay I haven't played that much so far today I've Colton's can't think of any other excuses I saw him cold in here I don't have compounds I'm lying to you won't you have pure embarrassment but it's okay because we sit away switch it away from the wing one day I got a switch they did the digital trails that we mapped before firing but it's difficult on people right there you want to spend time fatten about in your inventory and the good news is we have got ourselves wakayama points on these I know realized I've got a hammer point P 2020 that's that sardine I've thought I heard someone you're good look this place well I've got a single fine hemlock and I've been wanted to test this out I've actually heard I know I have to say it makes pretty good I'm not sure I mean I probably would have talked about in the Internet every time I want to make a video on its own gun I talked about in the intro and I'll talk about it in the game anyway so I'm sure you've heard what you play what's that's ease a little lava and that it's not where I want to go all right this is what I do every time I land here and it's a bit of an issue I just wonder about if these guys have any extra shot I mean I don't even have enough to regenerate nothing all right well I've already lived either one as well where do we go because I'm just gonna commit I'm just gonna go this way she would like to join me friends I'm venturing over these the over this way towards the towards the vault towards train yard as well we've got some pretty good loop I'm gonna click on the revenant honestly all of these voice lines of the voice actor I love the character theories and I'm not playing revenant is because it was chosen before me here you can't complain when you're playing Pathfinder okay so what you have little - alright let's go see if anyone is here at the train yard I kind of bunny hop gonna pill I need to stop trying that I feel like these these are probe in should have so especially men when the train is now not all got a topsy bangalore Hostel I'm on flank protection juicy it's two of them stupid three times site I use my abilities every time now teammate I can't stop I take the three times site is one of my favorite from the game the only problem is if someone is in your face like that you are in a terrible spot you're in an awful spot at the Bangalore I mean it's not fair on the Bengal because I've seen her passive I'm not gonna keep it down if I go to a long range gunfights I've seen the bangles passive is that she runs quicker when she's being shot at or aimed out whatever so that's pretty wide in people's without George that's literally as fast as I could turn around with these three time sight I got the whole team and we can see on the mini-map that this is still closed on what hopefully there's some good stuff in there for kills not bad at a bot though the only bad thing about that gun fight there with that single 5m lock was the side that I was using it wasn't suitable for that that distance okay I got the two best items I've already got a cop back got better start I'm pretty sure they just let me just walk in there they didn't even try and texture from me which is great just a sham I just throw my my appreciation there Thank You friends bulk is outside my back now so I'll have a bit more roof some heavy rains but yeah the increased fire rate definitely helped there at the close range gunfights especially I'll walk around are the one time site and if I get into a long-range gunfight I'll just quickly switch over to the three times that's the plan I think I've only use single fire gun so far this game scuffles isn't still safe might as well venture over this way yeah I got I got a kill with a wingman I got one kill with me man me still with other shots no I got two kills the wingman and I switched over to the hemlock yeah I've only used single fire shots I'm going for a single fire shot only victory here all right fragment West Indies my friends is no longer called capsule city that name has been taken away from the moon map on the map in general decision even acquitted I'll maybe I'll just walk around in a two-type site that's a bit more of a I mean I'm gonna keep them I'm gonna keep their digital threats it's so tempting to use the one-time sage cog but if I come across a Bangalore or a core sticks that matter I'll be kicking myself actually we've gone this way we're pairing up to go back I thought people gonna be fighting here capital city or fragment west even but apparently then it's not the case it's a very sad day a lot of people left them gotta hop up here there we go friends scrap in the distance where is that I thought might be Mirage voyage I don't think we should I thought that was down low okay that's the wrong way I'm pretty sure that's pretty far away in Mirage Mirage fortunately for us I am path miner and I've got my ulti we should be there in no time sounds I could you brought some it's gonna let my teammates know what's going on I'm heading over to scrap we'll see how far away this is if I can there we go bomb bomb I'm going across that way to arc sighs I believe we're throwing there let's get it around be well people on the ship but yeah there you go people look clearly this side as well it's much of a place I might regret that might be useful my might have been useful to use that to go into the ship a different angle but he's Therma toes French how he's running away great I thought brains you don't ask let me as quick as you can because he still has that recoil okay that's when you want to smell me at this all range she brought us ready to use a do shelves mainly gone you're gonna get a few Hills on I'm gonna go for a flank maneuver because they all have to heal up here all three of them are struggling they changed this ship there's always the pod bases you don't make this no I bounce away from it teammates all messed up uno momento pull the wall oh good job team as well I'd like to see everything I'll say these angles annoying we can safely trip - fine all right I'm not - half Dave I didn't want to so there's still someone behind as well this would be messy run-in with the flank 211 damage 111 damage with three shots there someone's needed I thought if you saw that but the revive animation that old bar was different because I've got a gob back so now you know that you're bringing them back and they can also see that I assume that's the point of it so you know you'll come back with a bit more house useful you know all right seven kills another pin 20 20 kill actually I was my first one I'm so happy I kept the digital threats as soon as they were just walking around the smoke walk down the end why my graph was so bad today these grapples are like best of two out of ten I'm not sure you can write them a 2 of 10 if they don't even connect with the surface of your china grapple tea there is 0 out of 10 by default surely this is more towards train yard and someone did dress tonight and we couldn't hear it so the fights he's so far in the distance the scrap is so far in the distance that we cannot even hear it and you can hear snipers from so far right there you go someone else is getting down name are they that's not that's a team gun please points I always say I always say it for whenever there's two squads left all you need to do is escapes and try and locate one of the teams and if you can track that team or even try and get close there then realizing that you're close because ideally you want them to find the other team and start fighting them and then you just you sneak in there we go I recognize the team of the fine people because they're coming from so far away that we wouldn't have heard it now we just need to sort of track them traps should be caustic hey what are you doing he's got it she's a Saltine everything doesn't hop down I see I'm a little bit weak thank you so chin up there yeah the gosh-darn Massey absolutely pepper me okay you guys keep trying I I think this team like rushes this is what you don't want to happen you don't want to be the team fighting the other glass team if they say they're just keeps not a pump at all right spider-man there we go shield us it's done what kill a third parties install mark help yeah I am NOT looking there anymore so looking at me someone's p23 Nover that sounds like what you doing don't if that guy behind the rock could have rotated cuz there's no way you just be tuning there and it keeps typing to me if you look at the mini-map these guys can definitely just rotate around if they wanted to and there's only two people find there's definitely a good chance of someone trying to sneak around and if you look at the mini-map even more if they do sneak around all of a sudden we're the ones being gay cats you've got to keep an eye on this it's like a game of chess if I see here and they knock on my teammates I can still provide crossfire you know I can weaken them as they try and rush my team I'd have come over anyway that's fine this is a bad position it's a good spot but it needs to be careful than rotating I very much doubt they're going to push this way I want to freak the negatives I want to tell them which need to be careful and we've got a good rng we can stop them here if they want to come through the middle one that's phoneme as well and I join your friends I find it and revenant I've done this before is the also number have you met kit ready because I've seen you respawn with full shield with no health and by the time you're done you can just grab a back in with full health there we go I can see cuz this shrubbery there's too much shrubbery xanimation max champions either side a game that was a single fire only a victory they're my friends fifteen hundred and fifty-five damage to revives nine kills but listen that caustic I predicted about 250 damage to me in total and then he gets sniped by the third party Wraith definitely deserved more than one kill and to be honest the revenant prodigy served more than four as well I feel like it was a good team effort though that that revenant and Pathfinder combo is unreal whenever you use revenants ultimate have your hero boss ready you don't need to shield up get your healer balls ready as soon as you respawn at that little totem thing heal up get back in the fight help your teammate as I can game of chess at the end and we we were the chess experts we're the grandmasters thank you for watching definitely try this single fire hemlock for yourself let me know how it goes in the comments and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
