hey we suppose eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more effects legends of course we are back on the apex legends or ranked grind at the start of this ranked season I was in bronze and we are desperately close to hitting apex predator I just want to say thank you for showing a lot of support on yesterday's call of duty modern warfare video I am definitely going to be uploading more of that game and it really means a lot that you guys will still watch other games on the channel cuz I have been enjoying playing so expect a few more videos here and there on the channel as well alongside some apex legends ones of course so thanks for watching no seawall in 5 and 1/2 seconds my friends all right friends it's also theists who say today it's been fairly popular teammate back it up whoa I was my um own nose to make a fella to shield that's okay because I am gonna find myself with all four shelves around this corner sure I guess I'm an a/b rounds back it was a shield cell not a level four shield shield is in the name maybe that's how the universe got a little bit confused it's all good both my turns got level two scraps or CT is actually kinda quiet for the first time today I mean picking off recently I think people pay aggressive or more aggressive at least in these ranks there because I'm starting to get more and more of the people for the players even those level three shields I think you must have pingzhi and them really only on level two where's the level two shield and friend [Music] hey sorry see me I mean thanks I'm an idiot clearly someone's a bit too far okay okay I guess we're not fighting this I thought we were going to scrap him I mean we're all kinds of kitd to level 2 and level 3 a high grandmas now is in problem was it send me reverse on a sea plane I need to fix that stupid challenge I've only peek from one angle there and they compete with different angles so it's just it's never gonna work hopefully I keep pushing her so we can have a bit of height advantage sorry if you can hear Ralph run around there's a bit of a maniac maybe 15 I don't plan on using that straightaway but if we get on tonight there we go we've got a big damage off and now my teammates wait what's going on here friends what are we doing that's for the Gibraltar the reason I put the ultimate down is because if if we damage them a little bit be nice to get a bit of a plan camera at the 72 but now teammates running backwards already want to play aggressive epidemic bomb they're not even gonna challenge this they've been peppered so much there's no way no way they've got that many shield cells I doubt very much if they are going to challenge this once more it's a shame we can't go inside that damage there because if we all damaged people at the same time we could just brush them which was the point of the ultimate what do you okay it's a bit tricky in this rank to work organize the team maybe smile maybe I shouldn't put it there until we needed it good stuff here friends purple extended heavy mangas well what's good huh bit of a heckler chair I boarded a glitch they want to jump and hit the lamppost oh I slipped he's one shot I don't think he's gonna challenge okay he challenged one an absolute lunacy the man had nothing left and he topped to her that wall why is it lunacy good job team oh I didn't even get an assist for that good grief not even an assist I've been after you some shields itselves on this day I am indeed just gonna storm than my teammate dropped actually I could do that every single time I do that oh I've got to anvil round guns here I'll flip out to find another one I reckon this might be the team that we peppered up earlier honestly I'm asked Adam half his team atleast inflected missed every shot team upon his lap seven he went down anyway I'll try and Nick a kill there like 100-something I think there are three teams in this building my teammates are only far away I don't care I'm trying I'm going for it it's maybe a completely stupid idea okay this is a completely stupid idea and I regret it immensely Oh saved the Wraiths around here I'm not gonna get this this for you but I need to be a little bit careful I mean that I could have died so I'll take the shame about the race but at the same time I was one chopped - maybe he's Amy I don't even know turbo charger it's got two veins your mouth flatline back I only picked up 48 never mind I still been in the morning oh my gosh that's my second and for receiving a double anvil receiver set up here never-before-seen it's a good job I'd switch back to the flat line and a better bag 28 shield cells it slightly luta myself here Oh lunatic theme we should party get going it's maybe a bit of a waste of an ultimate but he saves it saves of it saves us a few seconds and the storm is gonna push this as well so it might be worth it especially because the fight was going on here there is it's much better to get here when the fights going on and if we say 15 seconds 10 seconds even my actually get us a few kills here hopefully yeah it's always gonna like panics on the old arc starts okay what's a nice day that's not fair I was changing fire mode someone's respawn in behind us oh my god that guy's not gone even know that you have it behind friends I'm about to get ourselves a free kill or two here I think I'd have killed him if he was anyone else as a ninja brought a [Music] sure listen Seattle and my teammates gonna let separate teams Wow what that's a stupid idea they can have to come this way anyway think I need a bit of patience here Nations has done my strong suit unfortunately my Timmy's have run off into the sunset somewhat be dead honestly I mean quite that I thought I was gonna I might still be a goner but at least I can get close to the edge of the circle because I need some teammate seasons here I can't I can't shoot if I shoot I die let me get killed credit for this doesn't matter I've just come in so much to get kill or to know stuff to wear with nothing so may think it was that that full team though that was just a bangle or what happened to that there was a Pathfinder I think the wizard thank you actually don't know who the other one was there's definitely a path mine to them or maybe the Pathfinder escaped though mister translate they left someone behind though I don't know why they won't come and help or at least they've been nearby maybe they all just died I didn't see it why don't I get killed credit on the Pathfinder then I swear even if they get a revive it's done enough to to get killed credit sometimes well I need one more kill or assist and make it max points anyway up in the sky French okay your face this way he really looked like he was facing you the direction there that's not even my fault in your longboat okay - and shield cells here I'm not gonna waste a batch on this yeah we need to we need to get out of here they can cut us off let them go keep the storm here so bad Shoom team covering fire please they've got 1787 states call that G 119 scape I hope that's seven times seventy all right long watch him on push up what I need to do here is get up top and provide covering fire this is what my team should've been doing to me I think good hold on friends give me sec it doesn't matter if I down them here I literally just need to distract them yeah focus me get the revive off I'll do so yeah it's pretty fun to not miss the storms pushing them it was watching on the ground there okay the storm stops that party does chin underneath this I'm gonna get a cough on this say something to eat machine man half man half to eat machine f13 I guess this is my new single fire weapon hold him away I didn't know they could even still see me got some spare light I spent all that providing you guys who's covering fire there we go thanks thank you hold on got your back there's two Chuck that's my thought oh I just down like three or four different people maybe not for people unfortunately I was able to get all the revives off yes all day it's all Dean here we go that's all the hammer behind mind you I think he was the brute Hank that was trying to get this a bit of a waste I'm also need a shield cells but I'm not gonna well here we go you more supply bins six squads left I'm not gonna say that poor toilet seems like a death trap they probably got it right the edge of the Ring or something Lambie they're struggling for the loot there's no way to actually I think him to package pretty fine that's part of a team a team and all that just so much both can get up top as well up in the skies can't see gosh don't think seems I looked away Oh idiot phantom hits any shield tells b-boy how they I probably see me the rest of the game hopefully my desperate need a killer assist here I'm gonna be nervous now someone on my knee single fire mode the safe zone is actually kind of big let's delete machine man we can't let these guys use my ultimate we call them work this way over pinched I'm shocked so I'm gonna get a kill by by then that now last me I assume let's go get a revive up that is same size I'm Nydia the Bangalore was one shot to I got distracted and not another bangalore odds where there's like a 15th one this game I'm an idiot I'm an idiot I'm an idiot teammates please say you've got this please I was always so good I got so greedy I just wanted a killer Assad I don't even end up with it I believe in these guys though they've got a good position here got a bit of a crossfire going on this is the last corner stuck inside if they if they clutch this it doesn't matter my stupidity was not in vain I'll do nicely damage watching the still oven she finishes that your battery you're screaming very odd she finished the show battery I think he's like actually oh there we go hopefully three kills three kills and one assist I'm sorry jerking ideas 3536 hundreds how on earth did I have three kills that game 3143 eight kills from Gibraltar that guy didn't have an assist 1800 damage 1600 damage coming out of Bangalore as well I'll tell you what Mac maybe the UM maybe the the Duvall and Vall receiver was a bad idea I tell you what it was I couldn't remember which one was on single fire and which one was an auto fire so I kept having to switch them all the time going into gun fights it's really confusing really confusing I've polisher too stuck with that Island tonight our founding in scraps or city 3143 damage good grief I tell what I did right though I think I saved the team when I pushed forward that time and provided covering fire because that we would gain absolutely destroyed on that reach are you kidding me 66 it's 25 okay I wouldn't have got I only got diamond one even with an extra killer assist there so it's fine I supposed to start screaming if I was left in less than 25 points off diamonds one but look at that there we go hundred feet to our page should have been 177 cannot believe my luck sometimes absolute so you've devastated over it thanks for watching I do breach eighty hopefully in the next video we'll hit diamond to one unless we've got a mass on ranking spree or D ranking spree which could still happen ah three kills and a cease thanks watch I see on the neck mhm
