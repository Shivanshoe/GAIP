every cigars each which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more 8x and legends of four so today we are playing Lobel for the first time on world's edge and there was an interesting interaction with her ultimate and the loot vaults so I sent to Twitter cook yesterday by Christian that shows that using her ultimate near the loop vault does indeed allow you to loot the contents but a warning message comes up it lets you know that the Luther you're trying to take is inside a locked vault and asked if you still want to continue if you press yes your black market Ultima is destroyed and allow me set off on the vault which may be our angles pan here you still get your item but you can only take one of them that's not one per person it's literally just one item and I am glad they thought of this imagine how broken low but would have been if you could loot the entire vault with your team drove two games for you today with a focus around these interaction I hope you'll enjoy them both and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends train yard ''tis my friends and we are late son you realize I hope you don't mess there and I have taken us to the hot job as a late drop which is not a good idea if you're late you produce on land somewhere there's a load of people because this happens you get no shield you get a center now and you get a p20 now all of a sudden you struggling there's a guy behind me as well watching no one appears to have land in this entire building which is nice do you want goon over so we team up this week old here this may be what make this place a hot hot teardrop mr. goblins be quiet I will take that every day of the week it was a little bit far away in the p20 comic kicks I'll be honest you unexpected - hey you yes I'm gonna try something this might be a stupid play it is indeed I've gone too far oh god I'm behind them kind of the race was just an opening like a push roll over oh so nice you folded folding in half sorry I forgot my level one shields all right well this is actually turned out kind of well anything by Dooney there's a bit of heavy I won 24 rounds which isn't too good 24 bullets which is an ideal whatsoever again the gold gun for me is actually very nice no more bullets salute I think I killed can we actually you got an annoying ego do need that all right no update on the ultimate we are going to the vaults one of the reasons I wanted to land here is because obviously it is right next to want to do you volts here hopefully by the time we get there our ultimate is nearly ready to go but because we're low but we can get lolled sneak preview off so you can see the loop through the wall here we go Purple's Gold's all kinds of beautiful things for us in here right shield I literally think I literally think I've just sawed off all of them I'm only really interested in the gold shield because I'm fairly certain you can only take one item so for strong skills and also going to take clothes I've got to speak like I mean these things this each bullets I'm afraid hang on game a move here so we should get a little one message you whisper sexy skip three and you set a llama right so how how far away can you hear this alarm your kick is still openness with the vault key if you had one sure you would be able to we're inside okay we've wronged the proverbial dinner bell so to speak did they see us what's going on friend well communicating through the interpretive art form of dance apparently look at least one oh nice find up top is someone here I'll just met the person it's literally in the game not it's not my recording but it is my recording but it's my recording of the game I'm also sorry after they fix that soon it's incessant look I have tapas only down and he was fighting this team by him at all B we're going over got the two shots off with the hammer points do you quite get that last one seven spotnik this is the this is the first fruit and there are 14 people left on world's edge which is a far bigger map and Kings Canyon how on earth is this happened I do have some good news I've got my ultimate back was that purple help me there was a level three help me around here somewhere it doesn't matter too much because I can just take one from the vault I can take the the gold one the shield battery you have your ohms as well yeah forget it I'm going to take the gold one from the voltage if no one's open anybody's that's okay so you're are you good for the healer balls teammate it's just Ryung to keep up do you need some syringes you go charge alright so untouched I'm back I'm back to steal some monster it is tempting to tell you the things but I guess the gold helmet he's probably the best one he asked me is locked in a low voice he's gonna steal I absolutely do so you always take the damage because it's when your black-market things explodes it's literally like one damage I resumed I needed like stock up on Ultima accelerants and I need to just keep returning to the vault to steal all of the items in there that's that's my that's my dream mission he does take everything from inside the locked vault I do you think how that interaction is going to work when lava was released often we've had to play Kings Canyon for two weeks and it's nice they did something special for it rather than it just being like you get two free items each so you can literally clear the vault out with just one low broad smoke they thought ahead they knew that would have been overpowered I think using a weak mascot piercer they thought ahead imagine that you could London annex or sorry an ultimate accelerant walk up to the vault and take literally every gold item in there with your team as you get to each absolute now means you can only take of one item so I say think about things like this making not overpowered here we go I missed that's great news Thanks I love this yeah yeah it's fan big fan of this interactive gameplay careful friends I was choking to death I'm afraid you basically want me to turn I need nothing this guy and everyone Evo's because they've been Sam mirage behind that's a big thing man they're pushing I'm gonna push I don't know why bring that fight bear I was for some reason it came to my mind imagine if you could throw your low but ultimate diamond it makes no sense whatsoever so it's gonna have to wait okay oh God I messed up friends all right he down one of them okay that's everyone chill revive the revive this is fair let's just reset the fight I hate my life sometimes he's in bamboozle three times in a row stop moving he's somewhere though let's pop off the single hemlock lately I kind of appreciate the I can't walking back into cover with my uh move sorry teammate literally both of a one shot well the last gossip here then if these challenges that's gonna work it's absolutely not that's a terrible idea I'm canceling the funds rent they have to move off there eventually I've literally stolen both of those kills I do feel that at least inflator might kill counts I sort there yes the stupid idea the second time have used it this entire game question is which way these guys gonna flush honey you go let's go don't forget who hooked you up toodle-oo show batteries as long as these guys aren't pushing I've got a feeling they've gone all the way around the main scene because if I were them I wonder want it to push us when you know straight indeed makes no sense to do that that exists him now there's no way - there's no way he'd sell spooky he wouldn't he wouldn't be sound Mirage by arge with the tool tape he would've been in my face one clicking move with an R tonight this definitely isn't him I think he must have died earlier in the game oh gosh two twins player of all time BJ you know earlier I'm gonna set this thing clicks I told you it keeps up Quincy Josh something after the dismount damage to both those people and my teammate got both heels however he definitely deserved it because I waited about three kills all right that's great because one we sold two legendary items from the Voltas Lobo we set the alarm off are those oh you know what that's pretty even I thought I don't these guys kills but I didn't look I got slightly more damage and we've got 13 kills so it makes complete sense I would get but one more kill that's not too bad fortunately didn't have to fight L spooky again I fought him before I need that you just murdered my life that would have ruined that game entirely someone else took him out thankfully all right well that's a good game right there very good game I'm back teammate teammate teammate a I'm back he was just healing up it'll be like a syringe or something okay well this he's been lucid I'm gonna need a weapon new friend I mean I got a p20 but I may be useless hey Pete faint Mozambique level on helmet Levon shields I am pretty good to go some may say I'm looting McGrew T he's been a lot of while since I've actually said that but he's definitely one of those times when that phrase applies especially I'm pretty sure I've got bet better stuff than my teammates a name this closed-off blew his chance right behind him and my turn she doesn't have any shields please stop doing between you me that if you just want to heal up good shrunk my friend here oh my gosh she teammate just about I mean that's not bad considering I was afk Silas come grab your stuff shields got he levels golf shields name a bit of a waste of too soon juice when you've got gold shield it's kinda nice to keep the lower needs to be honest all right good news friends I've got my ultimate and they're going straight to the trainer vaults I'm gonna steal the good loot and we're gonna run off into the sunset somebody's destroying that cargo but are no friends but I've got a okay now always going over he's gonna be Amanda maniac I mean I appreciate the aggressive play I have tried to do heavy rains in it I'm gonna die that no I might be part see what I'm shooting iPilot you I don't know where you were teammate you want to despite these people okay they've got a vault key that ruins the fun that room is all the fun do not need a hot key we've got Lobos Ultimates we can maybe save it and run to the other vault perhaps we should be nice got myself ultimate experience as well which would be decent for obviously doing it as many times as possible that's the plan we can loot this one vault slimming just head over to another one let us keep using ultimate accelerants and then keep getting the good loot that's the plan that's a plan of action I just heard is your phrasing kind of news on either one of my goons teammate there's a this purple shield here someone chilling in that somehow meets the roof that's not fair you just walk past blue fields how are you gonna walk he didn't have any shields but he did have a second volcano already got gold shield and a golf helmet this is this is ludicrous and this one gold item here the other one is unlocked I mean the other one is looted it looks like my teammate this is yours because there's one gold Wiseman here and I've already got this everything else is purple annoyingly to vault keys I don't think I've ever had 2 volt keys released I don't remember the last time this has happened to me alright let's get the heck if we go to fit and go through the one I still want to know if you can loot the vault whilst the alarms going off I assume so but up it'd be nice to see if there's any kind of special interaction over big chilling my ladies to realize my ammo count is horrendous alright let's set the alarm off this has got a decent load of stuff I'll let you have every other gold item in the game the discipline on one guess it does it cancels the it's consciously alarm which makes sense completely that's how an alarm would work I'm not really sure what I was expecting but it was nice to test at least slightly skin as well shredded okay amazing take that I'm too sore why for some moments so just satisfying noise when you have to aim now you hear well I knew there was a bloodhound in a Watson for some reason I didn't expect you to be so close these guys are scrappy let's just grab some ammo get out of here don't need any more no more volatile it such as satisfy noise when they seen honor what's in ultimate so you keep getting there cracking shield noise it's kind of ambitious friend I don't one of them I'm messing up Tyler mr. Portsmouth may help have you got a bubble are you got a football are we good Nazism Riley the pony can't you can't kind that big rock either I was trying to escape by doing a bit of rock climbing didn't work it I just got buffed by the lifeline I'll let you have every Goldust won the game what does he's got for me God think though not too bad there's a squad sin RNG somewhere that didn't want to get involved with us I got the Boise noises so bad here we go found him it's crap restock on shields there's love between us it's definitely decoy there's no I'd be standing there if I can back up and go for a little bit of a flank there are the commits are tickled in the man's been successfully tickled annoyingly the devotion off seats from the best guns in the game maybe even the best gun but firing at that distance it's kind of tough to control the recoil way better to be closer to them but these Spicer it's not a high range nice take this it's maybe Street that's a fact that's not fair whatsoever I may be the first bracelet direct of all time I'm telling you I so want to be closing this book and just keep so much good I'm chilling I mean I practice field smile nice if you want damage that would be it was messy it was definitely messy that wasn't green at all but a win is a win my friends we open two vaults we'll set the alarm off and we won the game apex champions oh okay that's not too bad nearly 2000 damaged that game isn't too bad we spent a lot of time looting the vaults considering the circumstances I'd serve is pretty good game thank you for watching I very much do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
