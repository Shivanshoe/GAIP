hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are taking a look at watson's new heirloom coming out on tuesday it's called the energy reader and boy are people mad now i got these comments from the apex legends subreddit and jimbo says thanks i hate it and ryj replies what is wrong with the sock full of batteries now if you don't know or if you don't remember this was a 28 000 upvoted suggestion in the subreddit by the bogus gas man and honestly i could see this working it just put all the duracell batteries or any batteries you know other battery manufacturers are available into a sock and if you hit some of that it might do as much damage as like bloodhounds axe unlikely egg asks can i get a price check on this item over here and i i can see the resemblance it does look like a price checker just with more electric and more pixelated nessies on there by paul asks all the watson mains in this subreddit are you acceptable with this wells sr says no x crossed by w says no dank sinatra says no jimmy says no and i sort of get it when you compare it to reverend scythe or bangalore's i'm not really sure what kind of sword that is is it a machete is it a scimitar i don't know but in comparison it does the kind of weak but i don't think it's that bad i think it has potential but i suppose the problem is they have so many options with watson as she's the electric character there are so many good suggestions that may have been a lot better or a lot cooler than this item whatever it may be an energy reader but people are angry what do you guys think about the heirloom are you disappointed are you looking forward to it let me know in the comments thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends let's check out this area oh where are we mate genuinely i've never landed here before it's a new experience whoa i had an end game here that was sick was the end game or was it like first ring but there was two squads left no it was a rank game and that was like uh it was like the last two squads in this little place it was kind of cool it's a cool place where i know where it is where are we oh lightning rod okay this is the place yeah this is the place where this they're really loud it's loud it's just it's just a lot it's just noise there's a

actually yeah they're not here if they were still here i'd say fair play mate you deserve that kill for being that patient you know oh she just closed her oh did she yeah i saw it i'm sorry that you inking stuff mate they're gonna be like oh they're taking the gravity they're two low balls deep i think that's our teammate no no it was this one i saw it i saw it they they've yanked everything

way up top holding this door ah i got scared of your old i know it wasn't you it was our teammates and i put my i put my opponent i was like why isn't destroying it yeah i was hiding from that all right oh yeah almost broker most awkward angle cracker she jumped to the left right this way big progress underestimating the power of holding hands in this game no i know mate i'm i've got it three times on a still kill somebody this is because i got a three times on a 30 30 so i'm just trying to third party people arranged like that you see it's raining replicators a lot of portals over here right there's a full team inside there's a different guy on the roof track that guy oh if you see another three times let me know okay there's two teams just juicing that little part be careful over that way yeah i've been i've been scanned so they know another two teams are on the left they're looking down on me yeah backed right in for 61. on the way oh my god was it that guy that hit me did you just throw my fence oh no i think they did there's nothing outside there already oh the ashes look at me through the window three times in here looking through the windows i don't have multi lots of fences right here there you go no thank you i have no med kits in the storms coming in um nice huge there's quite a med that was fun made that was so much fun i'm just shack caps in that situation he's on for 74. that's about as good as he's gonna get i should have used more fans though i wish i had my ultimate earlier i guys don't have it still uh what's the quickest way to down the right i think [Applause] darn it i don't want to put it drops like on the 30 30. i feel like it's a lot yeah it is get him out uh teams are wrapping left on me one one one left the other one on the right on the back what am i stuck on oh yeah i'm in a bad spot yeah i'm going to come back i've down the revenant over there so i'm slow healing i think this team just grew up on our left it seems it's on the roof are they getting on the back oh they went to the other entrance i guess actually wake up there we shot some throw balls someone's closing into there's a revenant still around this just be careful she's cracked on the roof nice job i'm in shortcut mode yeah he does yeah one has a crazy i think it's the octane carefully spilling still mate all right yeah i'm just trying to shoot this other team i don't know i don't know what he's asking for oh my god i don't have an ankle on that guy he's getting we can push our team yeah i have it two times on this massive since they're pushing i'm getting on the roof they're now they're so thoughtful yeah he's lining it up so how are they not getting shot in the back i guess they're locked down i should have got six percent we could inch up to the fence i think 98.99 i'll let him go first he went in he went in get back guys he's in the dagger i know where they 33 i did good damage up top yeah i did a lot of damage up top nice i'm gonna shot from another team where where are they bar it's on my head i gotta move i don't want to go off things one i think i hit the goddamns down yeah nice job i got stuck on everyone there they're in the middle i think they're pushing another over there oh just be here right yeah she's a little bit of his background i don't know what she's doing yay a green craver it's christmas green oh that crab was scary it was why didn't they shoot the other team i guess they were waiting for us to big scrap i don't know they waited way too long though that was a great game
