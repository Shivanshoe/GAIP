hey what's the Geiser to reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today I have another a ranked game for you these lobbies are so much fun it's outrageous everyone takes their turn to fight it it's great to be honest with you but we're promoted today all the way up to gold but the lobbies have stayed pretty much the same from my personal experience there are almost like four separate lobbies on apex rank to have bronze through gold which is all pretty much the same and then once you hit platinum it gets a little bit more difficult as we're against Platinum's and also diamond players who are trying to make masters and then the final two types of love these are like the high diamond of masters predator solos and then the predator three stacked log is after that and I like this series because hopefully we'll get to experience most of these lobbies adventure it's not always going to be as easy as it is at the moment we'll progressively get more and more difficult as it goes on but I am enjoying these lobbies in the meantime also my video from yesterday was 4c flagged as unsuitable for advertisers so it stopped getting sent out on notifications and recommended last night's if you missed it be sure to watch it after this game both are really fun games so yes thanks for watching I do appreciate it I'll see one in five seconds my friends cap careful friend careful that the jumpmaster once it's got this plane you know what it's stayin there alright whenever on earth this place is called it is mimi-rose when we are here and we are in someone and if we have a good game here my thirty certain will be a promoter fyodor web to the dizzying heights a gold for gold for I think I can make good this is definitely what I would consider to be something good team we know they'll ended up top and if they're all London at the same compound these guys are going to be unlooted McGrew seed you know they're gonna have nothing absolutely nothing and haven't they got high grains fuzzy in the shrubbery I let this guy hit me a little bit because he is our ranking go the Evo shields and then I will city from you and now I've got a bit of progress on my Evo shield you know elite tactics that most people you can see they're getting shot on purpose to have someone else level up your Evo chilled you know it's just things like needs two little tips along the way that can help eat wasn't it we've wasn't actually what I just want to do but he did help to me like twenty nine damage that's a dream well your friends then if you're in the drone is a to v3 oh swine you fast I always forget how quickly you can find the triple tape oh sure what a man has been practicing lately good grief he's getting good I can't even hear that my shields if I level it up here so we just rush this guy it's got a triple take and maybe two sets of footsteps token I think - I can't live on my shields or your friends I think you guys are struggling - right this is triple team this men get him out of here watch this don't watch that didn't mean to vault me I don't Rudy fancy chasing this guy too much longer for one I don't know where he's gone and - I have no Lutz mean he goes mr. just a few shield cells would enable me to rush a little bit more here ourselves any shop sells going for you bought any at all would be greatly appreciated no not one shield sell that's gonna be it I heard the s I heard the pinger heard the s I thought was gonna be shield itself but it was not all done the x-craft going on someone's flying someone's getting shot at these supply bins are eluted down lowe's looted okay I didn't mean to launch myself off the edge give me a second here friends I'm just gonna there's going to be something in here guaranteed this is so bad hey there we go I can heal up my Evo shields but bad news oh there we go I can actually level it up afterwards as well may alright let's go let's go try and set priorities I don't know if they're still chasing each other what's going on here but one one was flying there we go I'm always getting shot at he's real close is he oops that's always hard Ange risky standing on the wall when there's a team behind me but no television on the team that they kept shooting did you just go up top be good teammates she's chasing me why stop I just need edibles I'm gonna take everything Phoenix kit don't show battery at all med kit I believe in you I don't even have two weapons at the moment give me a sec I'd rather lose up first make sure I have enough stop oh my god you do no finishing me that's brave that's what the flower one's good at not like the medium-range chopping news now no just said we're gonna take Avenue kill later the two coffee and it's me it's avatar quick gonna punch me off a cliff or something okay that wasn't my killer Pamela what is this fight a sea slug the 15 that showed up here our honey will keep track of who I've killed who I haven't killed I didn't even get an assist for that which means it an enemy team stole my kill she would submit five half fell over like little cucarachas octane would say actually amazed what it's launching I'm gonna drop it it's gonna eat it across shells is that you with the triple take your the drone earlier on was that you what are you doing it's the mess this three of them I'm trusting your friends is team number eight I believe the shield was still challenging I'm insulted that you'd even try that just just for that I'm gonna cook you up cook coupon the thermite pay the thermite mix never mind we can kill these team guys all they have is high ground we are the superior players okay every single one of those shots mixed I'm not the superior play it's one guy dead Oh God to be fired I think so though use that before my favorite good of all time I mean the flatlines benefit here miss here mainly miss really but it just comes in clutch when they're like sort of short to medium range if they have like an SMG and they stop meeting in there to reload but um I just keeps cupcake another team I don't know I can't even see what's going on it's a decoy we need to get up on a cross we can't we can't fight down the anymore I'm sick of fighting down this staircase this is like the ultimate low ground I could spend during ourselves here I think we just wrap around into human the side or swim in the back or something be on the wrong side of the train unfortunately this is what it's only known in the business as a diamond level flank speeding that's a decoy scout the 19 pretty good thing there we go the diamond level flank work tanks I mean these lobbies are species outrageous this is an outrageous amount of fun these lobbies are unbelievable like let's everyone third parties but they do it one at a time like a Power Rangers movie if all eight teams are there at once there's no way we we survived it I mean there's a chance there's a one in eight chance you would assume but it's a small chance but when they come one at a time like that they wait for the other team they form an orderly queue is what I'm trying to say here in Sauber which makes it a ton of fun because you never get overwhelmed but there's always constant action hereis crap in the distance going on as well we matches the fight bear for two full rings of this door coming in what the rink is it's cold I have 11 kills many people - for life I need eight out of 12 for a no sorry 9 out of 12 obviously I can do nice for a 20 bomb I don't have the 20 bomb badge on life line doesn't like it's gonna happen here I mean it would have been 8 but I had my kill stolen and that lug that big scrap friends you can either go across the zip line on the left or I'm gonna use this film because I can land on top of the building rather than turn upon the edge of the edge of the cliffs not seen a future today there's a ton of bad news apparently good I silver [Applause] my teammates fighting it's a bad idea it's a bad idea diluting a shot you again oh there should be one more unless this boat has a goal not a blue interrogate him interrogating a string all right one one squad left pointless looting you don't you don't need anything for one squad you need about 100 bullets and maybe two shell batteries max you don't need to be fully looted to take on the last team what you do need is good positioning it so kind of mad too much but I just want to find them I want to keep the I want to keep the action going here I thought I heard more people down here River but no maybe I was their last of him I thought they would have come out by now surely yeah that's the Royal dear friend if you see him give me a pink alternative is in spectrum six I might go for a flank I might I might diamond level flank again I don't wanna fight up the hill like this it's just horrendous especially when they're all split up it's difficult to gain cover from all of them at the same time so if you find yourself needing to he'll never properly work same speed as a Devo please pray anything this revolted anyway so how much of a problem it's so good you can start this game many people get so good with snipers washed-up teammate tell me there we go fairly certain that is going to be a via final gaming silver here I think we have been a promo to fight Dean Tigers too long actually these silver long as he feels like it feels like early on apex with no skill base and 3200 could have been a little bit more but we weren't such a disadvantageous position during the entire early on scrap we had to keep going to the low ground to heal up and then having to go all the way back up the stairs to get a bit of high ground to actually join the fight if we're at the high ground they're supporting to the 4000 damage game back-to-back in ranked it would have been checked out the team two kills for the Mirage but definitely deserve them all with 1300 probably stomped some kills I would assume 5 kills for our team it's same story to be honest probably deserved a few more actually no mine was right on track about 200 damage per kill I think enemies mr. stone not kills there and I tell you what I'm absolutely furious about it deeply rank up there that is the question 213 RP up I was basically there any realize I made it to gold I'm a half way to God 3 as well thank you for watching I do appreciate you know see you all in the next one
