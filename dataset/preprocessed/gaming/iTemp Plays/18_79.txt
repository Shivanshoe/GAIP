hey what's up garage switch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i finally got to try out the buffed g7 escape and i say finally because obviously it's in the care package and you don't always get to use those guns every single game when the g7 was placed into the care package they reintroduced one of the most op hop-ups that we've ever had uh double tap this was so good on the g7 back in the day you turn it into a bit of a cheese weapon it was that good however the problem was it wasn't the same it was it was a terrible version of the double tap and for a long time i have got the g7 from the care package and instantly turned off the double tap it's just not worth using but they reduced the recoil and they increased the fire rate of the double tap up up and they also gave the g7 mod bullets as well so now it's an actual machine my favorite gun is back i hope you enjoyed both the games that i have for you today thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos oh god you're you're ruining it you're ruining it no this one might this one on my door that's a detour i've used all these guns how is this gonna work now that's tricky i only have an old saying enemy lady dead already it was you know they have arm switches in here i have eyes on the enemy that strings farther big nate angle big nade angle we kill the kill leader they all right my scandal swim in here another scout recharge i think got another squad why'd he say that that's weird i don't know i didn't hear that i don't like that i got my two time on the p20 not on the 301 uh i think you need to change that little a little swappage but what are your thoughts on that that's pretty bad wait what someone's alright what'd you say oh no maybe probably not to i mean both of them are just annihilated british british recharging my shield i think yeah definitely opening fire lead with the hammers baby i needed the hammers oh yeah i told you my primary g7 this guy's down another guy wow we need to go and we need to uh well we're going to get the phone enemy landed don't say sorry this guy's literally killing everyone he's on at least 10 kills maybe 11 now nick's on 11. yeah these guys drivers two kills so this right here target there on you they're miles away i'm all's away someone val caught it though so i love alcohol when the bullets are so slow the octane is like around here somewhere there's someone over there yeah that guy's got red maybe he's the guy for 36 flesh too he was that way this way let's go there's a respawn behind us i hear inside maybe up top she's a valve we can just go for the rose i guess there's a lo there were a load of boxes this way they might come down here that's my prediction okay not too bad of a prediction well they might stay over there and die yeah it was a really bad prediction i don't want to tell you it's something like that really dumb very stupid valk trying to get more bats uh let me know if there's any more in there there's not my favorite i have uh i have three you need one mine no i got four i don't know why i was asking where did you get four from i was walking around with one i don't know i think i don't know i don't know i don't know how long i didn't know i wasn't aware big third party angle big goodbye oh it's him how did he get over here i was trying to kill him earlier oh i feel good about this character what clothes are they both no they're both back there all right i'm not that bad colton they're going to lie they're going to go here with me over here i was gonna ask if you could get a bed in a windows that you're playing mirage uh yeah you're the only one that could you can climb up there it went all the way to zone over there no they didn't they went all the way in the other side this guy has 18 this guy's on for a 20 bomb there you know i can't tell what it is it's just a it looks like a spitfire they're i mean i can't can you climb up there yeah there's a way to climb it sir i've never tried it i cannot drive in position almost broke one i'm up top you're up there by yourself i mean i'm just pushing it i'm not going to climb this rock don't make they're not a bit there they're she's flash she's flesh p20 nice nice line i got a rampage like always i mean it's not even like it's just guaranteed that you're going to land right there yeah it's your choice if you're going to use it or not let me go burp he's ready to scrap i'm scared to say the rope i hear that logo i should have popped the thing first well it's not happening guys are throwing you guys are actually trying right ammo here thank you thank god 64 cracked oh my god she just got a headshot or something reloading slash one recharging my shield i gotcha oh that valve back there's one i don't have an extending mag mirage is weak i'm just gonna come get some ammo and stuff [Music] i think yeah there's one teammate too bogey now she's going down i'm gonna revive on your feet darling plenty of fight left in me just a sec healing up need shields i have one shield cell yeah team team oh one shot recharging my shields okay the horizon was literally one if okay are they near yeah they were reloading there's a definitely team here enemy here unless he was just the mirages i think he's chasing somebody yeah i think so oh there you go over there i got them yeah so just in this building i think that's awesome i vote for oh she's afraid i'm right i'm rip alone behind this corner yeah running he has white armor he's he's basically sliding yeah i mean we're kind of close yeah he's got the rope so not again oh you got one clip i'm sorry i'm sorry you got the whole he just opened his mouth and just just cut it off swallowed all the bullets up or an idiot if you didn't do that he probably would have survived why would he do that um they would have bad stocks they would still have stocks but they would have bad ones no no no someone who doesn't have stocks isn't a bad investor we try to say anyone that doesn't have stocks he's an idiot they should buy stocks like me and lose half their money that's what i do wait two weeks and then buy at the very top as high as you possibly can i think i bought it at like 400. there's a guy to my left as well so be careful can we get uh can we get over here with this uh yes they gotta charge around page oh they're over here yeah there's a full team full team three bb's like half shields broken yeah he's really low let's drop teammates there's one here by yourself left teammate did she saying she's over here well there's that's why it went look i'm gonna try and get her off this way [Music] he might be in that corner so yeah he's in that corner you see him just here rub the horizon when it cracks on that wall again left i'll kick it i'll kick you ready yep where the heck did he go he took my cue oh my god enemy here i did not hear that cracked him he's laggy though i have q12 yeah i'm with you he's above you once any throne yes yeah that's over thanks for watching it's game that's it this is a g7 affirmative punch uh i love final outlet thank you thank you ultimate ready to go darling oh yeah i think it might be a full team jeez actually got a trio one combine yeah why stole your knights waste and waste and waste them don't worry about the last zone there's [Music] yeah we don't want them to take this spot behind us yeah ashes one oh my god so close shields recharging all right that's a different team i don't think that's that's a different thing from behind yeah you guys watch this i don't watch this yeah there's cover on the other side i think this team is going around okay yeah this this team over there is they're wrapping all the way around that's good news recharging my shield got a bandit close by bandit close boy [Music] it was closer you know i heard somebody and i thought it was on the other side but i think they're close back here in a tree no cabbage i'm getting shot by a phone right now actually i'm getting shot by a christmas tree why would he blow his car i don't know he thought maybe i wouldn't see him they must be like here [Music] instead of changing weapon by accident you were panicking i was panicking skywalker a little bit panicking skywalker yeah you are there you could not dream of having the creativity to come up with panicking skywalker not bad not bad right not bad one day i'd like to get some some kill credit i really would i mean i don't know what you're doing over there i'd love to get some kills finish any kills i'd love to shoot someone and have them fall over and die i had like i have 10 knocks what are you doing over there defending your knocks quite clearly
