hey what's up guys it's reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course so season eight is nearly three weeks old which means the fuse is nearly three weeks old as well so i thought i would take this opportunity to play him again because i haven't really shown him too much love since he came out now if he uses the weird one because i do love his kit i love the zoning ultimate how he's actually useful indoors i like his passive of stacking grenades but i just do not get on with how fast he fires them i can't control it at all and i try my best to nade these guys on screen as you can see uh i know it wasn't the best scenario they were right in front of me i could have just shot them and there were two jump pads they kept using however you can see the overall grenade accuracy is very bad let me know what you guys think of fuse in the comment section i think it's a legend that probably works best from mouse and keyboard as the nades are easy to aim quickly compared to controller i'll have to give it a go but yeah thank you for watching i do appreciate in five and a half seconds my friends oh yeah i don't know i'm on zero percent pack a lot let's go for the dubs oops i mean chase my octane and a horizon but i crack them both i'm nearly cracked they're not crazy okay i have a long bone of mozam charging on my shield where are they just here oh oh that's available between them yeah they had all the heels okay i don't know about you but when i find a shield battery it's like honest one of the best moments in my life it's a nice feeling i think there's people over here they went they're on the other side i think they're chasing our teammate that was supposed to be level two heavy for so long oh my god i think there's a gun left i i hit someone for 53. i don't know if they were already down though oh my god that was that guy was alive okay nice um i stared at them for like 10 minutes i didn't even realize that that guy was not dead i saw two people down and then like they just settled and then these guys started kicking off i'll have a little bit but i really wanted those but i already have two bats here okay i'm having a good time not too bad of a start not at all this place is fun like i actually love what they do with this this area slumlex is okay it's a bit of a maze this place is way better they could definitely i just like the layout of these buildings and stuff it's really nice anything like that would have put more of it around like the multi levels and the ropes and stuff like that play potential you've got you can you can work with a lot here yeah there's not too many open spaces i like when there's not um open spaces just everywhere yeah i saw my little grenade uh two there's another one right here thank you i can't take the second one uh i have five it's fine okay kind of stacked stacked like my grenade collection you could say um i should have more but i have an r9 it just takes a lot of ammo uh let me see it does it does indeed what's the neighborhood um i don't know well i have three nades what my name collection is lacking i thought i had so many oh right meg anyway dude um there's one on my gun no no i mean uh if you see another one it out i wasn't offering it just so you know what i want it i need it way more than you do i left dropped you my light max how many times i know you can kill people with like without one oh someone got rest huh that's correct oh let me stay up thank you anyone else stand on you no i killed an octane i downed a path on me spotted over there he wanted me to go running i was the first guy hello raised guy um so this must have been another team over here i saw you just like running away from all this oh that's what he's doing he's rising that makes sense makes sense hey you're copying me i think i said it first actually i'm coming i'm just lovely far away i'm doing a bit of cardio okay i thought that was a decoy so i didn't shoot did they just give up i think he was afk pretty sure the race was afk how many days did this guy have does he know he's stuff yes he had a lot of nights i broke one up here two times in a building it just doesn't work that's why i don't use it at all i made a lot of bad decisions there especially against a bangalore she's just like zooming she's sticking with us now she knows the way i think i need more need more throwball there we go everybody want more bats oh wait what people are here my offstar what yeah loads of teams i know which way to look honestly nice you're the one at the same direction nice all those things we're is on me oh nice good work everyone i have 21 heavyweights i do not have any for you guys okay i'll find some dude r301 is so good oh my god so much better than the 99 it's crazy i'm using the 99 do not disrespect it like that so much better it's crazy if you use the 99 i'll find another right here 99 is great for like um just those close range fights are so good because when when you one clip somebody it's just like nothing feels better though with the 99 it's not satisfying i have to get rid of my flat line frags and then more frags there we go all right i'm not with you at all uh no worries i'm just on the other side of the okay the entrance i'm just trying to see if there's anybody over here i don't see anybody though oh teammates pink in the heavy i dropped it but i appreciate the things i have a bad feeling and i'm not recording just a feeling i thought i wasn't because i stopped just a good feeling um on me i don't know why i'm standing in the open it's not a good play but i'm doing it i need to use some of these nades so everyone they are not getting no one six frag grenades and i'm fine every single one at this last team okay okay i won't i won't go in and just destroy them i will let's let's farm let's just fire them i'll try my absolute best to land at least one because i'm not good with the knights you want more nades yes okay there's mum here come here i'm gonna sacrifice everything that i have one right there and then there's a few in this box thank you and there's one right here tremendous you don't even need ammo rich no no no i don't i don't i will carry ammo for you what do you need light um yes okay i'll carry light for you okay i have uh 11 i have 13 nades but it's not enough okay i don't drop
