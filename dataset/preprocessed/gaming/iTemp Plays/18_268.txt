oh you are dead mate just flew like 50 feet what was that i'm pretty sure it was a tank or some type of explosive oh there's a tank over there oh let me tell the boys there is a tank little girl let the boys know i see you survived is their team killing on this i would assume yeah oh absolutely every time you kill somebody too it gives them the option like votes you out so oh god i just want to know what it's like to take a man's life i'd i'm tempted to kill scampi over here or kill the other team they're far away that's the problem i'm facing how did you get across that road there was no problem at all i just walked over oh there was a problem i got heated into another dimension yeah i was careful the tank moved dude the tanks on the move thanks for the move over launching a nade nato i press tab it's the biggest load of in five no way to understand it why would you ever make me do that i wanted to see if i got a kill oh okay well i've got zero kills lane linen cake is requesting my unit do i let him yeah let him in i saw that guy last time he was doing some good stuff paul breeze cool breeze lemon mate lemon let him in okay i'm letting him in i'm letting him in better play by the rules though over okay even there's a light oh maybe i've gone too far you were going the wrong way i'm not uh you're definitely going the wrong way oh god no i might be going there he tells you where his go through transporting i don't know if there's people on this side of the map but i'm i'm holding do you see oleg's house here on the left we're trying to capture it yeah yeah but that's the theme you got to be on your toes you can't just be be objective hungry they're everywhere there no i'm just saying like you said you don't have people here mate they're here no i'm aware i just don't know where and i would like need to help from where i'm at is just to run in the open and i'm not going to do that oh there's no way i'm dying over we've got people there i'm sprinting on this hill i'm gonna try and get to you i think i die here though this is such a bad spot i killed someone yes nice he was chilling in our like trenches he's being a little yeah he's been a little sneaky yeah yeah yeah people are crazy patient i'm probably gonna die here oh you're really far am i actually i got people ahead of me i think i'm close to you let me shut the map oh that oh you're coming yeah you're here you're here look at this guy where'd i kill him he was here but his body disappeared is he in front of me yeah yeah in front of me is this you yes i see someone in the flick in the grass in the strawberry oh did you choose class before the game started i like i was just i'm definitely i don't even get to choose i had one option rifleman rifleman i think we might be able to go for these gopros i'm gonna save my sprint essex i know you don't get loads i'm running for it i'm going for it oh my god this is so stressful it took me about half an hour to get here so i think we or where do we go do we need it we need to get older right check the map gonna get that way yeah we need to get over there all right let's see oh my team died they were close yeah further this way actually good team you got the smg close range i can't get through them pretty far i don't know if you can hit him i probably can't oh he went he went down i think he went prone though somebody just went from left he's in he's in the open right now he's right in the open i don't have a compass i see who you shooting knife oh i hit him he's he's behind this close-up building in front of us i hear him he's on the bottom okay i got him i got someone nice nice nice that might have been another guy oh my god is he in the building oh this one is in the hook mate in the hook with us he's in the hook with us oh he's he's in it yeah he's here i'm here all right all right coming in and coming in hot coming in oh we're taking over we're taking over there's no way what's in the game did it let you change guns no i'm lying down sniping about four centimeters from my screen oh what a shot i'm just gonna try and get the whole leg oh a headshot double kill double kill nice getting tested they know i'm here now they're coming for vengeance oh another headshot all these guys are just i think these guys got revived like a car is that what it is moe's in the gun so it's like a conor t8 it's basically like a sniper no scope oh that's sick that's what i that's what i want i'm just a rifleman i don't know if you can doesn't let me it just gives me smgs every year maybe give me some juice that's because i'm the rifleman it might be random i think you're forced to play rifleman and then it kind of just gives you whatever all right maybe i don't know that's probably not right i don't know what the buddy travel time is like oh i died from a tank oh lord i am dead i'm beyond help i've got a bunch of kills though okay i'm dead we're left to our left far left sounded kind of close god damn it this game sucks i don't see anyone wait i think i do i do i got him i got him nice is he begging you okay well i don't understand why you're doing that you're going into the spawn it's embarrassing he was standing bush yep he let you literally let both of you guys walk by just to shoot me well you were closer so you've already saw us all running over as a human picked his man just pic he picked the weakest man he let you guys walk by it's fine yeah we were too much of a threat that's how that that's how that works no no no he wants to he kills me first because i'm the threat that's how that works no but he wasn't sure he could kill us in one bullet we're too tanky too strong someone said why are you at oleg mate that's what i've spent on my whole game trying to get to where's these guys where are they going there's like 20 of you at oleg and then the wrestler over here oh yeah oh yeah he just like lost everything yeah i'm back at spawn helping the boys all right i might just run out and die then try and get back this is why because you were obsessed with oleg i'm not going to run for it i'm sure you guys are just slowly dying off over there there's only like i would be oh another one just die oh no we're just fine there's like four of you now there's only four of you guys are just dying who's shooting us my teammates just got shot who shot you who saw you you just died right next to me that's a tragedy oh no you guys are just disappearing it's just me yeah you got like two teammates but they're far they're yeah like north i doubt mate i just don't know i just don't know the guy's like why are you oh legs i'm like why not we've been trying to get this whole game i'm gonna open the map wait did i kill that guy what a shot i can't climb i can't climb uh i think well that's athena's i think you have to use riflemen until but why is he giving you that gun i don't know honestly maybe it just gives everybody sorry i think i'm dead as you were saying i've got a beautiful headshot i don't know what these words mean that they're saying help on commander's enemy op what help on commander's enemy op marker um i'm making a run for it okay i died okay there we go nice dude wait i've got a 1.1 kd i've got wait i got one sector capture i had 17 kills how does it say that go personal stats bomb left that's what i said like i kept shooting people and not seeing him and i was like i don't know if he's dead or just lying down g f guitar gene f squad you guys are not doing good we're mike right we're on mike we were mine definitely us we were but no
