hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going to be using the havoc which has been both a really good gun and a pretty bad one in recent seasons last season it was worth picking good but it felt outclassed by other weapons but in season 9 respawn has given it a bit of love by decreasing the early pattern recoil making it easier to control the havoc is definitely one of my favorite guns to find off drop because you can always kill people with a magazine that has like the big baseline magazine it's it's huge throwing a little recoil buff as well and you're looking at a pretty solid choice of weaponry now before the video starts i want to shout out my second channel i've uploaded two battlefield one vids over there recently and there will be a titanfall 2 let's play starting sometime soon on that channel as well it's like a passion project for me that i do in my spare time playing some other

see you all in five and a half seconds my friends well people like you know don't like that other people speak differently sometimes but like when you come to the when you come to like the us like you

dialects and their own phrases it's weird i'm what how am i walking there hold up get oh i'm i was expecting more recoil from this have it oh yeah no did you overcompensate yeah i was like shooting at the ground there's one way way way hey pat is actually cracked situation hundred thousand lifeline kills there's no car car car all right it's gonna happen might be something good this way yeah there's still ones uh once you're left too couple you need to crack some purple oh my shots i'm dead can i go back on the go uh yeah i was kind of confused too i keep thinking this is duos i don't even see where she flew i thought you were over here but i guess you braces it or something i was i was i was over there any turbos any turbos i should probably should have put that in here from this they're um fighting up here i think they actually just killed him i can't wait to meet them oh easy kills oh i'm not really using my r99 though so i guess it's fine um i can have a little look i have a gold one no turbos on this map it's the hardest thing to find in the game wait i see care package i don't want these two times oh the gun up top oh there's a gold bag the stew train extended level close range to havoc you just fire that bad boy oh yeah just spray it oh uh right flying in playing in um the entrance okay it was a blue bathroom so yeah i guess i should have just stayed here oh rodney who's little rodney no blasty's son okay oh sorry so expect to visit from laurel rodney coming soon he's not pleased he's not going to be happy do you apologize well stevie oh there's actually a guy scanning i'm so dumb oh don't you throw hands at all she's throwing hands impressive look at the team i'm scanning the beacon the whole time i couldn't tell we should we should get that intel now we killed them we should have like distracted the info should the cats are alive threaten to like break our kneecap or something get the infer i'm the guy you see i hate all the barbecues just ran into a wall it's a last time he's pretty low how low i don't know i'm not good enough twenty-four is low though right fancy [Applause] help me get the turbo hurry oh you got it yes okay you kill him with it watch this i don't expect it oh oh oh who's laughing now i am the distraction oh come on oh my god i didn't reload i didn't even know okay i wanted i'll stop shooting i wanted to punch butcher right in the cranium don't worry i've got a third person weapon on the go oh dude that was my kill i mean out stinky wants us to go that way big the big stink they call him oh there's a team in here practically i think what's that in the pan i'm taking the pad i [Music] oh thank you oh you don't worry recharging my shields oh there's more oh please taba table table no those are pathways that run off there's one over here oh yeah oh he's uh grappling outside uh he's up top he's up top oh he's on the outside right here this way kill him pop into medkit okay ah oh let me take cracked that is all you the energy does not exist uh i have 151 sway if you need some dumb i'm alright right now you must have forgot slide it out for the boy uh what are you doing taking this rope and as soon as i can grapple over here he's so stupid weapon i don't care what anyone says yeah it is extended heavy mag here hello surprised he's alive i'm not all these guys are uh really laggy flying laggy flying black fly okay i keep flying i can hear him yeah yeah i'll see him i see him jack they're gonna i have a rope i don't know what they're doing i don't seem taken reload i think i'm dead no i don't see anyone little status reports you probably uh grab some quickly from there if you want like a shield at least please no problem sorry i couldn't uh nothing you could do that nothing i one of the one of the main things i hate about lifeline uh lifeline rez is it just makes you play differently uh yeah i dove down because they're getting a lifeline raise like and because if he was just that team it was an easy win but yeah i wasn't sure whether to like uh because the the lifeline res is in such a weird spot so i just and i just like froze for a second also i don't think you can shoot the drone anymore because i saw ragtag doing the play test like on this video of the play test and it didn't work i think you have to first yeah i mean that would make sense yeah the losing the shield isn't anywhere near as bad as a lot of people are making it out to be like still so strong you can revive two people at once afk hey yeah because it makes you just like kind of panic and i think that's the main thing is like you you you kind of just force decisions which eventually doesn't work out yeah especially you've got to go back because your choices are do a hundred damage to the guy again revived in first them or do a hundred damage to the lifeline he's actually showing you the only thing it's not as good at now it's just yolo raising in the middle of the open for free yeah having like a free piece of cover for you to just like play around yeah that's the only thing that's not as good at night i think i heard people shooting over here okay i'm in a good spot now i got all my loot back i just had my all too oh wait can i you okay okay guys okay guys 994 on this guy one of top friends someone uh on the top of his book and he has a white shield i only just got to purple so she's not like these guys on the ropes i hate fighting on this like slanted hill that's the mind yeah i want to turn my head nice this is so awkward the habit feels nasty though god get me off of this slap i i just feel like i should tilt my head or something it feels like the game yeah it feels so awkward and i can't hit any shots when i'm i'm on there activating you get me involved normally i'll use my rope uh right in front of me easy kill 15 damage do this taste amount of damage i think they're all down i'm nice first damage okay all right there's damage yes yeah all right then i'll take it oh just shut wait that mace no way it went right through me apex champions oh nice good job good job nice nice nice thank you
