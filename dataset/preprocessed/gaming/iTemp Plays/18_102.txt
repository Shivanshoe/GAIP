hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and every now and again the stars are line and you find hammer points at the start of the game with a p2020 or a mozam or an re-45 and i am so happy that they brought hammer points back because they make those guns viable into the mid and even the late game but if you're trying to focus on using it if you're trying to find a p20 with hammer points you're not going to find most games you have to have those stars aligned in most of the games if you want to use this and in this game it's what kept us alive for the most part it was such a great game i hope you enjoyed thank you so much for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my a friends that might be something good this way please be gone please come please become please be completely gone please be good there's no way you're pinging me two times shotguns this place is i don't know why people like landon here like no one can enjoy this there's no way but does anyone actually know what's going on here yeah i agree with my shocking ammo oh heavy literally i have nothing there's no way you have hammers right i could have been a contender and i am no this is going soft right here cracked an enemy shield reloading yeah get out of here get out of here we gotta go we gotta go recharging shields oh man oh that's huge i could use that that place sucks it sucks i have so much heavy i have a hundred heavy giving that's like such oh my god that was funny though i'll be honest i don't want to admit it but it was funny though wasn't it heavy ammo here what a shaping shield cell huge i have 12 cells if you need those thank you though i said this made key at 120 i have 10 okay he should be fine then should just go get involved again who cares we stabilized i've got it two times on this stupid gun uh get that out of here i might just take this heavy just because it might have been useful great already inside the ring all right we're back what's happened since we left hostile right here [Music] see you idiots thanks a plane over here do you know what if i have more light i'd probably take this yeah i'm gonna do it let's just do it do i have the two times still closer is it on the right gun yes i'm gonna try and craft some uh some light rains i guess oh my god 200 i could use that oh nevermind huge oh man that was fun i have a point harry coming in coming i might as well take it for those shield cells all right we survived there's a trident southwest hostile over there troy zipline deployed like are they just living there or what i think i see one what's that [Music] shields [Music] there's a fight over here he died in the sight from corset gas that's hilarious i mean these guys are still fine this way i am taking fire friends making contact with enemy he's gonna bat giving my shields a recharge huge humongous game recharging that cryptos are live somewhere still i think it's the most ridiculous game of our generation here look at this i got more light rains than frames you need bats shield battery here i had two where's this crypto gone [Music] oh trick shot first thing to do to crypto is just honestly just get both sides of him i'm actually going to take this because i saw a low brawl in this one i think maybe that one only two enemies there are two squads left the first ones just finished by the way don't worry i got five i got five bullets so we're all good we're all set for a big a big fight they're shooting that seems to fight my ultimate is ready oh god he's gonna hit me throwing thermite grenade out we can't go that way we can't go down low we can't go down anyway we can't go down low they're gonna drop on us careful need light ammo giving my shields a recharge this isn't really going to end here or anything we're just going to have to go behind i think but let's giving my shields a recharge but the team might fly from underneath to be careful i think we just go zone only 30 seconds left on the clock the rings close i don't really have the bullets because they went in the door let's go this way can we go this way they're gonna have to come inside so who's ready to fly trying to get timur to catch up we can maybe just hold them here but to be honest this is not really going to do too much damage no one's going down because i think there's just a team top poking they're just doing poke damage i don't have the i don't have the bullets to partake in a poke damage situation got some light rains though they're going down now no teammates i wasn't sure what the uh what the situation was like with the the team that they were third or the team that was third in us you know as if we won that game that's actually so stupid that we won that game that was a lot of fun though oh played what played i had 14 kills since when started a lot from team i did what like 500 more damage and i had eight more kills for 500 damage maybe maybe i stole some you know i'm not gonna i'm not gonna argue against that there's a very slight chance i stole some of the kills gg sir
