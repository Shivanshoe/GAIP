hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the 3030 repeater and if you're only here for the 30 30 gameplay then skip to the second game because i do not use it in the first game that i have for you today now when this gun was announced i was so excited for it because i was and still am a g7 scout fanatic as you guys know but i suck with a 30 30. i find that it's good when you aren't actually in a gunfight if someone is looking back at you and firing at your face you just get beamed because you cannot strafe to avoid gunshots also the recoil is a little weird because it feels like it doesn't reset so you have to adjust your aim after every shot even on a static target when you hit consecutive shots though this gun can put out some real damage and that's what's annoying about it i know it can be good but i'm not good with it let me know what you guys think about the first 30 in the comments and also let me know if you play on mouse and keyboard or controller with those thoughts as i assume this gun is better on mouse and keyboard so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah oh we did the opposite mate i landed i'm saved oh i thought you were a full story ah i landed in uh this three or three story whatever i have a spitfire i feel that's a crackling let me tell you that's the one that scuffed me too some people in here level 3. team west absolutely destroyed down here oh if i didn't miss every shot no she's weak her teammate's on me they're both flesh for some reason even the octane oh or what oh my god he got the balls there's another team like east thank you wait what will i do why am i running away from that see a ball let me know okay see any bats let me know all right i have oh no oh wait all right on me i have one as well i know my gun wasn't loaded um i have two it's fine you sure oh sorry come on did you get the kill yes nice okay that's all that matters [Music] sorry i asked you for a bat well i didn't realize i had one oh well i stopped in the in the heat of battle it's a droppy one so it says a lot about me as a teammate it does actually uh probably it probably would break it then let me put it on there i should have saved my pad why would you line them all up so i can just shoot every decoy at the same time it's mind games it's not my game try not to get blown up hold on one of them is a vodka's one i think about creating healed oh it's shocking okay meet me i'm all right oh missed your shot there's no way it makes every shot there oh i had a white ball but still white bolt eva is so bad it's just you don't oh this guy had a purple shot he might have taken a shocking ball i can't get used to the rhythm like i'll get used to the level three cause i spend most time with level three yeah and then once you once you're like with a white bolt or a no ball it's just so awkward to get tough brady's could be both you could be off your head i usually am we're running oh what's in here is i think there's somebody else behind them no he doesn't where's that don't know i went like left this place oh wait we should just go back where we came from oh team entrance mate okay messed up legends week yeah it changed because of my suggestion on twitter.com 100 um yes fact that's the fact they said can you get out of the way mates who is shooting me huh uh yeah you crazy are you out of your mind dude i did i always hesitate to do it at first all right i'm i still have to pop bandages [Applause] yeah i say we kill this team yep really upstairs oh my god he's actually up there i shield let's get by something else any med kits i've had i don't think i've had one mick at this whole game nope not in here oh my god if i have to perform strange this game i'm gonna stop somebody okay i have no light though like literally yeah yeah i um i 45 space all right i'm just going to drop my gun 440 on purple uh my floor i killed an enemy this is a lifeline in the corner she's broken reloading here oh there's definitely people here oh yeah that was on it was a huge portal it's done i know i'm way hold on me this one inside on me for 17 shot caps i mean this isn't the range supposed to use that right one moment ten seconds that fight took away longer than i need you uh yeah that shot caps on a decent range so i missed everything so uh oh that's not that's not ideal i was watching uh i was watching a youtube video yesterday and it was a it was a doctor disrespect like playing apex for the first time in months and plays one game and just instantly i saw that live i saw that line is there one way lifeline i think and he was he came across like a duo and they were like and he ran straight and he got beans in the back right yeah i've watched that bike that was hilarious i was just i just could not stop like he was no feeling too he's doing like no film guys mania no mobility legend 2018 if i told you i was hitting every single shot right now would you believe me yeah okay okay okay i hate something right recharging shields interesting name only one fight i missed ever uh yes i heard a lot anything going on no no you did it let me tell you soon shot caps everybody forgot i got you friend giving my shield to recharge sending out my decoy uh i didn't no that was the last team and i know why did you leave her why not that was just awful on me you are the apex champions you
