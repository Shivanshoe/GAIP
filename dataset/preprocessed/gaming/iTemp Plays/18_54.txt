hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are using this season's controversial gun there is always one last season it was the flatline but it's been the hemlock the havoc the r301 the eva eight even pretty much every gun in the game at one point or another has been that season's controversial weapon the gunning question here is the wingman and i agree that this gun is powerful but only in the right hands it is a skill weapon you are not going to see a below average or average player absolutely popping off with this gun it's not easy to use but if you do know how to use it you can do some serious damage i've tried using it more and more in the last three or four seasons to get better with this gun and even though half the time i am truly awful the other half of the time i actually get some pretty solid kills and it's so satisfying to use and it's really fun which at the end of the day is the point of playing i'm accompanying this weapon with the i9 my favorite ground look smg and i think this will do me proud in season 13 it's my main loadout that is unless it goes into the care package a lot of people are calling for this gun to get into the care package it has made a bit of a comeback as of late for a while the wingman only spawned in with i think it was five bullets a magazine and it fell off massively in popularity because it was too hard to use without attachments at the start of the game now people are starting to get frustrated with this gun what do you guys think i think it's fine the way it is and i think if you make it a care package gun a lot of people aren't even going to pick you up but thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos yeah you are getting a little bit too aggressive for me i'm gonna i'm gonna need you to calm down okay all right you have called me an idiot about 14 times i'm allowed to call you an idiot okay i've got a million subs okay that's how this works oh well all right no no don't put that in the video don't put nine of these okay about 15 seconds ago that was really cringe i don't know about that i hope i have a great game so i could throw it in enemy here why am i playing octane oh i didn't see it by the way i'm an idiot i'm just literally i was just sitting there like i don't know why i was sitting there like i literally just i'm such an idiot let me know if you've seen me please i have phoenix i'll go on i finally make it you good repairing when i get out of there cause i'm kind of popping off somebody in the middle of it actually i'm gonna i'm gonna heal this blue i'm blooming rotating i got scanned yeah almost purple trying to help that wasn't even the top ropes i came from like the heavens it came from like jupiter or something should be fine i didn't probably lose this guy down here i had no time i can probably switch it off i guess okay this guy had no energy as well i'm going to use wingman again i don't think anybody there's like it's looted and those doors open but i'll see anybody when we man gamer do you remember the name for me for mills oh yeah i do

someone else is dying hold on check that does look cool if i was in the comfort of that i'll put my controller down would you would you yell would you just like freak out for like a split second i'd start screaming and say oh your next game's mode oh yeah that's what i'd do i'd do a funny meme reference and then i and then i'll shoot you in the head and i'll kill you i mean you should send your back to the lobby absolutely you're saying that like you've ever killed me you've been playing today you really want to you really want to say that have you ever killed me this is mine this is my disappointment this is mine this is mine this is mine this is mine here i think enemy at that location i think i don't know i see nothing i think you're lying like usual oh he's running for me i don't
