hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we have a new legend trailer here for rampus we chose her abilities and it gives us more of an insight on how she will play on apex so starting off with her passive we have modded loader and the description of this reads increased magazine slash heat capacity and faster reloads and recharge when using lmgs and the minigun and this is interesting because lmgs haven't really been too good they haven't been meta recently the spitfire used to be a really good gun but it got nerfed a few times so it's not so much anymore the all-star is a decent starting weapon because you can pick it up from the floor you don't need any attachments to make it good but then it falls off later into the game when everyone finds extending mags and barrel stabilizers and stocks for other weapons and the devotion uh it's always been good but obviously it's it's been a care package weapon for a while now so they'll make these weapons better than they are at the moment but only for rampat and the graffiti hop up that we got to try the other day and it's still in the game at the moment i believe uh gives us an idea of the level of buffs that we will see in this passive it's not gonna be game breaking but it will definitely be noticeable so next up we have her ability this was quite obvious from the other trailer that we had but it's called amped cover and the description reads build a crouch cover wall which deploys a full cover amped wall that blocks incoming shots and amps outgoing shots now we had a hint of this in the previous trailer but i didn't want to mention it i didn't want to speculate um i definitely had a lot of comments about it and i saw some tweets as well but it looks like this is going to be disruptive this shield is going to be the worst to play against not only can they fire at you and you can't fire at them but their shots are going to knock your shields off in like two shots and immediately i'm thinking of counters i'm thinking smoke grenades from bangalore would help cut division uh bangalore's ultimate would also help zone them away from the shields as well and you've got the mobility options so you're not stuck directly in front of the shield so you've got octane's jump pad or pathfinder's rope things like that things that allow you to get out of there because you do not want to fight someone that is taking cover behind this shield and now her ultimate it's called and placed a minigun sheila this is a mounting machine gun that anyone can use it's high ammo capacity and a long reload time but it is worth noting that this minigun was mentioned in her passive so rampat also gets those lmg buffs with her ultimate it looks devastating to be honest um and she's quite a defensive character like a setup shop kind of legend and her minigun looks so fun to use i think she might be the most useful legend they've ever added into the game straight from the get-go actually i'm not too sure because watson was really good in competitive but she's not that good at all in public games i don't know we'll have to wait and see so let me know what you guys think of the trailer and her abilities in the comments and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm going to ping this gun yes never land on me ever again [Music] i thought that was one of you then he was a pathfinder oh yeah pathfinder his path i just gotta go they're gonna only room for one oh yeah oh yeah here we go wait i have purple oh i'll take your you're blue fighting over here on me okay we're there in a sec just grabbing some stuff come on come on come on come on nice put footwork staying that's the dream oh yeah watch out for the new kill leader friend might start carrying heavy because i've got a one of those little pop-ups what the uh all the uh mapping i mean i know it's common okay still i'll still want to use character almost like the rarity doesn't match the yeah i feel like that too because i rarely find it on the floor i i feel like h cogs are the rarest items in the game feels like that i don't want to have a gold barrel for you uh i've got a blue so if you're using like an r9 or something no i i don't have a barrel as well oh he's got white eve and i've cracked him oh my way i don't want to give him three shots because i'm charging him for him there's a few over there where are they oh sorry just this way okay okay once i mean they're really weak almost there one's a call stake nice left here one's really low oh how's he live very nice there's a little bit of um strategy in this because i didn't want to give them free shots do you wait do you have any big hills like uh here's a gold barrel for you thank you i did quickly someone was healed yeah he was looking like funny i got scared i was like oh no he's gonna get i mean who would have thought the level like we've got a total level of bet 13 and we're absolutely frying people oh total level of like a good 15 solid max oh oh my god i wasn't looking i grappled into him that guy does not have aim this is 100 i would have been fried he's like pushing from behind i have no aim assist on this plastic uh revenant's really low max one one stain another caustic would you believe well what do you know um revenue went up he says blue yeah let's go i kind of shot twice nice giving my shields a recharge evil shield here dude i'll do you know on my stick on my low date i've already used this before yeah i have massive crawler i don't usually use the master same but i'm actually kind of enjoying it i got massive g7 i literally just did nothing there uh i did a little bit they destroyed the uh the revenant alt so as a victory in itself yeah i saw him just run for his life as soon as he got out of it i've got an ultimate where should i take us oh you're firing north northeast oh yeah and they are going to have to move because the zone is all the way in lava i've not been to lafayette honestly i reckon for about three years in three years you must be getting close i'll take some time and i'm just burned yeah you've got to laugh a little bit too soon yeah he's already out he's trying to set up too early my friend you've got ages left these guys at they start shooting so they probably finished them yeah it might have been a little bit more north than this what's on there i think oh it was a giveaway i thought it was a path whoa are they up top all right uh down low down though i'd ping but i have i'm still running away down here they ran more to the right i think yet bonus purple evo give me cracks down this way so his teammates will probably follow this way yeah they are just gonna watch out for zone two yeah that's actually really close to us that'll suffer before us right yeah i think so oh my god this guy's ultimate was so bad bless him i just cracked one again i wish there was a tear past red i'd definitely be there bunny feels diamond enjoyment indestructible over there all right there might go there beneath this right beneath it's right here hit the path happening he cracks give his kind of gold did he stand nice that's on the density i'm gonna try and thirst him back a little bit that's yours right yeah yeah that's mild someone's pushing him soon i broke this uh wraith or lifeline i need some shotgun am i driving used in a while but it still would be nice i have 20 20 is fine um i have some if you need some uh it's not like a desperation hours just yet i got like 30 something all right okay uh what would you like in return i'm carrying these for no reason i don't think he's gonna sweep either i'm chilling uh hold on let me there you go there you go thanks very much for the sure i have three bass as well if you need to let me know i have zero i could use one thank you all good i like that you can actually outrun the storm it's so slow oh yeah i know you never have to worry about it until a team is on you kind of thing get packaged on the right in the high ground there was definitely the player those guys didn't really stand a chance no there's like literally nowhere they could go our position was just too clean it's just gonna be please don't dad i forgot it's always like spitfires and stuff isn't it wasting my time oh yeah it is a little mod this can't get silent d mode on this mode then oh i can't wait for it to be floor loot and then get silent depot then the diva you smell my favorite gun really i don't wait did i use it no i didn't really use it i didn't really like energy guns back then oh it's just a it's so good the havoc wasn't that good but the diva was mental i i can't wait for everyone just to be running um devo uh tivo fault with like four thousand energy bullets yeah that's all everybody's gonna run right there just right here there's a team right that way i'll be there shortly we're gonna get on let's explore this i guess two of the squads the team around me played really fast almost there all good that's one these guys are launching nades at me i'm gonna get my 4k badge on pc easy i'm gonna crack this guy oh my god i'm aiming sitting these guys all over the place they're all trying to fire this is this is crazy i'm not playing them oh another team just pulling behind them oh yeah right right here i think i'll lead you just ping you down nice then i got 49 started close team still live right like here um i yeah they pro i think one of them had a res i didn't think there's anything on the ground here what's going on here i'm so confused yeah he just rose hey that was a fun game that was that was i actually like this game mode it's actually pretty honestly it's really fun uh they were but i think all three of them used g7s and we just had three different 1v1s and i just clapped all of them yeah i saw that your your armor was going nowhere do you thought i did have one of those like slanted rooftop peg glitches yeah those nasty head glitches oh you're fragging let's go fun game
