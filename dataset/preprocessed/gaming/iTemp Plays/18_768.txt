intense this game which is weird because we're at capital city for a long time and no one rocked up just a reminder that my g fuel energy code is 30 off all the way until monday you can use the code just like a deity's rage here who tweets me this to get 30 off your order if you tweet it at me i might just put it in the next video so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends uh i'm not gonna land up top i'm gonna land some lovely beneath it's a little e-brain no one's actually contested this here would you please fmg's always go first they respect the caustic yeah they they saw you and they knew i don't have confidence watson set up in that building good work we're inside the next i've got no aims this is a big idea that's a big idea no aim is this at all that girl was satisfied i'll drop you a shield nice because he had two right in the corner thank you this ulti being here is the most annoying stop it i it cuts off all my aimsies i couldn't i couldn't see what i was doing is this looted no they're scrapping the big building if you can't see it i do i really want to launch himself right here he's dropping down shieldless one's on the second floor someone's down here like literally on the ground down i'm playing all right look at that deployed up top somewhere someone's cooking right up with me recharging with the pathfinder on that roof oh someone is fleeing the scene janks we can't really do anything about it but he's right there i don't wonder if if it's the wraith they look like a wraith we hunt him down we can go out there that's like this old z point hold on a little girthy little uh oh you're inside the ring oh okay oh i hit someone [Laughter] i'm not faking it this time let's go into i don't know how i can uh look at my way up here i'm just a chunky little plastic oh i see him got the flatline kicks i fire one bullet attention all right i'm risking it i'm trying to get up close i would have okay i can smoke them on there kind of maybe i make it i made it i made it i don't think that's gonna smoke them maybe no absolutely not i'm i'm good i'm in i want for uh 19 on blue let's scout me now this is not good all right i'm in i have made i'm in nice nice nice i'll be there in a sec you take your time give me my shield do it using a med kit don't worry hit the bangalore for like 140. if anyone comes down though yeah there we go the other one the other one is i think he just went to the roof no he's down low okay absolutely shieldless i'm probably dead though nice i knew the drop down they always have to they don't have many places they can go impressive you've become the kill leader poor guys poor guys on the roof catching up yeah i know i i just pulled up with carsick yeah plus i i also love to see on on rooftop so anybody want to scrap i'm getting a microphone i'm about five seconds away from uh yeah they're fine in the air this is the thing man look at this this game is like imagine if we had this lobby right now this many left with the amount of kills we were starting with the other games yeah like nothing right now i have zero i must have stolen everything because i got four uh i think i just crashed um oh my game is breaking you're back are you i'm back i'm back i don't know what just happened i've never had that happen that's looking i was so close to punching you off the edge dude no how dare you hey i don't know what that was never seen that before yeah usually if that happens you're just completely free don't you are we going for a pinch movement over here flying v they're done fighting now unfortunately 45 again nice i hate someone milty there's like a lot of people here sick let's go i've been waiting for this moment one morning and i'm unable to move unable my vision is clear one of them has gold so just to keep him in there don't worry i got it i got it here we go some decent uh do you need batteries um i have four thank you there's another one there one sec and three more there oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait we're getting rocked up one and behind the other way too come on we might need to watch out behind you yeah they're down this way too they're crossing the street that's who's ready one okay they're all in us come back [Music] i'm gonna wrap down low [Music] another team i think oh please don't i'm literally one health i'm just trying to switch i have self-respect nice i'll try and distract or smoke it or something i'm just popping a medkit i think i'm dead this is such a bad spot for me they're just such good high ground you got this give me a sec you charging shoes might be good how did those dude on my screen there's no way those man's [Music] it's not raising let's go dude nice job bro i would have been perfectly fine i went down to that body down there and i went to swap out my evo my broken evo for a regular purple and you can't just tap oh yeah you have to hold it yeah it's so annoying i went i went to make the switch nothing happened and yeah oh that's so that was that was my play i could have went to completely opposite direction it was like we both ride each other so i was like oh if i get the armor swap we're good yeah you're good to go it's such a difficult spot for caustic too because they can't really trigger your traps too easy yeah they just rocked up late and had all the high ground on us half of one to go all right yeah yeah and they're pretty gonna push and i have no heavy i have smoke so if you need it i don't see them do you reckon we can get back there um yeah maybe worth it yeah yeah i'll dip into cover again make him stop shooting pop back to instantly and that was good well played dude thank you oh no contact if you're losing the good gun fight you just pop into cover pop immediately back out yeah don't expect it oh it's moving pretty fast let's get to this taking this this body it looks good yeah just take everything we're back in the game and i've got a dj you're good oh it's tippling my butthole oh god i'm going to open this for you i might find some goodies thank you increases rate of fire over time oh you can do it where's the where's the construction guys where'd they go oh very surprised we survived that i had no doubts i knew you were going to do it i had time well now i have a devotion yeah we're good it's like we're good nothing's gonna happen i am a little bit conflicted though you're right because there was that one that well i saw one guy for sure he went me in construction and i did not see him rotate out anyways we might be right behind them hopefully we are what if that team's in life that run away this way i'm gonna at the very beginning yeah who's the right i think with blue armor did he leave yeah yeah oh he's running real far down sideways recalling this yeah he's he's gone oh people that way too they're coming across this one we're in a bit of a bad spot here i'm going right up into this roof here i'll come with you again all the way up in here there's people right abuse i can smoke it though i think there's one and he's been out that's not good hopefully they just push heavy though shield battery here recharging shields they're on top of us right administering yeah there's one in one in each bin i think they're on the same team that's gonna be difficult yeah it's mildly annoying you got your ulti i do great for a tactical advantage what on earth do we do here can we rotate around maybe and try and sneak up the other one i feel like oh there's the i thought let's go to the massive there's a guy that's that pathfinder please donate i'm gonna go back to i'm shielding give me a second you got this dude i can tell they're not very good by the way they're moving i can tell they're not very good though it's a 1v1 the lifeline's on me the wraith is under your stairs the lifeline's on me the race was on your stairs okay that's like looting my box right now you win that 1v1 you're good oh nice let's go this way good movement i like it no painless knocking at the door she's probably just hitting her friend right she must have rest yeah big heads oh my god come on big hits though you got this it's got your divo get out the way stupid thing this is the last team oh my god it is huh you're doing good you got this you're doing good let me just reload stuff if i didn't turn the corner into a dude crouching in a corner with a mastiff yeah i know you know what i thought i heard him as well i'm going through the ring of this game inside the next ring ready are they safe in that no they're not going up that's gonna be difficult to deal with i'm running out of bullets in a hmm what is a man to do without any they're really taking you serious playing the high ground only jumping down to third they even portal down to third yeah and then they go right back up it's going absolutely it's pubs if we shouldn't be going into round six in pubs no we should not we should not oh they're both up there yes that was on point shooters they do got to jump down right after this yeah listen if they want to play like that you can you're better you got this i was addressing something are they going to jump off okay that's good big heads [Music] let's go rich don't you disrespect me by that yeah get them out let's go bro all day long let's go baby don't you disrespect me by getting this snowflake like that what are you doing dude that was rough that's the thing that makes joe's way better than trios though because if you if one of these down like you can hand two people if that was three i'm just dead like i'm just it's just game over yeah especially if they're playing the high ground like that yeah yeah
