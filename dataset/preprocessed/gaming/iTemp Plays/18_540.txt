hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some mirage here now in the last update that apex got which was on tuesday respawn putting the patch notes that they were going to fix a bug with mirage the bug was that his decoys don't have any footstep noise now i played mirage in the video today and i still don't think they have any footstep noise the decoys that is but i'm happy that they don't they're they're decoys they're holograms right why would they have any footstep audio imagine his ultimate with the eight or so decoys or however many he gets each of them stomping about the battlefield it would be absolute carnage audio wise you would not be able to hear anything it's the one method i use to spot the real mirage i hope they don't fix this apparent bug but find more creative ways to improve his gameplay so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends gaming console i don't know what it is i mean it's real what games can you play on there i have no clue but i i mean it's real i thought it was a meme mate apparently it's real though vic is like sponsored by them and he said it was real like oh yeah yeah that's like there's no guns here no one no one else is here kind of no this one need me please have a good okay i'm good i didn't work happy they just died i guess that was the last one oh yeah i'm with the right uh team blue here i don't know what you have here yeah you have nothing um i am staring at marvin i'm trying to get a purple trying to get a purple wait what do you do you have to wait or is there a time and you influence what you get from them i think so it's like a little it looks like a little slot machine like it's going uh it's going through all the colors and i think you have to time it it's all luck though i don't think you can actually time it oh okay i didn't know that but yeah i tried to give me white so i one clipped him oh my god is he dead oh he is that's so sad i think they're below i'm on the way do you need a bat um i have some cells i'll pop them i didn't even realize it was blew back from everybody's mouths nice he's really though i thought i'm gonna be honest i i saw him staring at you but i thought it was a decoy oh behind oh hemlock carrying i also have aim assists to my friends who's superior aim assist oh you're at the extended max oh my word there's one here too i just dropped one um yeah okay we're good i'm gonna pop this recharging shield one of these one of the big boys we yeah yeah i feel like we play the same people every day we do we're in the same win like with one lobby i yeah it's like i know them personally it's so weird and it's always the trials that you recognize it's never like i never i've never recognized some guy that's just like i know it's got like a 1k bench that doesn't exist that's always a sweaty it's always it's always the good ones where my drone belongs you should be allowed to drive imagine you know how you can control your decoys in this and they just like follow your way imagine if you hop in a car after your decoy like matches your speed and he's just he's just whizzing about the place like a sonic's hedgehog he's close oh like actually sprinting yeah he's just like full-on he's just zooming it'd be a decoy car like you should be able to send out a dc you just see three three guys coming over the hill could be a huge strat on the top of the top oh gosh oh no oh it's a pure disaster absolutely terrible decision yes they're still there they're still there right in front of me you guys oh he's throwing oh there's one he backtracked like this way he's behind us now can you first this guy he's like he's like 20 health thank you i never thought oh yeah this guy's in here um make sure they don't okay they gave third party in ps5 i'm coming up to you i'm pushing this guy playing on a thousand dpi it's just 316. 360 is so hard but missed every shot that was me when i first started playing on keyboard it's tough there's a big strap in here by the way you know just one of the biggest scratches oh lady cracks are you trying to punch her yeah i really wanted to he was just like probably so confused i wasn't shooting my gun at all i was confused i'm on your team uh i'm gonna do havoc do double energy this has got to be like one of the highest dps loadouts there is right what is it have a theater have a vault uh volt havoc diva would probably be good too but i just hate the the the mobility when you shoot you just lose all your mobility yeah you need octane you just need to hit firing yeah yeah yeah yeah or you could just stand still like a sentry gun because it doesn't matter if you've got a divo that's true i think that usually um yeah there's purple ones over here yeah uh my driving there wasn't good i would have me um no i'm gonna put some i'm gonna put some hours in i'm going to practice it if that's what you're doing game terrified to see you in real life i mean yeah is that just he's just playing bumper cars but irl oh i'm late making contact here um i am not with you at all taking a peek at these packages even though i know there's nothing in here that i need they see you just got hemlocked my friends oh how does that not stick there wait how many teams is this dude no no there's a lot of teams this is a terrible spot too i'm declining get out there in bamboozle oh whoa whoa whoa getting real fancy they're gonna they're gonna think twice about shooting me now that's wild what'd you do to those guys they're terrified look they're still trying to shoot you from way from where you were wardrobes this is good complete confusion yeah oh dude it's just the spiderman emote take that spider fire beginning it's guy off over here i wish i had a grenade you're on your own there's another team on me jesus what happened here i don't know it was my beautiful driving that this place in a really good position it was the only reason i just couldn't keep up with the speeds and the accuracy and the precision the violence and the speed the violence and the momentum that was there yeah yeah i mean i have so many shields it's climbing about the shields i've i why can't i never find a magazine for my energy gun i had a level three to start so if you backtrack i should always ping that um i mean even if you did what is that you paint that yeah i think then i bought it two-step [Music] just can't be the most that just can't be the most uh useful strat with caustic right never works surely not that efficient i feel like it never works ever you can just see it coming oh he's got a turbo for you turbo either um wait do i oh no i have the blue i have the the care package one i can't even put it on the table oh it's still here this one it's gonna dig those too absolutely what's this skamas um i don't know it's what the kids say what kids are you talking to oh no kids lockheeds kids that are like 10 generations before are after you rich i mean that's a good point how would i know i have anyone we're so distant you're so distant from them i'm so so disconnected from the youth of today oh my eyesight is still eagle-eye about eyes or more couldn't improve it i couldn't that's the best one i could think of for a bet would you say that's blind through bat oh i think you're just making noise [Music] hang is actually helping me it's helping me strafe like crazy i'll put two bursts into your back just let you know cause you just see him oh come on stop it sir punch him nice one squad left and i think i heard people firing this way what is this invisible wall here let me investigate what we're talking about me in here don't let me in oh you think you just have cover and you don't i know this is like this could have got me killed that's a big scam that might be the biggest game i've ever seen any throw balls yes here we go last team i'm stuck i'm stocking up how many kills do you have um a lot of kills more than you a wall i'm obviously how many do you have i have ten all right well we're even there you have ten oh let's apologize okay yeah yeah i need you to take a step back let's go let's go get gold i need gold vault what there's a replicator here come on man i mean i'm sorry forever twice i can't believe that's still a thing like who there's no way that and with all their data that they say they have i would love to see how many people craft stuff oh no they're already here oh should we go the other one um yes i'll see him i see him 45 seconds get up i miss like i missed like how many how many punches did you make i want to like two for ten that's not good aimlessness doesn't work with punches it's not fair is there's a melee lock-on option is it really yes what's that's a thing yes it's like target acquisition or something that's crazy i say this that was a good game i think we might be the best
