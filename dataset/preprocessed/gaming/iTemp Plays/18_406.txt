i don't know so it's so mean too it's crazy no you shield yourself oh there's a shield back there too i think recharging shields thank you good i i will save it oh yeah yeah yeah i don't use it on white armor no no no no terrible idea that's what you're saying oh yeah true i found the best havoc attachments there's people on me by the way there's people there people here oh my god wait what it's maximus cronus oh sounds like a harry potter spell sounds like a decepticon or no no that's an autobot right i don't know i just watched the either transformers i used to watch the animated series when i was about four and i just thought it was the it was the best thing i'd ever seen did you ever uh did you watch the movies uh that came out like michelle above itself the first few were pretty good i didn't keep up with uh i don't know how many there are now but like the first two i liked a lot it's one of those like i should watch it because i like i like um so i was coming back to the turtle but i've been on rails i think you're using it i like stupid stuff no no no no i've got a fault it won't make sense i'm just gonna hold it up actually i'm going to use that again it's fun i'm dropping energy dropping it four times ten times scope if you want one right it's not the worst you know like ryan reynolds is humor like it's kind of similar to like mirage really you know what i'll be honest and i do not like ryan reynolds i don't like that's what i'm saying that's what i was saying i i don't like that too i love deadpool 2. but him like himself i don't know why i don't find him i don't find him funny at all no it's not my humor i'm the exact same but i love deadpool i love deadpool so much maybe it's his face it was decent i think i heard nate got here it might be his face i hope ryan's not watching and he's a big fan of my channel oh mate you don't you never know if ryan reynolds watch your channel he would never say i i like him i just don't know i'm funny you don't you like him but you don't like his face he's what you said i'm saying what if it's his face you said he's ugly and you don't you you think he's really unfunny and his face is ugly that's what he said i've got it on film i didn't say any of that at all but i just don't get on without you it's the same it's like mirage humor i just um i like um i like stupid stuff right i'm gonna i'm gonna break my monitor i swear like that you know yeah that's peak comedy that's pete comedy if they put him in the film i'd watch it imagine that that was this dude are you good yes are you good yes man she's mocking me what she's mocking me i'll just have a cement she's dancing idiot 126. yeah come back and dance now idiot oh nice like this ha ha have 70. oh i forget that headshot take it out more enemies for an eternity i'm yep should have seen him mocking me i saw that that was funny no i hope they're not watching level four oh ryan reynolds i hope he's watching i hope he hope he cancels you you know what i'm not required to like everyone all right if you don't say you don't have that face no i said what if it's i'm just trying to understand why i don't like him because i typically like everyone i'm not a not a hateful person i like everybody but i just don't find it and i love comedy too i just love comedy so i don't i don't know why i don't find him funny like maybe it's a space oh yeah maybe you've exhausted all these other options yeah i love deadpool but not him so it's just like me maybe it's his face because he's wearing like a mask so you can't see his face maybe that's why yeah that's what that sounds so that's you know this is the conclusion that i'm coming to okay and that makes sense yeah that's what i meant oh they're fine oh god oh please oh please god um these boys be flying looked really cool can i pop a bat i'm am i okay oh this valkyrie is super laggy i'm like right on his head don't don't i'm gonna sense now chill chill chill chill chill how am i supposed to hit this are you kidding me i need you to do something rich i'm charging give me two seconds valkyrie is on 500p i'll know that's another team oh yeah that's that's the team where is she i think they're inside all right i'll get no amc through this she's on she's on the door wow is that it's a hater i did it oh dude i'm not shooting anybody rich please come on you can shoot people oh hurry i know because you literally i'm gonna kill them all in 10 seconds yeah but i've got a sentence with it three times i'm struggling kick double kicks cool okay ata i take crap whack him punch him retreat one other squad left washes distractions distractions where they are uh i'm just charged we need to charge oh they're down here okay i heard them you're gonna know way too early yes i did that is correct three three of the sickest sniper shots you've you've ever seen okay i'm playing lifeline so don't worry about eating i gotcha um yeah i do i do go down a lot so thank you that's okay did you bring us here did i you definitely you kind of like this place though you're a sniper fan yeah i always see you charge rifling people yeah not usually no no i've definitely seen it happen i i i i don't think so but we're already in the ring don't worry i'm charge rifling oh thank you for doing that i'm happy i don't have to you were thinking about it but i don't want to on the same team you know i was gonna have to take one for the team yeah i shouldn't have even recorded a voice line for shad caps should be just useless i mean they're probably they're probably good on mouse mountain keyboard i just i think on controller they're probably really bad though uh oh that's true this place is really creepy totally harshing my vibes charged rifle's gonna come in clutch in this place can't wait big ten damage might be something good this way come on far away are these people oh they're all over here oh my one's flashed on the top nice well guys i did not deserve that i need to go close my door one second okay let's go go oh god oh the whiplash tragic ah that's tragic actually not being able to make it over that only a two-time good back-to-back i'm back-to-back seem to be back to back-to-back when's the next race happening i don't know we gotta go gotta set it up i was p i was actually thinking so that's not my fault i was pinging i was spinning now this happened here this is this one wants to get here please tell me at all this octane is zoom in oh he's one hp oh my god no this is the this is the race right here oh no it wasn't no it's over there i'll go fast in the back of the head and she just didn't realize for like 13 seconds i didn't punch anyone that was all you someone just said all right i'm getting my offer i want back i have no heavy give me one sec he's going up that road oh dude this is this is bad this is really bad are you rudy struggling i'm i'm about to turn off my pc leader i'm not currently in your vicinity in any shape or field all good my 24 just disappeared i don't know what happened to that oh to the top so mean couch there's another team you know i've killed the race down the race over this way that's going to revive okay i want to give up this is awful i've never been never been so disappointed in myself they just rest no one on path right right nearly cracked right cracked can i reload my charge rifle how long's these things take to reload mate no absolutely not i'm already about to stop the recording you're a 13kd gamer don't forget i'm just i'm i'm just putting stress on my computer at this point oh there's no benefit only 700 but i've got a charge rifle with no scope on it and i had left i had a zero x any mag r3 so and i've got no mobility so i couldn't even get to the fight like you could all right how much damage you got did you get did you get a second dose of covet no there you go it's not just flying where are they good job just giving my shield the reach am i playing with no amoses oh oh my god i'm playing with alc what why why am i on alc when oh i was messing with it yesterday oh my god oh my god no i'm not not this is all you this is all you linear gamer just turn it off oh these guys are gamers they do be gaming the linear is back oh seventy flash safety players search flash ah no i'm dead i'm dead oh my god oh my god oh my god i'm actually uh i'm so disappointed in myself i'm glad you checked you know i can find it all today i wouldn't no i knew there was something wrong i was like there's no way i'm this bad this is unreal i was like i think it was yesterday morning or the day before yesterday i was just kind of messing with like alc just like looking at it and like in the firing range i made like some terrible settings they're awful settings they're not good at all and i guess i left them on oh my god that's kind of hard to spot if you're if you're not looking for it that could have been bad well i uh i mean especially since i play on linear half the time when i'm warming up that's how i feel like i'm i feel like i'm just bad so i was just like oh dude i'm just really bad today that's that is funny at least at least there was a reason for it because now your ego is back yeah oh yeah it's back linear gamer wait i thought i could use someone is this the valkyrie about half an hour ago just getting my shield that valk we had to follow them a's i swear it's possible there's 14 all the pads over here there's so many badges two there's three of them in that and like within 10 feet of each other this one right here thank you man that's actually really nice pretty must good faster i think that lifeline does have fast hills now because you can put that down proper bat your full health i need to test something hold on testing dead eyes tempo i still don't really understand you on this one but still trying my best it's just i think it's just the first uh first shot is is the normal fire rate and then you have to time it after that i think there's a little i think there's like a little uh a little bar at the very bottom on your site and i think uh after the second or after the first shot is when you uh is when you need to start like timing it okay i saw the third oh my god that's how we're doing double up full health revive that's one spot left that'd be kind of sick yeah i see the bar but it's like i don't know the bar these shorts don't make sense yeah i was a little confused when i was first using it too like it would work some of the time and then the rest of the time it was kind of awkward but i think it's just the timing i'll just spam it as far as fast i can before i go back i'm hoping so mate oh triple takes they must be pretty far right because we couldn't oh they're right here oh i missed every shot and then a wraith camera in the corner i'm here for like 88 and then on no sculpture in the head nice yeah that was uh that game was not it for me i want to see this gameplay still no absolutely not it was so bad dude oh my god it's just one of the worst alc settings ever wow get out damage mate you're bad
