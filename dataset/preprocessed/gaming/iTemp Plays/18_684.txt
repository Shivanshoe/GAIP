hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the season six trailer just dropped showing off a new legend a new weapon a new crafting system and it also has details about the new battle pass and the new ranked system as well it is a big trailer drop so the new legend added into the game is of course rampant this is our first real look at her in game and she's described as an expert mudder who made her name in underground fight clubs rampa talks big and has the ballistics to back it up now the first thing you notice about rampus is that she has a huge gun she's the gun is called srila and is that her ultimate ability perhaps her own custom-made lmg the gun is huge she's definitely not a stealth character walk around with that thing imagine dropping into king's canyon landing on a charge station to get your ultimate immediately and calling in your ultimate ability which is just a huge lmg called chile i mean i'm hoping that's her ultimate surely you can't spawn in with that thing and how else would you use it it also has the potential to be a turret that you place down and it's automated perhaps it isn't automated and you have to operate the tour yourself this isn't too clear she definitely walks around with it so i'm not too sure it looks completely different to anything that we have in the game at the moment and i am excited to try it out just adding this in here uh this part of the trailer definitely shows uh rampat using sheila and it looks like it is attached to the floor so maybe it is a tourist that you attach to the floor and then you sit on it and then you fire people and it's just extremely powerful i think i've figured it out we also have a new gun coming into apex legends called the vault this is a gun from titanfall of course uh and it's actually been speculated to be released into apex legends for some time now so it's great that we are finally getting this weapon and especially because it's a new submachine gun we haven't had a lot of close range guns in fact i don't think we ever have we've had a lot of snipers though we had the sense now and of course we had the charge rifle as well so it's good that we get another close range weapon here on ea's page there will be a link of that in the description of course there is a segment saying introducing crafting the description reads don't like your gear collect materials around the map to build something better finally we can upgrade our p2020 mozambique spawn loot into something better can you craft guns maybe you can craft hop-ups for your weapons maybe you can craft entirely new items and this is where part of this trailer comes in here we can see bangalore shown firing through some sort of force field this could be one of rampant abilities she's described as moder remember and this was actually rumored to be an ability for her but it could also be possible to make this through the crafting system as well we will just have to wait and see what this is capable of there is also the potential hint here of a corsic heirloom it could be we've seen legends used items in trailers before that have turned out not to be that actual heirlooms if i'm remembering correctly here but it definitely has potential he whacks pull pathfinder right over the jaw with this i don't know what's that he's toxic gas in there i would assume in this uh in this vial would also be a good time to release this as he's very popular at the moment unfortunately there's just gas everywhere you go just just can't breathe anyway just coughing around the map i don't think this would be released at the start of season six however as far as i remember airlines have only been released sort of mid-season in their own event with the exception of race of course who is already in the game but usually they do a town takeover uh as part of an event and they've released an heirloom and a bunch of these uh other skins as well but it's nice that we get a hint of future content here if you spotted anything in the trailer that i missed be sure to leave it in the comments i'm sure a lot of you are excited about this i'm sure a lot of you have spotted stuff that i'm missing there as well but the gameplay that i've got for you is with the janks and so far it is the quickest game that i've had definitely in this season i don't think it's the quickest i've ever had but it's getting close it was incredibly quick so hopefully you enjoy it thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends firing i dropped either here if anyone fancies see something gold what is it oh there's a lambo oh not again it's just so many let's all they're spawning here don't you ever talk down about the longbow in front of my presence okay the lambo is okay but this scope is a big pile of poop the longbow sucks watch your mouth you're gonna do it you're cruising for a bruising the long ways no near as good as my wingman r99 which i've used every game since day zero what are you gonna do okay you win you win you win you win what are you shooting at over here uh little little little little guys over there i'm not hitting i'm shooting but i'm not hitting yeah i'm not hitting anything with this scope oh is there a trash can there's a guy right here i'm trying to think i don't know if this is gonna work or not but i'm gonna give it my all here i mean i hit all my shots totally props to that guy i didn't expect him to climb up what a psycho i went um one for nine one for ten is that with the um not too shabby with the gold longbow yeah well that's pretty impressive yeah yeah yeah okay listen i'm i've only got batteries okay but i'm i'm 10 away from a purple evo do i go in no armor and damage how easy easy i can drop you some shield cells but absolutely not it'd be a waste it would be a waste because you're going to get these 10 damage yeah pop a oh yeah i got it i need sniper ammo dude i'm never gonna find any um yeah i'll let you know if i finally i'll try there's the purple right here two in here and one's somewhere else oh my god i'm hitting my shots it's it's absolutely insane never would have thought i'm so proud oh there's another one here i'm going in i swear i didn't that sounds sarcastic but i swear i didn't oh this is your camera you're gonna look he had the longbow right that's not for ammo yeah yeah i guess i just had a better longbow that's all i really was do you need a medkit are you good um i have one i'm okay thank you i swear i revived your friend you know i believe you well you shouldn't i just want to know and it's probably the worst experience i've ever had in april i'll just watch you both yeah i win i went three for three it was awesome but i i just used all my luck right there oh i see i'll see oh oh god i'm gonna zoom um somewhat near that other balloon like they were further north of it down there i think they're gonna go a bit yeah they're right here on the other side of this thing oh what's going on he jumped off he jumped off target over there nice job boys i always shot him out of the air oh my god i need to use a balls on the mastiff or otherwise i just get poopied on what's the last guy yeah someone has a res remember buddy did you oh wait somebody else did a finisher on oh yeah how far could he have gone and then he got finished by somebody else i'm scared it just happened didn't you down him like literally right here yeah the bottom of the hill but i think he used the jump pad but i didn't i wasn't concentrating i didn't see which way he went hey recharging there's there's somebody around here that just cranked the self res on someone or a finisher oh here my arm by me in this building and right in this building oh god 100 on bangalore how were they silent that whole time i'm so confused how they mentioned we imagined they couldn't exist that long i'm glad i started i'm like bro yeah i know i don't know how you saw that i did not notice that uh what a bunch of psychos their first thing they want to do when they see someone down is just execute them and then they just hid it was gonna be an ambush bro yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna grab a little bit of that that you firey gun uh it used to be until they buffed it into you know they made it better and now you hate it yeah i don't like when they when they break guns that i like because then people just tell me how i suck because i use guns that are crutches the same way i it was the same thing with the the longbow and then it was with the scout i basically don't use them at all anymore same i've always liked the skate and then they just made it a nerd gun i know that gun was so that kind of was so broken after they bumped it was straightforward yeah it's in a pretty good spot now i feel like they could probably lower the damage by like a tiny little bit but like it's not even that bad anymore no it isn't this way yeah you don't have a whole lobby just the whole lobby of timmy's just too tapping like it was man someone dropped a lifeline package over this way on the pink charger was pretty is this the first circle this is the first one i was lost in the saucer i wasn't really paying much attention that's so bad i hear them they're fighting over here it's literally one squad left before the first circle's even fully closed the fastest game of all time close and we're available and we got to get this game over and done with so we can get into the next one because jesus christ oh yeah this could be my fastest game if we can i'm quick oh if we die quick oh they ambush me they ambush me i saw i'm i'm not i'm not there yet i nearly one bombed one of them i'm on myself it's my all he's killing me [Music] yeah he's literally causing their game by doing this where is they oh hold up top right no i'm not practicing 27. yes dude literally spent the whole time just trying to throw his drinks like i literally watched it like why i don't know why i don't like the whole game now they could have 2v1 either me or you you are they yeah i was so far back they could have just dove on you and we were lost nine minutes
