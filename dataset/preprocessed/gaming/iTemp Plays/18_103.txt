hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i am reusing some of these intro clips that i used uh a few days ago i think it was four or five days ago now because this shows off the exact moment where i've realized that three times was unstoppable now i'm such a weirdo when it comes to apex stuff because i hated the wingman for like two years and now i absolutely love it i hated the mastiff even when it was a completely overpowered uh care package weapon i never used it i was too scared and now i absolutely love it i hated the bruiser for the longest time i only ever used the one times h cog on everything including scouts and now i absolutely love it and the same things happened with the three times i will use this on the r301 i will use it on the hemlock i will use it on the flatline and then of course you've got the snipers in there too which of course is good on those but this is just a complete beam machine look at it i think the next thing that i'm going to adapt to is the sniper optics it's the last thing in the game that i absolutely hate using so maybe i'll see a video about that in like a week's time or something i've got two great games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yep my game tab dave so that's cool this vacation is calling me in the middle of action i love how he doesn't even message you just calls dude i've been messaging for like five days rich you got a guy come behind you uh horizon no gun sentient [Music] [Music] hey did i get first blood yes where is bojack guy this is red you may have rallies you're not red i first did my guy reloading tell me okay i'm coming here marking our surroundings nice job guys all those numbers you want to be a cutie pie and drop one of those want to walk right right oh crap sorry oh man thank you is that not one of the best things of this generation um please top 10. i didn't mean to throw it there he's literally one shot that passive is mental i know i had it as well yeah i know i added two that's probably why i couldn't hit her he was double banged with passive death nice was it only two three it was the watson the path oh i had no idea i never noticed that you ain't flown on i just i'm flying as well so yeah yeah i think one fell off i don't know okay oh i'm going to be honest with you boys out of everybody that died there should have been me all they had to do was jump in my head all right three times flatline massive purple ball we're laughing i didn't loot you did i rag a little bit did i which one were you i don't know did i i mean literally worst friend ever dude no did i mean it's incredible your performance today rich from from being afk yoinkin rags loot i mean what's next i would sway and see i'm not gonna spoil it i'm not gonna spoil it i'll find another way to throw don't worry it'll be a bit of a surprise i like that i'll leap off the map i'll do it you hear that richard yeesh there's a oh there you go there's more there's more teams fighting on the rope oh they're on me on the bridge i mean i'm gone oh my god there's a blood out on the bridge and the horizon right here tango spotted danger close well they're here somewhere big scan why's my controller been so bad recently saw someone out there staying another teammate here was do not want to be that higher oh my god look at my health yes we've got a gold medal on one more guns and on the other gun i've got a boosted loader i just barely have to reload on this game 52 damage where did the pathfinder go i don't know where he went yeah i said here like an idiot she did not expect one of us to be staying there like an idiot which is exactly what i was doing so i was trying to find a path i didn't want him to sneak off and get a revive you know it would have been awful i have no idea where people are gonna be to be honest with you you can't really go wrong with him and lab it's not it's not as popular as it once was here we go i found them hammer labs i was rocking it is popping off i close my team they're flying they're flying i hear a trident or something oh my god that's going on here there's no one in there though there's no way you saw my kill like that i guess recharging shields let's relocate here and some bats but mainly did you know three times action there another one optics here mid-range isn't bad target over there let's get involved team we have to i thought i heard someone wait i dropped my three times okay you get that kill i'm going for my three times i'm an idiot when did i drop this hopefully no one took it please yes thank you they were scrapping here which is why it's weird replicator these guys came to us instead i don't know why maybe we were closer i don't know big scrapping though big scrappy all right it's my first game of the day this isn't actually going as bad as it usually does for a good while i had a track a track record of getting like uh oops of getting a good game first game on but recently i don't know if it's my age or what a little bit too crazy for that i've already wanted the plutonic for some reason given my shields of recharge now i'm fine over this way too over aggressive the tummies is that going to stop me absolutely not no i'm doing the same thing it's going to work out we'll see 45 light rains that's a decoy are they not nice they're shooting at me so they can't back up here a solo alcohol towards the mirage then i don't think there's two of them that's one guy there might be a mirage around here so that was a solo of alcohol unless you killed mirage i think he's typing i didn't hmm this is a fuse optics here close range always better than that oh they've respawned enemy over there hitting the injection eject to see me migo nothing better than him need you have to see right there well there are still three squads with less than six people in them because we're a team of three so there's fewer than 10 people in the lobby so even still it's probably just like a duo and a few solos or something one would assume anyway hey hey i knew it yeah say something over three times i mean i didn't hear anything right here on high contact okay so it's just a solo over here i think the last two teams must be solos that's a okay they just respawned over here as well good grief they've respawned again over here this is crazy get this guy out there what's he doing how close is he she launched a bracelet this way danger closed no i wanted to kill with them look i want you with the hemlock so bad how many bats you got i'm gonna have to small hill give me a sec recharging shield i really wanted to use the three times but then she's a little bit too close for it you know it's got its limitations give me a sec that's where they respawn anyway over this way somewhere they could have went a different way i guess they probably just loot these boxes look at the fuse the decoy just left the mirage it's so annoying i'm not used to knowing assist because if there's one fence involved this is what it's like nice play guys that was a fun game you i'm leaning back in my chair don't count those left shots on my teammate i'm leaning so far back i can't even see my screen you know that's why my voice sounds so far away i'm not even looking at the screen properly those shots don't kinked who left who left come on man that's outrageous gg's though ggs that was fun
