hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and every season i feel like there is a gun that just flies just underneath the radar it might not be that season's best gun but it is way better than people realize for a while it was the either eight and then it was the flat line i think this season it might just be the hemlock if you aim at the chest and then the last shot of the burst hits the head you're dealing like 70 damage and it really takes people off guard i've got two great games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends ps5 videos amigos hemlock off the bat which i didn't get okay you you loot that okay i'm on 40 p why am i 40 pink 40 pink isn't bad but i shouldn't be on 40 ping with the servers i selected why is it why is it sending me across the continent huh first blood has been taken i think we all know the answer to that question but it's okay i've got a hemlock which i'm very happy about i have an we're already alternator the ring i need optics for an assault rifle another team has been here two times or three times a hollow enemy at that location that's what's got a hemlock two huh if they don't hear me i have to stop walking what are you doing sir let's rush him it's one guy get him out of here and steal all his stuff oh my god he's on the corner oh my god he's two tapping with a pk i mean that's just ludicrous you sure but i want to save it by the time i actually alter cross he's probably going to pop the bat throwing frag what's my bubble fights aren't too good with an alternator hemlock my close range is kind of bad oh nice i guess he didn't oops okay enemy in he's getting peppered never gonna kill this guy but i just need to stop him from shooting my team themselves to be caught recharging shields i've never seen so many people in these fields two or three squads might be a few more to be honest it could be four or five i have to get close to this team to be honest i've basically only got an alternator so let's commit to these guys i have alt if we down one or track one or something i'm out of heavy ammo i need to get close to a team heavy ammo here that is too far away optics here the enemy is moving please reloading fly away this has worked out perfectly weren't you friends with the gibby wasn't he part of the clan clan yes it is this poor guy's been healing for the last two minutes straight just constant shield cells and he's hopped in the whip get him nice poor guy this way that's my red armor or at least loot this thank you amigo how am i struggling with heavy when there are so many heavy guns in this game this team is sat over there with like a sentinel a charge rifle and a dream all right everyone retreat to the building this is our new headquarters we need to draw about plans never mind we've got no time the bad plan is every man for himself okay they are literally surviving behind me machines recharging shields yeah yeah huge massive ash ultimate are you the guy i don't you've got a free revive yes you are give me your stuff mate i need you heavy enemy taken down recharging using a phoenix heavy to the wingman because obviously you don't need as much heavy for a win-man compared to a hemlock no no no let's go this way the zones that way there are people everywhere anyway we may all fight towards the safe zone and get our teammates banner we should we should 100 go this way no you'll find like three squads we could just get free positioning this way i have the banner we must correct their failure please die where are we going you know what it's been way too long since i landed at estates and died off spawn with a bow and arrow or died of spawn with an alternator and a blue helmet what do you got for me marvin okay i've completely forgotten how to use marvin's like when olympus came back when this came back i was actually pretty good at getting the purple oh i need really needed that down how do you use muffins please someone tell me like i used to know how to get purple every time and now i just sort of spam it and if i get a purple it's a complete look it's like you have to do when it's like just past blue or something i think actually i'll take the flat line looking for a hemlock yeah i've got some teammates being very patient though i'm out of light ammo so you picked up some light rain's teammate okay i've got a flat line we're good okay that should have been a down i missed too many shots don't get the octane skill nice you want to steal it heavy and light please amigo one heavy bullet that's clutch why does that sound like he was in a giveaway one of the deadliest combinations no to mankind hello i'm trying to pull a phoenix kit how much time do you think we're going to give you yeah we need to get teammates banners too one oh my god peace and quiet i didn't realize how loud his keyboard was until man oh putting a phoenix kit for use kind of a hot drop anyway but then you've got octane's keyboard going and feels like i was storming the beach at normandy you know there is no way i would have stayed in this game like i'm not going to lie to you guys i'd appreciate 100 if i died that early she's dating oh gold spitfire oh hemlock extended heavy magazines level three i have my old say my ultimate is one oh behind the gunfights onto high ground behind them and then they and they're not here and then they just screwed should have downed him i've had it two times i think i'd have down dude recharging he's gonna say there's no way someone is like that who on earth is shooting how have you done 70 damage with an allstar is that another team behind us take the asheville just up here it's unfortunate time and i think my horizon needed to heal it's okay didn't got it down nice guy down low maybe it's a blue shotgun by the new teammate we needed one let's i should have known he was on the roof i don't know why i'm checking down though but there's two squads left shields are depleted using the phoenix i need shields oh this guy had everything on it oh two times heavy rounds hold on not this guy this guy had some for you there you go this i9 skin good grief that is something i need i forgot you could put a gold hop-up on the hemlock watch is it a watson by any chance could it be a watson here if they're down here they've respawning why are they down low these ties find shields recharged throwing frags discovered of the door oh shieldless shield is in seattle he's off the bat hopped about seattle i'm blind reloading all right firstly get the gas out of here nice where's the last guy there's no waste there's no there's no i mean i respected though to be honest his two teammates are dead his options are try and fight us and get banners and insta respawn or spend the next seven minutes of the game trying to solo hide just to die to us in the end you know it's a waste of time may as well try look at that i have hello sorry teammate give me to steal your kill like that was he trying to punch it while he's trying to punch him i think the octave was trying to punch that guy i should have came in and started swinging i stole both those kills at the end i do feel a little bit champions listen that guy could have been full health for all i know and getting a win on apex these days isn't the easiest of tasks i mean it kind of is when you've got sebastian and you've got yeah yeah reigns uranes on the team ggs guys ggs
