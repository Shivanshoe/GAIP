whatever i mean that's a true it all depends on the fight the next fight we have what if it's like a 10 minute fight yesterday still wondering if those guys are dead it's streaming building i don't know should we go back and check yeah we could do just a little double tap you know it's got a lot now that was a sweaty team too and they got kind of i got the work you know i got the work and then they had about eight lives because there were three of them so they could keep reviving we killed them like eight times i think yeah okay the audio audio in that building it's actually impressive how bad it is yeah 80s i'm impressed every day that i play this game just how bad the audio is shambolical chord you know is that the study of shambology um yes give me all these that might make you near all the thermites here we go what are you thinking a little three stack all have blues louise with 12 maps each minimum every item that's in the crafting has been crafted so they have it playing right thumb one demon i was well this was this is the loudest noise to ever exist so this will definitely we'll definitely know we're over here oh please i mean i have three kills and 1700 damage i have nine kills zero assists baby let's go i don't even know how this happened uh i've probably stole a few i don't know i don't know let's go oh oops where could they be this circle's not that big there's a care package that's been here for like a solid two minutes so there's no way that they're not desperate to get this what'd you get all tea it's a glitch oh mate that's what you get i see you get as soon as you shot me oh he's got red he's got red playing three times impressive i met i hit him three times for 45 each and they didn't get cracked so i think there's two people with red be careful yeah i hit one with red i think they're decent team i'm not gonna like 61.5 he didn't get cracked again like what's going on what's going on 76. nice it's three of them yeah there's three of them i'll swing left a little bit dangerous uh octane's working on that on there great nice okay yeah they're close they're all just like scattered i think one's right here fat all the boys the boys [Music]

that's fine more damage oh my god i had i thought she backed me i thought she was gonna bat we have an agreement why didn't she bat no no i mean it doesn't matter how many people there are what armor they have the team cohesion is on point we played that really well well played i mean i stole every single kill as well he's making kind of a bit happy and he kind of did it wait i didn't even get a kill there i did it why did he get a kill that was episode one of the kill race thank you guys so much for watching it's there's no point in episode two i'm too far ahead this guy sucks i'm too good
