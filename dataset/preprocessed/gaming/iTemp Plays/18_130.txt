hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i have three games edited together and i had a total of four legendary golden triple takes in the three games one of the games i was running two of them now i genuinely think that this gold triple take is one of the best guns that we've ever had in apex and one of the reasons is it's good at close range it's pretty much a shotgun it's good at medium range it's got a long range and with the kinetic feeder which is the new hop-up if you slide it reloads automatically now this is something i wasn't really taking advantage of in the games here because it's so kind of weird to get used to not reloading but you could easily get away with never using the reload function on this gun it's effectively got an infinite mag it's actually so fun to use and i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends sentinels my first going to the of the not just the game but the entire day oh gold helmet for the boys too i need to leave give me a sec i need to loot maybe i don't i'm coming to help team there we go it's not there attention you uh you can't use your cue on this enemy here pleasure to meet him pleasure to kill him break that edge i'm trying to get them scrambled yes i got a gold triple take okay this is huge this is humongous this is humongous triple take here yeah yeah i've already got one it's got a really ugly green skin on it though which is wait they have two gold troopers no there's no way there's no way i can pull this off right somebody anybody there's no way i can pull off the double gold triple take i honestly i think i think i can i think i can first game of the day though just a warning well i okay you need to for understand reason you need to turn it on like i'm sure they'll hotfix that at some points uh lifeline to get gold back right yeah they both have gold bag i've got free reign to just use it just die anything they're leading is my boot to their okay so my favorite thing about the kinetic on the triple take is that it's the reload part it's not even the zoom in it's like i can go like that and then just slide and i'm back i don't need to reload ever i just slide and it definitely helps that uh you know look how quick that is when i zoom in it's like fully charged oh lifeline's back let's go i don't want to leave too far without it you know to explode oh teammates afk again no we're can just see a distance i guess we got a challenge we got to play our game she's coming she's coming she's coming in big for the load i can't see i should not be standing in this loving it triple take on the go here yeah lifeline's got gold bag and she's lifeline oh my god i thought i threw the game and i went down into my fuses off the thing is refugees if you're if you're on his team let me let me see if i can actually speak properly if you're on fusey's team you'll be struggling if you're going to the ring of fire because you can't sprint it's actually more dangerous than it seems there's 27 people left let's go get these guys come on oh god oh god nice teammate wrecking ball you fellas know the drill grenach finally something interesting well they don't have a crypto lifeline avoided and we're good we should be fine oh my word listen i'll play black ops 2 okay i know it's quick scope i know it's a quick scope i'm actually a bit of a demon here oh he went the other way around that makes sense that does make sense okay i got carried away trying to quickscope here because my teammates were on the flank and i had no idea because i'm an idiot this next game though i do eventually get the gold triple take it's a funny one so stick around wait oh they're probably all going fine night right it's kind of wait oh whoa whoa i'm playing mirage i'm on raj retoi uh no there's a tin coming here got one here enemy landed near me got my boozled squeeze i need to do this i'm hoping their leave so i'll get an instant battle ammo it's okay i'm on the way move fast folks [Music] i'm out of heavy ammo nice hey ladies and gentlemen okay i need the crafters i need to craft i want to flat mine nice teammate just killed someone else just a random guy reloading that party confused while i'm crafting sending out another me damn he's good-looking recharging shield the ring isn't who the heck hit me with the bow and out seconds who is this man and where is he contact wow wow okay well someone's in there but someone's coming this way bam i'm running out of ideas someone thinks they can take on a challenge [Music] two of them are down you can look something like that oh i'm gonna need some help seriously i'm gonna need some

gate gapped might be something good there quick follow me follow me follow me follow me follow me all right we got this team we got this we're all back together eleven people left it's a struggle of the game so unnecessarily difficult he said level three that means thanks or maybe it's just a russian keyboard and that's where the that a looking and i hate looking character from the russian characters could be great to be honest replicator oh gang i've got one here i'll squadron whole squadron and they're hitting me they're padding on us with a decoy giving my shields a recharge i am

yeah it's all good oh good not good not good let's go here back it up back in the back get up look at you might use my only balance let's go here we should just go aside i'm taking fire friends get away from that team recharging shields sending out another me my orders be down low is that a ramp at all i can see what the heck is happening in this game they've got it in the back check it out keep whacking them keep whacking them they're struggling yeah yeah they're struggling big time reloading i have no idea what they're doing no someone else got that kill we need all the work no they're dying oh goodness me put the lid down range she's struggling oh she picks her lean reloading reloading extended heavy mag here level rampage here let's go this is the weirdest game i've ever been a part of you've got guys with rampant turrets on the back of thingies we got my teammates dying in the zone one of them fell off the other died in the gas even though they made kids i can't say i've never made that mistake i'm gonna stop lying to you guys this can't be real life this just can't be we wiped the whole squad only two any bats big shields big shields last two teams are firing recharging come out this way last two teams are firing let's get involved okay man okay let's go let's go go on pathfinder let's get it together give him my shields a recharge let me hear some excitement let's go [Music] we're screwed if they get this rope and they survive we're sort of walking to the zone they were this way right 45 bad how about this way only 30 seconds left on the clock yeah that's good that's good actually it could wait a little bit because they can just turn inside i think yeah it's going to chill inside it's okay it's the thought that counts one's rotating left how about this way they're mad maggie on the left i'm repairing my teammate literally every shot landed on in the back that was the strangest game of apex i've ever played and then we died two or three stacks i mean we easy could have beat these guys let's be honest if i just pop to bat instead of trying to help my team i don't i don't know they're all good oh are they really yeah oh my god
