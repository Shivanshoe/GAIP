oh yeah you get a purple armor huh same thing that's been happening to you all day well just dying off spawn clutching sure i'd be more impressed if you're doing that with p20 honestly would have been more impressive b-20 is this the team that killed you nah nah there's no way yeah 20 and a white armor there's no way this team killed you okay you're saying that while you have a purple armor and all the loot in the world must be nice i destroyed them with a sense now i'm glad you're doing it now cause you haven't been all day factual statement hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are sniping once again something i've been having so much fun with recently whether it be the sentinel or the longbow i am throwing a three-time sight on there and i'm trying to quickscope people just for fun i've changed up my controller settings to the advanced controls or alcs known and in these games they felt a little weird at longer ranges you'll see me complain about it a little bit but the close range game felt a lot better i think some more fine tuning to get the long range feeling better and i'll make a video about the settings for those of you who are interested so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh hey hey say yes i am famous it is true this is true i'm very very famous room is archery i know you've heard the rumors most people have they're already sucked lane here but i don't know where what are you shooting at sir uh i'm not with you at all quite possible glass now i have white armor in a sense now i'm coming uh they're both really though they should be i think i'm taking shots so i did 500 damage they should all be low i got you oh god he opened the door he opened the door with his gun how do i miss that shot i'm terrible i promise you i'm worse it's empty flesh what's this lunatic doing it's committed i didn't fear a little bit oh god i got bamboozled oh yeah how does that feel is he bad honestly what's this here there's a physical object in front of the door i can't i'm good yeah there is you're not lying i'll panic sorry about that most indestructible object of all time oh he's just huge oh my god it's amazing dude he's just losing his i love how he was mid type he stuck somebody and he goes straight back that was great what's that i have 19 bullets in my i have nothing like always i'm just the greatest i'm his streamer that's what it is oh what just barely got my first backpack i have to go back back back back back back this is just not the coordination that we need to be showing [Music] bridge i'm gassing this up way more than it actually was that really wasn't that cool i'm just quick scoping with a three-time sentinel i'm just really excited i can appreciate that if you're taking like if you're if you're an adult and you're going as far as to like take advice from my stuff on facebook like financial advice from people to facetime i i like i don't even blame baseball at that point like why would you ever take financial advice from like from these guys yeah i mean that just makes sense i like so i mean i do feel i feel it's awful like they 100 should be they should they should get they should go to jail for that they should be investigated at the very least they're reviving it at the same time i'm like yeah you don't feel too bad dumb do you have to be actually invest into something like that he's crazy cosplay's really low it's all you i'm not with you yeah that's my hot take i mean that makes sense like don't take financial advice from content creators and also like some people know it's a bit of a scam but if you're getting early enough you can write the same way almost not as beneficial because obviously they get it at a cheaper price that are smart i know what they're doing they weren't even making that much money for how much they're risking like you can go to jail for this sort of stuff and they were making about thirty thousand dollars every time they did it that's not yeah weren't they getting like offered like around like maybe 100 200k or something for like some of these deals and i was like that that's that's a lot of money but for like something like that that's really not when you're risking a lot even what am i doing where am i aiming do you know what are you doing i'm just trying to back someone's reviving outside or something man i'm being shot in the back i'm just i'm just fighting yeah what are they doing hey one's coming across all right i'm not with you at all oh there's no way i don't know where he's at i'm terrified he's gonna drop he's going to stick me i'll be stuck oh my god oh he's stuck a teammate no there's no way he actually yeah do you remember when they changed the uh the shields for a little bit and they like covered your like entire body yeah like formed like a cocoon around your body yeah like it blocked so much you couldn't first anyone i can rope this up there yeah yeah i know when you're running too far and not be able to use it you know i'm a good guy you can say if you want um i i could this i'm not doing that again i'll keep jumping to see what he's doing he's just pre-aiming the top this is my old mile uh one on to the right over here no i'm a sheepdog oh my god three times instead there's another team shooting from like east northeast yeah i thought what am i doing really wants to set up his shields he wants to get up his heels so bad second squad oh i almost caught the one clippers right there almost oh she's one ah i was trying a quick scope uh i have two medies oh man that's scary he one i'm one one clipping people and then this dude almost one clipping for 225 that was scary i respect it though replicator touching down i find crack she's not running away from me is that lifeline she's really low really though i broke one inside here oh it's not this one twice oh i know ammo i lined up a shot yeah they're probably pushing maybe possibly no he's still just chilling up there i see him yeah why else he stands at this range so they suck though not lying oh where did this guy go mate these guys are let's keep running zone's closing now we got to move it's on ring's moving and this other two on this one oh this isn't the last time oh and this other team we're in the middle of all of them i'm trying to throw smokes for us that's him on the right yeah i'm trying to just get inside to cover we're in the middle of both teams yes sort of terrible spot get uh over here if we can do a rope yes that's him okay oh he took the rope yeah huge huge that's one thing i will say um do you think you could there's no way i know he wants us to like jump down but we're literally we can't like i'm getting pounded every time i even peek me oh my god jesus cracks here but dude i have to mute him i know i know he wants his album but i have two bats one mickey that's fine moving they're moving right there's a character here i'm gonna get it oh one's over here already they're already rotating a lot so we just kind of know saying okay they just took
