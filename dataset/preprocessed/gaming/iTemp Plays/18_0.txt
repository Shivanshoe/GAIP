hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now it's no secret that my favorite three weapons or three favorite weapons i suppose actually are currently in the care package you've got the g7 scout you've got the vault and you have the mastic they are my top three favorite guns in the entire game and i've complained about this many times but i can't use them anymore i never get these guns now if you don't know the longer a game goes on the more chance there is of a care package gun spawning in the care package now the problem is the difference between what is actually end game in public games it's usually about 10 minutes into the game and what apex thinks is endgame which is about 19 minutes we never get to 19 minutes anymore that 19 minutes in public games doesn't exist it is a myth now the drop rate is pretty great in ranks you've got the good distribution between powerful endgame weapons most people have purple or red armor you can fight over them it sounds great but in public games where i am i never get to use these guns anymore i dropped a ton of damage in today's video hope you enjoyed thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds all right this place is usually a little bit more relaxed thank goodness i got that i would have been raging we've got a team behind us i don't know if it's one team or two i've only got one gun as well pathfinder all right what is two teams which is nice maybe three teams that's my first and only all-star kill of the season i refuse to use this gun again i don't care i know scoped him to find an entirely different team there are people honestly here though it could just be the scoresteak i sort of forgot he would have put a truck i'm dead i should i should have phased when did he get up top all right listen first game of the day so it doesn't games i've only got one gun the l star doesn't games uh what else is in games i need to get my excuses in uh that's all i've got i should have just i should have just phased really shouldn't i i sort of forgot i was playing wraith though that's the problem when you mix up all your legends you know but it's okay we're still alive i expect people to be this way but you can never be certain uh three times that would actually be pretty nice especially but whatever i'm good i think when uh when it's your first game of the day and you play on controller you don't need it three times what you need here you go all you need is to get into people's faces and i need a shotgun abuse aim assist that's the plan oh there we go shotgun ball as well are these guys still fighting or is the fight over beautiful big third party opportunity step one is to set them on fire with the thermite grenade grenade step two first them to establish dominance f3 is he's to get a little bit scared and wait a few teammates because last time he didn't work okay i'm saving pathfinder did they'd like to respawn this must be a separate thing we need i could pull back okay that hurt pretty sure he's quick sculpt me in the head with a charged sentinel don't don't die i'm popping a feni okay i'm lagging hello i'm really lagging this is horrendous got you got enemies armor as well which is good um a little bit concerned about the current lag situation okay i mean that's just okay i didn't want the heavy bullets anyway you know the game just skips about 30 times in half a second and refuses to elaborate i don't really care i'm not going to stick around and try and find moser bully so i'll loot the uh okay packages i'll loot these death boxes on the way i'm going this way huge scrap team huge scrap i need to remember i'm playing wraith i actually don't think i've used an ability yet but the thing is when you're playing right you don't need to use any abilities you're tiny i feel so close to the ground when i play break feels like i'm permanently crouching but in a good way not like in a slow way but in like a i'm impossible to hit kind of way you feel like that when you're not playing a giant metal fridge you know these guys download reckon hello might be some of the worst reaction times i've ever seen i don't know if i've ever seen reactions slower than that before nice it was my kill but he was he was pretty self-reviving there you go there's the heavy purple shotgun bolts they're scrapping at the big waterfall i always call this fountain it's not a fountain it's a waterfall i don't have a shotgun bolt i okay i'm getting trolled this is this is one of the worst days ever that gunfight is also over so we can't go up the road because we'll be screwed don't go up there i think we just have to go around and challenge from the low ground here i've got also so if we get close enough i can just alters into the building i'm i mean this works too hopefully then on here and my teammate's name is dodo hopefully they don't make him extinct and i didn't get the ark so okay were they actually here or did you just spam it or accidentally press it because i did that when i placed here hello i tickled him that helped oh i didn't realize he would have the thing around here absolutely destroyed if you can make my portal it'd be great but there is a second squad here he's self-reviving i might be able to help him [Applause] recharging my shields no the insta downed it dodo huh is there still another team because that was only three people i'm confused why did we get the notification there was there was a second team involved picked up our teammates banner uh i'm not going to stand up here and reload loads but i just need some bats and then i'm gonna go revive these guys so hopefully they don't leave now would be a really good time to have a portal squad's coming back yes even though this is low ground it's a relatively safe respawn location because you can just land up top or at least if you don't make it tough you can land on the rope it's not actually that bad who's sorry there you go see well they didn't land down there see kind of safe yeah come on i keep it coming see what happens this is my first phase of the entire game it might be i need to recharge my shields that's why they stopped calling me phase david because i just wasn't using the phase enough you know catching myself up could be going around now they're probably reviving the lifeline down there actually i forgot down one of them replicator incoming friends okay this is horrendous just got no bullets on this it's sad because i don't get to use the uh the vault so often hey purple lineman oh they're coming why did he challenge like that why was he sprinting still one nice i could have had scout vault that would have been the best day ever possibly like top five at the very minimum i mean i might as well take them i got my main gun is a care package gun and my secondary is a shotgun i only need one snack replacement vaults perhaps this is kind of a broken cell i don't even need any ammo hey that wasn't the that wasn't the guy he wasn't part of the team so where's the last guy there's a solo running around here somewhere i thought we weren't going to get enough action this game but i've got 3300 damage here honestly if you just make it to the fountain everyone just everyone just comes through because everyone can hear it is this from the events not sponsored mess him up get him nice teammates that was actually a huge game in the end that was actually really fun at fountain not fainting i mean waterfall obviously what was that like 3 400 damage i got the first damage at the end i didn't want to take a kill from him they were very patient it wasn't like i was going to get to 4 000 or 20 kills or anything who cares nice nearly 3 500 damage that was a great first game of the day as well by the way sensational recreational confrontational that's all i've got i see you
