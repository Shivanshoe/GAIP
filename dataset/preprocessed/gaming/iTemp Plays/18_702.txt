hey what's guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in the old scrapple city i would always land in the same building in the exact same spot and i'll be honest i do miss that building everyone would land there and it was absolute chaos and now that building has been destroyed there is a new building that reigns supreme in scrappy city i am sure you've got a good idea of the one that i'm talking about you can literally sit here until the first ring closes and people are still pushing it's like everyone knows if you want to find someone you just meet up at this building be there at 5pm uh bring your r99 and we'll have a bit of a scrap that's what goes on every single game and today i am joined with so far and i think with him is that he's just so gosh darn good at this game it makes such a big difference playing with someone so good because i can mess up and still be in the game after it happens a few times the one that i've got for you today if i was playing solo with a random teammate and i messed up as much as i did in the game that you're about to watch i definitely would not have come out the other side i would have been queuing again uh you pretty much have to play flawlessly if you're playing with a random teammate but you can be a bit more relaxed when you're playing with someone like so far or like jenks so far actually uploaded the same game to his channel last night so i'll leave a link to his perspective i highly suggest that you go over there drop us up on his channel i would love it if you guys could go over and leave some support and one last thing before the video starts here g field my code up again to 30 they said to me they said rich your code is far and away the best code there is out there we can't help but give the people the 30 off once more and here we are if you'd like to get yourself some g fuel there will be a link in the description as well use code item for that 30 off of course and i'll leave you with today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah yeah i love the leviathans they were dope i just i skulltown was it was such a fun spot to land that was god i don't know if i should have landed here i have blue and a g7 are you in my building i'm coming down all right no thank you one more coming in as well and then you can use that here i've got a g7 with a one all times cool there's a team right in the building uh in front of us am i looking lucky us we are already inside the ring oh and in here oh oh he's a psycho what's your limiting it's kanye just ran at me no wonder oh he had everything but a gun there's two people here people on with the building still yeah uh let me go i'ma go up top are they inside uh yes these things start to run out a little bit reloading this hit this wall but there's still something over this way i'll crack down your head shine reloading i'm gonna jump on him i came with me there he's so fast there we go okay nice uh blue right here fresh oh thank they're fighting back at trains still too i have two double tap guns if i get two double taps if i'm double double tapping oh you need two double taps okay we'll find some yeah what do you have g7 eva g7 over eight which is quite the combat that is that sounds off okay yeah two guns you do not like please this lad appeared chilling now on my way oh what there's no way alone one sec healing up okay give him my shield to recharge president again i don't know where this is is it up top i think yeah it's down below down below i'm not with you i messed up got him nice job oh my word i was just trying to say as possible they were good players yeah that was a sweaty team though they were good nice job man that's all you oh god another team wait is he up top you're shielding i'm running out of ideas i think i think they're up top yeah they're both they're just they're just sitting up are they just chilling if you want to challenge at the same time there are they're literally just sitting there not not even moving no you're absolutely right yeah i am both kind of bad but i could push um i said we dropped back to this building i guess you should hit one nice i'm actually burning one i have my old say uh yeah let's push it i'm done i'm late i think he's flash i'm not sure there's one right here nice a little bit of shield but not that much health so i think he just popped up one she'll one shield self oh yeah they were holding hands right on top yeah i saw them for a split second and that's when i knew they died we can't push them out now those are close that was a close one but yeah very close these fights more manageable with two people though yeah yeah definitely it's because it's always that third person that gets the gets the kill gets the drop on you yeah okay if you see i don't know what they are giving my shield to recharge they're down uh bottom floor god i don't even i don't even want to fight this guy nor do i i have you don't need light ammo do you um i don't i'm good uh i'm jumping on classic yeah right bite crack number seven he's taking my rope i have no shotgun swipe just coming in classic nice fine nice it peaks a little bit if you see any shotgun emma please let me know because i all right zero i could just switch oh my god i have i have a thousand rounds in total my looting is just not there we already have the time i don't know am i looting i just spam looting sometimes yeah you sometimes you just end up with just the most random stuff i think i had 24 shields house i'll be honest with you right now like yeah a thousand rounds and and one one light mag that's all i had in my inventory i found double tap i don't like it but i'll what am i doing uh all right where's the next thing i think i'm just shooting east south and there's uh if there's no one there at least it's a care pack oh yeah it's gonna be janx's crate then we can say yeah we're going to get the crater jinx has been looking for for the past two weeks oh here i didn't actually over here yep i think you can still use this hey nice oh god over here i'm using that way oh god that team is still alive i'm okay i'm with you no i'm not uh lifeline's low i'm back it's just uh the one in the back of the sniper a little bit like one's got gold knock down thing you know okay she's low shield i think like uh 30 hp so he's rising i was trying to sell fresh i think it might be the lifeline yeah who was that everyone uh there was a uh octane that got away sneaky little octane i think that was the other lifelines teammate oh i see yeah i thought this team of top was dead so i just ran in there and i had to melt by proudly yeah i think it was three full teams all fighting right here don't actually get anyone again i hear more people in scraptor uh-huh oh i think that's the octane right there there's a lot of arcane magicians i'll see him i'll see him it's not bad off the scale just doesn't he's low yeah the like they made it travel so slow oh the bullet job 100 okay that was a completely different team i think there's still a solo octane somewhere yeah i have no clue more north i guess maybe they just rotate safe package hey somebody just oh i hear that oh that's behind us is that backwards is that back where we literally just came from i think it might be oh yeah oh my god this octane he's back only down yeah i think i think it was a solo yeah yeah it was it was the solo from before oh she found him he had no audio and then he's just in front of me yeah it seems like teams last a little longer than duo's i think so yeah there'll be more spread-outs yeah the game uh the gameplay feels a lot different oh yeah might be something good got called shields i think for nine oh he's he's out of there he's all the way over there he's chilled in a little yeah it was the octane he used his pad okay where is he oh he came back looking for a little shield hey this guy's got the fastest trigger finger known to mankind where is he oh he's back there oh yeah it's two of them yeah of course come along i think it's of course on the left i have a little bit that's like jiggle peak and all sorts of stuff yeah i'm gonna go far left the right time see ya oh nice i'm pushing that i'm pushing that which one uh can you mark it on the right um like here we should go okay okay ish fairly weak nice job that i'm glad i don't think because that guy with this trigger finger timer swapped out the other team are shooting at us from from west yeah that's two of them your car need 24 shield sales please give you my bads i mean i don't even i have three i have three bats as well thank you though here here's here's one extra one i'm gonna go grab some cells uh i can drop eight oh yeah you have like 45 right a fair few you could say an actual one right here if you need it i mean they're gonna have to come off the house so oh my god dude he's pushing he's rushing is he really hey right here the g7 oh this is just so slow on octane yeah on my opinion solo here he's blue dan what's the hop on a yeah they're playing this real slow practice on life i think i think it's the lifeline it's attracting 19 oh wait what where did that guy come from i don't know he must have climbed the mountain yeah i think he went into the storm and went back around this game yeah like those games feel a lot more uh smooth a lot more control definitely yeah less nice not as much yeah not as much nonsense nice let's go three dollars that was a nice game it wouldn't work that was a really good game
