not very useful for me i can shuffle across the way and i wish i had some big heels yeah i can drop you med kits oh thank you thank you all right there's a team up there the state let's just stay we are not suspicious at all we're close to you i can put some shots into these guys i'm going here we got the jump pad we've got the jump pad here i don't see them on me they're here they're here they're running as well they're running away i think they give me like 58. giving my shields a recharge i said we just have to rush him oh the double pad oh my god it's so so perfect oh give me i knew they got there they didn't want a third party yes we killed this team easy though oh oh god all right so they just used they're coming across the crew across the road please rub the den this way somewhere oh yeah we just need to make this one quick engagement all right cause we've got no cells right yeah yeah i've got one phoenix kit that's running up the hill he's running up there hold on oh close that crypto should be like 50 health unless he batted one there's one in there one in the smoke he's in the hole nice win dude nice that's a good one oh there we go good job guys oh and the two hours ago in two minutes like one and a half minutes so we could probably end it on a win there you are oh that was perfect that works to me last game ggs that's a great win i i turned up at the end god good job guys great game right there bridge made the clutch play though going in for the banner yeah but you managed to revive in the open and survive like we all we all had a piece it was all a moving machine so we crunched the numbers and the results are in coming in at first place is so far he got like 59 kills or something i don't know i guess it's all right coming in at second place is it plays there he is 37 kills to his name could have done a bit better but also could have been worse a solid performance and coming in third place benny central with 25 kills not a bad showing whatsoever considering his main game is warzone and not apex and now for the damage numbers which weren't part of the competition but i thought you guys might be interested so far comes in with 14 165 item plays with 9856 and benny central had 6622 so there we have it it was always going to be difficult to beat so far the guys just so gosh darn good thank you once more to lenovo legion for making this possible and sponsoring today's video and i'll see you all in the next one bye
