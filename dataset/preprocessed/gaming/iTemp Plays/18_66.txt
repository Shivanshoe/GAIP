hey what's up guys it's rich and welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have a great game here for you today one of my favorites from this season and i'm playing valkyrie he was a legend that i have not played for quite some time and the reason is uh my older controller had a bit of a problem with the jump button i couldn't hold it down i could only tap it which is sort of a problem when you're playing valkyrie because i couldn't really fly anywhere it was kind of the whole point of playing valkyrie also that controller and the controller that i used to have always disconnected both of those problems have been solved i don't know if you've realized but that hasn't happened in the last like week of videos it's been so much better recently but i genuinely think like valkyrie will be one of my mains now she's so good at getting in and out of fights and just taking the high ground which is good on every single map in this game i was left solo in this one from about halfway so it's actually really interesting i hope you guys enjoy it thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends careful teammate you're in a scary spot amigo he was i missed way too many shots in that first break way too many reloading where's their teammate that's the question oh okay three times action for the triple taking i'm not sure how good it's going to be in joe's which is usually quite a close-range affair god permanent scrapping oh he's got are they down low yes they are got ourselves a bandit out there get the wraith that's a testicle kill the wraith first she's probably a try hard because she's playing right you know working purely off what's the word for it stereotypes but if you had to choose a wraith or a crypto as the triad you're probably going to choose the wraith surely get the wraith out of there first then deal with the crypto after i have three kills probably undeservingly so but three kills you three kills minute till ring closed and we've still got a ways to go oh here we go did these guys shooting at did he kill that guy does that mean i'll get kill credit from this kill [Laughter] rampage of justice oh there's some good attachments i need the energy ammo that was in that bin but i'm not i'm not sure how many more gunfights i'm about to use this no one uses energy actually no one is out yes this guy does where did where does the loop go what does loot disappear scope this quadrant out here charging up my shields alert five ready to scorch for burn the absolute necessity of valkyrie on this on this map there are 20 of the people left round one has only just started zombies not on any sort of the map you could even walk on you have to be able to move around we're just not going to find anyone oh my god my trouble take is basically fully decked out what a glorious sight wings up care package here i'm gonna loot your stuff let me go take whatever you need i don't mind being we can second this area you people find this way so bogey over there why are you done looking this way oh maybe the lifeline pack opening fire rings out shields on that bandit should be reloading wings up a little bit careful careful i'm healing fire they might get you on the back it sounds like someone's behind them they are getting shot in the back there we go sometimes it's better just to turn around because they they're not thinking that we're going to turn around and shoot them so they're often just going to be in a field they have no cover there taking fire will they not get on the back [Music] reloading he's trying to get down this hill but he's going to see me rotate what happened to that teammate i'm seeing them i like the fact that this guy's using a 33 though you don't really see that too often i don't mind being like towards the gas here either because if we need to we can just all save shields on that bandit reloading i think i'm just hurting grapple charging on my shields wings out no come on let me up there we need to be careful it let you on that i've sat here before teammate you gotta be careful there just giving my shield wings out charging up my shield i'm on the roof he's solo he's gonna get double pushed the door yeah i just took out a whole squad got the banner let's bring him home so we're in the craft time 10 seconds to go no wings up i'll go this way if i can i guess this is the best thing to do respawn here i guess zone's not too far takes a bottle closing they can probably get luke we can valkyrt so i think that's the way to do it no it's not there's a team here nobody's not there are teams here too oh good grief charging on my shields don't waste it left teammate left [ __ ] falcons out of here why did he leave color five dog maybe they're going to keep this team that's coming in i guess might be able to get involved i have no healer balls so i can't really get in the zone at all especially because it's going to be third zone it's going to hurt that was a close fight with the valk i just came down to the noscope headshot at the end i thought i was gonna lose it for a sec i mean i was probably expected to lose it because i didn't have his full health because i just fought the mirage but still taking fire i might just leave who's landing could've dropped a 4k here for my team that was still around do you reckon i can uh check i can craft quick 30 seconds just one or two bats wins up maybe you should have crafted ammo i just really should have crafted ammo we're not fine closing charging on my shield probably could have cracked in another set of ammo i probably still could i'm not gonna though people have lights it's just the energy i needed really oh they're scrapping that way i mean i'm gonna have ultimate high ground here and i will have my ultimate my actual ultimate to reposition what are we hoping this is a scout i'll take a speed fire i was crafting ammo but who cares all right let's give this a go ultimates already multi's ready guys we'll be in the clouds ready ready to go give me some throwables they killed one of them still four squads left though two more squads and i'm coming in hot they're reviving toss them frag thermite out winds up i got myself in a bad spot now fox 3 missiles 5 valkyrie on station we are go for burn gopher burn that's a bad spot no all these teams going for these should air pressure drop oxygen masks will be provided if you're traveling with a small child this is a blood sport what's wrong with you i need to lock this down i need to prevent this team from coming up i'm against two giros here i need to i need to dissuade them from coming this way don't even necessarily need to kill them just need them to know that they can't be safe without getting beamed you know trap them up a little bit i think it's as well i don't actually want to kill him like too bad because then i'll have to face the jaw alone this is a balancing act now i need to stop him from coming this way i've got to hop on the rock maybe hello friend winds up it's a little bit sketchy huh you need to fight teacher that come on let's get it started i was about to ping [ __ ] idiot behind this rock uh what can i fall back to if i need to that rock i'm already i need them to wrap around that way there you go oh my god i need to get involved wings out i mean am i supposed to be able to shoot this guy he wasn't that laggy i didn't want to go and like waste my time i'm hoping he didn't try and heal up he's on half hammers wings i don't think he has hammers i'm already inside the ring that's aces is he the guy live yes i need to make this a 1v1 let's damage this guy a little bit so it's a 1v1 recharging is this golf shield up recharging shields it's my only health field so what else can i do under fire okay probably not hearing back up did the scene have red because i've just armas we shouldn't challenge that might be able to you know i got here i'm trying to climb what's my cover if he does this rings out i could have farmed a 4k off him i think if i just stay back there the reason i didn't want to is one i really wanted to win and two i had no health heals so if i got into a fight and he hit me down to like 30 health i'd kind of be screwed i'd be screwing a groove actually it would be the full screen magruder because i wouldn't be able to heal up and he'd probably just out i'd shoot me because i'd have like 150 total health so just get the job done i'm so happy i won that game there we go what a performance 14 kills 3 600. i don't know why my teammate left i think he thought i was gonna die i'm pretty sure that's why he left but still i don't know i get so nervous for those end games fights still that was a great game ggs
