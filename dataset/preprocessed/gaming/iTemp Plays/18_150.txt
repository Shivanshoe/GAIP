hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i am playing a legend who i think is the most underrated legend on apex today he's got one of the lowest peak rates uh he was incredibly good when they released him but he was nerfed shortly afterwards and those are all the hints i can think of it is of course sia why does no one play sia he's so good and he has one of the best ultimates in the game for team fights and spotting out third parties his passive is amazing and if you're playing in ranked you can actually find you know the rats are sort of sitting there on top of boulders and inside of bushes just trying to rat for placement points you can find them out easily with your passive you can detect any ambushes coming ahead you can figure out where the next gunfight is going to be coming from i honestly think he's criminally underrated i saw someone say that his ultimate made it so that they got third party more often because he's so big and uh you can see from so far away and i agree with that but at the same time if you can see his ultimate you can probably hear the gunshot as well let me know what you guys think in the comment section thank you so much for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends this one i think so yeah i think it just plays the worst i don't think the map's bad per se i think it has some bad pois but for no rotations and the fact that he's just humongous i just i don't like the flow yeah the uh the current kings canyon drives me in saying i really i don't know yeah why i hate it just get 30 too much uh i i think it's just because i i it was so good at one point and then they just like obliterated it it's because you're right i thought it was i thought it was the weirdest thing that they like completely got rid of two massive pois and like didn't even replace them just literally took them off the map yeah yeah that's kind of weird like through off the wall oh i can feel that map i could at least replace it with something there's another team this way yep all the things i'd love a bit of aim assist through just because there's one pole there they're on your head they don't like me can i hear him no i'm not that guy's 120. i can't yes it was fortunate this team decided to push this team instead of us i was not expecting that shields are [ __ ] there's a team over there okay i'm using the weapon combination i use literally every day i can see broke the one on teammate to the right how does he how can he see me through there does he have a digi yeah did you enemies seems dead are you good uh just two dead on this team or two down i'm trying right i'm going to raise stall yeah come on it's actually really fun to play like the the the interrupt mechanic is so good like it's it's such an interesting mechanic they did not have stuff started um i must confess i have three if you want to do trade oh yeah three okay i forgot how to tap strength cancel my syringe then face planted the wall that could not gone any worse gotta put that in the video huh i need a heavy mag so sorry oh well i'm not including that because that little spray i just did i missed every shot oh don't worry i headshot every single one of them do we have you back here it definitely wasn't purple only reason i did this was for a heavy mag oh no i did fine nevermind nice hey you found a you found a blue one there what about a purple oh i found it purple as well i took it uh yeah uh you're trying to be sneaky about it huh yeah yeah i need some heavy ammo now oh at 100 would you like something 37 i just found a little bit here he's in a wind man no flatline thank you i can't drop energy ammo i'll never find it again i reckon one day you'll see uh cya back in the four competitive things though i think his passive's so good you can get imagine all the three rp you can get in kp and tournaments by using his passive i think the only way that happens is if they actually do something with gibby that's the problem you see the pick right gb is like 99 yeah i mean i mean i like i don't know i don't know if they expected it's got 45 passives it's like so good they're all here oh yeah getting chased by multiple problems oh my god i want to shoot this team though i can't it's good what lies behind one when it comes to the right by the way i kind of split oh yeah they're bank in that way i hit one up top the blue the one on the one up there i hit one in the back two two of them hold that blue i need you got him blue of course the proudest agree with me who else would they be griefing not them up here i did nice i swear my bullets won't connect on that guy speaking right wrong way do you see that but i swear but it's there we're not connecting i need to wait they took the trident there's another one it's a different trident i've never seen too proud of seeing my entire existence two prowlers two tridents i've never seen more prowlers just please this is what you wanted this is what you asked for i don't know why you asked for this right behind you i'm out here for 105 flat did you game someone else got him i swear to see him for 105 flesh i'm not capping i did not possible see himself oh my god they're on me oh no they're not going down oh they're on me i'm judging my shoes they are i got your right side there's someone coming out that way though so let's go up the hill i have three should be didn't he where did the guy go um the worst yeah well you didn't see my speech right i have one cell one backed what's up anyone this place have looked this guy dudes high five bats standard stock here level three the main thing that extended it is required for now thank you a guy the lutege where's the uh where did you take the other uh car i tried it i don't know she just ran off with it i can't do much damage i did like bangalore in there still didn't get the kill i think you just drove away yo replicators coming in for a landing ah they were all chill after i just started screaming everybody gets the blood flowing you know you just start screaming what happens let's go crazy come on i want to scream easy win oh this is a crazy fashion oh i'm actually going to fly into the window there's no way am i going to do this oh that would've been so sick i think you're making into the window from there i don't think you can some guy did the exact same thing you just did to us before say i keep landing the same spot so i reckon that's just like what happened you know that's the limits uh i mean you have to know how to capture if in order to do that i do know that's that's right i don't think that guy uh knows how to capture he did he was tough driving everywhere i mean we should just start shooting around his last name scratching my head if i get crazy i get created ew all right let's take bets and where they're going to come from 100 behind us 100 this way save oh yeah i think they are too get ready for it oh 58 headshots just got red armor with this triple take let's go what am i believe and that one we mentioned it's got to be like 200 damage yep i'm i'm going to try and find my 5k i'm only 3000 away easy oh there we go there we go there we go yeah yeah imagine i'm taking that okay be gold to be gold's big ultimate from me looking on that one bye god i am never using this gun again not working because the heart is the hardest going to use in the game it is it absolutely is and it's very easy for it to make you look silly you are the apex champions get my scout back just because i'm dancing here thank you nice
