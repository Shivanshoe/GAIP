hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using a weapon that i actually used to despite when it came out it was either between the 30 30 or the scoped and the skate was my favorite weapon and the 30 30 felt like it did the same job but was harder to use nowadays i've realized probably thanks to so far that up close and personal the 30 30 is a buffed either 8 shotgun and in the second game that i have for you today um it's the only weapon that i used the entire time i barely shot my second gun in fact the only time i did shoot my second gun was to get rid of a watson fence and if you're wondering what happened in the first game we did go on to win but the game was really slow after a certain point so i'll just cut it to the next game anyway thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i win i win that film just i don't know it's terrible see why do i land here what mark i don't know why you land there like you let me land here i don't know why you do it we're just like always the focus when we're at this building back it up if you want we can try and help team mate uh she's here all right oh yeah wonderful get over there i four thermites down around page i do not i wish oh my gun wasn't out what are ashes flesh in there on the way eliminate the enemy so you're still thank you no well i have zero shield cells by the way thousands are depleted they're outside thank you i need that too thanks giving my shield thank you nice they're in here i've uh still have these four thumb lights i'm coming one nice good job good job bangalore he's balanced i got your habit by the way understand uh i'm okay you okay i'm fine okay maybe i'll make it have a greed oh no that's my idea well i said i was actually gonna make one but then you stole it literally kicked me i'm getting kicked served says right the boys are at the train okay come in i'm eating over oh my god i can't move mate reloading i can't move there's so much gas in there i mean i'm down team so hopefully they just trade resides here i need that teamwork to get over there hopefully they're up top that teammate can here go there all right it's next to us thank you you're good mate bad news is the corsics back up yeah and i'm not there sorry i accidentally messed up he's not back up i didn't even raise him yes contact with enemy [Music] is i love the 30 30 name it's all i've used this game let's give no scope it's great yeah 33 is awesome you need to hear this you hear this oh no absolutely not baby oh that's a habit okay i'd have killed him midday if i had the 30 38. that's sad it's gonna take me an hour to climb my head i hate this don't worry i'm gonna i'm about to throw i'll throw it it's a good time wasn't there a third oh no i guess it was i guess that's a big use mate oh that rope would have been way better what did i follow you for how is that better it's literally taking you further away from the fight not really how is that better look at how far she is how is that better explained i could have roped from a higher level of existence a higher plane why not just roll from here of consciousness where are we looking i don't even know where they are i don't know syringe here i'm tracking them they've dropped a lot of syringes in this area they're either construction or they're to the right to the right oh my god that's why you need patience i'm sad well i'll kind of get to you cracked get him get him oh my god sorry about the screaming i saw him throwing his ultimate i just i don't know my emotions uh i'm scared i'm just hiding in that corner i hate those fights in the bavaria i never seem to time it right you know do you remember which way this the the old ship came from no i never i never played an ark where did we land i don't know where we landed oh yeah i don't know recharging shield where'd you go guy i know come on on the way sorry just gotta challenge you like that cause uh no below below top like the floor right below one squad left by the way yeah why are the squads dying so fast today i i don't know what's has just been like this for me i've had some ten minute games on one's edge usually it's people died quick at the start but then you get like you know you get like five or six squads that land on the outskirts that keep the server alive oh my god yeah usually it's 12 minutes oh i thought it was boxing oh not maddie ice boys i feel sorry for that team they blew they've walked around for nine minutes because everyone led me to scrap it all they came here first of their team and died dude and that's the end of the game you are the apex champion i mean that's the apec experience you can't really see tonight that's true it is and that's why you have to learn scrap you do it's where life no nah okay and that's my apex experience no no
