hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using apex's newest weapon class the splatter round boosted guns that can only be found in big big moored big moored big mode it's the new area on world's edge you know the ramp up town takeover it's over there now as you can see on the screen these come with the splatter round hop up giving the gun a far quicker reload time and also more bullets per magazine as well they are insane the best ones that i found are the r301 and the r9 both are incredible you don't have to be ramper to make use of these weapons either the only catch here is that they are 100 crafting mats to purchase and at the start of the game you're just not going to have the currency to buy these however with this cheeky tactic you can secure yourself one of the splash around guns at the start of every single game you spawn in a sloba you wait until you get your ultimate which doesn't take long at all because you're spawning with like 50 on the charge or something and you can steal one of the guns without having to spend the crafting materials it's such a good strategy make sure you guys stick around to the end of this game because it's such an intense finish as well i'm left alone in a 1v3 v3 and both of the remaining teams want to be dead so bad so thanks for watching guys i really hope you enjoyed today's video and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right big mortadies i still have no idea about the layout of this place i'm winging it i'll give my best shot definitely another team here don't worry though because i've got a wingman and a mozambique oh my god they're all holding hands oh my god they're all there i mess one of them up i cannot help you teammate you've just went in 1v3 nice teammate i'm gonna take the r9 but i'm gonna need some i mean my wingman shots there were horrendous i need shields i actually did better with the wingman when i couldn't see isn't that crazy like i actually couldn't see and i was still doing better with the wingman i got 400 damage from me i'll take it but now i've got a gold r9 that reloads quicker and has more bullets per mag that is completely busted that is why i like landing there it's a good time this is the uh if you watch my video on the heirloom this is my havoc skin that i put on it's not a legendary or anything but it it's a skin all right it's one of the skins available i have one shield cell i'm just going to try and be annoying to this team my teammates are i think they're trying to come over i mean i've always got my q if i need to get out of here i'm going to try and find a little bit more damage if i can and normally i've got a naked havoc and a 99 not really sure how much damage i can farm enemy over there i wonder what i used all my throw balls darn it could really do with some i could do some shield cells too to be honest with you there's a fight behind them so i'm hoping they don't push me come on man try again this gun is definitely fair this gun is definitely fair i don't see anything wrong with this at all uh did he not have any attachments wait he didn't have any external mag i might have that more havoc if you're gonna be if you're gonna do me like that this r9 is absolutely ludicrous it's like the care package online if you remember that which was just lunacy careful i mean i've seen anybody shorty has revels you would assume so maybe we don't need it so stupid all right i am having a great time like i've been a little bit tilted because i'm on a time limit trying to get this video done because this is a great video because of how good these weapons are uh but they they've put world's edge in the rotation alongside king's canyon and olympus so if i don't get my video within world's edge i have to wait like four hours it's just it's the worst what time is it the moment it's currently half past two am and your boy is still here grinding a bit of solos that doesn't deserve a like on the video then i'm not really sure what does you know it's actually someone there we can third party over here it's way easier way better for us can i make it over the ravine with my with my q ability please thank you all the fight's over this way i've just wasted my queue there's someone over there seconds left let's go third party team someone has just gone flying teammates sniping i'm a fan of that nice here if we had race alt and revenant alt which i'm pretty sure we do we could have just like ran at these guys but that's okay it's making room for a shield battle too they wanted one as well that's fair enough so i've got space for that oh my god also alive i'll send you back to your teammate nice i press reload i'm gonna try and help you if i can two squads i'm coming oh my god the team's going to get here in a sec recharging my shield i don't send others people firing they're gonna hear i don't know why why did i attempt that cover me i'm using a phoenix kit i knew they were just i knew it i she needs to crawl away from them they can just hear it i had to give you down but that rampa thing is just so busted they know that i want to get back then revive i can't get banner i'm screwed i am screwed drive they're actually waiting for me all three of them are up uh if my teammates don't go down there i'm we're fine like did we use rebel once is this them no that's a fuse okay it's the second to last team now shooting me somehow i'm getting shot by everyone there we go here we go 10 seconds until the ring closes but it's a pretty long range fight from what i can tell if they're nadine each other it can't be that bad unless one of them please don't be a fused team because it's probably just the three stack these are the guys i don't like these the guys that were just chasing me there's no way you just said that for me there's no way you just double like what are you doing you guys are throwing why they're so desperate for me what you're still chasing me you're getting sniped by a triple team i'm furious there's no way you guys are this weird i can see the team though they're gonna take this road this is a real heat shield oh my god don't drive set woof if i could keep getting 1v1s i think i can win the game instead they keep chasing me i'm stressed i got one shield back from it though honestly using my phoenix kit there might not be a bad player saved on my heels as long as they don't take this rope wait is that the other team are you kidding how is it just me getting shot these guys don't care about each other like at all there is no way this is real recharging my shield there's nothing else i can hide behind honestly this is my only chance i mean i'm fully decked out i've got the graffiti mod r9 i got the full stack i don't know who i'm going to be reviving maybe myself with the self revive i can get my bracelet back quicker with the fast charge i've only got two bats but i don't want to give my position away with my ultimate that's how this goes probably terribly let's be honest the team behind me is a duo this team is the only three stack however i don't like this team okay i don't like them they've been chasing me like they killed my teammates i'm upset with them you know oh they're splitting up like this actually landing on them tell me tell me i didn't play that perfectly tell me i didn't play that perfectly yes i'm so happy i won that 3v3 v1 and both of the triple teams absolutely despised me and with the power of the broken r99 and some outrageous hip fire we ran victorious shout out to the team i know they left but they were patient they waited as long as they could they realized i couldn't get them they went into another game they were good before that i can't believe i've clutched that out i'm that's work 2 30 a.m 2 30. unreal c in fact it's it's 2 46 now ggs amigos
