hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we're also playing a little bit of lifeline who i don't often want to play which is weird because when apex came out she was an incredibly strong legend to play if you remember she used healing items faster i think it was 20 faster than other legends and this alone made her so strong you could pop your drone at a bat and be full health and ready to scrap in no time at all and then respawn tried to make her into more of a team player and she had the most outrageous revive in the game which they later nerfed but i feel like along the way she has sort of lost her identity a little bit she's not that great at healing her team uh for many reasons i think the main one being the drone doesn't move and how often do you get to just all of you just sit in a corner and like huddled around this drone that doesn't move at all one arc star and your team's going on reddit for a triple kill it's just it's just shambles it's a shambles i think that she could really do with a full rework to her kit because with all these new powerful legends coming into apex they've really left her in a bad spot in my opinion she needs she needs to be a great medic because she's the only medic on the game and to do that she needs to have a new ultimate and definitely some changes to her passive and tactical i to be honest with you i'm struggling to think what her passive even is i'm the only part of her passive i can remember is that she can get an extra shield cell from some bins in the map and that's just made me angry remembering that because it's useless let's be honest here now i can't say all these things and not offer up any suggestions so i've got one idea this is free of charge apex if you're listening this is a great idea i think i mean i'm not a game designer but i am a game designer if you know what i mean so it's a tactical ability okay we're gonna change it it's um a new tactical is gonna be a drone that heals your teammates now this isn't satire there is a change coming hear me out the drone latches onto your teammates so they can move whilst being passively healed by the drone let's say does 25 health over 5 to 10 seconds or something i'm not sure those numbers you can change them so it's balanced but she could store like two or three charges of this ability much like revenant and fuse do with their abilities and then when there's a big fight she can have two or three of these passive heels to go into a fight and i just think that would be so much more useful for the team you know because think about it if apex revealed that they were releasing a new medic legend in season 11. you can guarantee this legend would have like a jet pack and they'd have like a syringe but also like it was a gun so you could like it would be like anna from overwatch you could shoot your teammate and heal them 50 or something it would be crazy like lifeline would never be a legendary release now because she's too basic and i feel sorry for the lifeline mates i feel like they're being left behind a little bit she's not she's not in season 10 she's in season three okay let's speak the truth here i'm getting way too passionate about this because i don't even play lifeline let me know what you guys think about lifeline i know there are a lot of lifeline mains out there what would you like to see in her kit because it needs to be changed it needs to be more powerful so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it thank you for listening to my rather horrendous rant i appreciate that as well and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeesh i'm going streamer building probably not the best play but i'll try and like close then can i come over and help by punching because i've got nothing uh there's downs here are you even bodies i'll miss you can get down here i'm going i'm going i'm just healing upside down yeah you're good 14. someone's beneath us yeah i don't know how far though i have 20 bullets and that's it uh my light gun and my heavy i have 40. you know not just us we got to watch each other's back they're down below like very very bottom i'll come on with your health you're healthy oh my god pat it up top they put it up top but there's one team for 120 i'm blue oh it's another team pathfinder's one i can chase

broke one uh i'm switching up she's at the top i think hey oh i just sent that i guess you because the gas might hold on i mean mate they're separate seams i'm outside in a weird spot honestly i'm outside like on the corner oh my god no there's a guy here i can't reload because they've been [Applause] he's here him he's going to phase okay he's facing our teams there though another squad another squad knew the squad by the way let me let me play me if you need to man i'll turn on the switch okay that beat's gone on fire why does she have two drones i don't know because one wouldn't be a drum kit it would just be a drum you know sorry i'll go this way i'll tell the rampage there's a lot of loot down here why don't i always go around the back there for no reason you know it's my worst habit well i've got worse habits than that it's a pretty bad one round one we're all inside this ring he's broken yeah he's real weak him again that's going to get the kill wait i got the kill because himself that's a win nice work nice someone's on you yep that dude got destroyed by my 30 30. i can't behind him i didn't want to shoot him so i just punched i saw it oh my god man i'm dead

one thank god man i was probably back sorry mate so i am the worst that's why i'm gonna survive i did 12 damaged absolutely fine you didn't survive that's it oh there's a i don't know if you're using heavy but there's one in here at gold mag oh i really need that i have an e right with no bolt and an online i don't know what's happening with this game i'm throwing a lot too but it's not just me thank have been i just unreal we better get some prize money draken or no you know it's funny too as like uh we like i mean we have been struggling all day so we don't really get like much videos and then we're gonna have one game where we just steamroll everyone and then it's just going to be like we're just going to get those cuts you know mike's going to come back back mike's back lobbies you know big mike seems me he absolutely loves it there we go that's our building we fought hard for that building nice i'm like twice he's 18 he's one hp how is he still standing up there why am i reloading my gun i have a gold mag i'm so done pretty fast it's not heavy right hold the 30 30 takes so long it's pretty quick just putting your back pocket don't have to imagine they pulling down hello good boys 6161 nice and violated rights going back so yeah myself just ground floor having a great time mate beta's got absolutely first gunfire the game just for that to happen that's so sad they came in hot too i think the there's still somebody alive on that other team though no i think the wraith got away she she wasn't in the confined roof and i think she got away my 30 30 is way better than your wingman round two beginning countdown oh my thirty three so much better than your wingman it's actually crazy the reaction replicator incoming how much damage and kills you have because uh i feel like i have a lot of kills not that much damage uh let's hear yours first um 1400 damage well 14.79 oh god team at the mobile respawn i'd love respawn regular respawn yeah and 10 kills oh my god oh my god i can't see anything i'm trying i'm trying he's rising he's in stores what how oh what just happened i'm punching what happened i don't know what happened punching all these people man i'm just punching them to death i'm throwing a lot of hands oh did you push them all out i'm sorry no i won't like the octane was like because i then you got a reason when he was just popping it back so i just put the time to the top oh my god i missed i've never missed so many shots in my life that was tragedy hey i'm just like firing it too like they'll see that people have seen that team and be like why how are you getting block lobbies no okay so go back to our original conversation um how many kills and damage uh 12 kills 1900 damage nice what about you um i'm at nine kills and uh 2400 damage yeah i thought that's always much but i mean i'm using the 30 30. yeah well you hear that what the heck was that was that fuse altogether yeah what kind of positioning is that it's a good position he's crying oh he stuck me rich this man is really kicking off oh oh my god oh my god thank you i can just hear your thoughts yeah it is well not for me but i chased you to put the drone down on you i saw you jump out the window oh oh and i did uh just pop her medkit up so yeah i also came in i just took my little paw oh stop yeah of course that was yours oh he's taking the uh throw i broke him for 36 flash oh my god good thank god i'm taking oh that squad what are they up top yeah yeah where is this guy silent oh my god he's better there's three of them right i feel like they're all split yeah there's three of them i think they're pretty sweet [Music] i've got back remember you can just go crazy i think they're all over there they're launching excuse me sir stop it no please let me go back there's a bunch of arrows sticking on my face he's hitting them nice game mate we held that building well yeah that was intense that was crazy you could say that bluetongue is the superior scanner to cna what do you reckon uh you could i think you could too i think you could use actual tire if you wanted to i i probably could and i probably will okay considering we talked about this like 30 minutes no mate we have the exact same stats apart from damage but let's not talk about that part well that's the important part um true
