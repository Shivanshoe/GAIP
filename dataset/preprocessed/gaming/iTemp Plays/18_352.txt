hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends and one of the games that i have for you today was a bit of a disaster these are the kind of games that you don't usually see on the channel i went down four times and had to get respawned back into the game after that but despite that i actually ended up on a good amount of kills with a good amount of damage i hope you guys enjoyed today's video unfortunately it is not coming home and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends do the video that i that i followed which is pretty self-explanatory and pretty easy to do it shouldn't be too bad if it's just uh oh someone's going inside oh i'm gonna like feathering i don't know i'm down he's weak though i crafted oh my plan i don't even realize we had a lifeline he's okay i'm sure to use the drone if you use your drone can you uh can you can still rest now i know but i saw i mean like she couldn't use afterwards nice yeah that other building only had that entire strip over there had a mozambique and that was it how does that even happen that's ridiculous isn't it shouldn't even that shouldn't even be possible nah that's ludicrous tell you what though mozambique kind of nice honestly not bad right here really there's cracks because they're just loading my face like this it's ridiculous i can't even see because of this i cracked like four people jesus rich it's my third revive mate i'm gonna kill this lobo i gotta write on me nailed that whole squad good job reloading kill the race nice i think that was it oh my word have a thousand damage in one kill i've been down three times so if i go down again you need to start the revive within two and a half seconds i'm dead uh yeah you're probably gonna die if you go down so i would suggest not to go down you suggest not steam rushing in or what ah i mean this is just a suggestion i'm going in first on my desk so far not been my fault you know uh debatable nah that's not gonna do me hal would have died where i died i might have died sooner you know i did really well oh you're saying you're better than hal in that one situation yeah the 20 time how many how many tournaments are there 12 times i've learned i've won a lot i've won quite a few but under a different alias how no but we're talking about me no talking about how the 20 time he's like how do you go i dropped my purple there's like three purples over there and i dropped all of them i didn't pick up there you know 26 on this right excuse me sir the other team's coming the heck is happening here he three shot me with an either okay i've got three shot by this guy with an either oh my god 118 three shots there's no way oh yeah the gun's ridiculous i had one two but i aim for a hundred this guy's just the best i have 1200 damage and two kills and i've died about eight times like this is literally the worst game ever wait don't don't come this way go back the other way because i forgot the sounds kind of i might die here i'm dead don't no there's no way she has a spitfire dude out of all guns i mean they're stacking up the revived they all have spitfires that was the last of that squad don't slow down now only two other squads left is this been the worst game ever for me or what i wouldn't be opposed just turning off my computer i'm tempted uh where's the nearest you're not getting sleep now i'm rubbing you i'm robbing you well there's okay you've been absolutely joining me i don't even want to be brought back i am off the scene oh you have some great loot though yeah all right i'm zooming i have it two times on a on 99 should i give it a go yeah definitely is lc i can actually use it two times as well because you get per optic yeah you can actually use different yeah opt is kind of nice are you yourself i have a camera here oh ow this way it's going from this way too because that all came from over there yeah this all came yes i mean like oh that's your painting the other thing they rotate i think they've rotated this way they did this is i literally think i've been using this gun wrong i'm telling you the two times with these alc sayings oh yeah i would agree with alc settings definitely work maybe i can try it two times and everything there back to back they'll call me if i only use it two times back to back to back no just back to back that would be the three times mate that time's open if you fancy i wish i could tap strafe that would have been fun i'm just kidding ah he's got nades man he's got names this guy's got nades he's got nades yes i know where he is i don't know where he is what's going on man why can't you open doors at the end screen i don't know it's weird isn't it and you can't go on ropes they're like no it's infuriating because i risked my life for the team devoted it to the cars nice all those reports from me oh in here there's one more this is so hard oh can we get teammate oh we got him nice very close 45 seconds why not being able to jump that sounds horrendous yeah that's really bad i have no i'll it's fine it's fine it was just a funny video with the randomness like this random was just he thought he was a fake snipe down but he was like oh like aggressively toxic oh oh i did so much damage did you really let me crank this let me crack this i've been doing so much if you can get them in that like close quarters i don't know if there's any making some poppies what are they all right here in the corner they were all just like one gum was down but there were two like here like upstairs that was perfect i'll come let me [ __ ] one more she jumped over it that's not fair it's ridiculous and i can't move oh can't even jump how's that feel who needs to jump kills i'm sorry no you're not mate i was just i was being toxic again uh okay i just think oh my god wait what happened i blew it up i'm nice i have no heavy i don't know if you have any heavy i'll switch to something else but i thought um i dropped like uh like 80 70 over here thank you yeah it's been doing that for me too a lot they were like running on the ground yeah i broke crypto cryptos one shot i'm all the way up top oh he's so low this may have been a mistake oh oh he died in the storm that guy died in the storm yeah i think there's a guy that i got one shot honey no no that was the octagon that died in the storm oh okay i don't know i don't know what happened we should not see mate what's going on here three light 43 flesh [Music] what the heck was that team okay i need all the throwables i can possibly find you can't jump but you can still launch nice okay okay um would you like to know by uh my uh throwable count i reckon oh my god they're looking at me i reckon you've got 18. um i have a total of four our stars yeah four nades yeah and three thermite oh yeah okay every single person up there is burning are they dead yet they're dead okay i'm going to lose no no baby healed they're all fully healed now oh they pop some bats yeah they're full of that and that happens when you just set them on fire and they're like no there you go how are you alive no i'm gonna die to the fuse oh please no no no you better have some nightmare mate what was going on that fight did you pop two fuse ultimates how how could that come back oh that wasn't mine oh was he not no i died too and to another fuse unbelievable sight i i don't think i've seen a fuse all day i don't think it's even and then we mock the fuse ultimate and you die that's not palmer i don't know what he's give me my shield oh i think i see him he's burning i mean oh see if i keville i mean seriously this oh just doesn't work he he legitimately just does not work he's a magazine keyboard legend you just use arkansas and you just walk around corners with five ark stars and you stick everyone that's that's it's a massive keyboard legend i uh yeah it's almost too quick yeah i prefer just like using my arm i prefer the slow nature of yeah okay mm-hmm just have a teammate i have no idea what he said the entire time so i've got voice chat on zero
