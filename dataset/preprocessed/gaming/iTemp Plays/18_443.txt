hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the second chance game mode is here it is part of the war games event that let us play five new modes over the next two weeks and what a way to start this game mode is college as you can imagine as soon as everyone has two lives a quick tip for this mode is that loot at the start of the game is particularly difficult to find because you can't loot your kills if they had a respawn token when you downed them it does drop a few syringes cells and ammo but not enough for those heart drops and you cannot arm switch off the green boxes it makes it quite difficult but it's a lot of fun thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends if i miss it i only see our shadow i know i see one more team going to the right i think yeah they're with me wow i did the grapple technique and you still pretty much beat me is that the slide technique you just go so fast that's why you're here though i told you i was i told you i was going this way uh yes what do you mean yes what does that mean um i wasn't gonna come here until you said you're coming here [Music] oh that's clever i like the idea they're pretty gonna land up top right um it's possible how much time should you go why are they coming where did this oh my god are you so lucky yes dude oh ha that is what ow what i didn't get for holding it's just how do you do more damage to me go like this right and you drop down like this and straighten the window and then you're behind him are you really though yeah oh i could pick someone so if you die you can just respawn good luck i'm kind of bad i got the car for us oh this isn't you no i said it's a good look i couldn't like rope yeah yeah big place big place they see me there's two of them on me my hands cracked i just oh he's not dead i'm the worst why why you i need help with the kill you managed to take so i thought i see i have to reload that's the you know game's over game's done okay how much damage you have right now richard not much not much exactly three three thousand exactly 300 exactly 528 well i'm not impressed enough because you probably have 712 874. honestly i don't want to put any of this in a game because that was really bad okay i need some cells how many cells um i'm gonna have two after this this guy had one or two so i'm okay you see bye bye i'm on the other side i'm running i'm actually the world's best so yeah all right we just eliminated the whole squad how much you have 800 watt i mean i completely let you get those kills because i feel bad 500 watt incoming care i feel bad that i don't leave any kills for you ever i mean i'm hoping it can pick me up seat belts thanks for the ride friend let's do this does it take 10 minutes to hop in the passenger seat are you kidding like that's what i just take the rope let's take the rope [Laughter] oh they're crafting here see that's what i want to throw nice i can't see anything i can't see anything because the animation is bigger than my entire screen okay where are they i literally can't see i'm like i'm cracked man i'm weak oh yeah thank you good grief wow looks like that was the last one these guys remain i'm so bad at this game yes all right i need a scorpio if you find one please i need a hopper well do you ready for a big old say i can't use your pill like this can't see anything feels bad let's explore this way that's all right we're trying to come behind them by shooting you there's another team they're gonna fly back on us too probably or trying gatekeep i would assume i just love this legend this is my favorite apex legend in the game by the way oh before this okay 75 yeah this is awful um trying to fire in a heat shield like you just can't see anything yeah just the storm in general so so hard to fight in japanese by any chance i have uh three would you like one thank you thanks no problem it's been a fun game though been involved you know yeah my aim is all over the place healing watch my back come on there's a scrap on the left too hmm yeah i think they were fighting too much all right i think no i think they're right here flesh yeah i'm backing up oh come on i don't have an angle really other team i'm completely out of heels and she's let's get over there here we go another team oh my god it's kind of i don't know what is happening to me yeah like it's hard to loot because half the people you kill are just like i don't know they just drop one shield site on the floor i'm uh i'm gonna go to fight night i guess uh yes i'm gonna apply no i think i'm okay okay [Music] oh another team on me come back trying to help i broke one of them crypto is one two backs i got gold crypto gold um oh yeah i dropped the gold over here too i have four um med kits too you need one so drop them anyway um i have to get there if we need him on the bridge here this guy's got a sniper on my way over dropping the pain i think so i only saw one cracked let's turn this behind this we just eliminated caustic with a him i had to drop completely this is where the path is they're up top they rised up here yeah i'm behind him yeah i missed all my shots oh last one you got this nice nice it is it is really fun this is really fun i wish i wasn't so bad at the game but yeah this is great you're gonna be like 3 700 damage honestly it really was but it was so bad it was such i'm just so bad yeah we called freud well we can't afford it that was fun that was fun though this is a really fun game mode really fun
