hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are back playing some more apex legends of course and in my previous ranked video i said that i was uh really enjoying the solo ranked grind at the moment because every game felt different because i was adapting to how my teammates wanted to play and this was definitely one of those games where i had to adapt to how my teammates wanted to play because these guys were absolute maniacs they wanted to rush every single fight we landed somewhere with another team with a crafter there we killed that team i wanted to craft they literally typed and said no craft we rush only i was like okay then let's give it a go and it was sensational hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right i'm not under the back i've got a rampage that's fine why we also split why are we also split there's a team of three and they're all holding hands we should not be engaging you know my teammates actual bow demons my teammates are both demons i've got 2kb from this evil shield here level two hey we got bad guys over there yes i've got kp on that too stood still nice squad you guys are demons wait i should probably take this wasn't the crash this is so bad extended time for meg here this is so bad made a massive what a terrible hold i only get 2kp i hit all three of them i understand i'm confused what's your kneecaps gonna blow up i need to craft and there's a crafter here so i'll be a little while no craft only brush crafting like when you when you see them type that you think oh these guys gonna be like well apex predator and stuff and then and then like recharging shields i like okay we are two so you decide crafting give me a sec batch you guys need any bats these guys man the lobby's not going anywhere yeah give me 10 seconds i'll be there just chill hold on opening okay i don't have a shotgun bolt and these guys are holding us from zone and we still need to go this way i'm not even going to try and chuckle i'm letting these guys shock all right shot call cause they're not gonna listen to me like at all these these guys this is the gank you know and now you want to craft shield battery here got you with the bats i'm gonna craft the bag i think reloading grenade beautiful watching this back is so funny because these guys were the most unassuming players ever like level 90 level 110 one of them was like diamond four the one was still platinum so it looked like one of them just made diamond and they were still trying to play like they were in place one of them's got a bow we're almost got a triple take and they're just brushing everyone and it's working and i i don't understand i've had games where i've played with like masters and like ex-pred players and we play like defensive and play position and scan for b can get to the zone and stuff and we still die yet these guys are just so full of confidence they're just rushing everyone honestly was actually kind of refreshing and i apologize for ever doubting them because they are geniuses at this game contact there we go there's two enemy down i need to recharge my shields okay on the back that's one of the first forest which is nice thank you guys want to show my tennis elbow like he keeps cracking people with the bow and the other guy's got triple take they're actually kind of crazy maybe this is the way i need to play turbo charger oh here we go down that one reloading i'm taking shots bandit down i got you back i can't believe this strategy's working is that team still on the roof what a bunch of dweebs i'm using it for now he cracked one hey who invited the third party sergeant shields come on come on charge it let's go here arcstar oh my god he's 10 health that counts for anything that guy was struggling big time out of here man stop it we got trouble really close i'm not going to get any kp but he's fine i've already got seven i'm just going to try to do good damage for my team here what's in here probably a crater i would assume reloading recharging fire i'll leave you there how much damage we've done to this team reloading another boogie sergeant on my shield is that two down from this team or one reloading one second we got this i gotcha hey i've got a deal nice i actually got some kill credit like it matters but they're a bad thing right one minute ring's not far i'll don't hold on to my ammo i might need to use it just using a phoenix kit i need to recharge my shields okay kind of farm some damage on those guys crack them about 18 times each ring's not too far 45 his team behind didn't push up that probably still sat there doing absolutely nothing one would assume team here hostile over there opening fire recharging shields yeah we can't really see it for too long we should probably just see in there let's go right here he wants to rescue the team i'm telling you i was i was doubting these guys at the start but i'm actually on board if you want to rush him let's rush him these guys are genies i think he's trying to hold him actually i'm also down to hold him another squad let's say for now i don't know how fruitful is going to be nice i mean i could pull us down on come on we have no throwables either okay so we know where one of these teams are taking shots need to recharge my shields really trying to crack one of them to kind of i accidentally took that oh my god i nearly threw that by accident going through a portal but it actually gave me a nice little position i mean i assume they're solos because there was four teams and it wasn't even 10 people and that was a team of three i think it might be two solos or something i don't know i don't think it's a full team i'll be hiding under there i'll be honest with you i'm going looking sweet fire still here so it might not be this way there's a clueless bogey out there hey where's the last one where he's where are you off to get him i mean i'm not gonna get this killed ready but still i'm going in there oh what play guys i can't believe how that actually worked what played oh just you wouldn't expect to see these guys i think level 93 not a level like 110 apex walking into a diamond lobby just rushing people i love it that's amazing [Music] hey at least i got four kills but the damage is right up there come on come on
