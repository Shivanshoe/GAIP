have a cigar to twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now there was an update to the game yeah say and one of the biggest changes came - Evo shield and I overlooked this change yesterday until jang-soo mentioned it but they've drastically reduced the amount of damage it takes to of greater each level of the Evo shot you can see the numbers on the screen here so the first upgrade takes 75 damage down from 100 the second upgrade takes 150 which is down from 300 and then the third upgrade takes 400 down from 500 so 225 damage gives you purple armor from from nothing pretty much that's easily achievable within two kills and then a further 400 damage will take you up to the red and this change has made evil shields the new the new base life mean they'll be the thing that I'm trying to find rather than personal vault I definitely still think the gold is better apart from maybe on lifeline and Gibraltar because they have access to quick heals but if everyone else I'm going to be dropping purple shields for Eva even if it's just a twenty five basic off the ground Evo shield just because of how quick ease to get back up to purple you're gonna make sure that you play a little bit slow until you have those purple shields though because you will still need to heal up when you upgrade and you're you're just so squishy when you've only got 25 shield for anyway thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed the video if you do be sure to leave a like rating and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends I thought were going scrapple what I've described oh I swear we called that first littering no one goes to geese in my friends and nobody not one solid part from I saw it assume they're going train I should be flying this by myself all right feces the maximum way to get loot because my teammates call it Giza which doesn't have too many things to I remember and then I'll just leave this lot larry's they're actually somewhere over there I didn't see anyone flying in can see any trails nothing oh here we go having to find myself some Evo shields because these things are tremendous sees the only word pick of all three bottles of commands okay there is actually someone over there I didn't want to believe it but apparently true I've got an evite our revenant that has purple shields at least let me try and find like a slice or something I'm coming I'm coming listen no more messing about and what is the one thinking a lot and she doesn't have any shield so yeah I'm coming hopefully we can get like a little bit of a pinch maneuver here howdy how do these guys sneak past me Bonnie see him finally what's the deal we got someone down or something old nails I got a few they prefer they book the owl starter which is nice okay nice job teammates I was redressed in my hand when he came down there when he came up the stairs like that good grief that could have been wrong bad and embarrassing which would have been worse in some way I literally thought you're arriving what am I doing here what's going on here I believe you teammates I think if you two does that one guy right if you cancelled the revive I've been playing good today as well I've been playing real good and Here I am not embarrassing myself once more all right 14 more damage I've got myself purpose feels which I do not deserve doing the current level of gameplay to stick with me all right because I'm definitely gonna pick it up here are you playing good today I feel like I've been playing better the last few days actually I'm not really sure why some some days I hop on and I'm like real risky on each yield shields here I'm not gonna just feel batteries thanks right yeah some days I hop on and I'm really received but last few days I thought we did actually not the door type I'll take the level to obscenity heavy matter for my old hemlock of justice here they both the else done they nerfed in some aspects but overall I would definitely press the player book medical friends definitely know what I want anymore are they reduce the recall when you feather the trigger like the horizontal recoil but they did reduce the amount of shot it takes to overheat so it's sort of like it's all like what they did to the havoc like they remove the turbocharger but they reduce the horizontal recoil and it's better than ever you don't need the turbocharger so I think it's sort of comparable but the nerf but a buff at the same time all you don't want and you may think I'm an absolute lunatic for this but I'm only 40 damage away from purple shells thank you friend all the Watson doesn't matter either way a 40 damage away from a purple shell to the Evo and then we are I think it's 400 damage and then here and then it's red so then we'll have level 3 level 4 and then whatever Evo shields are level 500 oisin we're gonna be looking real color from the bottom left-hand side here that's only like he on his screen doesn't say that I'm using an Evo shield it'll just have got blue shield is probably extremely confused as to why I'm running off here it's all good bit of a scrap in the distance here train yard teammates are just at the how does this always happen to me how do I always go so far ahead with Pathfinder looking for the scrap scrap scrap finder and then my teammates are a little bit further behind I search it's on here yeah and then the spring they'll fingered again managed to mention find the scrap before we run away looking look at our armors we could definitely well be I need 40 damage there we go he's landing I fallen off this ledge whilst I'm firing you come on there we go yeah 400 damage and then we'll get to the red shields as I climb get bamboozled helping that I'm faced with in my life who is that same squad at least I was the Mirage yeah yeah I know no no the Mirage is the best one to have the goal knocked down on okay oh it's so good type of God knock down on the Mirage because he can I've see one of his passives or he's passive I think he's only got one so when he goes down he goes invisible for a little while so you can sort of crawl to safety and try and revive yourself I would have fun with that it wasn't for my teammate I mean I would hurt him I figured it out once went we downed all of them and I saw that they didn't have any decent knockdowns there is another team here I've got three kills and I've got Eva red Evo's let's put pressure on this team I've done one of them call em get free revival oh nice job teammate the Evo shield should have a sixth one it should have a sixth ability should transform into rainbow shields and you should have what would it be like a hundred and fifty cuz I think I'll to reach you by name if it was in the game I mean that would be ludicrous imagine imagine it your ball same with these fictitious rainbow shields that would be 270 - might be a little bit too much cynics okay okay everyone's using an energy good that's not good and we got to go real fast explore it this way hey I can forget to be friends a little bit um I have to drop my ulti here let's make sure we can make it I don't like doing that because we come into train yard and Pathfinder automatic train Yardies op2 transporting your teammate up top but I do have a gold helmet so we'll see if it's all come back soon enough we'll be alright I'm sure I'll scout ahead there's not like there's anyone here thankfully at level 4 how'd you get that from did my team ever do something that's always that that came from there's one back there but I'm not sure why they drop it it will just drop all that stuff yeah absolute nobody's here unfortunately for us scrapping the descent server I mean if we're gonna go I'm gonna have to get real close I've got a fully also prowl app and an L star he jumped off how much steelies high ground then if there's no one else up there might be something good this way you can have a door knock then this could be the fontina I'm on the way friends I call me all-star in hand to absolutely no health that was his teammate info party name some contact exams around 56 in there we're all using them so I'm trying to make sure they've got enough one thing I've also about the red shields the red evil shield is that you've got to make sure that you've got some big heels by will actually carry around lurking lurking behind the rocks I will actually carry around Phoenix Cletus with this it's gonna heal so much confidence hi friends companies is very high I'm not sure I would a receptacle Digital threat I mean I got so many of it six-six should be fine there only two of this caused them to just need to make sure what I like either they go into the cat package or they trying to put participant no man for treating okay one is landing on my forehead what do you do so crypto lens and a wife already you know I should have that that's the guy that was wished for me I think okay there's the other last team aren't this is no there's nothing I can do with an L star in a prouder against these guys [Music] the verification unity how did they pull back all these guys copper he does ready those two now that's a one out of ten grapple but it's okay hey did you see come on excited sniper some type of lumber no time to mess about it's two against one you guys got this surely there we go nice job team this guy's living life that wasn't a carry you revived me the start Watson 20 kills we cleared a third of the lobby just under 3000 damage not too bad this man was revived three times and then said thanks for the carry I didn't play says GG did he hear that oh no he heard it GG my friend oh great teamwork that game as well ready vows shields or just Evo shields in general if you didn't pick them up before because you used to take too long to charge up I mean you should be picking them up now you need like two or three kills and you've got yourself at least purple and you've right around the corner from red thank you for watching though I do appreciate it and I'll see you on the next one [Music]
