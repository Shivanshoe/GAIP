a versa guys each rich welcome back it's under the video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and this is going to be my first to win in season 5 which came out a few hours ago now I'm playing on PC because PC you gets the update far sooner than PlayStation - actually still updating my PlayStation 4 unbelievable but we're playing low but the new legends were testing her abilities and we even land in one of the new locations as fast I hope you enjoyed thank you for watching and I see you all in five and 1/2 seconds my friends all right capacitor this place is called capacitor and I'm here with all over my teammate he's a caustic which I'm very happy about because caustic received a buff his teammates are no longer slowed in his caustic gas that's good for me when you're the teammate of the caustic which means that we should just be champion inside a building and then just bouncing the whole thing out and then winning I think there you get the whole planets can I go go just in the window just train the window I should probably save that do you look at the core bank it's a 25 second cooldown on Lily's hammer points I'm not gonna use that actually I have two hands please Pete only 20 they'll do and they also nerf the havoc a little bit I should lock on that she loved you at me there's another one around they did this it looks cleaner that and you can see the loops a lot easier you just need Miami I've seen fall for a p20 Clinton we can have 14 wait give you some more as well I'll just use this for Lobby all right first kill that'll do they did not okay they did not know what they were doing as you could probably tell from the fact that they use their teleport oh it's purple shields look at this what an incredible passively sees it's up there as well too fancy nobody need it as much as him I don't think the fact that you can do that is is actually crazy you can also do this you go over here just got a list of all we activate the charge in tower watch my ultimate BAM maximum maximum charge pinged it before I realize what it was well there are so many changes I'm trying to remember them all as we're going don't need that don't need that I don't know if I want to keep this the or tonight something burst I was gonna go like this don't know if you're planting haven't points but it's up for grabs I try not remember all the buffs and the changes as I'm going along so you stopped in wrong please it's our site is it a Stephanie site three times well you can see through the aim of it if you're close enough there's a big scrap going on wait okay what a bit high ground here then craft absolutely murdered Havoc's enough by the way purchase arm is reached I have no ammo trying to keep this one at bay because there's people this way to I need to rotate around not getting pushed I'll call you back let's go this way let's go this way it's all kicking off enough right now if any drones already need to change its gun even though it's still outrageous I could just all TV's let's do it what do we want let me open it give me the Spitfire please with this oh those are two times you can have okay well that's not fair ammo counters Nitin and only one stack as well what's a little tip for you I guess not for my mistake don't do what I just did I think you can get away with it you can't they know what happened down here still cuz they don't really have an easy way out of the situation so which way would they have gone did everyone just go you know what we don't have lights at level 19 this be final 19 action my tier he got himself some decent stuff too I would assume nice give me your stuff give me your stuff I need you guys heavy wait where's my pink on home r1 you need like imma I'll give you a bit of a trade see that's just confusing me do you have any of this I know you pick some up come on a bit of a try a bit of a trade you've got a must if there is that don't use heavy hammer there's no way when there's shock and I win the game oh do we get involved that's the question and the answer is probably yes just make sure you challenge up top it doesn't have you didn't have a fight oh let's use their all team are usually named that's not fair a lot of things aren't fair today an admirable kill he was crawling in the dirt my friend he there's nothing I remember about it you know that way the songs come in low I hear him just let me leave this I'm joining you I think they did that we've makers storms not too far away she'll be fine there's a there's a low bow around you somewhere I just don't know where she is and also it's very sad I didn't get killed pretty flat don't you must have already been the perp the people that downed them must have still been alive because I swear if they die you get cooperator for it I mean if you see any heavy day boy struggling out here got my ulti back but how do I have only two kills I feel like I've you know I've got a few a season Nettie he's been looted but there's a chance there is still a few bullets around no I am to rely on the alternator here I think I'm having to rely on an alternator it's my primary weapon it's a struggle team you could say sixteen people that all right let's rack up some kills here I do like the fact that me my team are here have been teasing with the teamwork we've been near each other entire time thank you so much here we go sleeper stuff behind where do they lower go I feel like she would have been behind this cuz I was closer when I threw my little low bow bracele maybe not though someone's setting off the dragon over this way it's gonna loot this rock we find here I've got find a flat - meant to replace this as a mastiff maybe I'm oh how much do I have not that many I'm coming I could have literally just place my ultimate date there are books on d-day above us maybe's has hidden stomping around the place always a possibility to the coffee ground make sure we talk to up one of bruising oh that's yours trouble setting here we go alright let's go let's fight some more people only have two kills got let's move wind test now low blow thanks that way somewhere there's also purple arm in here but I'm see we've both awesome I have to throw boss it's not that bad not that bad well I always get like this burst of energy on update days I feel like I my videos are just completely different to usual sounds so far stop firing jazzy Spurs hey let me get over there first I thought it's a single fire preemptively absolutely launched this okay wasn't enough planning and then they go far enough and my teammate saw it too how embarrassing nice update this by the way some of these make some of these now Dave God shields no longer fast here's what it does instead that might make is the Evo she'll burn now instead what happens is your shield cells heal fifty so it is kind of faster healing still but not for shield batteries and and also not for Phoenix kids to I don't think we go this way friend I think we just go and fight people grab it I'm terrible with that this menace never seen me Craig Bros anyone no one's ever seen me Craig Bros anyone it's never happened before hurts on phy this way I believe kind of perhaps I do like diluting abilities here on on logo I know there's a few parts that I definitely could have used my my alternate oh okay assessee say we should do this should hear me fully you go give top is he safe there no he's not he's probably jump down then launch it okay you can't actually throw it that far upwards maybe a high ground just in case nice deploy those variables friend no idea where he is I had a bloodhound there not to get a no rate they're pretty short it's got a low rate on that guy could use my ulti I don't know when we're gonna loot again but the problem is okay there's one team left you know what what else am I gonna do you know we're not gonna go a loot our way through and that could be something good within the buildings - all right here we go knock down shields what else can I take steel battery that's good I'll take that and I'll take the ammo for one team I need to get used to my lower ability but I don't wanna practice it now because they could be here and there's a decent chance they're quite far away giving the come I mean look at this map it's beautiful on red now if they did this to work wards edge didn't they at the beginning of last season once you start getting destroyed they gave this beautiful red globe Nasus dawn but look you know what I mean it was blue before these I don't wanna get caught in the storm here this is not when we want to fight that's all then watch the champion team level 28 it's got the elite badge it's a low becausee combo well they've got a caustic who is immune to your caustic gas my friend and the low but can just teleport out if she needs to you know I don't I don't think you could tell put yourself up there definitely not from here come on teammate listen I need this we can do it I've got my ultimate back already it comes back that quick it's like a pathfinder grapple call they did you know what thinking about it the evil shield would have been way better because I'm not gonna use these door shield cells I have six shield batteries I reckon Evo shields are better it looks like I'm just talking to this guy and he's just sat there a lot of you he's taking some lessons or something but it looks it uninterested it's true we're already in the next ring I either absolute ready one of them juicy sort see the juices or think alright we just wait to say we won't be safe make 7/8 no reason to him change that we've been obstacle that's the only issue are facing I read in one of his traps wait we're the ones they're safe defend this area get your traps down I'm saving my time say my thing I'm gonna have to stand back a little bit I'm gonna stand back a little bit she's dead she's dead she's dead don't set that off upon do anything [Music] we won yes teammate you're a beast he got the last two kills this guy are made in one shot this guy was all you all of you my friend nice I tell you what though if he didn't get that guy out of teleport is right over that course he gasps aw look at this a beautiful beautiful first a season five victory it wasn't the greatest game I've ever played in my life a decent amount of damage though considering the circumstances there wasn't that many people where we sponding I tell you what first game nice friend I always environment so it's not even here I am ecstatic to win a game here on season 5 ecstatic testing out the new
