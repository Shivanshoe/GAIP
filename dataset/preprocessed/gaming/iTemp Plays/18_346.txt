hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and games like the one that i have for you today are the reason playing solo has been such a challenge recently now random teammates have always been hit and missed but with skill based as cranked as it is at the moment if you don't get a teammate who doesn't just die in a 1v1 instantly uh it's pretty tough to consistently 1v2 the rest of the lobby you may be able to do it once or twice but can you do it five times in a row to win the game that's where the struggle comes in now i've got no hate for the teammate that i had today because you can tell he was coming into the game with some heart aggression you can tell in the pings sometimes uh he had a two and a half thousand damage badge with a good amount of kills so he was no slouch he just had a bad game but when you see the end screen you will probably think the same thing i did so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends broken is the best place to go like i actually very rarely get contested or broken this is why atlantis so often it's actually got enough loot for two people because you can just duck down underneath um pretty sure people landed a market this way where's your shield gun you'll shield this in seattle oh perfect there we go cancel that on the heavy ammo friend i didn't hear any gunshots i don't know how this guy had no shield i mean i can hear gunshots and all sorts of stuff going on a streamer building the old four-story they sound like footsteps okay these guys just died i need scion this bad boy i can't actually see what i'm firing at there was definitely more people that they were fighting someone good news is they didn't actually get to loot there they're kills oncoming teammate oh that sucks someone's this way too i need to get out of here pinch between two teams i feel like they're fighting on the bridge i think my mistake there like because i arm switched i mean i needed to army twitch too but uh he had nothing to switch into to heal quick i'm not sure if he had a medkit or not i've got to make it for him now i mean it's pretty obviously he doesn't have one here you go friend free of charge humongous scrap a train i didn't get to finish loonies did i hey there we go i got it two times all right uh timing might be healing for a little bit i guess i've just got to go in but i've got to be careful about it and when you're playing pathfinder being careful about it means running into the fight but just not using your grapple i think this fight's over unfortunately oh my god i think i'll just matrix that sniper shot i'm pretty sure the new kill leader he's the person in train and he's a 21 bangalore guy's far away he's got his 20-time sight on there and chris kyle it's the ultimate duo hey still in the exact same spot uh well this is slightly annoying because i can't challenge from where i want to challenge because i'm going to get sniped in the side of the head yet they are still looking at us i don't know when you guys got here got any break recharging shield i think he was pinging for me to help him got head of red i think well like i didn't know if someone was here because i don't know who down the bangalore like i didn't realize that we damned one of them maybe they got sniped in the side of the hedge because that's what kept happening to us so i thought someone was nearby and then the teammates pings came in i've got a mobile respawn beacon though so it's okay but if he wasn't pinging as much i would have been able to hear that why am i going down the road does anyone know i mean it's not a problem because getting an instant response here but i do think someone else was around i think i think the bangalore or maybe it was the pathfinder because i got the pathfinder one shot so it would have made more sense it was him i think he must have got sniped in the head after i hit him flight 150 or something maybe if you want spitfire i honestly i don't mind that i'm using a speedfly here because a lot of people are in joe's i'm playing solo and i haven't used the spitfire in a long long time i'll crack both of them i don't mind taking these extended trades because i've got four bats four bats in red these guys healed teammates with me too i think he must have just hooved up his own box i don't know if he's got an angle on this guy in the car oh i'm bad i'm so bad giving my shields a recharge well they found each other which is good oh four heavy bullets for me nice that's a kill this be fire recharging shields big respawn behind us maybe he's going to draw people like out of these buildings because there's two teams here i think he's in the building good job me whole squad down here the guys are coming we can bring them back oh my god my accuracy is appalling sometimes recharging shield he gives us the gunfire i thought someone was here okay someone was here and imagine sometimes the gunfire sounds like peter patter and when you're one shot lunar box any sort of noise you sort of terrifying my aim honestly during that bosto i was actually landing good shots and then i backed up onto the stairs and he ducked under my accuracy like under my aim so i couldn't see where he went is this even worth pushing i don't have any i have one gun and i've not been known for my r99 one clip so i think i'll just respawn here i need heavy ammo and he's left i'm gonna loot this anyway i don't fancy fighting with one weapon aldi really going to challenge that with the pk okay i think the lifeline is a little bit lost and they're downstairs out they're trapped i respect it though a little bit confused i could have killed him quicker that that pk was scary i mean he's using a sentinel and a piece keeper i respect the setup i mean you've got to respect anyone that uses the sentinel hey the logo looks lost as well everyone looks lost over here not even haley trying to push the building when there's a core stick to seem surrendered and if she crawls around the corner oh you came outside for me thank you i thought he's going to retreat up top oh i've got to take the arthur on this fifa has been so good to me probably because it's an incredibly good gun but i've got to drop it because no one is using any of any heavy bullets no one's using a flat line no even a spitfire for some reason usually they're everywhere i have point three thousand kills my like i could have like the lobe acoustic was fine but the [ __ ] fights before that i definitely could have been a little bit cleaner but we're still breathing i guess that's the most important part i wasn't gonna push that anyway i've got a two times on my r9 uh i'm not that interested in pushing the valk i don't know if they're solo or if they have a team and it would appear like they've made my decision for me because they are retreating okay the race is going to get voice lines if i keep aiming her she probably already has i've got a crater are they not going to push this i mean i guess they wouldn't if they have a crater one of them might them yeah they might leave this valve behind where's the wraith just a minute until the ring closes at least i don't have to wait for it all right they're still here i may have heard that they did i don't want to mess with the crater that's a problem closed it's near good thing i can move the fire giving my shields a recharge let's go with the bone arrow one of them's down at least the crave is gone unless they've managed to loot the first guy which they've already have let's be honest yeah you've got an angle on me as well why would you push me where's your team still aiming at me yeah i mean that is ludicrous was my damage 3.8 my teammate literally didn't land a shot are you kidding me he didn't do a point of damage i think they've just won now as well
