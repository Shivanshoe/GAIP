have you guys it's reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more Apex Legends of course and today we are taking it all the way back I'm running solo I'm playing Pathfinder I've realized that I often try and make videos about different Legends and I always talk about Pathfinder he's my main I compare them to him and then I realized even since I've been back from holiday I haven't played in once and he's so good when you're playing solo he's just got it all I love playing him I hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends I hope the guys up top aren't too annoying but we will see that probably gonna be very annoying all right nice they're looking the other way it's like no audio there's no audio please oh I do I'll take this I got any bullets that's not good how do I have two cells and I'll pick any up okay I don't really have any bullets stay alive please please please please I'm coming no you see me diamond hello okay well that was interesting oh Phoenix but this guy's probably gonna harm this which anyway sometimes I'll keep it so he's only got white it's fresh not too bad any heavy oh heavy I got bats though I shouldn't take three bats at the start share them out a little bit threats are both really heavy so I was gonna say how dead this guy hadn't he look at that I'm gonna let's get our ammo I've sent it to get a Batman all right well we survived there's a chance someone is going to come over from that way potentially maybe not though people have been here and I heard the gravity Cannon once or twice but are they actually still here I think the answer is no darn it I had a little bit too late okay oh I should have crafted it three times I mean there's things here though I'm bothered I come back hostile spotted as he's still alive oh God help another team it's really not good how the heck did this happen back there's a respawn just above don't leave don't leave him to fight oh big name here thank you she's phasing him but she went up top enemy taken down there is a rifle nice wait that was only an assist where's my kill engaging don't tell me they pulled down there and then revived oh my God I respect it I respect it a lot but it didn't work where's my other guy and they're just this way I'm gonna risk you who cares yes I care because I got no heavy hammer thank you how did you know thanks my teammate didn't leave which is fantastic news I don't know if I want is Havoc anymore to be honest might take the PK even though I had a gold mag unfortunately I don't know why that well I do like that that's not the issue the issue was oh they're coming up top oh God guys over there foreign I'm gonna pretend to okay foreign I was gonna pretend to come back and then grapple up top and sit here that was the plan uh I think they saw me just go here wait where's my purple soccer ball hello who had it was this guy right I'm glad I noticed all right it's on my gun 100 it's on my gun if he falls off again wait there's 23 people left why are these lobbies today there's so many people left there's an outrageous strategy look at this bam got me all too back it's however I use when we could just sit here but that's boring there are 20 people left let's go find someone foreign two minutes until the Zone comes and the Zone closes again anyone even been here I didn't even open all the bins so respawn that way huge uh they're respawning down here Southwest I guess it was I don't even know what reason is it must have been Cascade but is there even one here there's one up top but it was like down there so it might have been oh it was checkpoint okay hopefully they don't have a Valk because we are running into the zone that might be a lifeline right here that's a Lifeline package I shot the back too frag out it's nowhere near so difficult this range they left I don't really know what's going on I'm trying to be a little bit careful I can when are they all here I mean this guy crafted a a wingman kind of scared he's died I suck I'm so bad am I failing that I mean so many shots that's sideways recall really messed me up it's just his teammate too it's like a lifeline and a someone I could have farmed all three of those people there I was scared to push I thought they were all in the same Rock well I guess not after the zone you wanna be careful to Zone that come in I think they must have gone up top I'm more than happy to go this way he seems like a waste I can't believe I've got none of those kills too many missed shots they are coming this way we could have gone either way but I was scared that they were going to be gatekeeping us that's all over there oh you went the other way thank you jump but he's not ours foreign foreign [Music] easy Pete I'm the new kill leader only 10 seconds left cool we can bring them back Evie mobile uh okay we're good now I messed up with that Horizon obviously I was playing around the fact that I could get up top and then I should have realized a lot sooner than I did that the Horizon can also just get up top for free my mistake but it worked hey I sort of baited out her Horizon Cube because I had I had basically had to wait eight because I still have my grapple and her Horizon Q is gonna be a lot longer call then because I went nowhere with my grapple so then I could get back on the roof to bother that it sucked because that's an arm switch oh they're fighting no no she's bad I might just need to fight this to be honest I mean he's on the way someone just to do I have to out of top or something because he's reloaded no I didn't want to play that one I'm picked I got there just a little bit too late foreign I need to get around this before they do this big gun I mean that's still helpful I guess 10 seconds on grapple [Music] and respawn third I think the team with three all holding hands down there try it I mean they're just they're right next to each other damn it what is that you have to be all three of them up oh so close so close imagine if that last care package is a good like if that's evolved I kill that guy so much quicker and I can grapple away ah did you want play to the teammates though unfortunate that was fun though I enjoyed it 3 000 damage pretty good
