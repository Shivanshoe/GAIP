hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some solo apex well i had a teammate until the first gun fight after which he left the game and this game was after a few games of me playing no filled duo so i'm still counting it as playing completely solo to be honest with you because of the struggle that i went through before this game as well now i was playing fuse for some reason who isn't the greatest legend to be playing solo usually you want some escape tools to keep yourself safe so i had to play a little bit more defensive in parts but this was a great game with a ton of damage and i'm sure you guys will enjoy it so thank you for watching i really do appreciate it as always and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my this is your friends oh okay then oh at least i got a teammate this time straight down can do amigo all right this is what i need when i'm playing for you someone to else some of the bullets because i've got no escape all i can do is fight fire me knuckle cluster mate i just need to dissolve fuse it just fire me i can't do it but you know what i'm trying to say that's my only capability and it does help if they're if they're chasing you i guess but i mean it's not as good as an octane jump pad or a or a pathfinder grapple of the century you know so i assume you're okay are they looking at you funny they're looking at you funny let me give them a gift hold on another perfect gift for these guys he's taking this together champion's gone they probably see the knuckle cluster and want nothing to do with this let's be honest but if they do carry on pushing this way we'll be able to hear him we'll be ready we'll be fully looted as well i mean our army situation is sort of diabolical the guys across the way kicking off it would appear as the uh the team oh my word the gondolas are too fast um tonight do you want to get involved in this crap when it sounds so concluded there we go me never mind oh french i almost did yeah are you gonna chase me 20 health teammate quit did he even get bursted wasn't a hard bastard i didn't mean to hop all the way down that's kind of terrifying what a combo oh the camera wasn't good enough well well well looks like i'm inside the ring i'm gonna be honest i'm probably dead this game it's happening again uh i need some of those heavy it's happening again i'm solo and i'm a fuse and it's a real real sad day for everyone involved and everyone involved that is me i'm the only one involved oh oh what's happening we good we're good someone's here two people minimum i was literally about to stop whispering as if they could hear me so i do need to be somewhat stealthy maybe catch one of them trying to loot or something i don't know okay my stealth mission has failed these guys have the ears of a flamingo nothing and no one can sneak up in these guys are you rushing me why are they both shielding i don't even hear anyone i'm bored enemy killed okay i've taken his head off man's got no head he turned around okay i'll be honest i i thought you were going to sit behind the door for a little bit and was going to have like a a bit of a door off you know oh no guys an absolute psychopath um but i guess in that gunfight it sort of shows the problem because those guys weren't experienced players let's say but if they were holding hands i'm pretty sure they'd have killed me and it might have even been easy for them it's just the way apex goes if you hold hands you can't lose get all the way to ibex predator just run around together get the job done be trapped in that now we can just phase out of it that might be the worst knuckle cluster of all time and i can't really push that that sucks i had the wraith stuck in my ultimate she can just use her ability to care of me okay i'm the worst i'm i'm going to get fur pied here i can't i've got my red armor honestly i think i take that as a as a big w i need to go and refresh on some nades i left a load of grenades back here if they want to push me i'll have a load more nades to fire them i've got my red armor but when when they're at the same angle like that i can't peak and isolate one of them to trade you know i'm always gonna lose the trade if there's two of them firing at one of me it's so difficult i'm so close i don't know if people play solo i honestly don't doesn't sound like these guys are pushing either to be fair i i did i did do a lot of damage compared to them i did a load of damage they were all hurting but she's closing in 45 this will be a laugh and a half and they still sort of need to come this way no don't think they're interested here we go i finally found someone to fight this is what i need to do i'm the only solo player in this lobby everyone else has a friend all i need to do is third party people big ultimate rush me now see what happens 10 damage that's what happens you've been you've been fused mate how's that feel that's all i thought yeah you're back to pulled away didn't you support friend that's the problem what happened to the fight you guys were in weren't you weren't you shooting someone else i think it's not going to work i was trying to do a voice line he's definitely weaker than i am but he's got a friend with full health and there's a big scrap over there i'd rather get involved in hello everyone i'm here for the big scrap saw advertise on facebook big scrap i am literally the worst why are we all fighting down low i mean what's going on here i'm trying to say i'm on fire oh my word it hit him oh my god now i didn't mean to drop i didn't mean to drop [Music] they're above me give me a ride with i mean not only did i drop onto a um revenant silence i dropped onto my own knuckle cluster and probably did more damage to myself than i did to any of my enemies can you please stop i'm just here trying to loot for a sight i don't know what my two times my flat line didn't transfer to this big fire i feel like it should automatically but i don't have a sorry for the spitfire that's what i'm trying to find you didn't have to die we could have been we could have been best friends you know i wasn't looking for a fight you didn't have a single sight either all right never mind we couldn't have been friends 45 here we go tremendous lift all right one team left hopefully it's one guy it's probably not it's probably a joe that played very safe and didn't want a third party the massive scrap that was advertised on facebook and they're gonna hold hands and i'm gonna down one of them but the second one's gonna have too much health and he's gonna kill me that's exactly what's gonna happen here okay this guy's got the mental advantage now he knows he's bamboozled me 57. you're not bamboozling me again it's not happening i've got this blue armor to play around if i stay back here as well which is good yeah i know that's not you i'm not an idiot you know what i'm gonna keep dancing with you your little dance partner no i wasn't trying to emo so i was trying to do a voice line when the good news here is that he's not safe up there so as soon as this ring closes in 30 seconds he's gonna have to hop down and then i have the height advantage and i've got this blue armor switch and i've got a care package weapon and it would appear as though it's only one guy but there's a chance this was the masters player like the champion masters player oh it's not on high ground anymore let's ask his friend no because the guy tops not peeking he's just one guy he's actually been me it's got my ultimate now just which is real good i'll turn damage that's huge let me push off that okay that was way easier i should have just done that to begin with what were you saying sorry did you say did you say something i didn't hit what sorry apex champions what are you saying teammate huh i actually won i actu i don't care that's a no-feel victory that i was going for that's the no-filled win i mean teammate died in the first gunfight 90 damage and i think he instantly left there's no there's no shame in doing 90 damage and dying happens to me all the time shame comes when you leave right after which i've also done all the time i mean listen it's an eight kill win it's not much but it's 2700 damage which is quite a lot and i wouldn't by myself so i'm happy with that alfie uzi i did about 12 damage total with his ultimate too i'm the worst fuse in the world
