hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we had the same octane guy on our team who was just a maniac he was stimming to like 10 health he was jump padding into every fight he was trying to steal all the loot he was berating his teammates for having less damage than he did and i just want to know why is every octane player like this i don't know it's kind of crazy but i have two good games for you still today thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah let's go go i like the animations though like they do to climb in let's start oh oh device i just launched revenue oh my god 10 feet i was actually good barely i suck oh my god i feel so bad let's practice one shot pretty sure i took all those kills i'll go on but i suck anyway i should have killed the guy beforehand i'll land her on the side and do 30 damage when i do clean shot on him i don't know what i'm going to want to do i feel that that's a wingman now you're using a wingman no he's spraying with the vault it's a weird it's a weird angle i haven't gone next any mag uh i'm lagging and [Music] uh it's a little bit too hot in my room very hard and also i've just been a bit sad recently the ring is nearby uh just reasons that's not good yeah so you affected my shot you know level four don't be sad full health on purple somebody down here they're everywhere rich there's a gold one in that box to your left i've been carrying about 3 000 heavy bullets for a wingman so i'm definitely going to get a comment about that would you like uh would you like some more no heavy ammo here yes uh valkyrie got away and she's going to res um someone i think the octane that you killed 45 here that's them bean rest where is that i believe where we landed probably isn't smart they're not even in danger here [Music] are they like actually trying to box oh let's go [Music] he's just getting triple stacks okay oh we are the worst type of people nope actually just the worst type of people absolutely not consuming oh thank you for that no i can't get there hello patsky oh my god there's another okay you actually didn't turn around to to check if there was one on the other side and then shoot it okay well why did you do that when i'm already passed it just proves my point we're the worst type of people to ever exist but i'm already passed so i don't care like i don't understand exactly the worst type of person to ever exist i still don't understand i only care about number one me some sounds like that pretty sure that's me i had to quickly say who the number one once before you said it pretty sure i know it was coming i knew it was coming someone just fell off the map yeah when i see that on like world's edge or or keynes canyon then i'm like okay you're kind of dumb yeah with this map especially over here totally acceptable totally acceptable when the death said that like people kept falling off the map in the place yes i was thinking who have they got play testing this and then i played i remember that i jumped off the edge after you as well i know i think i went like a solid like week or two without jumping off the edge and then there was just like a period like a month where i just jumped off like every single day that's all i do i actually almost just jumped off not even allowance 670 in this point come on we mental i'm oh my god oh my god oh my god 22 cells if you see some please let me know apple teammate that is honestly just the greatest possible situation like we're talking about how how easy it is to join it's not like we're talking in game two we're literally talking to discord and then he just sends it and i'd like mate we need a replay feature i would i'd love to make a slimmer montage just as we and we're like it's so easy to fall off and then as he's funny he's like oh much better who can say where the road goes and he's falling down you can zoom in on revlon's face i've got it whole i've got it all planned out you got it all planned out oh yeah yeah that's that's a finger and at the end it comes up directed by quentin tarantino uh oh look at that you see that yeah yeah i'm doing a lot of stuff with the sentinel but as you know end screen's gonna come up and it's not gonna look like that so don't you go on about saying that you're out damaging me because it's not acceptable you've i will not say that you've got more damage than me how much damage you have yeah this is going to be interesting no i i literally have 1796 like oh what's what i have 1795 i'm not lying are you serious i'm serious can we just like finish a game like this no if if you ever get one more if i get one more damage than you i am like hard flaming you i know you are i don't mean like just one more oh my god oh my god oh my god we need we need the rebels why did you why did you fire [Music] there's damage me there that's not going to make even a remote difference we have to land this we can't you said you sent into the middle of all three no i thought they were going to look over the edge i was trying to get behind the bin i was trying to get behind the binge positioning is all time worse top ten anything no you tilted me i love your damage you suck you are actually the worst ever exist let me just put into the next game just like that alright games game game game can i climb oh thank you what's up but they are a demon i need to get back in that one yes purple switch view he did uh i can't say i literally can't me you and the and the enemy were in line perfect line the whole time what do you mean enemies and beasts this is down no it's a teammate beast he was like shielding us when i raised you oh i was like well i was like what is he doing he's down no but like i appreciate it i appreciate that too there's the arrows everywhere i know there's one in my i think there's one in each of our bodies yeah i got one bullet in my uh rampage that looks crazy all the seal holds up there that looks insane this is risky are you going up top i can meet you there again the arm switched recharging shields as well if you need some extra 300 oh those are reds i think out of solar i think i'll kind of gather that kind of oh yeah oh no it is that's huge that's actually such a big tomorrow what's happening he's firing i think he's thirsty found my first light uh heavy mag level one by the way kind of a struggle today so if he's throwing someone there's there's somebody still alive i think he had a voiceline saying he was the last one but he doesn't have a gold knockdown so yeah wait oh this round part is still a little oh my god i'm already trying how does this rampart survive out of everyone wasn't she at the top hello oh i thought he was president sorry i can't believe i'm standing still i don't know i like you what's up that's why the other ultimate looks anyway yup there's nothing good about being stationary in a game that's based off insane movement signaling on your head mate there's a few of them trying to get here with you oh that's obvious oh no what are you doing i'm once oh my god i hit him once wait did you miss all your shots apart from the last one i knew which one was him too i was just missing you know the vibes you know last life yeah that was the thing that knows

like i'm actually the quickest oh i did it oh i went flying man i went flying i told you it's literally time it's timing it doesn't even matter like how fast you press it it's just the timing of it boomer discovers fire that's what the start of the video is called that's basically what this is not twice has been in the game for like a century here okay look at come here come here nope i did it way too quick i literally pressed it four times and i did a little jiggle i literally put that there for you to practice on you do one you there's a scratch okay just use your ultimate to get here okay go double jump on it who's flying over here oh she just makes you just flying she's just flying off the map come back please okay i'm not chasing you i'm going to the fight over this way i'm not chasing the valve she's just going to pop her all fly off into sunset without me involved you know cause if i'm here too super don't worry i will they're just this is an awkward fight we're gonna get
