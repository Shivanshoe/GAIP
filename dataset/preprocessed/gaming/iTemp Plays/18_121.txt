hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have been trying since the season began here to find the vault in the care package and every time i pick it up i have a great time for the 32 seconds left in that particular match for some reason i cannot find this gun before about 12 minutes and every game this season lasts about 12 minutes they increase the damage of the vault and they also increase the magazine size when they put it in the care package so it's an absolute demon of a weapon but it's just so sad because it's one of my favorite weapons and i can't use anymore i have two great games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you so much for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends it's dark enough for yes indeed on me why you guys both got blue man how lucky are you trying to run if you guys turn me down oh mate that came down they're reviving him again this guy in my head i literally right next to each other and they're not shooting each other they're right next to each other picked up our friends banner we can bring them back who else i seek this here i go obviously do you take anything from me block so you should be good i had nothing to because did you not i'm out of 99. what the heck is going on firing reloading headshot two people over here giving my shields a recharge hope i played squad wiped jesus using my phoenix yeah it's a little much good grief 160 valve okay this is so ridiculous i'm just aging at an exponential rate because of because of apex it could be older than me soon or yeah dude well i don't know why i'm on this what am i doing i'm going to crash i was supposed to get a long bird but that was a lot that's long gone what are you crafting with purple oh yeah this is something just your main yes that's a bubble bag like yep yes yes maybe maybe both i suppose it's fine this way target spotted oh i should have said my car hasn't got one so yeah same here i only have one mag on my 99 it's a white one i don't have one on my eva oh and it's that time for the voice did you hear shots this way too was it just me oh i think i did maybe maybe not it looks unluted to me damaged do not do the same it's a i heard more footsteps by the way yeah yeah come on mistake come on get it together moving on i've gone marvin on uh you get it together mate can't i don't have a cross there not possible can't get together what you don't have tree that's right a little bit of uh life advice for you i didn't slide onto the pad so i just went vertical look at how athletic i am it's it's unreal look at look at this on a question that's why you're so far back it's because you've stopped it cringing let's finish so much i have to look away from my screen that's cringe it's not being athletic i'm playing for my life my i mean maybe at one point punts ratios so just unbelievable i played at the rose bowl already ron again i'm getting the rose the rose able yes probably that's probably a better name to be honest than the rose bowl i think so the rose a bowl everybody has a rose yeah no dude it's for like middle-aged white women is the damn girl landed on me i'll grab all the way terrified i don't know what i thought she was going to do bite my ankles i guess that's uh that's something you gotta worry about oh it's in behind you being behind you okay yeah uh that may or may not be the duo of the that gold havoc kind of scary kind of crazy where's the phoenix get in here ah marvin arm here he's holding on to that for a rainy day just just to see what's happening i don't know i don't know yeah just never know i want to go to marvin say need a hand and then give him the thing but i can't find him so i don't know where this is the guy went did he get a revive beneath us like who knows yeah i don't think i got the kill on though yeah yeah look at this guy he's probably that nuclear guy again absolutely standing in the open i'm moving uh i don't want to take that giving my shields a recharge i want you some help they they're going to take the ash shorts so i have to sit on this nice i'll take it rambling close close i went for that i went for the sliding carpet okay sleeping a load of the rose a bowl tipsy last thing last time oh funny get up the volts kind of stupid stop it there's down there yes i got 50 of that let's go nice he popped off i kind of had a decent game there come on triple wings i don't know if i landed these ones now you stop my gun i love it though wow looks like that was the last one in the squat feeling watch my back oh god what am i doing here you go teammate phoenix get here repairing all phoenix action i could drop a phoenix kid he's got a phoenix kid he's got little hills syringe here best thing yeah they're both pretty similar one section pop that pop up there you go what a mess of a start i thought i got the gun let's take that to be honest all right let's try and third someone i grappled on the blue towns i was spamming triangle like where the heck is my gun med kit here didn't exist didn't have one all right we've got big [ __ ] ignite r301 here keep eyes on the new kill leader frag out spot it double time can we get over there is it a possibility i want to use the wingman but i'm going to avoid it today because i've used a load recently oh look at that medkit here can we get over there who's ready to fly on a zipline i am performing there's no way they didn't see that though contact like it's 100 percent broken just chase is gone level three that far away is there's no way [Music] solid copy oh that did not go as far as i wanted to yeah that purple was broken as expected 45 seconds and rings far fire up the afterburners right here solid copy they're in there all right guys definitely shielded by now fire we can definitely just like dive on these guys do you have a source no you don't that makes me very sad please someone i need optics i have foreign many heavy bullets not enough sights i'll hear him i've got a popping off tim is pretty far but he should have i mean i guess he used it ultimate easy quite a lot of those have been here heard that i need optics for an assault rifle tango spotted no gun up give me a sec recharging shield i don't know i don't want to grapple links while i'll be away from my teammates until one haven't escaped all i've dropped my nade enemy over there let's go recharging shields they're not a team inside like that's what's scaring me here doesn't sound like it actually it's taking so long to get over i think we can't do anything about it three hours into this game well the fuse team team is here which sucks because i had these guys on the ropes just like these use a phoenix guys hold on using my phoenix kit we there's a chance i'll get away with this ammo oh my god give me a sign for this please for the lord of god give me a sign for this hemlock thank you giving my shields a recharge yeah we got banners nice job teammate i have two bats there's one of those there that was ridiculous i think it did really what stay alive i'm gonna go on this just to see if i can get a battle too two bats drop the gold mag all right well that was a an interesting fight teammate did exceptionally well today live there oh my god that probably is one of the most athletic animals i've ever seen and i've i forgot i had a mobile respawn beacon but this one is right on a care package which lets us use this it makes sense he's right on my king hmm yeah i think this makes sense there's like a lot more loot here and it's away from those two teams fighting i mean i could have used my mobile respawn but i can use this one and then save my next one for when there isn't one available does that make sense get my contraction i'm really hoping this is evolved this yet i'm excited they're still scrapping up this way and you're the gun i don't let bangor take it craig spitfire scouts but i haven't had a chance to use this so i have to over here the heck is happening is this everything reloading this is everything one minute i think it is because there's a team up top as i have john messed up the evidence points towards yes let's be honest this is a terrible angle to go from four seconds on the zone so he could just sit safe bubbles about to go oh my god let me back up let me back up i hate things that stun you on this game it's the last guy pretty sure we got him track him in the corner trap him in the corner yes nice the two fights that we had the two big fights were ludicrous gg well played i tell you what i know this is a bit of a rant and this is why i died so it's easy to say after you die from it but i think anything that slows your aim down like that and makes it like i hate stun grenades on any game so arc stars valkyrie stunt i hate that stuff at least give me a chance just just have it do some more damage or something but don't stun me that was a good win though finally got to use the vault ggs
