this video is sponsored by ea so here it is my friends my best game of the new arena mode coming to apex legend soon also happened to be my first ever game i got four and a half thousand damage it was a back and forth between us and the enemy team uh i haven't really done too much editing to the video because that way you can see how the buy phase works i did misunderstand how it would work to begin with but if you keep watching you'll learn along with me i thought i kept my items my guns my healer balls from the previous round but this isn't the case i'm sure you guys know now from the trailer that came out recently but there is an increasing allowance you get each round and you can collect the materials in game you'll get the extra materials for kills on the previous rounds and you can also save materials from previous rounds into the next ones as well in this game i was playing with ragtag but we didn't cube together we weren't allowed to ragtag told me his in-game name at the start of the day so we'd know if he'd run into each other in any of the recording session and it turned out we found each other pretty quick in the first game of the day in fact rag's channel will be in the description of course i'm gonna let you guys enjoy this game it was a really fun one thank you once more to ea for sponsoring today's video i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends rag what seriously yeah no way i have pushed a talk on so i can't talk that much i'll change in a second have you only got a mozam i've got an r99 okay i have a vault taking a moment relying yes can you still hear me i can i can oh my goodness so we get the the ball check compound ball as an air drop round two do not falter marking our surroundings got a bandit close by um reloading i could try [Music] all right i have open mic now so i can talk awesome i can't go and buy again because i oh it's square hold on wait my vault's gone i lost it oh i didn't realize that's how it worked i got a i got a g7 and a p2020 i need to find some boxes i need that box we need some high ground here on the left i think we'll have a look yeah they're close i want to go to p20 i've only got a p20 in this g7 i'm so nerdy hospital no she has a gold bag and she's reviving everyone no i didn't realize i was going to lose my gun we can bait these guys easy either i have a flatline this time yeah i've just maxed out the rna name i flatline mastiff and i have three scans right there on match point extended supply being here here sorry i took two bats dropped one in here are you scanning this way that on me do we get the right well played i think the lifeline loses their goal back now all right we got this what so do i keep my flat line or do i just have to no i just have to keep buying it okay i get it yeah yeah i haven't got a scan this time but to be honest i make a lot of noise so i'm going to go for the supply bin again it's got two bats in there so i'll take one can you take you're there we need to take the lifeline out first because she's gonna keep buying this gold bag and it's like we're fighting five people i agree oh did i say left i think i said left the other left exactly dibs might be something good this way we need to draw them into us where are the two people exactly if we get this we get more materials for the next round when we beat these guys this round [Applause] package they're going that's my fault sorry mate i didn't realize that one day could see bless me all right i have g7 volt i've got something more disgusting i think we need to go mirage you know like this high ground here works well for us and they keep going this way is that another lifeline pack [Music] a charge rifle if you can because the lifeline before we do i think maybe we take this my ground right swan yes we got this i think i think wraith is their best player oh this is a tie breaker wait we can just buy whatever we want i'm pretty sure oh no not quite not quite charge rifle again and i'm not sorry yeah well yeah we'll just because that strap was good we'll just try and get the high ground again because that she might buy another little package for him they'll just stick at the back there's a crater in the care package by the that would be awesome if way can get it where does it drop like in the middle i think yeah it does right in the middle she's one she's really weak is yes what blade rag nice can we talk to them match point what do you mean i thought it was a tie breaker what you mean i wasn't sending the door gee i honestly the same tactic i think this is a good tactic they're already okay they're already up here yeah yeah well play drag oh my word you can do emotes you can just spam crouch then you can do an emos [Music] well fancy beating you here on the same team [Laughter] in one minute as well you know gj that's it
