hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends and i am playing the one and only fuse because he got a little buff in season nine he got the revlit treatment which means his tactic can now store two charges and the call then has been reduced as well he's still a weak legend however respawn are definitely playing this one right when you have a legend whose whole kit does damage they can be obnoxiously good really easily they said more help is coming and i would personally like this help to be more damage on the clusters and probably even his ultimate as well most legends can avoid his ulti and even if they do get hit by it it does less damage than accidentally triggering a caustic barrel i think damage is the answer here the thing is he's still a fun legend to play i love area denial abilities even though after watching these two games back it would appear that i am really bad at those abilities thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that's a spot it's one of them where you going oh right here blue light meg blue light mags some heavy bullets i don't have a gun either i was having a bow called the bosan okay i'm not a fan of that first blood game bloody on palace i'm down actually hello i have a phoenix never seen anyone is laggy i'm taking this oh nice well lucky guy i don't even know this is the same time i don't think so oh wait wait he did that before he was getting his teammate back he's cracked well i'm not gonna let him rest how long do i need to wait uh till he comes come here he's so fast he's got no health if he keeps using that ability yes no you stay gold ketchup oh actually won't let me loot this box i'm so mad you make it to me yeah i can make it if you need it here we go yeah i could use one i missed that yeah i kept thinking like i've seen two of them like is the guys look tough like recharging like a flat line i missed the prada i missed a heavy smg yeah i miss uh i miss it before it was broken too i don't like i i stopped liking it when they when they buffed it and it was just ridiculous then you just like oh another abuser there we go wait did i hear somebody here thank you sorry i thought no went on to be there that's kind of struggling really she had a goal back to no one she was going for that time yeah she's committed [Music] there was a lifeline shield you probably would have survived that i probably would have uh see box is like scattered over here but oh yeah over here okay [Applause] he's got a pk sorry friend that gun sucks for that level you're the new leader nice okay i was definitely throwing right there punching that guy up he was oh you were punching the first guy i really want to use my ultimate oh yeah i've used it once it's kind of weird to use sure when to use it i love dropping it when there's a big scraptor like in trios if there's like three teams yeah that's pretty good it's like a close range fight i mean i guess if we like uh if we break somebody's shield or something they're they're hiding behind cover um i'll send it out i could have used you just then really a lifeline pack oh here on my way oh i'm in a bad spot that was the last one in the squad one squad left let's go break their hearts a replicator on its way reloading oh i forgot stack up on nades i only have three nades fuse ah a week make the three weak or maybe four fuse bands out there are gonna be furious 77 oh he's pushing me oh my gosh the worst i've ever seen take slow i'm gonna die why did i just finish them i'm the worst fuse in the world everybody just goes up top team's landing low ground [Music] i need a bit of energy if you see um right here and uh purple purple mag right there no holy you can't speak sadness and like let me look at this band it says something live on twitch so ij live on twitch with two exclamation marks i'm not laughing at that live on twitch

like an hour and a half and the games are just amazing and ah this is wider because people will just sit on top of something for half an hour and like you have to find them and they don't care yep these guys are excited almost broke up but huh i don't know who you thought you were pushing sir also [Laughter] oh that's gotta be like the funniest little glitch ever dude the heck was that how did we both see she just went for the crazy clip on he saw that oh my god that's funny sending these guys i broke it when i broke it oh my god i just went so high that's crazy but that doesn't make any sense makes all the sense rich come on all right well two squads the good thing in a boxing match is that i'd have the height and the rage advantage yeah that massive one inch is just a huge i can't confuse that i can't compete with that huh i'm a checkpoint we're gonna post a few video and people were just gonna be so mad they're not picking up 45 minutes oh i'm actually dead [Music] it's got a triple take too oh he's got his old no wonder i just honestly i did some basic damage oh i'm scanned obviously yeah he's in all too oh yeah i'm not bad i have no bats and i've got two bat and cells cells what is happening not nice separate team yeah that's another thing nice not happening to us in hard focus oh wait the triple sec is too good man i'm sorry i'm pretty shy that's my fault tragic i thought we had a thing going no i just quick scoped him three times in his face i thought there's no way the triple triple taker will kill this don't worry three shots from my care package weapon are gonna kill him as he's standing still cause he's just standing still in the open
