doing they're collecting loot we have to get out of here mate it might not even be worth firing unless they're fighting each other they find each other no no no they're they're two of them up there super winnable dude the bang was flash okay dude i keep scuffing these jumps i have to jump off be careful outside the ring down to one nice angle there i'm dropping down i'm dropping it yeah i'm going down they are up top top yeah yeah she just hopped out on the left i don't think the bang healed bro so the bang's gonna be either no shield or weak flesh one or the other so two of them are back here they're crossing now you have a calf kevlar you gonna go down oh my god i didn't realize dude i wasn't watching how hard it was ticking are they still any sight only one is one took the rope he knocked one of them oh my god i think they're gonna die they're gonna die dude i can at least be a distraction for you this team wasn't involved so like when they're not going to be a very confident team there's still three squads left so this guy must be like solo somewhere i swear it's probably the bangalore the bangalore got out right oh she took the rope like one more that way do
