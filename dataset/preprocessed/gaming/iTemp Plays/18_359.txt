hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in the background you can see that apex was actually hacked yesterday as i'm sure you guys are well aware now the hacker or hackers i have no idea seem to have done this for a publicity student to bring awareness to how broken titanfall is in its current state apparently the two games are overrun with hackers making them unplayable so i guess they wanted to bring that problem to the more popular game apex legends to try and force the hand of the developers in solving this problem they had changed all the playlist names to save titanfall with a link to a website and a discord which i strongly recommend that you do not visit as you cannot be certain on the security of such things however we all know that the real way to save titanfall would be just to remove the titans because they are really annoying when i'm trying to shoot with the pilots and i do not like them and it's i listen i know that's a hot take but i'm willing to die on this hill seriously though many games these days are overrun with cheaters and the more games are adding in crossplay as a functionality the more this problem will spread to everyone whether you're on console or pc i played warzone the other day and i died to a hacker in two of the maybe four or five games that i played which is just completely unacceptable apex legends itself has a bad cheating problem but they're mainly boosting people up to predator and i assume charging for the service and i guess titanfall also apparently has a bad cheating problem now i don't want to use this publicity stunt to further push their message because what they're doing is illegal all hacking is bad but game companies seriously need to invest more into anti-cheat to avoid the hackers and games but to also avoid people like this hijacking their games and preventing normal people from planing how can games like league of legends not have any hackers in them i've seriously never seen a cheater on that game how is it possible when pretty much every single fps game apart from maybe fortnite is riddled with cheaters i would love to know the level of riot's investment when it comes to anti-cheat for league of legends for valerant for teamfight tactics and any other game that riot games make compared to other companies because clearly what they're doing is working there's a recent movement called save apex ranked on twitter which addressed apex's own issues of ddoses and cheaters in the game and i really wish this kickstarted more investment into fixing these problems because for the predator players that are often just streaming this game it looks unplayable it will be interesting to see the upshot of what's happened to apex legends here and what the game companies involved will say to the community anyway today i have a really fun game on the og kings canyon i hope you guys enjoy it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends let's check out this way scorpion it is me amigos and i am heading to where earth is the door all right i missed i could have done with the teammate punch there but it's okay we survived there are two teams here the alternative is ridiculous all right got you and then i got you do i want to spit fire probably not never leave your wing man you go i mean i could just switch out this p20 20. men get here someone say yeah over here i'm leaving this med kit i've already got one i know that you don't because you use syringes all right let's get our teammate back uh i'm pretty sure we cleared his death box but the loot situation was diabolical i mean we all saw that right a bit of a scrub neither side of school town but i don't want to over commit it's getting it's not actually that far away and if they see this reason won't come in there's a good chance they come over here i'll try and help the team out a little bit i can't just leave him hanging fortunately radar shows the rings yeah that's just the fight that we can hear there's the map champion three stacks we just need to delay until revenue gets here oh my word that's punchless entry i got a phoenix let me get my purple armor that was a like a pred that they had like a 4k badge or something my healable situation now is actually tremendous that's the only thing i'm looking for purple shotgun bolt as well it's just it is tremendous there's an r9 in here as well i'm leaving a med keep if anyone fancies it here the loot situation's looking good i don't have any shotgun i'm pretty sure there was something here there we go didn't miss anything else did i it's worth the check i've got enough light i have an appealables valkyrie's actually so funny school team this is the first time we've managed to play uh valve in school team and i i don't like playing mobile characters here it just sucks when you're trying to get away when you're trying to chase people not playing pathfinder and like valkyrie now is a really good option as well this makes it far more difficult oh there is a team here i was wondering if you were just i didn't see any evidence and my jet packs out of fuel how does that hit me sorry teammate i can't see i know i don't feel bad taking this red armor i think if anyone deserves red armor i mean you'd have to argue with me right surely i have 1300 damage here do i keep eve right r9 i mean whilst you're in school 10 it's a good idea but then once the fight moves towards like central and towards the late game let's get out of here friends you ready to go storms coming in once you get towards like the mid uh the mid game and like the the middle of the map as well r301 is just definitely superior there we go all right tremendous scorpion survived eight kills 1300 damage we killed the fred champion team three stackers and we leave to scrap another day i tell you what i'm actually having so much fun in these old maps seeing school town seeing bridges cascades there's the champion three there's three one of them at least wings up oh you can't yeah you can't do that with valve that's the one annoying part although i don't think i've ever used a wall jump uh for any sort of like functionality it's always just to show off or if i'm bored so like do you need this screws over here looking for luke are you is he good i assume he's good there was so much loot back there uh oh it's so weird as well one thing that i've noticed on these old maps is that like once you survive score 10 the rest of the game isn't too bad because everyone else that's alive didn't land school tense they're probably not that looted in terms of like armor oh there we go big scratch let's go you'll be done going to this fight without armor please recharging shields he knows he knows we're good where is that we can cruise everything like that area i think need a hop up and or receiver i need the anvil to complete my ranked setup i literally made a video the other day arthur i went there two times with a with an anvil like it's it's just a sick joke man now the gibby's are so far ahead but the tiniest branch you've ever set was a big branch but mostly it was underground stopping me in my tracks yeah yeah huge scrap i know replicator falling from the skies i've been fighting for about three years as well so i mean that's a good sign this week where even are they no tough people oh there we go i see him obviously the gunfire the bullets flying around that my friends is what you call a third party you rock a blaze i mean i wish we got here a little bit sooner could have got more kills but two kills isn't bad revenant used his uh ultimate he's devastated where's the but end i killed level two barrel stable are you telling me that i've been walking around on level one or not even a barrel stabilizer i don't know if that happened right well my hypothesis of like people at the end game not actually having the best oh there we go there's a clueless bogey out there these guys are trying third party us but those guys all have purple let's see if these guys do [Applause] but that seems to be harsh makes more sense for you to revive well he's not in the you got one of these too my hypothesis for the fourth time is that people in the end game haven't actually fought that much because if 45 people land at school team and there's 15 people stretch across the rest of the map they're not going to have too much of an opportunity to level up their their armors but everyone that i've shot since then i need some light i think everyone that i've shot since then has that purple so there we go there's a mobile respawn beacon here uh i don't need seven shield batteries i've got my ultimate here as well you guys looted are you you want to get the heck out of here i'll try my best not to throw the game drinks are not complimentary on this flight though you'll wish to god they were soon enough my passive hasn't picked anyone up so they weren't trying to run over the map to try and third parties and i don't want to leave my team too far away got a care package coming in yeah i'll pop the email why not oh it's a decent email beginning ring countdown so it's close the ring's actually kind of small now you can wait for the care pack it might actually bait the next team is this place even lucy oh cray there there we go how many how many are we talking it pink to the right so did they run to the right at least two mirage and a crypto fire there you go blue armor recharging shield please don't say one of my gold knocked down at least there's one more person for me to shoot the crater come on are you actually shooting anyone who just testing out the flatline oh he remembered my thing that's nice i already found one there oh friend okay well you have blue armor as well point proven you survive score town i'm not gonna call it an easy win but you've probably killed or the best players in the lobby have probably died if you're the one that survived school team that's just the way it is that was fun i'm surprised we actually said live when we got rushed by that champion squad because it was just me and the gibby and they could be had nothing uh we did pretty good 20 nearly 2 500 damage 13 kills i'll take it gg to you thank you old vic gg me meega
