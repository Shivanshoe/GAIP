hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex or legends of course and we are playing some lobo who i think is actually criminally underrated in public play not only is she actually getting chosen in competitive she actually really suits public play at the moment as well because everyone is just hopping out as soon as you are able to and and flying straight down and if you're not with those guys that hopping out straight away you're finding two people the entire games you've got it you've got to go there with them and what happens when 40 people land at two different pois you get no loot who's good at getting loot lower you can see the logic here so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that is cool that is the beauty of me i always think where i'm landing imagine kind of lame i've only gone either right so i'm going this way for a sec or you so uh yeah they did hold on am i all seeing seven percent this place is usually way more popping off than this i'm gonna go over there yeah there's eight in here just took four recharging my shield and i've got a bat i have two i three basically you gotta take me to the bottom i need to meet them i don't even have a backpack yet i took light from there let me know wait i just picked up that bat from the thing okay i blame you i'm all right dumb face right through it right i should have stopped if you've got the rope i'll use my [Music] i'm out again okay in front of me really cracked it's got a pad here what three teams just all shadows at the exact same time i got hit by three different freedoms too it's my last healer but i can't really pop my old scene don't mind if i do i actually might be able to crawl away because there's so many people fighting here all right thank you i have a bad thing it's my last thing now it was no no no we were just in line with them oh my god no target down we have to go this way important i'll put it away according towards the bridge reloading i set the portal patching myself yeah i think that they're pretty busted they're pretty broken oh my god they followed nick and his minions are they doing what you mean huh which means that what's that god doing nicknames oh no the dude are in the doom clown like uh cod cod guys yeah yeah there are they're here they're here at apex oh oh we see what you mean oh my god very good yep one of these up uh i think that's part two to the uh doom clan 45 seconds until the ring closed recharging my shields random team behind her like the race is still kind of close i think yeah she is right on me i'm okay she's like immediate mid i'm okay though i have to brush this team really i'm popping the phoenix so seems gonna come behind us yeah i'm not a big heels but i've got a i'll say that's our best this right he's still here like i don't understand oh the ravens right here oh it's got no angle 140 on the on the race okay for 140. no there's another right behind us with a sensor sorry right now yeah i'm just getting shot in the back while i'm fighting this target down reloading i still probably could have poked and like shot with you but i just prepped the back so i don't know i mean it worked out but this is the most adverse yeah i killed him the most adversity ever this is a true survival story so the team has to be just chilling on the big building care packages looted too so i think they're on the building i hope they've got they've probably got purple from the care package one of them has blue i reckon oh no but they didn't take the purple from that they don't need it i got red i know it was a phoenix kit and i was there oh my god oh she's so low i don't know who that is just go back where we going where are we going mate wherever i want i'll just do the weakest wall jump i'll just miss that one oh no oh god a bow and a centennial double p20 baby uh if you need another gun that's a rampage here there's an enemy you're able to delete certain weapons out of your loophole i agree excuse me we're already in the next ring good more time to lose nothing worse than having a white armor and getting a body shot by a wayne man it's just literally your entire shield is so exciting there yeah i missed my shot he's in here now there's someone here yep i might all say that mate can you stop oh my god this guy's having the worst day so he's cracked as well how are you almost there and the oxygen should be really weak recharging this octane and his teammates here i think army they just can't resist me can they 70 on the wraith up top she's gonna go towards you nice time she was outside drop down reloading she uh swapped them below me oh enemy shield broken last number's down 400 lie rounds i got a i kind of think that was a good decision enemy that way oh they're literally 42.78 what is that 84 150 162. but they've got a what's in jen pointy oh my god oh my god we just got played oh my god where'd she go where'd she go where'd she go okay i have 400 heavy i'm looking for a little bit more i have a six-pack now you need some do you have an hole nope i see i need i need sniper ammo hop up here hammer point shotgun ammo here now watch this though like look around the corner right now and then i'll go like this and then i'll go like this you're chasing me and i'm just like okay what do you think something bad would you think what do you think bad i thought it was gonna be a lot worse than that i wasn't too bad did you ratchet ah i've got the skills you're gonna just do something really dumb i'm gonna make you feel dumb for doing something dumb it wasn't bad um it's a entrepreneur although he's an astronaut oh well an entrepreneur does everything he does everything oh cause i've seen him like maybe he's just a handyman maybe i think i think yeah i think i've seen him as like a plumber i think he's a very very handy man too handy that's me a little little he's a little too happy ignite that let's go on the cd i'm out of here yeah yeah she levitated she's doing later 70 on that recharging shield was on the inside of the class but it was right oh i just kind of tinked it understandable boss i had more fire in this way west i think healing i have two shield cells that's what's up you got two cells generally use those because i usually have 28 so i'm trying not to take them like in my head i'm trying to train myself not to take them and look what happens i've got two okay i need to stop listening to people all the haters out there a lot of haters out there a lot too many haters i have a great time there's literally nothing i can do about it it's too late we're gone he's gone stop worrying about it using a sentinel is going as exactly how you would think it's it's an absolute tragedy's name it's just a diamond yeah damn what four hard stuck 700 rp can't climb i feel that i could have i wanted to i just don't want to ah you could i've gone to games and i'll tell my teammates like i don't want to climb this is stupid i don't like it i just throw and i'll just jump off the map so you do with me uh no effectively yes but no so yes you're saying yes mine that's going crazy is it going wacky right now it's locking until every mar i've got it because there's not that many people left so i got it targeted to marvin's toggle the marvins there's an actual like option for that yeah yeah i'm just locking onto you no bam oh that idiot look at you look at you just i all just out shraped out of your mind kept i don't know i can't speak man are you okay today no you're a mess today what's happening you have eye damage that has nothing to do with this conversation why are you changing the subject true but stop this gun sucks it's funny too because people get so mad when i say it sucks but it's like i love this gun yeah it's fun but it's bad it's probably my favorite gun to use in the game but it's not good it's just pretty bad all right you have enemy over there don't let them see you this is okay okay you're having a good game right all right make it worth it because it's not good for me big seventy on her hundred hundred reloading what did he get oh we didn't even get the gun no he didn't it's pretty far it we're good oh do you mind this one close he's gonna climb with me look at the wall good guy instead of just armor switching so i could have been involved but i've been an idiot hey nice very nice thank you
