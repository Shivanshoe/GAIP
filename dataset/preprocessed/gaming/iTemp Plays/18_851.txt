hey what's a gauzy to reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex and legends of course and we are going to be talking about the season 4 reveal that was on the apex legends official YouTube channel less than an hour ago so in the background I show I'm going to cook together some ranked gameplay footage I mean done one now we're going to apex predator solo never teaming with someone once and I am currently less than 500 our PA from heating effects processor I have 11 days left of this prank season so I'm definitely sure I'll be able to get there but it's been a bit of a rough ride ok everything up the diamond that was pretty easy but then diamonds my god the amount of people that I had the amount of teammates that just went down and - brought it out to save their RP was unbelievable I'm pretty sure most the team I started getting diamond rank at the moment shouldn't really be there you know they're trying to boost up for the rewards they're using the the no RP exploits when you don't lose any RP and it's been a beat it wasn't that fun so that's why I didn't upload it that much but upping silently playing a game here and there so I'll put together some of that for you in the background so the season 4 reveal stream was shown today on ethnics legends youtube channel so season 4 brings on the 3rd of february so in 11 days in this video going live it sees the release of a new legend from day one called forge a new weapon called The Sentinel a sniper rifle and also the return of Kings Canyon but there may be a bit of a twist with Kings Canyon first things first let's talk about the new a legend coming into the game there's a lot of speculation actually that is going to be one called revenant we saw hints about him stretching back months he was the announcer in the Halloween events actually like the zombie mode and a lot of food Brookside for him to finally get released into the game he was described as being a very aggressive like an assassin type character there are still a good chance that he'll be released in season 4 as well given the hints towards his release date in the last few months and also he has an in-game quip it's related to Valentine's Day which is of course mid-february so all the information I will talk about here is as always going to be coming from a data miner and content creator called that's one mining guy if you want to know details like these early definitely follow him on Twitter and YouTube those links will be in the description so the first thing you may notice about Forge is that he is an absolute unit the lack of a better phrase here's what looks like a giant or a robotic arm and his abilities I speculated to be based around this as you would probably expect I'm gonna quickly run through the names of his abilities that were dates might fortunately they have a brief description attach them as well so you can sort of get an idea of what they do and you just have a fair few ability so the first one is called a pulse shot the description reads a short-range grapple that pulls enemies into you and can also be used to launch yourself into the air the second one is called ground slam crouch while airborne to slump into the ground below ko punch which is jump forward into a direction press Crouch to slam into the ground below and then one two which is a bull rush in a straight line and if you heat an enemy along the way press it again and you'll upper cook them launching them into the air so as to passives or release things that I would assume to be passives one is called on the ropes that means that he's melee does more damage that lower health Forge is and also dealing melee damage it gives you a temporary over shield as well and in victory rush so Kinning a plague with a melee attack restores your health and gives you a 30% speed boost for 10 seconds that's so long that is so spending octane speed boost in my opinion so my first impressions reading these abilities from Forge is that he would be the absolute worst Legend to go up against at the start of the game when you're fighting an enemy for one gun you know and you just happen to land in the exact same spot as an enemy if it's Forge you may as well turn around and run away and then get the good because you will not beat this man in a fistfight even if you hit him and make him a little bit weak all you're doing is making his melee attacks more powerful and then when he kills you he'll get all his health back and then he'll get a speed boost for 10 seconds so it can run over to your teammates and punch them in the face as well it just sounds horrendous to play against early game stay away from this man for the first minute at least I assume the one to ability will be the ultimate that's the bulrush with the uppercut has the most powerful ability he has it's like a - it's like a split ability as well again these are just dates mine they can always change things have changed in the past but we will get a plane in less than two weeks time so moving on here we are going to be talking about the maps a lot of people wanted Kings can you to return or be honest so did I maybe it was a bear map maybe had a lot of nostalgia tied to it but I do miss playing apex legends on Kings Canyon unfortunately it doesn't look like it be playable at the start of the season they've talks about having a major map change towards edge it will give us new areas to fight in and hopefully or keep things fresh for us but kings can you ball be returning its return ties into the changes to ranked mode so I'm gonna be talking about that a little bit now so season four ranked mode will work slightly differently the season will be in half so we'll have two different ranks splits next season the first of which were played on world's edge and the second will be played on Kings Canyon there will be a soft reset which is what has happened to live at the Pearl you know the last few ranked seasons where the start of it you get reset down at division and a half I think he saw an apex predator would be reset down to plan them - there's now also going to be a new rank added into the game called masters so this rank is essentially what a PEX predator is now at the moment and then apex predator will be reserved for only the top of 500 ranked players in each spliffs on each platform so this would be a Rudy exclusive club of top tier ranked players if you see one of these in game you may as well leave the game that's that's how exclusive this will be so Kings Canyon is returning in season 4 but it looks like it could only be the ranks mode that's the only way they talked about Kings Canyon the man who talks about he was head of ranked mode for 8 next legend so of course he's only going to be talking about see in relation to ranks Boston commodity he doesn't really make too much sense to only have it in ranked mode imagine if you're a somewhat new player to apex legends and you've never played Kings Canyon before the only way you can play ranks mode would be on Kings Canyon you would have to learn was plain ranked you would be a such a disadvantage that it won't really make too much sense in my opinion that could mean that maybe there's the an option to play Kings Canyon in the casual mode as well for those people that never actually played it so they don't have to be stuck on ranked mode trying to learn a new map but that's the speculation they did only confirm that it's going to be in the second split on ranked mode so on the screen now I'm going to be showing you the rank two season two rewards they look slightly different from the rewards that we were given in season 1 of ranks which I didn't really play to be honest I'll make the gold and I sort of stopped the badges look slightly different but also getting some more weapon charms in there as well apex predator weapon Chomper white looks incredible definitely going to be putting that on my favorite gun if I do indeed make it to apex predator and this is a big one actually for people who like their rewards so stays on the website from here onward dive trails will be temporary for all future series this is to help alleviate the visual space when everyone is dropping a map because as it stands now the word event should be too many trials and they would lose their meaning for example if you place apex person in rank season 3 which is the rank mode that is Kanab soon you will have the apex predator dive trail available for the duration of season 4 but then it will be removed players who earned any dive trail in season one or two will be grandfathered in and we'll keep the trials forever so if you want to keep your trail forever without having to re-earn every season you have 11 days left of ranked season 2 to get a higher rank as possible so the other news we have coming into the start of season 4 is of course there is going to be a new gunner coming into apex legends it's another sniper rifle it's going to be called as a sentinel now they only talked about this briefly and what they did mention is that the gun will have a charge mechanic it sounds like it'll be different to the charge rifle though iíve severely dates that bring a charged rifle copy into the game it won't make much sense it may be able to store that charge from more powerful shots you may be able to shoot earlier than the full charge is ready bird damage penalty for example it sounds like a really powerful weapon for a patient player and it sounds like it would be a great way to initiate a fight as well if you imagine that you couldn't open a team they don't know you're there you can charge up a shop make it more powerful it doesn't matter that you know you're waiting they'll be longer if they don't know you're there if you take one person out of game with one shot then you can rush in and finish the job three be two ladies interesting because a lot of people are I saw on ready it's one of fair few people at least I will not be disappointed that was another sniper given the fact that the last weapon we had added into the game was also a sniper rifle in the charged rifle and it made me think which gun would I like to be added into apex legends and personally I would love to see another submachine gun I love those close-range gunfights I'm terrible with shotguns I do not like the Peacekeeper because I cannot aim with that gun so I'm stuck with either the alternator or the r99 the alternator doesn't really have a place in the metro any longer since disrupt arounds were fortunately remove from the game and the honor tonight's can be stale because it's been a top tier gun since day one so I'm gonna open the question up to you guys what class of weapon would you like to see added into apex legends so as I was recording this video I kept checking the apex legends of ready to make sure that nothing else came out that I missed perhaps and it turns out as soon as the trailer was dropped there have been map changes that have happened right now now these are only small map changes there's signs in various different positions but they are probably going to be where the major map changes will be occurring in season 4 there's also this weird photo shoot set up that a set up with pictures are forged there as well we're probably going to be seeing a few more teasers towards season 4 in the next week or so so I'm looking forward to those so thank you so much for watching I do appreciate it if you know any here be sure to subscribe to
