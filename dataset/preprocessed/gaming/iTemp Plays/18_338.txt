hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are here back again playing some apex legends of course and we just got the new season 10 gameplay trailer and it showed us so much of what is to come we have details about the new map changes the new legends the new weapon and more so let's start with sia we can see sierra throw down his ultimate on this bridge in a new area remember that his ultimate tracks fast moving enemies within its radius after that he fires his ability towards a valkyrie who is mid-air trying to fly away and we can see that it actually interrupts her mid-flight and she starts falling to the ground we know that this ability is a tracking tool but it would appear as though it also has interrupt functionality on top of that and once he stops valkyrie's escape he turns around and zooms in through the floor remember that he has a heartbeat sensor ability when aiming down sights but he didn't actually need that here because his ultimate provided reconnaissance on this mirage coming up behind him we could see him through the wall but it also showed his footsteps as he was walking towards sia this short clip showcases his passive his ability and his ultimate and just what it can provide you and your team in these big fights this is his whole kit on show and it looks extremely powerful i will say though that it looks pretty easy to use these incorrectly his ability is timed and avoidable his ultimate has a big radius that everyone can see so your enemies might just leave that sphere you have to be careful with his kit to get the best usage out of sierra next up we have the new rampage lmg showcased of course by rampa here the lmg specialist on apex she charges it up with a thermite grenade which are going to be in hot demand in season 10 and then she absolutely guns down this gibby and then shoots through this door with the lmg we've seen this mechanic beforehand with the care package l-star back in season three or two or something like that but that gun was so rare and nobody even picked it up because it was pretty poor this will be really interesting to use in those close range gunfights the weapon itself didn't look like it had much recoil its fire rate was decent and you can guarantee it packs a massive punch especially supercharged with those thermite grenades on top as well now we can take a look at the decimated world's edge you've seen it all the way through this trailer but i have some comparisons from ea's website so we can see exactly where these new pois are placed on the map and what they're called first up say goodbye to the refinery me amigos you've probably landed here three times in your entire life but now there is a huge reason to drop on the north side of the map and it's because of climatizer this area looks absolutely huge it has ice it's got lava gondolas and i'm sure a whole load of loot on offer as well it looks amazing it's definitely a big improvement in my opinion the next area to be replaced is sorting factory one of my least favorite areas on world's edge this is being destroyed and in its place stands lava cycling first of all the lighting on world's edge looks so clean it looks like we'll be fighting on a nice summer's day instead this area looks amazing i love the new designs spawn are providing for us here it gives a new feeling towards edge and we see the gondolas here again here's a close-up of those gondolas we've seen them a few times in the trailer and they're actually pretty big another big map change for us here this time it's train yard another one of my least favorite areas of being absolutely destroyed in its place stan's landslide this area doesn't look rich with luke just yet it's undergoing some reconstruction but the gunfights here seem like they will be far fairer in terms of the high ground distribution so those are all the major map updates and points of interest changes these are always some of my favorite changes that come with the new season i am so excited to test them out so that's the big changes we have looked at cs kit we've taken a look at the new lmg and its capabilities we've looked at all the new map areas in there as well if you spotted it was the new vault battle pass skin which looked incredible season 10 is going to be a great one thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends messing about me i'll tell you what i've been messing about okay i've got i know i think that's the issue no more messing about i don't know i think that needs to stop yes you swan no what do you want to get bait i'll just start getting punched in the back of the head okay i broke one yeah oh this poor guy literally missed every single one of those for this poor guy ran up to me after i landed for a half an hour before he didn't push him in the back of head mate 70 on the one outside damn the guy was in horizon you told me uh i think so one dropping backdrop no i have 170 who's that full stack right thank you okay well we just switched places then no i mean you have to say at 60 right so we both have 120. oh you said 180 oh okay yeah yeah another team just jumped up or something like that two teams here why does that take me down mate going this way oh i don't want to go this way but i did oh me no i've got your thread boyfriend what's in one shot there's a patty i'm gonna take it yeah i knew i should have switched the g7 with the r9 in this building that's stupid of me thanks mate i mean everyone has an even eight those buildings so scary yeah it is these guys aren't that good that wasn't literally punched twice because they just dropped an alt to a low yeah another team's rocking from the bridge rocking off oh dude they're taking everything how are you not dead she's literally 30 hp i'm so sad i have to run there was another another team trying to rock off yeah there's teams there's still teams everywhere it's crazy i'm switching to an e right because there we go so we're not contested on energy mate oh yeah i was about i think i have to drop mine too i only have like 20. it's so hard i'm not sure oh it's down below it's down here kind of energy if you want something now you're coming i'll switch over he should be really weak recharging shields die why did that all miss i'm going for the punch mate i don't know how that all missed i'm i'm gonna have to watch that back that's a scam put my head on my head bismarck i need to arm switch me second oh my god i'm a mess i gotta change a lot of stuff almost gotta change a lot of stuff oh this has been a messy game but kind of fun apart from that watson she should have killed me already i was missing me i was missing you know i'm like i was there i would have cleaned it up yeah that other team would have shot you while you were reviving now there wait was it down low mate that low brought yeah yeah in the back 224 shotgun um i'm pretty sure that there's a team like train area zones closing though yeah i think i heard chance this way have you ever used a digi on a wall yeah i don't like i mean i don't mind it um i would go as far as says i hate it oh okay every ounce of my body it's the worst thing to ever exist i'm quite passionate about the subject i am i don't know why you brought it up triggered sorry yeah it was that was me that broke out hey let's go over here okay i thought they were gonna go out apparently why didn't they which hadn't made they're going to be very upset that we ran all the way over here to kill him but i'm bored i'm a genius i have one syringe uh i have one med kit for syringes i can drop something for you yeah i'm gonna go i'm gonna they're running back i broke one oh he's got white oh i jumped off that's okay i'll just i wonder they weren't that confident with it yeah i don't think i don't think they can fight this they're just going to try and run yeah yeah i'll definitely flee give another bad i don't 94 96 okay 97 in front of me either god hit fire more rich got it far more i can't find more of my videos i should change back to my alc if i hit five more and if i play lc i can't play cod with the boys because it just feels different so you gotta switch to mouse and keyboard rich come on especially we're gonna be doing game nine a lot of these games are would probably be like uh more compatible on mouse and keyboard sorry i'm sorry so the damon yeah you are but like you know we could be like actual demons you know yeah we could be yeah yeah i really should play card with me some keyboard you're right  it'd be fun all the best games are just so much better on controller i mean not controller mouse keyword now you're right if i could have gone back and changed like now i mean i've been playing we've i mean we've been playing controller our whole life so i mean at this point i don't care but if i could go back and change to like playing on mouse and keyboard growing up 100 i would you see these kids that start like counter strike when they're four yeah yeah and then that's pc i'm not on the road oh 126. on white on the first guy oh oh i hit the guy that's looking like oh here my favorite meet these guys are shook you headshot them on the rope and then there's there's suss oh wait wait wait wait wait they're attached to us i'm not messing with third ring mate that is true they might just take that rope again fly over our heads perhaps possibility oh wait this is all wait what am i talking about they're running across i'm so stupid i i was looking the wrong way 63 on one string sandals going kind of crazy we could be there tune them but i told us to run away uh yeah yeah not pad for ages i'm gonna get hit by it no oh i punched it i'm insane why did you not just get behind the building octane 26 oh my god it's impossible to finish kills unless they're already one hp yeah but if you like engage a fight first with a sentinel you it's like only damage you get like a couple shots and then just like somebody else cleans up it's hard to find damage it's a low damage low kill gun but it's so satisfying to watch yeah it's just so fun to use get on there get on there now that was actually good that was actually good that's great we are geniuses oh man content content for days oh that's great make content out of nothing you started flying me you just know he had a glimmer of hope i like how we didn't say one word but both of us knew exactly what we were doing i got another record like as soon as you shine two so we both connected that was great that was a good oh that was great game i would say i still stole kills but you're using a sentinel so yeah that's just the way it works you know and i was using a volt with a digi and mind you the worst thing ever exists hmm
