hey was the guy's do to reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today I've got three my best game that I've had in season 4 it's a ton of damage it's a ton of kills it's a beautiful game here on the Kings Canyon with a load of action and I got it with one of the weapons that was nerfed in one of the recent patches the g7 Scouts on screen here are some of the stats that go along with this now the headshot scale went from 2 to 1.75 the multiplier base and the leg shot multiplier went down from naught point 9 to naught point 75 and along with that the projectile speed has been slowed as well so only slight changes to the g7 scale but trust me he's completely dominant and you gonna see in this gameplay as well so thank you for watching I do appreciate an Aussie ball in five and a half seconds my friends the pity is my friends the pitch 8yz I have not landed here since 1984 my belief pretty sure someone got purple shields in the middle and the wingman that's fantastic actually feasting on oppa going on what's going on don't worry buddy good grief we already way look at that caustics controller batteries ran out or something I mean she's off course the crap went sliding across the arena they're extremely bad blue and purple and we just had one blue and they were the two tanki's members on the entire game all right that's the diluted I guess we get the hair can prepare to pee and Mimi goes look at her scope it's got the havoc as well I should land to the pit more often I swear there's always purple shields in the middle of the pits always just a shame that they were there a lot bit sooner than we were left us I left my teammates shielding us in Seattle I like the blue one to get protect some damage for me doesn't this the place that used to have like a gold item every single time they're fighting what sounds like be the bunker which is well of course it should have blinders we've been deadly over this way let's miss them a teammate we would elites that he's on the way why am i always speaking sniper attachments up I never ever use snipers ants on a postcard 47 huh groans I was to hit a Sony people are idea they either have no shields or this guy just had a bad guy he does know this guy just had a level one or is the looking if any of those people have dual or purple I think Green scream recruit there I've one of them did look like a nice option got nice nicely bullet back here hi hey Ivan unlevel one bag I don't want to pick up this is why I don't like to loosen it I'll there we go this why I don't like gluten that much go I get stressed I don't know which one's the better one steaks explore this I can just I can already hear the comments in the back of my head though on voice he's talking to me saying you missed it I need he said a green stock because if that exists on the game what you got for me we've shocking balls on the ground anyway all right scrap in the distance don't smoke me name the people are top don't leave this teammate we need to shoot [Applause] he stops walking whose fire is gone like the Terminator this continuous continuous fire boss Holland down forward on the flimsiest hopefully can see a few good time traps there we go alright nice well these are clearly week 56 health absolute maximum Bernal ended two of the 14 shots on this to the start this guy would be dead already freeze you might say it's got its kill it's real fast there you go holy damn oh that's good news for us I don't like too much I did 150 damage hundred people now he's near enough I've been on an angle friends Oh sky purple well right on the edge of the safe zone here there's a lot of good loot here so if we can just retreat to get my teammate back he'll be able to get a load of good loot otherwise it might be a bit of a struggle that slightly no absolutely not okay think of a dismount of time and as I'm left yet which is also good news there's still 27 people left this map is far smaller than boards edge but earlier on I had a like an 11 minute voltage gain some reason I don't I don't know how it happens everyone walls edges just pin each other that it's all land of fragment west on the same building all right this is what I reckon this is the mistake whenever I get respond to my team I always runs off into the sunset and leaves me with no abilities because you spawn with your abilities on called aim and then you just can't see you make it across I think you did some careful teammate children in the outfit absolutely please please you're gonna die anyway just please stop embarrassing me this is what I don't use this gun quick teammate thank you stuff don't leave too much Doug because we can just go and get our old glue back Oh God there's something about the Peacekeeper I'm telling it's sticky yet it's stickier than like the online tonight or something I'm telling you mister I don't know it feels unnatural to me actually surrenders with the peace coupon wanna see lobster one comb what's going on here stupid rock mental Risa here we've been playing good up until now need to try and get to lieutenant Luke back I always need to go over that way once you mate let's go let's get your old lay back look like walking around with blue shield although this team could have stolen these purple looks like they did come from this area he's on his way here taking a wall but there's still 15 people left that's all good throw nades I saw that you might be dead without the stupid arm shield oh you guys are demoralized they stopped shooting they know me Georgians and they knew the moves were to sleep they stood no chance of evening only so week why you started me for I guess they gonna hang on this team not a fire each other I think no they're for my teammate my team didn't magico himself purple which is annoying Eric and his team stolen from us will headshot on farming damage though if these guys pushing up keep in mind that they nerfed is good in the last match I mean look at it still dominating we can change that shirt a second Yvonne shields okay sounds rock climbing now this thing's gonna get high ground on us are they both our bet I reckon they are you know incoming care package I love loot I'm not sure this is worth it they're the Gibraltar that alone is freaking me out that you're brought up with high ground is a lost cause I'm willing to say I'd say what isn't a lost cause own this Scouts were the two times four times variable sight possibly the only gun I'd use it on maybe it may be sweet fight to be honest pretty decent now I reckon we brought her owns it this way but start to try and find someone else apart there are still six squads left we don't have to fight that Gibraltar you guys hi great there are people here I found this crap got a scan you guys nice I missed John a reskin what peacekeeper feel the firing I know I've got a lot of lire munition but I don't like seeing that looting honestly I hate I despise it it's my least favorite thing about Barrow our games I hate to do and you could tell from the quality of loops that I've the skill of my new teens explore this way if I had to say more than four seconds in a death box I'm fuming honestly if my blood pressure rise so I can feel it Rosie I have to just leave the box even if there's something that I've seen I just have to run away that's just I'm afraid that's how it is it's a medical condition not sure the name after these guys haven't rotated I reckon this doctrine alien Domo here if I to guess I reckon that's a decent or spot on this hill so my favorite places to land on on Kings Canyon stupid gun match your angry dog killed you now missus because I'm fired through a fence the old no Emma suspense situation just toking today I can't encroach on a feat let me actually knocks amigo with a piece camp hold on friend who never makes her fall for war as I say there we go what is this game I feel like we haven't stopped fighting tight I'm me throw balls I don't need this many live rounds for one team I didn't need this many like rounds with my game I would assume I say the worst way to lose a game though is to be in a 1v1 squad situation like this and to get shot at whilst you're looting all right no more death boxes elated so we go this way 16 kills honestly I feel like this has been a non-stop game come on teammate we got in a friend this way position is so much more important than Lutz if someone gets here and they know we're hearing that curse off word screamer group it's the old saying goes this is good because we have good hands blue team has a beautiful Scouts so I think we should try and make use that we don't have to play aggressive no one's gonna steal our kills I know in that way now we just wait for this golf called name and charge it up friend so loud it's good just be one guy there's a reason they didn't push he's gonna fire I think I reckon he's one guy terrified in a corner [Music] not going to oskins do you be me it's absolutely I don't know what it's beautiful its destruction you see that's the thing the Peacekeeper is a good weapon I'm just not good with the peacekeeping I mean I had some decent all shot in there however that one fights get against the Pathfinder if I hadn't already taken his shields off and he was 1v1 I'd have been struggling is what I'm trying to say 18 kills I thought we might have been getting close to 4,000 damage and we were indeed only 258 damage away from that shouts out the teammate for one getting six kills and eighty fourteen hundred damage and also being patient and let me run back to the old respawn as well fantastic a twenty four kills on Kings Canyon map well usually people just killin each other about 12 people left after three minutes good game thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
