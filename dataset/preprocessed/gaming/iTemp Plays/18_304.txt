hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i am sick of being in diamond and i know that so far is as well so yesterday we hopped on we played for about three and a half hours and we got over 1 000 rp and we didn't have a single game where we lost rp in the entire session it was a ranked masterpiece especially seeing as we weren't a full three stack now in this session we actually went on a three win streak back to back to back for over 600 rp and here are two of the games from it the final one was the freest diamond win you've ever seen in your entire life we barely had to move until the final circle you'll see what i mean so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends one team blue that team's going inside over there now i don't know if you see any uh sniper mate all right sniper mag yeah there's some great things let me say scanning i hope they don't see me i'm trying to put some shots in anyone bingo guys if you want yeah i'm down to rotate these sucks 11 damage so i'm gonna need you to start putting some weight i've done 60 so i'm sort of popping off myself sorry pull in some weight i'm somewhat of a of a professional myself amigo this is all alluded to yeah very much they took well actually a good chance they took sniper but still they uh they're into some resistance you know what was that they ran into some resistance in the caves it was sound oh yeah it sounds like it's another team probably playing that edge over there there's a low voltage stuff over there so it's probably a team nick marks love sniper scopes maybe i should pick one up he does it's crazy to see those controller players just hate him yeah don't know the last time i used one honestly they opened the vault in there okay tracks one here for 100. they didn't open the vault by the way a load of stole soon from it i think i got it i know the courses

regenerated reporting over there into that take that building that's good they're not going to come this way yeah i'm fine here big fight near me no mate big strap over here wish i had a name for this i think they basically the fight's pretty much finished though there's a team inside like guys down they're trying to come and do this building from them that's fine as long as we're able to hold this uh this part so it's fine i'll end it eyes on there this i'm staying back here though yeah i'm gonna come back i'm gonna cover from there so i'm done i could try and look at this let's go here they're trying to craft a thing i'm tempted to try i don't know if i can what are you trying to do there's no one over the side that there's a team in the building like i want to loot this death box here um i can try and walk up with you because like he flew there because he was so i killed him as he was batting cover from the other people like i don't think anyone knows i'm walking up with you the only thing his teammates walking up with me i'm good i'm good i'm good i'm good i got i've got a lot of stuff from that there's another squad attacking yeah i need it yeah just back up back up you're gonna take the spot i 480 light i'm gonna give him some back we these these two rock uh these two rocks are here safe that we haven't it's right on edge trying to cover him just in case they fire guy right here 50. we need a low but that love is actually so good yeah she really is he's not trying to stop staying still yeah this team's pushing over there i'm watching this side you guys just need to hold that over there shields i'm i'm still holding this spot over here i don't know if he needs me to come over i've got yeah teammates with you no no i'm good that's a full team over there whole team gonna come out of this so yeah i'm really low now now what'd you need heavy yeah it's literally you can't really fire though it's fine i have a spitfire okay if you can fight if there's a light there's not there's no boxes here yeah it's there's so many there's like so many full teams left yeah yeah yeah i'm holding this give me team i'm holding this guitar you guys need to try and focus that team trying they're gonna have a big fight they're gonna have a really big yeah they are we don't really need like we just whoever's like yeah they're kind of roast that over there they need to crack that as long as possible and then maybe inch up to like this part right here that team rotated over here they're not gonna fight really one i'm back nice clean is there a beacon here not all i can say yeah it's nice yeah let's someone's been down low they might be they might be over there if they have that off they're in the middle they're in the middle everyone just grabbed one just grab him he's on the rope right now charge him up front page hold on i just can't hit a theme with this iron sight that's fine that's fine we can go uh we can go scan one won't be still pretty close it's possible only saw two i think that's i think that's him right there yeah i think he's oh my god i'm trying to cover back to one of them i'm just going to back up before zombies one of them like it's too late to scan it's fine though i need heavy my team's on that middle part one thing oh come on either three times on my rampage you want it i only just picked it up no no hold on no no no i think that's right this is fine okay i just found one i mean honestly i'll just i can just put my over here or somebody if somebody takes it then this is just we hear it yeah who's ready to fly someone just always needs to watch that route yes oh sniper attachments let's go and a ween man and light ammo yes let's go over here hey i don't really have any heavy this guy just joins it for his proud like whatever he's using they're trying to get his old stuff back i think no more sniper let's explore this way hey sad sad times he's going back for it he's gonna bubbly though yeah that's fine let's get ready let's go this way he's gonna be there by himself there's two on that bin i think yeah they are right beneath us i mean i've had so our rotation is pretty fine wherever we want to go uh this team's out in the open where this uh bloodhound team was neither got the back nearly cracked nearly cracked team don't know what's going on going through their resources team over here i'm gonna need them right here they're right below i'm meeting both sides they're gonna move throwing forget crack them i crack i hit all three of them i think i cracked two oh my god yeah we can't even commit to it that sucks i have i had two families but are they getting they got naked i have two remotes do you mind if i i got a rampage but now i don't think so mate i've i've only got a hundred bullets so they're not gonna really count for too much i'll take one just keep that one yeah i'm using i'm using my last two shirts anymore it's weak come on come on still safe we're safe for ages this is unreal this zone is actually so charging it's literally meant for this team to win whoever just stopped here the longest they're still down there they're still chilling down there take a thermal i can't possibly use three of them all right and he might come in clutch your path a little bit i've got an angle on this guy pretty much you can stand by him nice i'm a little bit yeah in the open him nice they're pushing that too i think burning him i'm cooking him down there i killed him why didn't mine bounce like that we would have to drop a different i mean i have a pad but is guys here see isn't he broken all right 16 shots on my rampage i'm just going to charge it up now she's yeah we're chilling on our channel we're good for like another 30 seconds please drop me some heavy oh my god thank you i've been begging all games she's had so much she dropped me barely any yeah it's mirage i don't know but i think there might be a bang right here i think so oh that's a really battle that's so early they're fighting like crazy she needs to drop me an extra 20 heavy here this is crazy there's two of them two of them down and then there's another one at the other bin i mean i'm going back to kp i'm not too many bullets so i'm just gonna i'm gonna dive down to this cover one place actually that's such a that's such a rigged zone it's meant for whoever's up top to win 100 every time i mean that that place shouldn't exist like if you can't get up there without some legends like path or octa i mean even octane like you said is pretty difficult to get up there it's like a horizon pack oh we were we were healthy we were so annoying 20 minutes out there yeah teams hate us teams 100 are so angry with us right now that's three wins in a row mate i don't care she was sitting on 200 heavy in the last ring and she dropped me 20 me i can't
