hey was a gauzy to each welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are hot dropping it into school town apart from the fact that it wasn't a hard job because only one of the team like today but it's ok because then halfway into the game every other team migrated over to score town and we had to scrub there anyway so I hope you enjoyed today's apex platoons video if you do be sure to subscribe if you know around here to join the light Empire and I'll see war in five and a half seconds my friends skull town it is my friends I have been a reluctant to land here because Scott n is of course the hot charm and the plain path is right above it unfortunately unless someone here thanks ludicrous to be freight shopping that's a teammate the greatest Ivrea chocolate performance I've ever had by pounding on the walls grace play I don't even need to see who I'm flying them and they just fall over and dive inside shoots into the abyss a teammate no you bought wine eating some Lutz health he's struggling to to be fair I'm nervous to go this way back into the center of skull town I've got about a hundred health to play with this is emoji this is decent my school team came back before or sorry Kings Canyon you never got this much loot in fact school town is incredibly quiet there could be a squad just lurking around illusion though might be a decent idea to stick around with to the octane here or at least the octane in the blue tone to hopefully I'm have to use one of these syringes anyway alright it's still motive I think honestly I think there's no rush to even properly heal up here yeah it's not what I want to ping there you go there's two there as well if rate was good to me let's pray the best performance I've had with an earache shotgun against that Watson but I can't not take a havoc in the current situation on the game the havoc is outrageous let's say and that Rangers out of ten I've heard people described as I should have been trying to remember what spawns where because this is what it's going to be like all right don't land at these boxes you won't get a weapon no wonder it's unloaded to this I'm a bit late to the party because you came out on Tuesday it's been a few days don't don't lend at this box either you're struggling I mean if you want an extend like Maggie laughing I'm trying to play that Corbin inside I'm extremely excited because I've never actually never asked you that before in my life I've tried twice I think failed both times and I is the first time I've ever done it yep you're not wrong Bakhtin you are not wrong my friend at least the size of life tonight's a nice one of their five ever come to Marshall place might be a decent idea to grab that it's only got one stack of ammo they're coming this way I can't believe you people to scrap Len will come through making contact with enemy no never went I mean I think they probably heard me anyway nice to people or at least two scans all right the race has got about three health maximum yeah they're on the last legs then we just got a Gibraltar to deal with okay the Gibraltar is week two that's worked actually because I've got a major assist on the race and then I stole the kill on the dribble so then that works out in the end the Phoenix kits I'm struggling for a decent bag here not like I would make the best use to have my bag anyway in fact I need a bad bag than anyone else on this game because my loop situation is so horrendous for me to be efficient I play need a golf bag at all times any to select fires really and of course as soon as we leave school same people have returned to school time it's a waste so Weissman is already one up top Pathfinder is so important for the team when you're fighting a school team because he's to mention the only way you can get up top so it saved my alters I mean I could pretty crap up here I could make my own web without without my um ulti my teammates gone definitely worth saving where's the scrap we've turned up a little bit late here there we go so they waited for us making contact with enemy gosh-darn stairs at least I did 130 damage on one word wyakt hit straight into the spikes [Applause] hands on top but I think him they might be a little bit scared cuz I've only got wide shields I need to get a peek here if possible see yep hi again mess my grappler messed it up fleeing the scene so put Hank I'll try to grab the safety wait all these people come from where were these guys at the star of the game these aren't proper school time scrappers official birther is gonna get revived but my teammate must be 10 seconds left who else is reviving here a friend I think I'm get back in time even if they do revive I'm not sure they have enough time to heal up anything once all day I killed in it lucky yes we are already inside the ring sulfurous nobody's not I was waiting for them to cross over but apparently what he made it across tell my second one purple are over that's fine these guys got purple anyway I'm not dying I was pretty sure one of them had gold just really took the right band I'm pretty sure they're on the same team that is unfortunate but hand got absolutely Wambach's by that peacekeeper bueno adain there's so much loo here 200 this is the close run my foot sorry I thought this is one that was further away we're good I got your back and there through the scores they have two and two of them are fighting in the distance what does that not sound right no so why did everyone I you know what I think it is I reckon school town was an absolute mess the first day Kings Canyon came back and then everyone got sick of lending it so I think there must have been some sort of gentlemen's agreements where it's like right listen nobody fights at the style game okay what we're gonna do is we're gonna load up in different areas for five minutes and then we will all meet up at school team five minutes into the game and that's pretty much what has happened because that was one of the biggest score town scraps I've ever had and for some reason you've wasn't the start someone come take my level two name yeah there's one squad here they start the game unbelievable I reckon that's what must have happened also because I think the zone ends on school town so people don't want to be here the entire game because then you'll just get no Lutz oh the zone does change every single day that's enough loom for me I'm already boarded it what we need to do is probably try and get a bit of high ground here because that last scrap was to the north and these guys will have to come this way I think this was a ludicrous idea but I mean this should probably be out of bounds to be honest some characters literally can't get up here there Elise miles away these are the last two teams need to get involved trying get over as soon as you can friends I know that I'm a Pathfinder I got here far sooner but you got to instill some sort of urgency in him did your brother's gonna see me gap that's proof there you go that you're brought to it's coming down fortunately it's easy avoidable - eats up even though that's done nothing it's probably still a good ultimate because it scared us off and they were getting pinched that's probably works out well for him let's explore it this way I'm gonna set the zipline back up top we can 20 long K because that other team will just rotate around and get better positioning teammates dessert I just want to take you all the way up top is tough cuz I think the plan here was to try and track both teams just you guys this one's probably a little bit easier anyway I can get up top whenever I want and now I still spotted ready for the balloon which is bad news for us my teammates gotta select Barney's habit you definitely won't give it across I've got a prowler but still dating in burst mode isn't it something it's not the end of the world you know a good Newsies there are knock taints gauntlet and they haven't taken the balloon if they took the balloon they can land or buy up top and grievous the entirety of this game I think we just try and deal with these guys quick if we're gonna fight we have to take them out fairly quickly I don't think the other team is close but you never want to get third party nice job team I basically did nothing there I did well I did my fair share one of my I don't like having these few Gila boss okay it's it's on my mind when I'm running around I'm thinking how am I gonna heal up it for more short songs that I'll do this team thing like that they try to get involved at all which is good for us or care package action care package over here team distracted I've got a plan I've got 43 43 more damage and I get my red shield here and the devotion combined with the red shield sounds absolutely ludicrous and be taken down recharging she Elst off from that range shot down there's no way you choosing Susan L star I don't believe that you can kill them in that range but I'll just run away in here look even if you get me waiting there's not a chance only 30 seconds left on the clock this guy but she go to sinsa-dong to you in this way did we all just get bamboozled beyond belief did we all just get triple beep beep you'd that's outrageous I mean we've got a good time which is good we can try and track the lifeline which assures is the last one left I just want to be involved this is what makes me feel all kinds of I don't I just wanna make sure I at least see the gunfight going down otherwise it's anticlimactic the tracks can't be a mini old shorty you can see the tracks you go back up top sorry friends I know you had a devotion and purple shield but I have a devotion and red shield and sensei says ogg my friend says we got the ultimate combo the legendary devotion the raped shields 2034 damage to revives to respawns not a bad game shout out the team I think we were a solid unit they're unbelievably the school town was pretty dead to begin with but ok because we were returned there and in the mid game it was completely popping off he's the only terminology I can use to describe that but thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
