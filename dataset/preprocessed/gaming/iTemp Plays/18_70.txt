yes i got him what a stupid game how did the team do all right nice job gank i've absolutely ruined their game that can't start oh nice man very next game i'll get one teammate i'm down this is that plan trying to ruin someone else's game i'm causing this is easy yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i left here i like this guy oh my god oh god oh god teammate oh oh oh god oh god you're being hit no hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and not all of my games in ranked have been like those first two for some reason that was a recurring theme though i kept getting no teammates or one teammate it's just a joke and then in half the lobbies i'm like lagging around the place but i did have some good games i've got some wins i've got some losses i'm gonna be showing you both in today's video the highs and the lows are ranked i hope you guys enjoy thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends come on oh this is an ugly sight i'll take this instead are we chasing this let me get some kb i want the kp come on guys don't be mean i really deserve it i deserve this kp no you've just stole it it's unbelievable that was my kill oh this one's mine though no no no no chill chill chill this is on me this is all me lord darn this won't hurt hold on i need some gaping oh i need some cake please yes that's the last of that squad dimensions looking up shoes purple careful might want to back up oh my god my teammate needed that more than me welcome to diamond i guess good grief at least he got the shield back from it that's our banner we should grab it they're still fighting we can we can get banner hi sharp the ring hundred percent we just need to chill a little bit let me leave this guy real quick oh there's a gun left hold on target over there making contact with enemy have it here oh my god i don't know what the heck's going on i'm trying to get up to my team here but it's take so long teammate there's another squad attacking me recharging my shields contact with targets recharging my shields need to recharge my shields what an absolute mess that was oh my god i mean this is a decent start there are only two buildings here though i have to share one of them look at this i'll throw one have a point mosaic not bad a point harry wanna try and use this craft over here yeah brother okay just changed taking damage out geez uh maybe i should just pop the bat i didn't want to pop the backs i just crafted it and i took that damage because of the bat that's just annoying i should have just phased beforehand i was in such a sticky situation and we almost died because of it [Music] okay never mind wait i have hammers i forgot any light mags there's not gonna be one left he's there uh 2v3 for that engagement because i was not doing anything i mean i got the kill when it came to that right someone's coming in we could have maybe scanned cryptos before we went but it would have only given us the next ring which we'll see in two minutes anyway are we gonna fight it we'll just fly i think we just fly i can pause this if we need to yeah okay yeah they're kind of holding that taking a moment let us go this way back to another gameplay let's try and get safe now i have 2kp it's not bad get some placement points you get kp at the end of the game anyway always nice to get one or two kp the start of the game can you hear me okay i get overwhelmed in those situations i need a light mag so bad man any names no i'm going back to sleep they started yeah i agree reloading we have to push this the other two recharging my shields one minute ring's not far you could try to run away from this run for now 4k is pretty good heads up new kill leader threat ring's not too far so at this point i did try and wrap around to maybe try and retrieve the banners but there was a sniper there very unfortunate so i reserved myself to ratting i had to just to get some kp for the sorry some rp for the gang almost got seen by this team managed to hide behind a pillar the plan was to try and wait as long as possible and sneak around and then my spidey sense is my wraith passive tingled how can they see me i thought they're ahead no they're not the whole gang was behind and that was the end of that game not sure i think there's a sniper in the area there is a sniper in the area and he's shooting at me first blood 100 is a sniper in the area i am up easy i'll take it just about big thermite angle reloading wasn't sure if i should heal or challenge and then i did like a 800 spray which made him an easier choice uh i'm gonna go respawn teammate that's right he'll need to recharge my shields then we can all loot nice i love landing on a havoc it's so good our teammates doing it okay oh they're playing together that makes sense i left so much loot in there i didn't do the two bodies so i was gonna craft okay let me up lay me up i don't know where these guys ow recharging my shields i guess they're just beneath us stop playing aggro here in a second yeah we need to get out of here two teams us i think somewhere how many times am i going to get scanned one moment friends no i needed that shot oh man i shouldn't have challenged i should have phased the thing is i didn't realize my teammate was reviving the other one i thought i had to win that gunfight for us to have a chance of winning the whole thing you know does that make sense i'm gonna have to use this again i've used it so much in ranks but in ranks i'm not to try and mix things up it's difficult enough as it is give me a sec body shield here level four but these elite strategies shield battery elite strategies one minute rings now save them save them uh thanks one syringe that's gonna come in clutch that's gonna when is the game 100 i haven't alternated still what am i doing i need a mastiff i need a shotgun if you're playing with the gibby you need a shotgun because you're gonna be bubble fighting i mean we can just play safe we don't need to challenge this i follow you guys whatever you guys want to do i'll follow sometimes i think it's better to do that because they're playing together so whatever strategy they want to do i'll just like if they want to rush people i'm right there with you if they want to camp like this i'm right in the corner with you listen more three man this corner like this look at this throwing arcstar on the roof he's cracked giving my shields a recharge do we want to be here enemy shield broken avoid jumping this one i don't want to so this is just a trade of resist i don't have a phoenix for him no and we could get shot in the back relatively easily more friends out of this entire situation i wanted to go through that little cubby hole that goes towards cage because then we have like a choke point between us and their enemies then i realized the race portal isn't that long anymore and we sort of got screwed because if we stayed there we would have died we got third if we reported look what happened to me is this a bad spot we have time to strategize need to recharge my shields we should go here get ready it's zip line time i am taking fire friends i'm under fire recharging shields repairing damages giving my shields a recharge what is he doing nice team one last guy last one it's a wraith you guys have to they had such an advantage in that fight turbo divo as well that fuse i don't know what he was doing he tried to load these beams for some reason didn't know who's here oh my god energy ammo here hey i got a line mag any shotgun i need a shotgun this is a mad maggie i think so maybe she had a shotgun bolt i dropped my three times that maggie's absolutely screwed recharging my shields watch out for the new kill leader friend repairing my damages we should go this way i need syringe here i don't have any kp on here so you're still a putting up girl heat shield man we just got those are some tough fights was that three teams was this three or two i think he was just a two i got three kp which is fine i guess it's not i could do with a little bit more than that it's okay at least we survived listening to the third party and i got my three times back if we don't move all right tma said it himself he said time to sit and play chill and just get top one and i i'm happy to do that because i mean i'm positive rp which hasn't happened too many times today in diamond it's kind of difficult to get positive in diamond at the moment because everyone like and you see you saw it just got absolutely rushed two separate teams pinpointed we don't even have to third this i think they're shooting the people going up the rope anyway i am taking fire friends let's go this way my shots [Music] recharging shields i'm such a big target that one is so huge i feel maybe we get to that oh my god it's an absolute beginner with a bone arrow broken and they're getting shot in the back yeah they're getting furthered enemy over there just walk up on these opening fire too many trees nice there's another squad attacking frag out i don't know if it was ours actually because they don't seem interested giving my shields a recharge all right so we've got this fused team yeah i don't know if it was just that down that blue hand i really wanted to kill or the kp because i'm only on three i assume teammates are a little bit more if they only want to play placement if we go this way we kind of trap ourselves in this little place but i don't know that fight's over right no they they thirsty great less than a minute area enemy over there this is a crazy head glitch so we just sort of trapped ourselves man might be something good this way the ring's moving friends diamond is all about like the fastest way to climb like we could just mindlessly rush those guys but it's completely unnecessary like we was safe here you just play for placement get a few kp to start sit in zone reloading nice so only uh there are two there are two people missing in this lobby still these are probably the biggest teams that are left these ones that fight i would assume i mean this is the team that's a bit of a bother because they're all the way up top it's going crazy the arrows i hope he's got enough heavy wingman here extended heavy mag here level maybe 61. yeah it's a jump it's that night was that a blueton scan i think it's a bluetooth scan all right the two teams in here there's probably a solo rap probably that way it has to be like a solo or something over there shortly just trying to make it awkward for these guys going through some resources perhaps teammates have uh come and do this building i can grapple too this is what this is what ranked is about these end games you don't get these in public games anymore i'm giving my shields a recharge they thrown at me i'll just scrap over there should be fine i don't think there's any cover up there they could just blast me i think i've only got one back left so i'm gonna play safe until the end they have high ground i think i think they can just see me up there the ring is closing there's nothing to hide behind they're 100 be able to see me i'm making weak this is the thing we need to worry about here what a great end last game that was huge it was worth going to bed because they just weren't focused on me just cut through all their uh resources at the end and they had to drop with nothing we just free fired on them that was great well played team feels good to uh to winning diamonds you know overcome some early game adversity come back putting some good damage numbers look at this everyone got good kp seven eight i got nine perfect really fun game
