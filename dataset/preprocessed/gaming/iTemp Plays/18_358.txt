hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today so far and i have been set three challenges by lenovo legion and we have to go out and attempt to complete these in apex legends i would like to thank lenovo legion for sponsoring today's video and i shall be playing on my fancy new lenovo legion 5 laptop so here are the challenges first up we have the triple loot box challenge we have the single fire only challenge and then we have the level 1 only challenge so some stipulations here for the triple loopbox challenge we decided to only allow ourselves to loot heal the balls ammo and throw balls after our first three loopings that means we can't upgrade our weapons with attachment so it's kind of difficult for the single fire only challenge we included weapons like the mastiff as it is a single shot weapon whereas the either 8 is fully automatic so you're not allowed that one and for the level 1 challenge we were fine with looting shields as these would have leveled up anyway during the game but everything else was level 1 including cables i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you once more to lenovo legion for sponsoring today's video and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends kicking us off we have the level one loot challenge and a big chat i'm putting it all on the line uh we're alive oh well i'm so big chad yeah you are i can't use that land on a havoc with three level three extended tonight to drop it um tragic can't pick up any of this stuff either i'm really sad i've got marvin here but i'm gonna try and get level one on him yeah i was out of my materials yeah i got level one level one i got double light i don't know i found a light mag level one that's pretty good not too bad and that's it fine thanks crack but he's probably going to blow our switch one's coming up this guy's behind this still oh my god there's no way i just stuck that guy oh my that's the greatest timing ever oh oh the ark size the oxides between us have been an absolute master class three arc on these people oh i can't take this helmet that had to have been like a hundred yards plus ropes up top but i think there's a gap after it so yeah there is unless you can get it to like that side i was a battery that's fine i'll see you so yeah see ya goodbye there's no way so yeah i mean don't be sorry to me this is your challenge this is going in the video right yeah i thought i could do it i forgot there was a gap to the right as well like that place is a death trap it's honestly a complete death trap i should never risk it died i don't even want to look at the boxes because i'm going to want to yeah we're looking mate right here right behind that thanks on the back yeah yeah i don't even i don't even want red armor because i'm gonna have to slow heal it it's gonna be awful well you'd have to go all the way there's no rule i hear him like my last one i broke a wraith she's behind that he's trying to get the bat off i broke the one in the back right he's for some reason i instead of jumping when i use my grapple i i okay so that was a strategy i've just tried to employ okay well we're doing stuff we're doing it still stuff has happened it still worked bag i need a white bag asap asap i have i have no oh i just need to fell off the map hold on level four against that point in the game where no one's got why anything i i no dude now i have nothing i don't know now back wait where'd you back oh that's why you were cheating ah i don't remember when i picked it up but i just backed up here because i kept checking it was back okay you just have to use nothing unlucky i guess yeah but see like i'm i'm rezzing you i'm saving your life i'm i'm hitting g7 shots there's a lot going on i can't keep track of it i like that uh over here where we started our adventure yeah yeah she's broken [Music] fair enough i guess i don't have an angle what's the difficulty thing from like up top quack quack quack quack nice yeah you're not gonna find a level one bag at this point mate recharging shield kind of start the game oh they're here they're here they're here quite a lot what's got flip what's good i got sniped oh no i have bats i'm not going to use them though ah i probably can use them no i got cravered back forgot it was trios you gotta you got a health train oh she hits every shot give me things oh man you are demons i saw that i next up is the single fire only challenge i think i'm like plat through your platform did you play some extra yesterday or what uh i think i did i can't use this r9 i got a full team on me that's cool i can't even help you got nothing to use um you have a spitfire in an re like can't even use this yeah i'm going to grab this i've got a medkit dropped in here uh hemlock for you i'll just use the master finale thank you i'm here not with you that lifeline raising the course d yes that's huge oh my god a lucky day i stepped on a nasty that has as a single shot isn't it what massive yeah uh yeah i'll see why not hey someone that's me i'm here hello that's good timing though pointing out is that you i don't know if that was you but no i didn't have one but there's more over here i think wait to my left from my left over here they're kind of far we're in a bad spot there we are i'm watching i'm watching your left i'm watching left i can't really speak let me watch behind us this team isn't pushing they're looks great i really want my armor back hold on i'm gonna grab a second popper upper back yeah so one one team's back here behind us and then i think the other teams it's like a teammate i'll give you methyl giving my shields what's it even coming from is that from left side uh that's like yeah middle or something here might be something i'm trying to get to your ultimate so i can get some light rains they're down here as well oh yeah just be careful behind i guess we do need to go towards you yeah i'm watching behind i don't see them here footsteps we just need to go this way mate if you want to back up i have to pop about once again okay yeah i'm gonna i'll go back to you practice one of them wants one shot 30 seconds to be somewhere else again yeah we should be good this team i've also tried to come this way i tried to take anvils off in the middle of that fight and i ended up taking the stock off [Laughter] yeah i just i just took it off completely i was like i'm gonna i'm gonna end up getting myself killed trying to take it off mid-fight i quite like this it's really helping me honestly okay we might want to back up like this way or something yeah i mean i'm i'm not i'm safer on that up a little bit if we get shot by all teams and we'll probably die i just wanted to try and let them find each other because they're kind of close each other now i think for 30 as well now we're taking yeah yeah let's go straight over their head that's the watson sickness i might try and get up top yeah over here the ring is close just make them run away hey i went down too far boston's uh close she's like half shield i have to pop about are they all working together or something like they were right next to each other just now i'm backing up though backing up hard harder how long's your time uh eight seconds i'm going i'm getting down now i'm gonna go this way okay over here team i don't see him i just of course i shot that just got out of level cash for that i need a i need a slow heal okay you know like 60 70. so one's a part in our phasing oh yeah i'm going all the way this way where can we go like i guess that left side we just got to get it down it's something yeah like they're not even peeking they're not yeah it is weird maybe because they know they've got zone i'm going to try and swing left a little bit may i do i stay here i'll stay here i'll stay here yeah i can i can i can uh bracelet back i'm gonna have to move very soon but i broke one they've revolted i'm going back i'm going back is that one back uh wright is 50 50 health rev is really weak i sent him back he didn't heal and i'll just hit him for like shields i might try and get over there i can't really peek it i mean is that safe is that safe then there's a nasty head glitch right here so i'm gonna i feel like i should try and grapple over that distance i don't know like us being here is kind of bad i mean if you can maybe play mirage yeah 50 rave 85 shots well a little bit giving more shields a recharge they're just not breaking they're not are they are they really no one like there's no way their loan supplies they got to loot that with the team i mean i'm gonna put this down but there's not gonna be anything in here it's going to go down final circle this is ridiculous oh yeah we're not going to win close range either no no we need to broke our mirage we need to do a tiny bit more damage and they're not vegan hold on i'm chucking the knees i got gotta get these nades like i think i'll hit these i'm gonna i'm gonna try and go i'm gonna try and go this way a little bit this way we just need some damage on him back here right fire eyes dude oh my god that was ridiculous i used a mastiff for the last two kills but it's a single fire gun it's a single player yeah it is it is we're joe's in trios against three stacks you know so best mode in the game hold up oh it's so bad man you've triggered me i've ruined the whole game the whole vibe is gone we need to redo it no no no no no no no gg ggg that's two down and finally we have the triple looping challenge uh i'm landing the two close beans in the middle and then i need to find one more yeah yeah i'm gonna land on the bins on the right side these bins in the middle have some potential tough gold guns and um and my purple armor i mean i guess they all though you know what i mean can we not pick up like uh ground loot uh we can't you're allowed to pick up like ammo but not guns right yeah i have a g7 with it one to two times okay so i have a lot of choices do i get a pick from what i want no it's just the first three i like i've only got a g7 it's my this is my loadout now just a g7 okay but i have like seven guns in these three bins oh you can choose then yeah yeah okay nice nice nice okay well i got flatline alternator well i i left a purple on not like a gold on it even uh can i take one of your guns wait i found one going nine nine it was on the floor next to a bin oh get rolled mate what what was the gun i'll take i'll take the re thank you ah you took you cheated no we combined forces for six spins you know the six billion uh that's that's four bins for you tell us my our teammate thinks that i'm the nicest guy ever just gifted him one of them just gives you a call though yeah you only like to take ammo on heels from these i like throw balls i don't know where where are they oh valkyrie's one i'm holding doors yes attachments uh can i swap armors i don't know mate i don't think so you have to make your own how many rules you're making your own one two three four five three five two six seven okay what what's his name oh one two three four five one two three four three five four he gets you he gets you because yeah he makes you think it's gonna be a five but he throws another one in there i don't know you know that's kind of good my brain sees the five because it comes after the next three yeah my brain just decides to ignore it it's weird good one i'm drinking that easy so do you remember what i mean i would think that'd be the first thing that he'd put on there might be his telephone number give me a ring they're underneath i think jumping out here i'm i think on you look at the boxes in here that's why olympus lobbies just die like whoa can't even use any of it in here wow so that almost got so many goods i saw the arm switch i saw that llama switch wait i can't on the switch no i think you're making your own they're both one where is that in the rulebook that's just your loadout it's too much and these lobbies it's it's kind of tricky oh it's a full time again i i'm switched again i have to leave my helmet behind i have to pick up the wrong one i can't know how many have i switched like 18 times okay well you've just broken all of the rules oh one two three so far is a cheats that's manny's big cheating however we're going for a board are there last two teams fighting we just need to get over there this is a world record game in terms of time fastest game of all time all right i'm coming on this might be a wreck of three challenges three wins honestly we're doing pretty good only one other squad squad where is that though is that solo oh the mcdonald's ice cream no it's right here it's literally oh my god they're all on me no there's a guy back here on me i'm so bad yeah yeah yeah yeah whoa one two three's kicking off mate he's just punched me at my emote oh he's showing me his name he's proud of me let's go you are the apex champion wait wait wait wait for it i'm not looking i'm literally not looking oh no no look at the screen look at the screen no that's horrendous you're a cheat anyway dude i have i have saved all of these games so i i i deserve a thank you seven minute wait wait that's actually so fast what i'd literally had more way more damage than you in the single fight one btw so you can say you saved all the games but you know
