hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing sia who is a legend that i have thought to be very underrated for a good while now however sia does have a big weakness and that is being left alone his whole kit is about information and if your teammates are up and alive the information is three times more effective his real power comes from feeding his teammates that info and them acting upon it with their own abilities like singling out a player with horizon alt or barraging them with fused grenades see is a facilitator he's a support legend and been the last guy on your team alive is actually really difficult i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you so much for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me migos all right i don't really know where to land here the looting side is really good guaranteed not guaranteed there's almost always armor in the middle i landed on the left there's no armor in the middle but there is a gold spitfire no why didn't i oh my gosh another enemy down i spawned yeah that's pretty uh that's pretty broken i'm recharging my shoes that's high enough i'm on my way what lies behind it nice oh one minute nice job any heavy i think i have i have a hundred in total because i gotta speed fire so oh there's one below what's the worst voice line in the game i've got one in mind well they're right here this one oh headshot 711 ah she fades away oh she's face here thanks david you know faze david yeah no face david that an actual person yeah where's david phase oh day you never heard of face david she's running wait here trying to be a detective in here making it really hard okay she's gonna go up top she's taking that rope right now okay she was the killer i have seven kills how many do you have four she had eight kills or more really never i don't know if i believe that i think that's a fabrication that's toxic where you think she's not gonna no i'm not saying that she's not saying that like she had exactly saying that seven is a lot of kills you know is it really though yes on 126 ping the ratio actually turns it into 20. here we go here we go yeah what's your pink it's not 127. here we go no but it was it was 190. yeah what happened yes you were yes you were i'm gonna cut to a clip if you actually grind so laggy wow wow oh there it is i called it out though too you got to cut to the clip or your ping even like barely reaches 100 and you instantly start complaining i mean it's 127. one oh be careful behind you behind your budget just got from my head i recovered i mean that's insane this is way better nice i got spitfire i got a purple mag spitfire i'm coming good night's good night wait what oh they're inside oh you're fine you've breathed was she behind me she was hiding on she was hiding here i saw her behind this ah i don't know what happened i must have liked that that was that time you know it's been insane there she was the whole i think she was time me nope she was on this right behind him where he was like here oh sneaky spot to be fair yeah i just like went down didn't expect that no i respect it i could do that but it's way too far away recharging shields knocking doom afraid you can't do watch just gotta leave it just gotta get out of here do i take this they're in there there's no way yeah oh they are here 500 that sucks i don't have any shields at all oh man you want to change much i guess but no maybe [Music] oh he's teammates oh no i'm sorry i'm sorry there's no way you did that on purpose i didn't definitely did that's pretty cringe how much heavy do you have uh 24 spare okay i have 21. i have 19. so i tweeted oh he hit me in the face with a maid [Applause] just so low nice oh i missed every single shot so you were lied to me it synced up perfectly i have a lot of cells now a lot of cells a lot of bats i have one top this cell's in here i feel like i've had one cell this entire game yep you don't i've been looting you guys just take everything well i'm fighting risking my life put my life on the line i have a level one bag we all do it sucks that's the life when you want a pvp a lot of pvp penis going on over here what hello that's what i'm saying what did you say what are you talking about oh wait that was actually really close there's two down here and one he's weak [Applause] [Music] there's one well played yeah they are like high ground i think [Music] yes it is that one's weak okay yeah they're all broken yeah i know i kept switching i'm using a phoenix kit see now that's what you call pvp penis that was fun oh okay i am repairing myself that was fun i love sea roads yeah he's a good legend just the lack of mobility is what makes him that's my feet and then look how i died in that last game i don't know if it was the actual last game where i was getting shot by literally four teams yeah you got away if you have mobility yeah but then look at that team fight when people joined in we could see where they were it was perfect he's not very good clutch legend but he's just he's like the support you know yeah he's good he's like he's not a good solo legend but he's really good for the team yeah yeah yeah also helps that i'm on 77 oh here we go i actually killed him not you oh it's my loot first two times that might blow what's he saying and then forget to go back the last time lesser man would have done more better man would have done wouldn't done at oh yeah the last team where are they cool guys [Music] the answer is maybe why this guy i'm to the right yes yeah that was a very confident play yeah too confident if you ask me teammate did not care what was going on on this part of the screen didn't want to see it already in the next game right now
