hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have absolutely no idea how people get 20 kill games anymore it's impossible i had a great start in the first game in terms of just killed credit my damage wasn't even that high but you know when you shoot people and they just have like 20 health and you end up with seven kills and about 90 damage that happened this game not quite that bad of a ratio um but it was close to that but it still wasn't enough i have two good games for you again today though so i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends gonna be the last team averages yeah we're gonna be a lot we're nice oh my god there are so many people so many people hate us wait people hit us there are so many people did anyone like that yes they did all right mate we've got to get this little hut to myself what i don't know what to do i i'm coming i've got an alternative oh i'm better but this guy this is the new i found a new enemy taken i got one kill though it's worth it no he's up top what is that like a flat line okay so um oh please that's the only shield that how many bullets do you have we gotta punch him out we gotta punch he's pushing us down come on come on where are you oh you dipped oh you lost i had to i had to i'm here he's got purple in a flatline and like a mastiff [Music] yes i got him i'm finishing him i forgot i had a knee right mate i'm going it's the worst mate right cracks on the left oh this guy's like 14 health max max 14 health bobby i'm popping one song yeah the resin right here the razor here okay they weren't pushing when i saw them but come on come on i thought they would be here by now but i guess not remember they're not maybe they didn't have anything it is quite possible uh if you need light range 130. i might as well drop this while i can use this i yeah i've got a wingman just because it's efficient you know six bullets and a blue heavy mag oh i need that heavy mag teammate too hey uh where was the heavy mag in this box uh y'all got this box over here uh you were lying it was this box i i peened it sorry man i'm literally staying in oil kills today literally stealing all my builds crazy we'll never know heavy desperately oh he just that no glue another team came from the left actually maybe they're backed up no they're just over there i think they just backed up that's very weird yeah they ran i think oh maybe i have 24 cells that everyone just tanks 50 mangoes the wrong way nothing wrong with it if you oh yeah that was uh cracked go back on the left [Music] yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna lie now i just need attachments like max still don't have a light mag buy mac purple yes charging up my shields here all right i have 16 cells in two bats i don't know i like how we're the ones that survived we were both big struggling like the biggest struggle i could see when we dropped there i saw it look back at us like you maniacs i know he pretty much figured that he was just on his own after that right this week makes all the sense in the world why don't you damage me what can you do my damage was like when i had 12 kills wait there's no one left man come on i have 12 kills i've stolen all of your kills for nothing yeah it was to no means i wanted a 20 badge and now look basically just ruining my day how is that possible how do you drop a 20 bomb when this happens like how oh watch my back i don't know does this make any sense don't you just don't at this point you did you've done it yesterday not enough but i had more kills than that what 12 kill your 12 kills as these things closing in no you didn't when we were playing together no you didn't i'll watch you back when we played the other day and you farmed like eight kills the end of the game jumper you dropped a 20 bomb it was not it was not eight kills it was like four well called it six no it was not that much it was like four yeah it was like i killed i killed one dude once and then they rest and then i killed him again and then i goes again yeah then i killed two for those four six ten man if this is the old days literally 25 kill game i literally stole everything you had how many kills you wanted damage yeah how much change you have do you say first uh how much damage you are how many times you have almost 70 years how much time do you have tell me really quickly mine's changing some point no mine's changing so i'm firing you you haven't even hit a shot yet you literally haven't indeed in for 20. what's your damage not respectable oh he saw my kill no you saw that one oh god you just ran past a person what there's eight people over oh mate i'm literally gonna start crying man no i'm not you got a pad oh that tim is the best i used to catch up to you i thought there was a big fire in the building i thought i'd ran past everyone you are throwing sir yeah i didn't get a single one of these girls i'm just so upset i'm so upset this could have been so beautiful look at this he's the best but that thank you is not to you by the way no worries okay when you said that i had 1450 damage and 10 kills which i don't think is that bad when half the kills come from people that have white armor to start the game i'm pretty sure i had 1300 damage when when how many kills did you have uh like four yeah well you need to finish your girls mate straight past the supply ship there's nothing there anyways it's usually a purple okay i have it two times on fb20 i have two p20s i actually thought i was his teammate that's great who's running with me there we go dude what is going on i have to reach out my pc and the cool seat need shotgun ammo i have along my pk this man joined everything i have a gold bags okay gives the lifeline back yeah a trash i've made i found so many sniper attachments and stuff i'm stuck on a door oh god oh god i'm dead yeah i think it has gold though it doesn't matter before you want me did i find someone else at least no he's just thirsty banner no ah come on let me have a switch too much action for someone that hasn't eaten at 4pm nice all right sorry i know you probably wanted to die because you need to reset your game or whatever but uh yeah i'm just too clean mate i'm just too clean i just can't help it i don't know how i got a thousand damage in that fight that's ridiculous what you did yeah a thousand damage there's so many boxes around i know what's oh no is the team come in i don't see anybody evil shield here level three money's fine um oh that's the wrong oh wait never mind i've got yeah i'm good thanks oh you have one now i've got our knife flat line there like before yeah thank you i need to when i play valk i need to keep an eye on my wait i have my ultimate by the way i need to keep an eye on my jetpack fuel because i landed next to them i was like i jumped off the top and i didn't have any left so i was just landing in front of the sky they tried to make them they even made it like a like a color no to where it tells you when it's getting depleted yeah but i i never glanced at that stuff you need like a like an actual animation or it's not an animation like some something visual on the screen it may be a noise like maybe it can make a different noise when it goes work dirty oh does it matter i'm just not a valkyrie i think i don't know neither am i i've never played valkyrie ever i just don't like i tried playing her the other day the other day and i just don't like her jet packs i really don't i was all messing up yeah they just they just messed me up i know i'm kinda kind of feel bad for talking down on them way lots of stuff going on over here oh they're inside that team on the right too with 39 blue broken thanks bro right nice why am i close to him i think there's choices unless they just killed him i think there might still be a team inside yeah inside inside okay i'm just terrible with our needs you're good i know you're not you are really bad oh uh oh he's attacked they're both on top okay i'm gonna try and come behind it let's talk more just one more really long fight that was going on from like when we walked out of the cave it was fights that we're not involved in are so long and then we come in and they we just like we'll finish them instantly or we die sorry i need to recharge my shields yes all or nothing they're playing like the war of attrition one's inside the building taking pop shots maybe they're playing for a day or whatever we'll just like ah take the pad it's a lot of passive aggressiveness full send get involved all right i'm flying towards you too far away from the team mate all right we're doing the same thing again right just like literally full-on full gates i mean i don't know any other way this guy this game this guy's getting single life i don't know what good night please help better for solid 20. he's broken why the heck is he double kick kick it kick it kick it kick it yes ah no that's the wrong button mate i'm probably gonna saw myself that wasn't the right button i was trying to fly okay well now the hello sucks at that range it actually recalls kind of a lot like if you throw three times on that like the g7 is actually the best gun ever wait did you kill the mirage i didn't know where the mirage was oh i guess that's the guy i could hear he probably self-raised oh well he i didn't i didn't doubt him i left him oh i couldn't find him oh he's underground did we first the lifeline i did okay right for 100 just got one clicked this guy's broken on me no he closes on me i oh the violence the speed and the momentum yeah yeah i'm just stealing the whole the doc's whole brand what next just joining straight on youtube.com you are the apex champion nice nice hemlock still sucks nah that meeting right like if they're a little bit too far you can't really do anything but
