hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and my apex games actually went a little bit better today they weren't easy by any stretch of the imagination this game was almost impossible to play by myself it takes me becoming the team medic whilst playing watson to get a victory four revives it took and i still didn't get any credit for it you know i felt underappreciated by the squad if i'm honest but it was a really good game i hope you guys enjoy it thank you for watching i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i have a turbo havoc i have a turbo havoc a flat line purple armor that's not the thing i was trying to do sorry i'm taking the mic donnie oh oh my god i'm absolutely looted recruited get me in the fight right now doing an extended energy apart from that target's right in front of me wait we have to fight there's already only 40 people left we just landed this thing with the limps at the moment especially when it's like the same shape every game people get bored with the same shape land in the same place i can't control this guy can't control my decoy because i'm silenced even though he's already out there new kill leader all right she got bamboozled well it's on the roof though did i get my kill i didn't there's still a revenant around here somewhere pretty far this team oh no one decoy look at him go that's the saddest thing you've ever seen carefully i don't know what to do i'm gonna try another team does he make left i mean i don't know why he's challenged that without me is the revenant team i think it is because the bow and arrow i remember you remember me man this place decoy it was my own decoy let's get here [Music] one bullet man this is ridiculous i have so much damage and i can't kill anyone what is this game god just casually robs my red armor i had red armor no kills this building sucks anyone lands here he's a psychopath i'm telling you listen i'm down i'm down to land here with a squad because they want to land here but i'm telling you then you know sucks oops i messed it up i've actually got a gun hey he's great i see you nice i'm not going to rob you stuff don't worry i thought this is b2020 can't lie to you right this one's better than mine wow stole both those skills this building is one of the best places on the game i think and if if anyone tells you otherwise i think you should lead us then actually i don't know saying that don't do dumpsters should we fire that i'm here we good that's funny hopping everywhere i'm stealing every kill i've done eight damage this game i've done eight let me express that no give me that no please why didn't it pick it up please i'm i'm begging i'm begging bulk come on you know that was mine come on hey valky you have betrayed me i cannot believe it just rubbing off my loot even though i pressed it first and he just didn't give it to me are they even using light yeah they are at least they can use it i don't have no lights i need lights i need lights down can you drop maybe i can if i can revive you get out of there teammate that's a good phase that's a very good phase i need light ammo i don't know i'm tempted to take it without an extendo mag cafe good grace man good grief i don't necessarily need too much i need to reload yeah let's third party i'd rather third party team than 3v3 someone makes way more sense they're all big scrapping he's got a pk i don't want to fight that always got to be careful this is a really bad fence but i've rushed it because i saw the wraith in front i thought was my teammate to begin with i hear a lot we'll do that just in case someone goes through there i think we just hope we let this hold this this is ridiculous there's so many teams here still there's a team here but it's gonna shine on the back if we do anything last one not a headshot oh huh no i'm trying my best here man why can't we just sit on the roof huh i don't understand why we can't just sit on the roof come on another big pylons too many people over there i'm sad a bone arrow and an l star two guns i'm terrible i've with a hemlock though i'll take this oh i'm dancing i'm dancing yeah let's just get in there there were some uh supply beans up top but whatever moments past nothing we can do gotta get involved give me that ammo that's fun in charge rifles from across the map oh nice i'm going in revived suey who who's scanning me i'm not really doing anything like i'm running around trying to help teammates but nice well she can't how many times she could they are absolutely raging they have never been angrier i feel kind of bad oh she's finishing her as well oh that's going on ready.com 100 i've done nothing that's what it feels like i've got two revives though right this gun doesn't have any fire [Music] you didn't kill me if i blew as well like it's unlucky for her you know he cracked him i knew they were respawning that guy got away i really shouldn't place those so close to the door i think i should place them further back it's okay let's not regen in my shield here in a sec so maybe i don't have to waste my last shield cell it's going to get rid of my node no and the door oh no it didn't what are we doing i didn't hear him can you open the door anyone passes through here we'll know i have to i was going to put fences down but i didn't want the timer to get too low need medkits how much shield is my all got left on it i don't think much oh nice oh my god i didn't mix it that was my fault that was my fault yeah i can't aim are you going okay get him shoot him oh okay what team can we get a victory can we get a victory royale here i need lights and maybe ultimate errands i don't think anyone's gonna be carrying enough to make sarah so i'm not going to even bother looking that's a lot of light of a fight do i have four revives this game i think i have four revives i'm just the team medic the team support i'm not gonna get it's not gonna he's not gonna give me a gun there's a gun here even though i'm the team eddie oh no he's been shot by a bomb pop is that a rampage i shot get in there just start launching stuff i don't know where they are just start launching stuff all right 83 83 big game three [Music] off the bat did we mess him up maybe i ran this way somewhere oh he didn't oh his team he's kind of rampage i haven't heard that all season i just i heard it once and he got it was like a gold one from uh i think it was from the rampart place apex champions i tell you what i didn't miss here in the rampage [Music] i'll play team i'll take my four revives not too bad but this guy just ranged quite instantly didn't even want to see the scores yeah do all the damage same kills for revive sounds about right you know sounds about right gg's done i'm happy with the win
