hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and unfortunately so much has been linked for season 13 so we know what's happening weeks in advance however i'm not sure what leagues to believe now i'm fairly certain that arthur allen is confirmed to be going into the replicator next season and that the mastiff is going to be in the care package and if you've watched any of my solo masters grind this split you would know how much i love these two weapons and with the other two guns that i love the vault and the g7 also in the care package i'm going to be useless in season 13. i'm going to be so bad what am i going to use a gun that takes actual skill terrible i have two games here for you today guys i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends are falling from the sky and landing near me well the good news is um they didn't come to my side donnie i was hoping they were gonna i gotta back it up round one count down my turn blue and purple we can fight this big scan one of the biggest ever that's what he loated friend so you're not coming back up i'm confused i need the arm switch are you swinging out this guy's fighting ghosts he's fighting demons there we go finally i felt absolutely useless in most engagement i really liked the 30 30. i it's one of my not one of my i was going to say it's one of my favorite guns to land on like it's it's good i mean it's not the alternator and it's not like a flat line from when that was groundless but it's solid it's actually a lot better oh there we go it's a lot better than you think and you don't use ammo really quick which is one of my favorite things about it i've already got one thank you come on are you telling me you can't make it all the way across wanting to be the scariest robe of all time you've got zero light rains i've got zero as well you have to steal these guys stuff after they got some lie rounds for you extended heavy mag here level two a little bit finger you can use it all right did you actually see it right here okay that sucks lesser well i know you haven't got your bracelet you can't have gone far oh my god this is not the best range for the either eight but i can't bother to i can't be able to reload the uh it's just the worst i don't i don't think that guy's going to come back and fight us so he should be okay you got that teammate there you go what played and we've got the lower ultimate too light ammo here healing they don't really need to ping that do you since there's a low bra right behind us you've got no i'm after this you might be as bad at losing as i am but if mine even i've remembered there's a low brother here sniper dual shell is very tempting i should have taken the jaw shell instead of the um instead of the sniper stock someone's been there there's boston fences and the other they are spotted the ship came from this way and they're all getting forced over here because of the safe zone so i sort of knew they were going to come this way hello look at this thing reloading we don't have a g7 but we have the 30 30. that's an impressive throw that is a very impressive throw look at that he's 83 damage that's to make it right the ash the ash maybe it did that's actually a really good nade i don't know where he delivering went recharging shields horizontally if these guys gonna half they are they're gonna actually let's go this way our teammate isn't with us ash is by himself them let's explore this way hey blood hands come back they're getting furthered that's lucky because this team probably wouldn't kill us i didn't realize the bloodhound wasn't wizard with us he should have pinged up nice there you go oh my god oh i'm dead yeah i'm a goner it's the fifth party took on with me i mean it's a big party just they're just coming like a power rangers movie just one at a time one squad at a time unfortunate man i'm not sure how long they're going to last here because it looks like there's a team coming in and i'm pretty sure my drum master was afk so rather than just floating down to the decks you might as well hop and have a good fight have a car three not a bad stars contact with target hey we're spread out a lot look at the map look at the map this is my rank setup well not the havoc the arthur one car or prowler pretty car can't believe i've said that but without the heavy mag i feel like the prowl is pretty tough oh my god they're gonna find out it's just me it's not just me i've got a bunch of the boys here a lot of the boys are around so please let three men rush me okay i shouldn't have used the author i want for that hostel right here so yeah thanks for the i am taking fire back to the purple get in there teammates here we go rescue mission i don't have time for a phoenix really there we go i didn't hear these guys at all i don't know how the pathfinder got on the roof i mean he probably grappled when i was getting chased by a crypto drone you know we're not close because when you're flying through the air from the pathfinder grappler you can't really hear it so it makes sense get the timer back in here so 30 people left that's actually not too bad i'll take it great is a blue up top i mean they've got to come this way so they'll probably see that blade surely hello is there we go or maybe maybe it's one team on the left and this is the team of the mad maggie that got respawned that charge rifle isn't annoying at all recharging shields contact i need help cracked an enemy shield he challenged that maybe he has no grappler imported away the team on the right doesn't seem too interested in us which is which is good i guess all right let's go this way if you can get behind the hill or you can just crawl this way that's fine i think you're okay i don't know what happened to the team i'm a little bit confused see if i had an ark star in a grenade i'd be laughing i really needed this guy i know he didn't have a golf game did you guys knock down muster a replicator fire friends reloading i hate when they get the bat off giving my shields a recharge can't let you die i think there are only two of them i think they came back for the banner it's hard tracking all these teams though you know where's the wraith show yourself that always works you shoot the damn guy they start screaming and they always they always peek in contact with enemies i'm risking it oh my god he's beating me yep that's my bad apologies don't die there we go nice whole squad's down we made the rage right okay i went from having a beautiful one clip i know it wasn't full health so missing all but two shots hello that's all i got the smg in the back pocket okay give my red back by the way i've got a lot of respect for sentinel users that gun is not easy to use i mean this going look at this this gun is i'm going to miss this gun an extra 42 oh flesh it's a florida man the proverbial florida man hello it's just you is there another one nice there we go should be i assume you got the gold knock down i think perfect good job team thank you for carrying two wins in a row you are the apex champions i might got like most kills whatever but i'm i'm not winning that game playing by myself you know so it's always a team effort it's always beautiful it's a lot time in the game not too bad that was nice
