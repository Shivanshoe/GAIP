hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing an underappreciated legend and that is rampant they buffed her shields and they buffed her sheila it was about eight different buffs they gave her in season 13 and yet i really don't see her that often one of my favorite things to do when you're playing rampart is to go into a building and fight in buildings because when people are trying to use doors as cover against a sheila it only ends one way but people don't know what to do they're in the building the door looks like cover but it absolutely isn't the first game that i've got for you today is with wraith but it doesn't last long trust me the second one is with rampart and i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends uh there is a team right behind us we are gonna have to get in here and sprint oh you are absolutely devastated that guy's uploading that clip to ready.com as we speak hello little mass he's got a shotgun he's one shot though oh he stopped protecting the revive too huge thank goodness we won that gunfight i'd have been absolutely raging we lost that i found life i have uh one spare heavy bullets switch the car to lights i don't really like the car is this my new setup alternated longbow oh i should have been there that helped drone this is a big mistake nice that's a huge scam from the teammate they're both like 10 help we are still alive here half the lobby's dead though all right lifeline revive she can afk revive the bluetooth heal us all up simultaneously it's an elite strategy if she was playing it would be an elite strategy uh as it turns out it appears though she has gone afk in a really bad spot in the middle of the stairs but if i was mean i could punch you down this hall but i think you'd be safe in this corner please health teammate he's got no timer left you didn't drop you've got like eight health mate what are you doing yeah leave the game you've got to go into your next game and do 12 damage unbelievable what kind of decision making is that this guy's got eight health left and instead of phasing down low he's he's stuck around please at least armor switch or something you can't go down again please heal back to that bangalore having to play with that right that's outrageous i've never seen anything like it i'll take the light mag i've crafted an r301 i've used the wingman so much recently  bolt h cog for the for the wingers needed two times oh my god turbulence are we good yeah i think r301 gold light mag i've got one too many med kits and if i find it two times three times we'll be good i've got a shotgun as well he's always nice and and he's disconnected and my lifeline is afk yeah they're all going to chase me my problem here is that if my teammate drops down trying to help me then that's all going to turn on him are they rushing him yet i need to be i need to be annoying here i need to shoot them in the back a little bit because they're just going to shoot the bloodhounds shoot a little bit then run that's the tactics this game sucks if i speak i am in in big trouble in big trouble and i don't want to be in big trouble please don't help me stuff thank you did you shoot this man at all is that guy on fire he's not going to change his angle i can't see your gosh i'm going to be honest with you actually if you spawned in with sheila that's all i need right now hello okay that means yeah i missed 100 thank you i'm once again asking for your assistance i'll never be more prepared for a gunfight i got about 60 health what the heck who's next huh what do you think was gonna happen i can't lie i love it and i hate it oh my word i've got hammer points nice these footsteps are up top what were they so loud imagine if the alternator had a hammer points available it would be the most broken thing of all time one of the top 10 biggest graphs of this particular game is happening over this way just over the hill and far away the big scrap okay the big scrap's over oh my god spider-man but they're pointing at each other yeah now they're rushing me hello why is this shielding vulnerable oh that was my shield i think that must have been my shield yeah i'll shoot my own shield all right that makes sense let's get high ground teammates if we don't sit up here and we third part of them from down low one of the last teams will sit up here instead and then we'll be on the ground like a couple of melons you know a couple of melons we've been running around for too long i actually don't mind getting involved in a gunfight here the guest scene up top this angle is not gonna work is it cover for you mates what am i doing [Music] sheila is completely busted she is so obnoxious that was 100 damage against that bangalore half a health just gone i can't zoom in i don't really want to see up here i'm gonna fire the last bullet and just leave it get that on cooldown i far prefer the mobile sheila than the tory chiller you have to sit there and reload it and stuff that's not it's not ideal well the good news is my high ground strategy would have been completely pointless because it is forcing everyone off the high ground so we lost nothing though for that gunfight because this team probably would have rotated to the high ground you know now we're just shooting down at them instead this is perfect they go is that them running off we need to be careful there's another team somewhere oh nice i just surrendered i couldn't be bothered to even try and shoot it because they were just so far away 54 damage a shot through the shield it's a four shot kill on purple armor through this rampart shield i'm getting my ultimate name too oh no you don't want to sit behind there trust me you got a devotion i can see through the wall there you go do the damage not not you as well come on sheila is completely busted no terrible terrible angles what are you doing guy no oh i feel bad i feel bad is there anything more fun than shooting through doors with sheila i'm not sure there is that is so that is why i waited up top until i have my ultimate back i knew that they'd just hide behind doors and then there's nothing they can do then like what's your defense in that situation there's no cover let's get shot up 200 damage just like that don't rage quit before you see the stats add one more kill and 1100 more damage lifeline with the three revives i mean this is a solid team though that was some good teamwork i'm happy to win i'll tell you what ramparts got it busted i know i say that i bet everyone but come on kind of kind of broken ggs
