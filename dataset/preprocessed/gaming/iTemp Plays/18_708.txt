the funniest games that I've had on apex legends one thing that I've realized though is that when you're sitting in a team of three it puts you against so many other teams of three and this is definitely the way it should be otherwise it'd be way too big of an advantage but this means that the games get crazy I have two here for you today and my word in the first one is scrapped of city living book to its name it's an absolute mess every time we learn there because people just love scrap it off it's unreal but I'm enjoying playing with Jencks and so far the channel links will be in
