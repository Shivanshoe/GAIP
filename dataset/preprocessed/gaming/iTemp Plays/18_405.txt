hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the game that i have for you today is typical of my favorite games that i have on apex legends you're playing trios with a friend and there is so much late game action that you can split off and have your own little battles with separate teams and then meet up afterwards it's a great game and i'm sure you're going to enjoy it and if you guys are interested i started the titanfall 2 let's play and i also uploaded a card video earlier today on my other channel so be sure to check that out there is a link in the description so thanks for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos um any people um that my ultimate my ability to pick up anything uh they're all over here oh okay i'm gonna get a better gun i'm gonna come over wait there's a team on me oh is there really they light land dudes oh they landed really um coming back all i have is a pkn mozambique yeah doing 176 damage with the pk and uh just yeah taking all the damage is usually the way that's the vibe right yeah that's one of the vipes it is one um you're struggling giving my shield to recharge i don't have any money so i've streamed you to need it i have i have eight i need a shotgun one sec i have a massive enough shotgun vault yeah i got a pk no oh no shotgun boat it's probably a good idea probably they stop topping here they are where's this audio i missed a lot i'm back i don't know if you do some damage let's go on the top on me i have nods right these i don't know where she went huh i'm in need of some light rains but apart from that i'm good um i have a 196 extra i have 22 but i've got a flat line okay yeah i would like to drop the spk as soon as possible uh we came from the south west so i guess that's the way we run on my way inside the ring i don't have any bats but whatever i'm running i'm i'm i'm still confused as to why we all right over here uh as to why we get uh like white armor helmet shields but no backpack oh no i feel like it was an oversight hopefully they changed that recharging shields oh i wasn't expecting the fly i got red destroyed wow you see me land three and you're ready three countries like that and you're really gonna ruin my vibe i would have had one kill and 577 damage that is not okay i am ending that man's life instantly get your old yes why just asking just wondering yeah yeah i'm just looking for some light i remember i killed these people ah forget it i'll just use my flatline all right where'd you want to go oh you're not valkyrie i thought you were valkyrie i mean yeah we've been still going valkyrie for like two hours big value i'm kind of disappointed when one of us is in valkyrie yeah hello it's so good just for like putting the time between finding people we're gonna have to make it a point for one of us to always be valkyrie yeah one person plays him for an hour then i'll play for him an hour really good though so yeah i haven't really played her much i need to play her more she's fun i don't know why you don't like that much i don't know because i mean everyone kind of everyone uses it you know yeah and i've always just been a fail so like whenever whenever people like using a specific legend or character then i'm always using other ones you're always on mirage tv yeah that's how i was in like uh like overwatch too like everybody loved uh everybody loved like a tracer and genji dps like people love dps yes so i never never played dps like ever tracer and genji i don't know if you playing on console sounds horrendous on console yeah yeah i mean i i played on console my whole life until six months ago seven months ago i would be the big monkey if i was on a wash on console give me a legend but you can't you don't have to however go from the rope i was kind of i was kind of crazy with the winston that got 33. i think it was there i can't remember the numbers like this the other day because it's one for 35 then 32 and i was like him for 77 oh yeah that's math that's one of the maths that's what they teach you yeah oh they're right here oh i can't climb that i can't see anything they're dropping a replicator this team is just running reloading oh i'm bad oh he wants it to steal this game has been under oh there we go only 50. i'll take it i guess recharging shields horrendous wait where's the tudor always you have to you have to pick it up afterwards oh he's someone up here recharging shield on the back arena nice i'm telling you my brain is not working today when you've only eaten once in the past two days your brain just not doesn't function properly apparently no it's fine i don't know if you know this you're transitioning to a 5g tower that's why oh your internet's gonna be crap though helmet here level four extended light mag here level three 45 seconds oh this guy just got rid of the two to four time wow disappointed tits for when i used it last time disappeared so oh really yeah that sucks i love the two to four times on the triple that's pretty good there's probably a reasonable explanation for it knowing my looting abilities but then i like to find it there's a lot going on the last thing we're worried about yeah which doesn't make sense ten but the ring is fairly close um oh valkord's in the distance uh 15 they're going this way target over there no they're not oh they're split enough they're splitting they're doing a kill right okay nice play nice play they're in the kill racing and they landed at refinery they're going for world record never know sometimes the finale goes crazy honestly sometimes it just got my ultimate i'm dead i am i'm pretty much dead there's a lifeline here not reviving their teammate unless that's not you guys oh this is not the smartest play i'm getting 100 dead i might be dead too there's a team just sniping over here whole team are you okay so i i should be okay from this team yeah i'm good for now hey check out that replicator reloading down give me a second i'll be there oh yeah at scene on a rope is no no no no no no no no that's a mistake me amigo what's up the balloon tried to help but i went too far you good yeah i'm good i'm good there is okay the snipers i need a scope for my teeny oh this is really bad how is that all missing oh my god hello i can see why they were sniping although to be honest with you if i was in a gunfight myself i would have said the same thing i'm hit firing the flatline doing about three damage per second you're not watching enough of my videos rich come on i was trying i was trying oh nice that's fun
