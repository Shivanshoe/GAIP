hey what's up guys it's fish welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and this video is going to be some gameplay here on pc so you can increase the quality up to 1440p to make it a little bit more crisp in fact it's not a little bit more crisp it should be a lot crispier than usual and the reason i'm playing on pc is because i am going to be streaming this game apex legends when season six comes out not immediately but it will be on the same day i just think it'll be a little bit later on in the day and the two people that i'm going to be playing with are pc players so i'm trying to warm up because if you didn't know the aim assist is different on pc compared to console it's uh it's weaker the frames are different the general feel is different so i'm trying to warm up so i don't completely embarrass myself and we got off to a good start because i think in the first five games that i played here with so far i think i had one kill in those five games so if that happens on stream i might just retire well we'll have to wait and see yes i'll be streaming it on this youtube channel on this one that you want right now uh when it comes out a little bit later on in the day i've already said that so be on the lookout please i'd love to see you guys there so yeah thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends no i for a little bit i was going to do like battlefield stuff because that was my my longest series like the battlefields brought to max rank uh i had like 120 episodes they're like 20 to 40 minutes yeah holy that's a lot it's fun baffled so fun no skull based nice yeah i love the love the lag double wingman if you fancy one robbing nades somewhere what low ground i think yeah oh behind too i call you wow looks like that was the last one on the squad it was low ground i swear someone was i heard footsteps there maybe not most because you're looking that way i think because forward and backwards audio is so body difficult here because you've only got like a left and a right yeah i mean does that make sense yeah yeah no no i know what you mean i don't mean i yeah i try not i try not to get mad at audio because i i i could see how hard it can be yeah to get audio correct from like a it's like a depth standpoint like doing like yeah front and back audio is sucked like would be impossible i think you'd have to add like echoes or something i don't know yeah i think honestly for the amount just like the sheer amount of work that they had to put into like the the audio working i think fortnite did a really good job yeah they did uh but they their up and down audio is still like did they ever fix that i don't know i don't know it's been years since i played i remember it was kind of weird but just the uh the amount of like because the there's so much building and so many angles that people can be at yeah like getting getting that audio right is pretty insane yeah it is i think did they didn't they do something where if they're on your level they sound different but yeah they have different uh different pitches yeah they're weird i don't know different echoes they weren't on your level though like you couldn't tell if they're above all blow yeah and i think they had a certain certain um certain uh like textures are certain things that they would walk over would have completely different sounds yeah there we go i'm kind of loose you know yeah i mean i have hemlock uh hemlock mastiff i don't know why i'm using this this isn't gonna work oh someone's on here there's one on the uh on the zip line the octane was down his friend go uh he was over here somewhere i know where he went though i don't know where this other dude i think he's trying to be sneaky yeah he probably looks like is been hitting the range i have been here in the range thanks bangalore did you turn voice chat off on this as well no i actually have it on so it's kind of it's kind of funny hearing everything because i'm not used to it give me a second recharging what many dust particles around this area i think i spot someone it's just like a dandelion seed or something it looks like we're camping banner a lot but i'm not trying to oh yeah he's right there oh yeah i'm counting banner big time oh bless him that's so exciting oh yeah i'm camping banner big time what have you here that it is very mad yeah i would also be big mad oh yeah i'd be screaming i'd be punching my monitor right now if that was that was me that much but that that's literally been me all day so yeah they can they can manage one game oh honest okay i'm going i'm giving my shields a recharge you're pushing i'm not with you i'll try and hold them back a little bit that one one's nearly cracked on me i need to stop ads in close range but i'm telling you i do not trust myself at all with hip fire i just don't good work taking out the chat i think you just you just gotta you gotta learn to trust yourself oh that's difficult i have six maps if you need anything um i have zero v1 thank you how much you need change heavy 55. um hold on i think there's some in here actually yeah i'm good i'm getting chilling i am kitted i just need a uh school pizza and a gold helmet i'll get you some how many bats you have now i have two okay i'm giving you some now i have six oh we switched places if you give me two we have four each all right easy math oh i think that's lifeline oh yeah they're in a terrible spot oh you're on your own i've been trippled i just got so many no regs on this let me try on the back cracked run i'm good i'm good thank god for bengal speed boost i have my old still so we can just giving my shields yeah i'm chilling i'm sure oh i'm going to take a bear i guess maybe they'll shoot to something i don't know oh i think they're getting third party now i can go back up oh yeah that'll do might be bait so be careful oh my god it could be anyone close yeah he's close right on right on the edge i shot him pushing nice job nice good stuff good stuff another team i have to make yep two seconds one okay good i just got started oh my god good stuff oh okay i got stuck that was oh [ __ ] post one there was nothing worse than you just sitting there waiting for the explosion yeah and i i survived it too but there was literally like a little like my arm was poking out i guess he shot me all right i gotta get some ammo what do you need this oh we've got so much loot here as well yeah yeah it should be good here any sculpt knows he's in a scorpio sir i think i've landed god all this started because they called in a life like like 45 teams out there it's been a fun game crazy yeah this is a good one gotta clutch up so i mean like honestly i'm so bad at the start but you can still have a fun mid and end game yeah that's that's the thing about apex though is like i i i want more consistency yeah do you go this way all right i'm chilling yeah i wanna think because the game when there's a lot of fighting it's so much fun i mean yeah i feel like it's so much fun and it's so entertaining from like a viewer's standpoint it's so entertaining one of the best games to watch i think when it's gone yeah especially yeah when there's so many crazy fights it's so cool to watch definitely but there's like 10 plus minutes of just running around in games yeah yeah kind of kind of kills the suspense when i'm streaming i hope there's a lot of running around less action than possible the better it's no all right i'm with you i think we'll find something else on my left yeah yeah be careful oh i hit him he's one good job what happened left and i don't have a skull piercer yeah i haven't seen one gold box at all so one that guy had a goal knocked down no go back wait oh yeah i have gold back too what the heck last team i'm holding high ground i don't care yeah same i'm not going to move i'm going to hide in a corner i'm going to nod i'm gonna check that package real quick are you good nice i only see one guy no two stephanie two uh peacekeeper i'm gonna pick it up what say yeah six i'll give you more learn the bins for some more shield cells after i collect them i'm gonna go on left a little bit just to make sure he doesn't take this yeah yeah he's played this is a waste of everyone's time 47 let's go that's a victory nice okay so we're both playing the same game oh yeah they're going down they're gonna live the low ground over here i'm gonna cut them off though they're going towards you a little bit they're trying to climb up oh my god one's right on me i didn't see this no i didn't see him i couldn't see him you're good you're good i'm chilling i'm still i'm still coming hold higher on hold high ground they're going towards you one on me look at me funny break this broken really nice nice [Music] almost there one of mine is teammates which is great can i spring and slide literally where did
