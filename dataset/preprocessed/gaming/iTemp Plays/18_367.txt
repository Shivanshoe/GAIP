hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some more ranked mode both of the games that i have for you today are in platinum the first i was in gold but both my teammates were flat and the second game i was playing some solo ranked to try and catch up with so far who is in diamonds now for the first time ever i believe it's a big accomplishment for him i'm immensely proud of the guy the two games today contrast just how different solo and three sack experiences are in apex i think apex is actually one of the few games that i can think of where you can literally get full-on carried to the highest rank by barely doing anything at all all you've got to do is stay close to teammates and hit enemies with one shot for some kp and you can still make masters with the right teammates solo however is where the fun is in these ranks and these middle ranks like gold and platinum in my opinion you've got to muster up some team coordination with people you've never played with before and try and secure the win against the odds both are fun though and i hope you enjoy the games today thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends really close to diamond so will we still be able to play i don't know honestly i have to go grind by myself i can get to plat by myself and then we'll just rejoin i mean i can just leave a lot of rpgs on me oh let me get let me get a good god i'm no gun in my building no gun in my building full three come towards me i'm running towards rich i have a massive with no bolt oh my god oh that's not you oh i ran forward there was a three on me as well i think that was just two of them landed up top they're already above me so thanks to the race by the way thank you so far for killing everybody and saving me yeah listen when i was up there they were beaming when you got there that reverend was just looking at you like i don't know what was going on what do you what did you say yeah your lobbies are so easy oh man i still have a spitfire oh no no no just disregard disregard too late too late i already eated this gun we saw the pole i got nervous okay i thought it was a shadow of the unit good old pulge bait careful there's someone below me too because it cracked nearly you know i'm like [Music] at the last second oh my god there's a guy over here flying in over there all right i need to drop this thank you what is this thank you what team they're going to pick this angle on me this angle on me uh i'm watching them now they back down they back up everything i have no med kits um neither do i okay i'll chill on my head no or maybe three bro might be three one oh my goodness is i don't know i see everyone tap shaking nowadays i feel like it's not as impressive as it is as it used to be no oh that was kind of crackhead though yeah that looked insane and but then i turned the corner and he's just crab walking and doesn't shoot his gun no no no that wasn't that was a different octane ah they're all oh i can start face just chill everyone chill no i don't know i'm 140. i'm good mate i'm holding square oh all right then thank you though you you go fire at them [Music] i deserve the the revive you know come on battery i [Music] just him just him he's got a cold armor some idiot there to the door so i couldn't see are you good there am i though thank you exciting watch this switch the gold to syringe just to drop it yeah but then look at your hell you got like this tiniest i'll leave uh 45 seconds but we could just walk it thank god i stopped the phoenix i'm on the way there it actually popped to phoenix yeah i actually popped a phoenix for a sliver of hp i saw a replacement i saw a replacement i only had one syringe left you know i think it's just two on this team yeah i see two guys running away on me hold on [Music] [Music] yeah she's running away other guys run away at the horizon horizon cracks nice shots let's go fellas don't let her go in on the right side going down the hill here i think i think you're right i think oh yeah she's in here let's move this way yeah no they stole it they're pulling the beams i'm yes but what he does have is a lot of thermite grenades what is this [Laughter] spinning circle on the treaty all right we've got another team coming here i don't know if they're gonna have to make it at the top never mind nor am i teammates i do not have a gun i'm pretty sure i just got melee whilst about 15 feet in the air i'd love to see a replay of that this is why we need a replay feature on this game i'd go back just to see that but i can't it makes me sad yes uh i may need a better gun no i really wanted that fault so i guess i've got a reloading i guess i've got a purple mag so the alternator is just fine as well that's okay good job team i did 25 damage and the team's gone there's another bin here but whatever i'll just come over a different team or what recharging shield contact why are you shooting me for this mess just headshot me can't catch a break uh it looks like your teammates have left you uh would you like a phoenix i've got one for grabs phoenix kid here he does you see that one i'd say he does all right where's this guy's teammates hey they're both r99 in me from i think three miles away i need to get one of these downs or i'm gonna start screaming i need to do something in this game i am tempted to use a finisher i don't think his teammate's near him i can't arm switch to white that'd be pointless you guys are fine right just one guy all right well at least i got two kills there thank you baby that's okay you can repay me if you find any heavy and then we are even i've got 21 spare i do not feel good about it making contact with enemy yes it i'm a is there we go double tomorrow brady multiple reloading charging reloading i got to start self-rating you got that first on your teammate you got that first on your teammate yeah he did everybody's trying to join my kill there for a second no 100 heavy right before my eyes this guy needs 60 i mean that's okay that guy's alive that wraith one moment a hundred heavy just disappeared there's my kill as well i mean if he's using heavy and he needs to i mean i've been struggling too so he could drop me if he could have dropped me 20 though i need heavy ammo good grief i've got the wall supply of med kits and this guy to speed five there's no way he didn't have any heavy i don't believe it octane i grappled him i've got your back obtains one i've just got i've got to make a stand here i can't even grapple oh god how on earth are my life oh my god i have no idea how i survived that i didn't realize that i was going to be on the left but i saw the octane small healing i don't know why to do something i know i was the one that had to i mean i've got some heavy now this is great i know i have to be the one to take some some fire you know great the ring is closed less than a minute and they're scrapping this way but we also have to go this way sort of have to fight our way out the central turbine here i thought this guy saw us and i'm pretty sure he was actually looking either way so uh yeah a bit of a wasted opportunity there with the old stealth maneuvers apologies it's probably my fault it's probably my fault it never come my way crack two of them but it's a different team got this team in this team it's wrapping yeah the short my kill that's absolutely fine don't worry about it 162 don't worry about it without the grapple he's got a speed fire okay new teammates the good news is i've got three med kits zero energy been struggling with that the entire time are these guys still here perhaps reviving no i think they run off all right i've got you guys don't worry about it i might need some ammo 120. are you listening well there's no i was going to say sorry i have to taste energy but there are no energy guns here for the squad anyway any scraps not bad speed fire spitfire extended heavy mag i'm gonna win something on the lottery it's only blue one of these for you england though level two is that big scrapping they're not the final two uh final two teams yet it's fine heavy ammo here but i have to just rush over just yet i've got a crafter here heavy a heavy mag okay i can craft a heavy mag for that guy's wingman spitfire package i've got a heavy lag for your wingman no that's not the bun there you go he's run off level three and he's not coming back okay i think he's trying to third party to get kills so he can steal their loot it does make a lot of sense cracked one there you go i don't have any heat shields i'm afraid all right at least one of our teammates is looted there's a guy over this way as well this could be the last two of these the last two teams blue shields cracked we're in a terrible position though that's an awful idea even if i could make it across there it's the world's most dangerous soup plane i mean just go this way good idea there we go they're getting third party that's what we're waiting for we need to get involved once our octane is actually not heading towards the fight obtains not with us but these guys are still shooting each other and there's no one up top so there we go i think we try and hold this top position until these guys start firing again this is not a crater because i'm pretty sure he shot me right in the face sticking off it's never gonna work i have so much health thank goodness he's using in auto that's first mode i'm pretty sure i die heading also oh gg gg [Music] bit of a struggle what on earth is this movement lacked a lot of lacks a lot of ammunition you are there but we got the job done good job octane good job that's not easy you just need a little bit of teammate coordination and you can get the job done solo just fine there you go not bad at all
