hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing crypto who got a decent buff in season 12 here the most notable of which is now you can sort of throw his drone in the middle of battle you don't have to do the animation of putting your gun away and open up the drone uh controller and you're out of the fight you can throw it it can see in the corner for you if it hits a wall it will automatically turn around so you can throw it in the corner of a room not worry about it and it will act as a scan or wash your back for you and then of course you can use the ultimate straight from there too he's really fun to play and it's great for variety's sake but i'm getting emp all day every day i don't know about you guys but there are so many cryptos running around but i can't complain makes a change i guess so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends have your pk i got landed on please keep your weapon located shooting at me are you down low i'm coming yeah i went down there it's school time lights that is a lot of thermites it's a lot of thermites evil shield here number two i just need to find the kinetic and i am good to go do you need an energy mate uh i don't i have alternative they're reviving the road that was the last of the squad it's hard to survive along i got your teammate cool you're on the murder buzz huh how dare you every pk shot i do massively superior watching you i actually i would agree i think the massive is the better shotgun mastiff is clear okay no i haven't tried the kinetic though you know that could be a game changer because what does the mastiff have you know you've reloaded quickly but the connection make it here you don't really need to reload at all you kind of just slide around this is not flying everywhere thank you okay my loadout kind of sucks oh i just want a purple ball nice you want an r9 99 that's what i'm using i got a bruiser on the alternator yeah i can't believe they nerfed the r9 of all guns yeah a little surprised why would they i don't know why they would try to nerf smgs because the smg's like in the last couple of seasons haven't kept up no they really haven't no flat line he's like do it all after one do it all you know yup actually is this a wingman they just velcaulted away oh my god loki dude real quick i'm putting a mag in the crafter there was a team here enemy spotted over there three other squads are close three squads are closed hmm i don't know where i'm closing brings closing and we ain't here i see one at least let me pull the trigger handbag i don't have a scythe for my hemlock but i'm gonna give it a go i give you one here take this take this take this thank you come on i can emp them they were running this way when i saw them maybe they had this compound signaling my drone back they are they had to have ran this way i think they did yeah getting my eyes in the sky patching [Applause] dude i played that so stupid i thought the bloodhound was dead oh of course this way i'm running away i don't want hold on charging healing up thought about amber jay getting his back being attacked by another squad they got 32 i guess it was that long to find someone and now we're fighting the place i've never fought before against everybody people yeah they're responding behind two freaking right we can't leave this with haunted area left and right cracked an enemy shield he cracked a shield but we can't even push off that firing someone destroyed my drone i'm popping all this acceleration reloading oh i'm out of heavy i need heavy ammo another squad is attacking us richard on the right side that's correct she's really weak i don't know that's why i wasn't like worried about committing too hard because the other thing was literally in that building need more juice yeah i'm confused because it's all in there too two times in here if you need it by the way i'm good thank you i need bats perfect two actually i took one all good nice hold on brother there's no way is the kinetic in the game i haven't seen it i honestly i don't think i've seen it all season oh there we go they gave us enough time to lose that was nice man that was nice we are in the zone though you're gonna die now if you've always seen my i hear the wraith running right it sounds like i got the low ball really weak nice job scrambled that maggie's around for good i thought they'd come from that way they're gonna sit on the thing again look it here oh my god [Music] can we not just walk up this way why did he make that away i don't know what i'm weak i'm down yeah the drone is great i mean we can see yeah in front of us oh i can't get his man with my drone they destroyed it grenade out grenade out all right i'm gonna walk out and take a level a little dandruff ripping through carefully this team passes they're getting red pushed they're getting red pushed i don't know if you've got the no we don't have to know we don't have to know you're going to mess them up they're kind of the best ever i see one of them be prepared under fire yeah i put one teammate okay maybe not here and i'm looking straight up this way shields recharging first blood deer one of them's right here anything this guy good news is i've got light as well so i can just switch to it it's a good thing about the car you know i do i do this the car a lot but early game it's so versatile hold on sober to charging all right what's your challenges together yeah got one of them here putting an eye in the sky throw my grenade out hold up over there right up top grenade i'm down teammate i'm coming fire [Music] get him out of here reload killed one that's one step closer shields recharging i'm recalling my drone well that's healing playing crypto charging it makes me feel like i'm playing a mini game at the same time so i'm trying to think where my drone is i'm trying to i don't know do you know what i mean like three things going on at once sorry though i'd rather have the mastiff but but it's still good you know it's still good give me a second some live i've got a rampage i've got a massive with nobody if anyone sees one please let me know extended heavy meg here number two energy animal here i am pretty surprised we survived that need to hop up hammer point any time our points all right i'll stamp for you is it just me or pick me up are you guys finding like zero batteries this season i feel like i've never got batteries i'd have to craft them no it's unfortunate oh they made it why is there so many different guns and stuff in here now i guess i did need a medkit that's actually fine they're here i heard one of them i'll go like this pop it here and then i can hold logged off my drone my ultimate's charged and ready yes neither we pick me up activating emp you shot so bad so i'm gonna go back goodness knows what this last guy is is this hammer points yeah right here got one taking fire level four okay what bag do you have this is ludicrous why have i got nothing hold on i have six baths i guess that's not nothing that was such a satisfying ultimate if you pop your crypto drone in the middle there i guess i need a shotgun it covers the entire charge tower and i saw and have this rocker and that makes me real sad i'd very much enjoy having one no i thought that was one scammed what the heck this come from a different dimension what's he's doing here light ammo here another we pick me up you sooner i think she's trying to just draw people in hey my teammates that actually cracked you can kind of tell from the start i should have taken the rope got one right here my teammate thinks there's some behind this but it's not chocolate switching to drone view watch my background my drone has been destroyed enemy here two times [Applause] reloading okay there's two actually replicated in orbit reloading the squads here arm switching i think yeah we found you the good team in the lobby good grief they were kind of popping off i've still only got level one shot involved there we go all three of those guys are next to each other altered i got rid of the watson fences and did 150 damage with the ultimate i did kind of mess up though i should have if you if you tap and hold the button it automatically puts you in the drone at the start you don't have to do another animation we're almost there oh look level three shotgun ball these guys that team probably thinks we're three seconds we're absolutely not i'm just playing by myself these guys are just apparently the grace ever you know yeah under 30 seconds almost at the ring hold on i've got an idea i'm gonna test it press and hold there you go you see that once caught in the area we have to drop backing out of my drone i'm good to go one squadron in the area signaling my drone back which i get high ground on them it's not crazy high ground but real i think we could all use a i'll get in there i they're not going to see me right they're not going to see me but there's a stupid box in the way nice t nice gg well played i didn't get the killcore at the end but i did crack a few of them i was looking so sad i'm so sorry what was it looking something by the apex champions that was fun i had three great ultimates there like just doing big damage hitting all three enemies all three members of the enemy team nice good job that was a lot of fun
