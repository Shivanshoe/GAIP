hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some arena and i also have a regular battle royale game here for you as well so there's something for everyone in this particular video now in the arena game we got matched up against three really good players multiple masses badges 20 kill and 4k badges you guys know the type and we demoralized them so much that one of them actually gave up and started grenading himself mid-range i'm not 100 sure that they were a three stack because so front and i were only a duo i'm not completely sure on how the matchmaking works but there were still three really good players who were looking real confident in the first round but that quickly changed let me know if you guys want some more arrhenius content if you don't enjoy arenas there is a regular vr game after as well for you to enjoy as usual so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends this last last game right yeah yeah mine's better though i haven't got my drumstick it's on this game you can't get a bat if you buy the wingman huh yeah alternates better they're full sending this uh it's cause he bought a pk so he had to cut the distance with his um football it makes sense i respect him i like it no i don't absolutely not okay no i hate that what are you doing man come on stop playing the game yeah whoa man i did a friendly tea bag and she swiped me with a stabby knife i got you back stabbed here in game yes gibby might do the same thing he's trying yeah rice on this low side i'll mate nice you're going crazy that's all you've got you're going crazy with the headshots these guys have never seen anything like it looking after buy a gold bag of around who wants to be throwing nades there too here uh do not go right side um i mean it's it's match point yeah but they're a good team still that's that's still a good thing i want to beat him and we will yeah don't you worry i am sorry i literally triple headshot that give me 65 each that's insane i can't wait to go on 10. what is that like giving up yeah i think so they're here race cracks headshot what shot hr again she's really weak attract double headshot yes i'm actually cheating give me just gave up what happened this dude is trying harder than anyone in the beginning hey yeah yeah i can't deal with this wingman man they went from on like uh 10 000 to just zero zero mate demoralized that's what that's the our temperature on wingman guarantee does you know uh-huh another team here [Music] you okay yes what happened to you i uh i i landed on a diva this wraith ran towards the devo i got the devo first she punched me off onto the rope and then i grappled back up the rope and then she stuck me and then i chased her while i was stuck just to like a downer with her own stick i don't know how he didn't kill me though that's a tactic what are you using now do you have any chevy either wing yes hold on here an extra 40 there too uh actually that's all you though that's okay i run away i've got a wingman i should be fine say seven bullets shotgun bolt here level three there's a gold mag in there that box oh he's not of course i get hit by that nade you can't make this up i think she's below us on ground floor i like i i'm literally just taking damage that's all i'm doing i swear to usually made it just that i swear like i'll rock a place and i'll be the [ __ ] heat that's unreal would hand in here somewhere call stick as well okay this is just terrible times remain let's keep winning another squad is attacking us we just eliminated the whole squad any energy attachments anywhere for any reason i haven't seen any sorry young bad last one yeah i don't really do that much damage i've barely taken any damage this game and you've just been here on the entire time i've literally killed oops more than anyone probably in the server it's crazy oh definitely 100. uh i have 169 spare uh i'll just switch to something else there's a gold heavy mag just need energy how much you got um i have 120 extra i'm chilling yeah you got entertainment that's fine i mean i'll be fine what is this audio i'm so confused i know where they are trying to think at the same time you're shooting minnie's cracked so well someone's all frozen i think you're oh really no is the corset um i do not know these bowels are still here they disappear right i think so yeah he's down here don't worry down here that's all you i might need to help it sporty no no no no i do i do i do i do he was self and he had a knight there it's those blocks i played i had to move because he threw a nade there and then he had his traps oh my god oh my god that's oh the lamppost man i watch your video on the tips and tricks and i play crouch on toggle yeah you're just throwing here you're playing crouch on toggle you're still dealing with your thumb you play with one paddle as shown as you go um how many what's your killer damage ratio um how many people have you thirsted 240 damage to kill 250. i was actually way easier than i thought it was i did it the wrong way you're you're you're a mathematician you should be able to do this up with ease right yeah that was really easy but i don't know why i've made it complicated so when you go to like winning hop do you just press jump crouch and you just let go of it jump crash jump crouch um i hold crouch and then i just tap jump well you you hold crouch i'm holding crouch right now if i hold crouch this is what mine does like i'll hold him here i'll just there's no crouch after it doesn't recognize that there's one important i guess you're uh yeah because you're on your own toggle right yeah yeah it's a little let's go everything kind of works a little differently toggle yeah it kind of like that first input and that's it i think this is like the only real way to bunny up i think you have to be on toggle or on hold i mean i can do on time for but not that easy on this yeah you have to be on hold yes we just look safe yeah right here let's explore this way just a valve why people so hard to hit when you're like this far above them i don't get it man they're trying to be disrespectful i don't like it i can't hit let's see it's like this way oh he's gone i thought they're gonna land on me so i got scared i'm fine yeah you're right are you struggling in the health department i know i'm just kind of running around this is your game i'm not doing anything i'm not going to do anything now either after that i'll tell ya get missing this is just one or two oh my god what hand swan that is he's right 120 130ish are you punching uh he's like 180 he's probably 40 hp got an arm shield oh scary yeah my trolling never goes as planned i turn around i can only hear one gun going off you are the apex champions i use the wingman way too much nowadays yeah you've been using it a lot now you've been popping off with it it's nice i like it
