hey what's up guys it's fridge welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have some more early footage once again of apex legends season 9 or legacy as it's being called today i am focusing on the new legend valkyrie i'm sure you guys have seen footage of her by now but these are going to be my first impressions on the new legend and also the beaucheck bow i'll show you a battle royale game first and then i will talk over an arena mode game where i'll use the new legend and the new weapon with my thoughts so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends this might be a good place not a bad drop this thing is so useful at the start of the game okay to see where people are headed i don't think we got anyone coming this way look at the mini map dude it's doing like this little radar thing you can scan this area just to let you know that it's scanning everyone oh hello we good i got the mastiff they're gonna be the guns i don't think there's any anyone around so we should be fine just getting lips that must be two separate teams that i somehow missed i saw you going for that purple armor i can get rockets in the window like how horizontal is this not very is the answer listen you've got there's a first time for everything you've got to test effect that's why i'm here i have a variable scope on my massive nice i've used the scout quite a lot today and it feels the exact same as it always does i'm trying to like as i'm playing i'm trying to think if there any there are any differences with the legends or if there's any differences with the map or the all right so it doesn't do the radar scan if you just fly a bait it's not if you're airborne i think it must be if you're like in three four that sucks but it's nice if you if you're solo with no shields you may as well go and play a new game get into a new lobby get some teammates and try again because you are just in struggle time just roaming the map with nothing extended there was one in that box if he checked it you'll get a level one i'm struggling on light need a shotgun bolt what are you offering me marvin shotgun bolt shield i'll take it that's not bad three bats okay i've got the world supply of shield cells as usual the rings need light ammo they don't need any chill cells i'm just gonna leave him on the floor they're all coming this way so they'll see him here i'm in desperate need of small teammates i am very close to my ultimate do you guys want to zoom you guys feel like zooming he knows what's happening there he comes how how does he send you does he he's like we've got a balloon on the right to see what we're higher than that balloon it's actually such a good rotation tool and if anyone was here i'd be able to see them with my with my passive as well my little scan so if there was someone to shoot we could just land uh basically on top of them would be the strategy that i would employ gonna revive big red teammates they're time and ability the ability doesn't do the most amount of damage ever but it does have like an extra stunning effect so it should make finer people a little bit easier as well they're fine team mess them up this guy's won actually made that really comfortably oh this isn't good i guess i have a way up top that's the thing with horizon the horizon managed to get her crypto teammate up top but i can't unless i've got my ultimate that wasn't going to work out all right i'll come back for you teammates quick get our teammate spanner these guys are in a fight if i can make it to this rope and get across grab the banner we can give him another shot never mind change of plan i could just be one guy but i don't want to risk it here all right i'll get the banners and i fly after safety oh trying to collect the wrong banner there are so many so many valkyries are based all right quick phrase i mean come back good thing here is that the crypto and the horizon have boxes that are on the way to where we're going to go please third party i don't run too far just in case someone flanks us i'll try and protect him a little bit all right team this is the mission we've gotta hoover up a box each and we've gotta get involved in the big scrap it's a two-step plan there's ammo in there you don't need light on the r9 you're good there's been a fight here for the last three decades i missed i'm missing yes teammates got escaped too all right nice tap strafe two octanes just walking around together what's going on down here didn't i can't see i can't see what's going on in here oh the octane came back mercedes friend scammed no i gotta sell friends but sorry dad no family reunion yet i got a match to win i mean i have to pop if they hear the shield back they'll come kill me but if i seen the bike ship with no shields i'm dead anyway are they gonna start shooting each other an absolute tragedy a modern day tragedy not bad though fourth place we got focused by everyone pretty much not sure what this team how is this team still alive that's my question they're all doing pretty good like i don't i had them on the ropes so that was my best game of battle royale at the capture event i didn't get the chance to play too many unfortunately as the lobbies take a long time to fill up where there are only 70 to 80 people playing on the eu server i did get some valkyrie footage in the background in arena mode it was a pretty relaxing 2v2 game and i was testing the bow check bow out as well you'll see uh in the game but i do kind of struggle with the bow check it's an incredibly fun gun to use with a high risk reward factor so i'm getting that practice in early now my thoughts on valkyrie are that she is probably a middle of the packed legend in terms of effectiveness her rocket ability could have easily been overpowered it's definitely intimidating when you're in a gunfight and you see loads of rockets come toward you but this gun isn't too obnoxious the damage is fair for an ability it's just a well-balanced bit of kit ultimate he's really cool i think she may have a chance in competitive play because of how valuable rotational legends are in the pro scene in public games it's also great to get into your next fight a lot quicker and paired with her passive of scanning the skies it removes the guesswork of where the next scrap is happening you just go airborne and land on someone's head it's a simple plan but it's very effective her flying passive is quite good but man you are so vulnerable whilst you are airborne in this the movement is slow and predictable but that's a good thing especially after playing against so many horizons since the start of season seven it's going to be refreshing to see someone airborne but they're going to be shootable for once it's still really good though you saw that i chased a horizon in the game that i just showed you uh it's not about crazy movement mechanics but it serves a purpose as a scouting legend especially high ground is underrated as well so being able to fly up on top of any building or bit of cover is incredibly useful you will have to be careful with how you use this ability and that's a good thing it's a risk reward factor overall i think she's a fun legend she's unique in the fact that she can fly she has a damaging ability which is always good for her character's kit and a great ultimate for the squad i doubt you'll see many solo queue sweat warriors picking her up but her kit is full enough and her law is interesting enough that many players will remain hurt in season 9 legacy i'm sure now for this last round you can see me and the horizon having a little bow check bow fight first impressions on this weapon are that it can be incredibly good if you use it to its full potential am i using it to its full potential absolutely not i am struggling the good news is that a fully charged shot of the bow check bow do 70 damage to the body so if i just keep peaking and let some arrows fly chances are eventually i will nearly crack someone with that 70 damage shot just off one arrow it is an incredibly satisfying gun to use though i can't wait to use this weapon more on the battle rail mode and go for some really long range boat plates i want to snipe someone off diving ball from half a mile away that's my dream and one day i will see it happen so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it make sure you are subscribed to the channel for more season 9 footage and i'll see you all in the next one bye
