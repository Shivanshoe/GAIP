hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and janks and i are playing some jewels here both using the skull piercer wingman you could call us the winged mandem but you would have heard that pun already because i assume i'm using that as the title so i'm not sure why i delivered it like that we didn't end up with an incredible amount of kills with the wingman specifically because we were looking for that particular weapon for most of the game but i want your guys feedback if it is at all possible because i've changed the editing style of this video of a little bit i've tried to skip to the action a little and i've tried to show you more clips sometimes it doesn't go as well uh it's just a fast-paced vid so let me know what you think of it in the comments and if i should stick with this style but yeah thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i have a gold
