hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are switching it up we are playing ranked with ratchet and jacks these guys are incredible players who are very comfortable and experienced in masters and pred lobbies and i am not not yet anyway and before you say oh this is a dog too lobby the ranked split started yesterday so all the masters and prep players were demoted to platinum 2 which both janks and ratted are i stopped playing last place of diamond so i'm gold but i'm still obviously in the platinum lobbies which are the masters slash pred lobbies just ask this guy this guy knows making contact with enemies oh my god brother there's no shock this guy is sat here shooting my box you have made eight dollars from this game now i am not good at ranting these lobs yet and i think my biggest problem is my confidence my accuracy is also a problem but that's a little bit harder to fix in the short term now let me give you an example should you face here okay horizon's there basically yeah you're dead ash right here so i went from having two nice headshots on the horizon we finish up the next kill as well and then we got flanked by a separate team and when jank said back up in my head i was thinking like we're backing up like 100 meters i just need to i need to learn to play for myself sometimes and make sure i'm okay that is the biggest thing you can do is make sure that you're okay first you have to look after yourself it's like when you're in an airplane and they say you put on your oxygen mask first and then you help other people and that all comes down to confidence because look at it i just ran in the open i was absolutely fine on the roof the corset wasn't on me i had high ground no one could push me and i threw it away i'm running the open like an idiot i got a good night really bad really bad we got a good name i've only got here i did so much damage boys big w fellas good job he pushed by himself his team's not even here yeah i don't know what's going on girl yeah good for him in the corner my controller is connected my controller is gone and as you can hear my controller i disconnected i had a gold bag i could have stuck the res on ratchet really quick and we end up dying because my controller wire disconnected amazing i do feel bad for ratchet and jacks because not only was i throwing some of the games with my back plates but this is just i mean mechanical failure you know what can you do just throw in every single game now the game that i have for you today i didn't exactly pop off but it worked well as a team and it definitely showcases a different kind of play style and gameplay to our usual float so i hope you guys enjoy it thank you for watching i do
