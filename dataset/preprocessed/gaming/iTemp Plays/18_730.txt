charge isn't that bad if you know when you're gonna find someone could you compare the charge of time I get common sometimes yeah and they say like oh how come you'll have a family so how come you're holding a charger it's like happy oh yeah all you do all you do is you just like like I play it like for example if you're here right there I will jump this corner and pre-charge like that's exactly already see to them I sleep the corner and yes I'm pre charged by the time by the time you're actually in the fight it's already charged yeah no the charge up time is irrelevant I have basically white shells in the moment I hit 100 ok the Federals miss castle the other guys sweet so I'm gonna put just give me over here he's somewhere over here I would say it's a funny or stairs like carton Ocasek - oh okay it's a Korsak Givi team all stick Gibby nice job let's go at a golf sweet fires well what do you appreciate even though he was a Givi caustic team member I feel like you appreciate a little bit I do know I like anybody that uses guns that aren't your typical well oh you take hemlock I got so much respect for that that what no he was using triple takes peat fire but this before his gold that's my hemlock you see for even that nameless before yeah yeah can I be that have I all game this game but I had the same situation you did where we ran out of bullets yeah but still befriended a
