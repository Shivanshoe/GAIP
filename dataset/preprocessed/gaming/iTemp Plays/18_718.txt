hey was the guys at rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are testing out right she was a we'd won in the recent patch because her ability was buffed in one way and then nerfed in a different area by quite a bit as well and then her ultimate was also nerfed a good amount on top of that and when I was reading these patch notes I just thought that overall she was nerfed by a good amount and I still think that's true but it's not as I thought the change to ability specifically have been really interesting and it shifted the focus and how you play right as a character so just to refresh your memories here ability note X of 1 and 1/4 seconds to enable this used to be 0.4 seconds that's over 3 times longer than before however when she's in that phase state she's 30% faster she can see people in the void it lasts for 4 seconds instead of 3 and the core though has been reduced by 10 seconds it's now 25 seconds so it's a huge buff but it's also a huge nerf the way that wraith has played before is just to play really aggressive and if things go pear-shaped who cares your inner void in less than half a second and all your teammates can cover you whilst you run off and heal you really could get away with so much as this legend but now you have to be a little bit more careful if the spot that you're in gets really bad you're probably going to die before you can get into the void 1 in 1/4 seconds is a long time to wake the invulnerability that the void offers it forced you to stay close to cover to be a little bit more careful but if you can now this place noise you can get so much more out sphere ability I'm gonna leave you with an actual factor ranked game here I hope you enjoyed if you do make sure to leave a like rating I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends containment to these Mimi goes one of the best places to drop here and it's already kicking off and I am weaponless no nevermind I'm not weaponless I'm armed to the PTO's 20 it's all noted I'm pretty sure he's down low I can eat them mud squeegee which is muddy screeching about there's no loot down there so I'm not really sure why he's down there unless accidentally you have just picked up next inning I woke up the P to a 20 okay I mean scam they get me in this scrap I've got good loose get me involved I hear the puffs on 4/20 and I hit the course ticket well in the same distance the same good I need heavy I'm struggling on my words thanks friends two more teams over this way I cannot reload and I guess my way oh there just a second teammate I gotcha I gotcha I knew the octane to hit to help me there but he was preoccupied with another team like he was holding off a team already got 40 rounds actually okay that wasn't his fault at all he's already holding up another team rushes smile good grief containment is kicking off today this is why you'll end here though careful teammate you haven't healed and there's definitely a team there someone lob something at us and they also look is he fine portal here no problem annoyingly I reckon these guys gonna steal all our loot here and we need ammo with 18 Lords mine octane needs a an entirely new kit Hey look at him as a decoy what time enough she'll spew I sure batteries but we can use down a level one shield I'm sure one of these close guys had level ones at arm's reach boy that's a bit of a waste of a life 22 shots we should we shall loot over display or all struggling I need heavy ammo - I need a bit of light as well good grief that's that's why you liked it mr. Frank this is post there be 12 people first circle honestly it's happens quite frequently recently maybe not 12 maybe 16 to 20 but not many you know you have a good start doesn't matter because you want finding one till the third circle because it's only people if we actually have a good amount of time to loot up here find a bit of ammo let's find some better shields rock scene I'm gonna take the digital threat because I've got a course on the team if you've got a course Agora Bangor it's usually a good idea especially because you can still spring that through where caustics gas may never used to be like that she saw FOP I'm actually calling lucid these guys ran off into the sunset dropping care package service pay to left me a lifeline care package I've got no B I'll pose but I don't have loads just keep running at least once Ralph into the since they once more good grief all no word are you kidding me this is the same team that nicked a stuff cuz there's a Pathfinder and there's a mirage you've been buddies with two separate occasions that pathway there's a fork and it took 221 hopefully this is him we can just take metagame early it already kill anyone wait there's 41 people that what's been respawns lock them all oh I hate Mirage it's making me feel foolish sick of these guys I'm gonna be absolutely female let me tell you this guy's really weak nice to separate teens behind as well yeah mobile situation like 20 60 out of gold longbow no wonder he was brilliant off so much is that Mirage don't we the Lord's reckon he just ran off right I guess I reckon he's ran off given the current trends for the past five minutes I think that man there's probably other side than that by now portrays a different set of teams to fight fed up of chasing people on what word careful will that be the revenants you went back to the ultimate son who's gonna be behind me that's fine once again have a mo problems didn't even real of my honor tonight mayor's will take you scape because not literally no one is really every good for some reason people I'm gonna have to get the heck you freak out of here they're all cook they're all kind of weight off one of them one of them is one shot it's done one of them is popped assault say I think is actually okay Corsica so difficult to push can you don't have of course on your time this full team good work top as well yes songs about to push I don't want to get gates cats so I'll actually close that must have enough these guys like for tuna or something maybe something good this way charging on my shields they were not all the way around the mounting I'm Phoenix by don't know how much on I've got here I got to try and specify then I think honestly the thermite with the caustic traps my actually I'm gonna take you somewhere else teammate I'm scared were gonna get in a dude or something we just make so much noise are you got a jeez man sort of my first uh no one's even here all right well the force was a bit of a waste but I was just terrified they were gonna get third party and that was the perfect log could be hard to get made in this day though it looks kinda stupid here stupid unnecessary perhaps but it seemed boil through at the time people unfortunately it's not gold I mean I prefer red either have to try and level it up myself but this may be the first break we've had and I have nine show batteries there for grabs wine is it more here good place close to the ring thirty seconds there's a sniper in the area maybe yeah they're tough behind us might be something good this way there's a family this is what I was scared of well I'll put the portal down if these guys are a bit closer and they throw that fur my artists in the hole the both screaming rude he's trying to avoid these mice best say for the next zone but it looks like there won't be after them after that so there's no need to try and fight them find help I'm covering fire damn but apart from that I think we should get out of here this ring always avoid the fights with people at the cage unless you're a finder of course have a pad for no team just like you would avoid I've bought same sort of both theories it's the same sort of I've no thought kind of point is a special day there you go they have to bring Rolf are not worth that time yet we can try and loot we find a Lycan I can drop you some bullet policeman is dropped name launches ultimately as he three seven I have three ended shots she sends a single fighter hoping I'll keep them going we might be able to display more lay around here as we bit of it what's stingy ammo dropped there but I've got an online tonight oh this is gonna get messy one-minute rings that far don't need too many bullets with these are they done only to anybody's with the g-seven skates extended heavy mag here oh thank you but I'm not gonna use it I don't think she'll battery here target spotted here okay see down already that's lucky there's a portal that looks like it takes them up top we can push up to take that that'd be much but I'm not sure gonna be able to hey yeah oh my kill Cody we don't need to rush for the post office already so busy playing it's pointless that's my kill Oh today I was gonna paint job on that trap I thought I'd be two times bruised anymore I'm not honestly I'm not a fan they died up there can we cope top these guys are fine around the corner there we go this is safe too I say we try and get a top it's trying to do together though it could be easy no firing that way I got a push down here massive choke points were still safe on this if both teams are down here this should be a win pushed with the bangs awesome that smart talk to other squads my patients we've got no reason to drop down here that's not play that it's not to play all three era I can't see though i my brush me if i take my long Sankar is so difficult to shoot them I ain't got as a batteries I don't know if I'm gonna win this just three of them why did how on earth how on earth do we lose that game how on earth do we lose that game I am I am shell shocked is that 4k though I feel like I assume people the entire time 3.8 that's fine neon a 4000 damage I heard that the four can race I don't mind too much I can't I don't know why we jump down when the two class two teens are fine oven if he fell off by accidents because there was no like there's no the last two teens have ice him all we need to do is like knock one of them maybe then we can trip down um 10 kills but maybe 4000 damage is a little bit horrendous let's say should I be more aggressive there looks what I've jumped down with them I just fell if I was suicide surely we wait and wait for a big advantage because we do not need to jump at all right am i writing that book at the same time if they've jumped should I commit because Trudy that's our best chance of winning if you commit to a play I guess so I guess so to be fair I don't know we lost that boost in a fun game I thought that was action from start to finish still hundred twenty for our P thanks for watching rightly still extremely viable by the way yeah thanks for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
