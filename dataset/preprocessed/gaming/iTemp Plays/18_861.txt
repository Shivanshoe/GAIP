hey mr. Gossett which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today's video is sort of a weird one because we barely moved across any of the map whatsoever the game started in scrap Atal City for me in the squad the middle of the game we were in scraps of City and then at the end of the game we were in scraps or sitting about you doing a little bit of a heat map for you so this is the apex legends season 3 map and here in green is where we managed to venture off to another zoom in so you can actually see where we went this game was the biggest load of third parties you've ever seen not just enemies my squad as well food here at gun fights crafter city we've got the hicking freak involved and at the end of game such a feat scrap between the last 17 teams he felt like it was mental this is what I FX legends public games is like in 2020 that anyway I hope you enjoy if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe if you know around here to join the ight Empire and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right scrap it all this we are back here once again I always landed in the same corner this is literally this is my corner because you get a lovable knock down shelf and a firm white cranes you see that you never come up to this corner because you get to Mozambique's what this is some aah this is depressing this is why you come to scraps or city to get some of the best link on the game you know so me and friend Tom here okay product remove ABS people take that's fine I think you must have done mostly damage anyway at least merge to get rid of video Mozambique go look at the bright side this is a decent vote great though sure battery and a 99 humongous crap over the waiting it's funny get involved that's a goodnight looking promising never mind those including mixing Layton thank you it's just going out the back Lucy's probably chasing a race please let me know climb this okay well I'm literally hear someone teammates gonna be careful I'll say if that's happen you could just here is the old robotic legs stomping around everywhere now I'll go well with your peacekeeper friends I am in desperate need of a back here this is Lacanian her friend just trying to kick stuff up I bet I've walked past three have an eye I always get common saying which you mister Bank which you mister bag I don't like that pop more name what I need them so I can carry a level one shotgun bolts without havin to drop it for ammunition there we go thanks French that's why you thoughtful of you don't thinking it out for me I do appreciate that oh yeah yeah I agree and I thought your ping does display good thing let's craft a city of course is that you can be fighting at one end and they'll be a separate fight the other end and you won't really know about it until you travel over it's not fight some guy opening a door in there teammates are coming on over this is good because I've got a different angle to my teammates that's decent damage Haggar I did a decent amount of damage doing attacking the purple that's fine I was gonna come in for the revive it was her kill so I was gonna take the fresh revived but sorry I guess I did a beast mode enemy job just take what I'll need and just run there was a time where I honestly I'd have left all of that but playing this game recently I have never seen so many people trying to brush over to loot as much so sometimes you just gotta do the same thing and then you can't complain when other people do to you it's just one of those situations like 24 people left best times in the game the most satisfying items on the game for me to find our extended light mags and maybe even the turbo charger is the turbo charger unlocks two weapons that wouldn't really want to use now see now I said I still live the devotion tonight hey you French no easy resetting I think someone used the Mirage old see beneath this as well good grief nice job oh that's your stuff off I die where did the bangle got I've seen the octaver enough to heal her but the bangle was absolutely nowhere to be seen I was gonna absolutely murdered of this way hey looting I'm also in need of a little bit health Oh sir injuries aren't gonna make government job actually even though you've left me to die I will still drop this for you so I'm just a fantastic teammate Johnny Timmy don't steal this ok nice will you try it I think you might just use the syringes all right well those under the fights in a separate part of scraps or CC we are doing the tour of scrapple City at the moment we're gonna visit every corner see me let's go this way taking Annie thanks thank you I'm totally sure she wants to keep that no shield sells to me but it's a decent I'll trade three shield cells from Medicaid yeah that's I'd say that's a fair trade especially because it's my only big heal that is the worst scrapple of 2020 there will never be Thanks oh but that was a - three out of ten and they're all using my ultimate to get top careful teammates they've got high ground on us named thanks to some idiot who's put it all smear down no shields oh that partying going on here this good news actually I'll be and then might be to the team now juice Armas wish for six damage ice okay it's only go free I heard of grappling thought he's just gonna be coming all the way up top a teammate say here but they're still two of the team's fighting have you got to be patient in these situations hey okay I wasn't expecting to turn a fight there for some reason I thought it's gonna run away that's fine I've got no big hey or song have to use the Phoenix kick this is the fastest way to get before Oh must have so bad on the lifeline careful teammates give me two seconds I'll be there hey boy nine damage what's going on down here don't say breakfast there's another guy careful that sucks gonna need to loo to get lion munition that's why this might be able this is every squads left oh well this is yeah does he do gates don't fall what can you do huh I'll shoot my body in a 3d one when your third party not third party you've seventh part of that one you've seventh party there were 17 now there were six teams and then you joined in with a full team that was left oh you boys kill leader as well I say what that is probably matches though and I'll tell you another thing it's kind of fun when it's that messy after you paid rent for a while and people who'll be tentative to fight and I'll hear a fight and then there maybe go over it won't let me I'm trying to look at the summary by the way and even see the people who want but it will not let me but after you play ranked for a while people a little bit tentative going to a public game and people just brush the rushing of third parties like that when it works out it's actually pretty funny I mean I know I finished second place but I did what I could you know I think I've worked with what I had in that situation we didn't leave scraps or City once we just went from one quality other taking different fights on an arm's damage I did all right got ten kills and I did 1,900 damage which is kind of are we pass 3,000 kills I didn't realize they'd do that as the most amount of kills I've gotten any carrots by the way 3,000 that scrap salsita for you in 2020 I hope you enjoy because if you don't you're screamin groove because that is bubbly like this right now thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed it still I know I did now see you on the next one
