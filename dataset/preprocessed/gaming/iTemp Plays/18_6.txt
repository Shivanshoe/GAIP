rank tiers are all completely different gold feels like plat that feels like diamond minimum you're mainly fighting like three stack masters from previous seasons and i don't even know what diamond feels like i think it's just predator lobbies because there aren't that many players who have reached predator yet and these ranked games by the way i should have said last time but jackson's planned them so are in those lobbies just so you know and maybe i will be after today's game i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half
