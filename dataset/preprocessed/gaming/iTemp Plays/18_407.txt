hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing valkyrie on world's edge and i think she's so much better on this map compared to olympus her flying passive is so useful in the multi-story buildings that you find a lot of in scraptor city and you can use it for high ground or to be evasive and quickly change levels where other legends can't follow you as quickly i've got a pretty nasty 1v3 in the first game that i have for you today just because of her movement mechanics the enemies didn't know whether to heal revive or shoot i was too slippery in the gunfight i hope you guys enjoy the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends um i'm landing ground floor let's scope this quadrant down here slash [Music] it's like no there's nothing we can do no three teams in here i played am i stunned in there i stunned two people that was great i may have stunned myself
