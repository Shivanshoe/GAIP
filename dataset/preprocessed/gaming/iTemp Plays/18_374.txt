hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using some single fire weaponry mainly the flatline and the r301 now i love that these weapons have single fire modes that you can spam and contrary to popular belief they do actually have a fire rate limit on them in this mode of 10 rounds per second though this cap is so high that you don't really notice it the fastest my trigger finger can go is around 11.6 rounds per second or clicks per second which i got on a not so scientific website that calculated your clicks over five seconds and then divided it by five however the technique that i use to fire so quickly actively makes aiming the gun more difficult which is a problem in a shooting game the technique is to basically tense your forearm muscles so your fingers end up kind of shaking it's weird and i'm sure it doesn't make much sense if you've not done it before if you were to actively think about each button press with your finger they're going like up and down each time you press the trigger you could probably only reach around six clicks per second so this technique if perfected has the potential to be deadly in game if you can keep your aim steady that's ease so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i've been like i miss the i miss the thought the thought of playing war zone is just like oh it's gonna be so much fun but then we play it and it's just like yeah this game is terrible it's it's only good when you get your loadout and stuff and the way to get that is just to kind of place on kind of slow start i hate fighting the game without loading it just ruins the entire vlog no i have 20 extra heavy i can tell you guys whatever i'm just popping some syringes i'll drop some more down below if you needed it thank you and it's not like uh i'll throw one or off someone coming over really cracked 61. oh god right when i run around no i do not forgot whack him he's really weak nice oh my god uh do you have a single fight recharging uh this guy defense i have a hemlock uh yeah i can make that work i know him it's in that box i had no i mother do you need any bats i have like five mean i have one well let's kill these guys first i made the wrong choice oh recharging shields uh do you need a phoenix i don't i do have one drop something here i think your food must have arrived okay yeah sorry i have my food you good i thought so i dropped a lot of bats that's why i died i can see that the shield battery here so did you hear me that's why i died yeah yeah i uh yeah to be honest i think he died because of me i chased the bluetone instead of helping you oh yes that's true none of it was because of me someone's here i dropped you phoenix did you hear that part did you yeah yeah i don't know where is that oh it's inside uh you could already committed to this medkit ah shoot rockets man he didn't hit me though i gotta try and single fire ah why did that stick on to him oh me oh he's still there yeah he was just vibing the whole time i couldn't even get around to him any heavy yes and a flatline yes wow everyone loves pass so much uh it's a sad though isn't it yeah straight butchered okay i remember when i tried the keyboard brain like when i used to play with ali like roads commando and black ops 2 when i use the foul whenever i shot my i did this noise i don't know if you can eat it can you hear that all right so you're here you'll hear me i was going to sing for but i have ten spare heavy bullets because no one is using heavy i dropped my heavy check one of those boxes i dropped or whatever heavy i had over there i don't think it was much actually that's tripled my well for droop of my song but every time i shot a single fire my was going every single shot and it was i didn't i didn't even know i was doing it why what are you are you a cat just my brain just like i don't know like it's putting so much brain power into firing i don't know why that reminded me of uh you know like those little noises as cats make yes oh this guy's firing right in front of me i'm the worst guy on the left too and guy behind me obviously oh this guy's flying right on my head there's a team across the way i'm going to try and help you though nice it's this annoying team now okay where's the teammate i think they're both back there now are you okay i'm popping this line's a hedgehog this is tough man the flatline is so difficult because you've recalled so much unless you don't have the brain capacity for this on this fight the wind man is so much better oh yeah recharging the lifeline's just further back so we can just angle where the octane can't even see us the good news is i've got basically no heavy left which is nice this guy had 200 heavy hold on i'm coming on come on oh you might want to come to my way come my way come my way these guys are going to there's just one but this is behind those jesus people just flying around these octanes are going crazy things have just evolved they've just evolved they're all maniacs actually honestly i should switch to that i really should i'm pretty sure i'm taking all the kills oh my gosh he's under that's the boldest batter i've ever done oh he didn't see the enemies 50 damage right there right at the end so bad i don't think i'll do 50 damage if i'm not single fire on team left this has been a mess absolute disaster i have so many i have so many heavy uh lightweights now i'm i'm switching to an afro one yeah lights just so easy to find i didn't know for a last squad but the flatline the recoil is messing me up big time yeah you have to control recoil on track it's so awkward it's awful it's so difficult well i got a gold bag someone does oh i see him at the top let's pop it in battle reno he's gonna feed me right here and get are they moving i haven't seen it for a little while uh yeah they backed up i think they went over there is broken oh yeah yeah nice this is the art drawing is definitely the play yeah it's so much definitely the play oh my god i was such a struggle before i picked up the author i won i even stole a struggle after that to be honest oh i'm stressed apex champions nice nice pretty good game really yeah i wasn't bad
