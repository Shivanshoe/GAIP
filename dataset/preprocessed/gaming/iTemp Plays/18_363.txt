hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are sniping on apex specifically with the longbow but i did use the sentinel in there a little bit as well now unfortunately the best game that i had to showcase the longbow in the three hours that we played today i didn't record and i never make this mistake but i can tell you that this gun is outrageous now because in that game believe me i popped off now the longbow got a buff in the recent genesis event taking its damage from 55 up to 60 which is massive because now it takes one less bullet to kill enemies who have either blue or red armor and i think you'll start seeing the longbow more and more when people start testing out for themselves and realizing just how good it is at the moment now this video was actually kind of tough to record and it wasn't because the longbow isn't good it's a combination of apex currently being the most try hard it's ever been these lobbies are made up of maybe 15 average or decent players and then 40 predators who are sick of getting ddosed and cheated on in ranked and they just wanted to drop into the og capital or school town uh hot drops battling it out and these areas are not where the longbow shines however we did get some nice kills in there and i hope you enjoyed the gameplay thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends thank you i missed it there you know what it was uh where'd you want to go uh wherever you wherever you want you're the sniper guy over here i'm just gonna go on the score wait there's another rope to our left which is the exact same i'm dead hold on i have to get my shatter caps i had to they're really important i'm using my only bat i got this guy hit every shot on you and there's a procedure that's crazy and then when i'm up here he's hitting me for another 75 years he jumped off the sky 44 flesh 30 30 combo it's going to be so devastating uh how many how long do you hold by the way i have it do you mind popping it i have no bats and pretty much yourself i hear somebody i think it's below me though yeah i think they're going to try and come up over here and they'll just hate us there's like a understanding of demons oh this octane's a thousand uh my apologies no maybe we just bought around the same way i don't know i was gonna get stunned i think they're up there last one i'm going once really week on getting shot under the team though it's the same team but he's too much of a wind angle uh so is the other guy on top oh yeah he's dropping he's not partying i almost broke grace why can't i help that can i can i oh that back then i was trying to sniper with her three times i couldn't hit her behind her teammate just so little that happens their map design is great though i i love like their their maps are always just so good pull the full one to play this game's just so advanced that it's hard to balance a map someone's in this corner right now they're uh inside oh he's just holding that let me take my ring mike what are you doing sir god it's goblins oh my god i respect it what a man i respect that massively p20 hemlock i like this guy oh man that's such a gross name it sounds awful i thought it was someone who's right uh you can let himself raised hey selfridge over here you've ever seen that's uh that's so gross because i picture that in my head forget everything you thought you knew about wobbly sausages this guy knows it all oh yeah okay but the the hit fire 30 30 is unbelievable uh nothing he's absolutely nervous no they nerfed the heat fire i think like a like a patch a couple patches ago didn't when they turned them into the like marksman rifles oh all along with the g7 and stuff yeah uh i think they lowered the hit fire a little bit but i mean it's still just so nasty i was stuck being 48. correct i think he's just a solo ah yeah he looks you see my tweet about like every pro player's stream looks like these oh yeah they look like a nintendo nintendo models yeah but he looked just like the tweet as well it was the same skin and he didn't rendering property on my pc i had a lot of shots on the last guy well i him and he wasn't cracked so they climbing i don't think so what did he do oh i fell oh oh god i felt oh no sculpting for 95. nice jesus oh you're a drummer oh god oh god if you have a respiratory system it's fine we just need we just need game plans can i use that last game from your perspective and just like i'll just zoom in on me in the background with the longbow i mean i got a really good shot when you grappled at me like a psycho and i stabbed you oh yeah i'll use that i'll use that check out this new buff longbow guys i have a styling i've alternated what are you you're absolutely man what else we killed the last member good work team not bad shooter nice first blood right here for like whatever level two okay almost there like that guy was like first win but he was in spawn running bossy in an email like guys looked up he's like what are you what are you holding in your hand but he's while he's emo hopping comes in maniac this is the first thing he looked up at youtube when he when he downloaded apex that's not going into the game he's like wow i mean it wouldn't you never know that could have been it what got me into fortnite was seeing people like fly on rockets and snipe people hey you must be much like this oh yeah a lot of your bits lots and lots that's all you did i hit every shot another i don't know where you heard that grapple though right no oh no cracks um kind of bad coming out coming up trying to shoot your kill believe it or not mate no one's using a longbow i've got a sentence i need some heavy as well desperately i need heavy ammo i have heavy okay so much i'm small healing drop for me basically cracks i think that's huge it's not freezing here i go i'm slow healing below me different team oh what's happening yeah i don't know what's going on i'm gonna leave this one hopefully there's a long one there i mean there's ten people left still since now there's only sentinel no long let's wait there's five bombos but madden you miss it oh the outrage oh god that would have been the greatest thing ever if you complain that there's no lambo there's five of them in there i've been so funny do you have any sights okay okay i'm watching i'm watching looks on the floor next to us there's the lamborghini these guys run off until the very last second i had high ground i had all the advantages and still lost the ring isn't far hey three times more long by the way okay zero it's like a spider-man playground that's ridiculous look at this look at this have you ever seen anything wait hold on zipline here i didn't do it have you ever seen anything like it that's actually crazy there's so many i've never seen it like this yeah that's actually crazy there's got to be at least from like three or four different they usually pathfinders red platforms they're crafting hostile over there on my way i have my grapple to get up top on here both of us it's on my planet somebody on you yeah it's just right yeah once another one uh coming in from the start i got that guys member good work grappling reloading recharging shields are they still up there probably why is this all the same what didn't surprise me oh he's just running that was the most delayed scan this man he's running cracked 48 flash you know oh he's challenging it's a different one that's a pathfinder teammate there's two of them the ring is in close proximity less than one minute who's this audio yeah yeah this is this lifeline team what's up only one of them scared me i'm mine oh sorry i'd like to apologize it's this lifeline team that had the thirty thirteen they were crafted ten seconds you ran where would you go you'd probably sit on a mountain right no i bet you they're in this compound in this building right here or maybe give me a sec recharging okay i can't even drop me i can't even drive i hate that when you get stuck like on the ledge yeah it goes down further than your feet i should have twisted my instincts that's a mile second one oh we're nice just lifelong let me get this battle please please she kept dodging my longbow shot were you nervous for a second a little bit nah come on man i had that i definitely killed him never ending did you really yeah there's a lot going on there's a lot going on at least they didn't kill me i'm fine with that yeah yeah yeah the uh bangalore instead of letting the lifeline teammate tap them and get a goldbag revive started self-reviving so that's why yeah yeah she's probably so mad
