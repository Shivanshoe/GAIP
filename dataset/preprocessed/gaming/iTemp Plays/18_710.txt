hey what's up Gossett which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing with Jenks and so far wins again and Jenks is actually is in crypto in the game that happened today he's EMP was pretty much worthless it doesn't usually happen that way but every time he uses ultimate here everyone was already shield less so only stun them but having the crypto on our team made me realize that the new portable respawn beacon might actually be a little buff for crypto specifically because he's the only legend in the game who can retrieve his teammates banners risk-free for every other legend you have to sneak in do the animation of picking the banner up and then retreat to a respawn beacon and we were actually chasing a crypto in the game not happy today and he snuck inside a bush he was hiding there and the only reason I knew he was in there was because I saw him get in but if he had a pulse will respawn beacon with both his teammates down he could retreat to a bush grab his friends banners risk free and respawn them wherever it'd be like a lot of support both to crypto if he'd greater keeping his friends in the game having said that he's Pro my least favorite character because I just don't like being in the drone I don't like not being able to use my gun it's just the one legend I don't like playing with but I do like having in my team there the scans and the EMP SAR brutal so thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends something I'm sure we can come to an agreement loba yeah I see many Loki's nowadays but I hope we're not on world's edge yeah there are well dead yet why does it still not work I'm worth it broken yeah the devs actually said they were like they were good contemplating taking her out for world's edge it seems like a really big issue what they spend on to throw me he yeah I mean it's pretty bad I got you kind of difficult to fix oh my god I have a gun wait it's nice I'm kinda lagging maybe here oh my lord you are dead you are oh she's in the tree one nice monopod I'm coming nice I do my part thank you Oh drop something I didn't not like you alright where are the armies there was a total of three armors in this entire place yeah we probably go to the ship and get you a nice juicy one I miss that limits on mud by the way Alma was sorry they lose the exact same of your rank which is the big places yeah Oh see you know let's see how it is kind of cool dude my favorite thing about that game mode was when I wanted to record a video about a specific weapon all I would need to do is just land on that way you just find it that's actually perfect it was so convenient their team up there I can hear people firing oh really spike yeah they're like all over there oh yeah man I'll dude any any sort of LT I'm honestly just variety yeah I don't really have much go my city yeah it's nice this is just the toys I want to play on I think are these lice or sing by I'll help uh they're in here incoming oh that's a Hail Mary I'm landing on their head if I die I'm sorry good all right something this way yeah bubble I just got exploded Evo he just hit me with the one Clippers oh yeah I guess I did only have what ebo never mind yeah it's not that impressive he'll be okay wait on that there why I think it to kill credit 40 wait where's he's mine uh huh that's a crawled inside no I hear them oh they're right here wait they're healing Oh oh nice that I threw some grenades in there yeah thought I was your family who I put it three times say it on the flat line I don't know this is the gonna be the play y'all just think of a wingman that's Stefan off the plane for me I trust your three times for allowing more than my one times really yep I don't know if I'd go that far I would three times on a fattie I never lined the shoulder I still believe in you Oh have you got don't let them see I'm gonna crank them with an EMP forget some Evo charge going here oh I actually just hit it for a hundred oh my what it was on the right -
