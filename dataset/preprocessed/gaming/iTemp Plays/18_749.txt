hey what's occurred to twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we finally got a good game with the peacekeeper I only found it late-game in the video that I have for you today because as I'm sure you know by now that peacekeeper was rotated into the care package juicy so finding one is difficult to begin with we had a good amount of gun fights with it landed a bunch of 100 plus damage shots so I'm sure you'll enjoy the video that I have for you with peacekeeper now seeing as it is a care package weapon now its power has been increased to do the general care package class of weapons the PK now fires 25% faster it reloads about 7% faster and the projects on size has been increased to improve consistency at close range and that's the big one and your sake just had consistently spoonie's when you're right over close and personal default with the big damage shots that always land on people in this video so today I'm playing octane and I've been looking mixing the characters of recently no longer am i forced to play Pat pointers to have any sort of chance as a solo player I feel like I've been playing so much better since season 5 commands as well I'm not sure what it is my game feels smoother I'm not really messing up as bad as I used to randomly during the games I still obviously make stupid mistakes as everyone does but I hope that this also translates into the videos as well I'm more aggressive and more confident in gunfights and it's the most fun I've had in Apex in a long time so thanks for watching I really hope you enjoyed today's video and I'll see you all in five now seconds my friends Oh chill teammate this is my Gorman this is Octane's okay there are a fair few people here please give you boy a good little thing well are we 45 Millar 99 oh he's flying in with his axe get out of it very much for the purple shield that's why you don't rush that middle part first because I think sometimes it's gun but even if it is a weapon it doesn't spoil ammo but on looting I swear he had even before these what happened nice chill to me I have two guns that eat through light ammunition so if you just haven't that's not why I'm a that's fine you just you to clean up the event tree I respect it there's a core stick across the way that's not good news this'll do change up the ammo type I think it's a good home caustic team over this way I have one shield Bachelor I might need that set they're waiting for me oh my word sorry teammate hold on I'm back nice job teammate the Tortugas pawnshop and loads of sealed cells for you here in a second here you go she'll tells HIV three shield batteries as well I've gone outrageous idea can you banks Ark size on the bounce pass so set thought they're fine for anyway we wonder what nice job is everyone did we win obtains gauntlets plane is octane I think we just may have friends and a believable scenes here oh this guy at the attachments ooh yeah my round section shield battery or two we're actually pretty stacked really look at that other guy die you may have had one round to you somewhere I think there we go I mean I don't very much yeah is worth it I'll check it's been a little bit I've got my power here I guess I've got double SMG sense a bit this setup he's actually incredibly fun but obviously you have to get close the good news is I'm playing just the right coder to get up close and personal people the jump pad is now a 60 second call name less than double the Americana takes Pathfinder to get his grapple and the distances I mean not really comparable but it's nice be able to get the high ground stuff when you play an octane so if I'm playing it be fair if I was using this set up with any character octane would be hope on the list of characters I'd like to play with a double SMG set up we can make this work five kills still 25 with the people which is good news you know what I think about here this Kings Canyon might be my favorite my favorite map we've ever had on this game is a scrap in the distance a friend I'm gonna get involved that's what firers was at you I think is my teammate but the reason is because score town's gone Kings Canyon is no longer land at score town or to find three people the entire map because we've all had that stupid before you don't find anyone if you don't learn school same no I thought the fires going spread apart no it's not man diesel are you going oh my god I've been the foliage cattle teammate I'm in the foliage of the strawberry can you stop and Buscemi please stop teammate this guy had some extended purple and purple some of the best attachments to game the game one run did they both run yes it's no help to you whatsoever it's already in cover I'm afraid I should have saved it are we doing your friend I thought he knew I was there horrendous that range it's incredibly difficult no sure we'll take man there you can push towards us I got a double SMG setup is actually now why did you run this way see Matt I think we have to run the storm is not much of a problem the only issue is if he did run he can gatekeepers from the storm it's not worth it beginning we still get the fight it'll just be in 15 seconds rather than trying to get of course of personal with him in the storm all this is an incredible game so far got I've got a few Bibles for you it's not many it's difficult man gun the part of sucked a median range my are nerds no it's not doing too much better but yeah they probably run either way this has been nonstop from Octane's gauntlets all the way to River Center and hopefully the scrap is going to be resumed here in a second we took a little bit of a break you know we went our separate ways for the safe zone hopefully we are back this is all noted I get some ammo Drecker absolutely not you sound top yep that's how it's popping him back he's running away and my that's get some ammo all right I think that Loeb is so low then my honor tonight I've made a gold oh no no no well I don't have a four-barrel stabilize and close in affair what does that even do nowadays cuz that the only reason is better is because the muzzle flash for the muzzle flash is not a sure anymore and they find at the cage I'm about to get there you can still see me don't do it stop chi'lan mr. bean after sleeping with all horns on my head look whether a red unicorn oh good grief thanks teammate is the best save me IRA can we just run I want nothing to do with this anymore this is I think when you have a double SMG set if I ever skates I can just poke them a little bit and then just wink towards them but with 25 seconds left on the ring Rosalie I do not want to get caught in the storm you know it's been a crazy game so far with the way that they have to rotate they probably have to go more if they ever have to cross this ravine they burn all the way around that's annoying scrap this way though weak demon x4 health I see baby the goal see ya thanks a plane gotta go there could be more people especially from like markets don't overstay your welcome if you can help it there's a filthy hug which you've got yourself there sorry teaming and then mind your one shot to hold on you go never mind that they and blue someone in the storm wait I can track and I can make this someone in the storm and they sell me that building right I can make it up there teammate I'm on a mission storms kinda hurtin but it's only this but I think I find here oh my god oh my god please don't I'm good set the stall all over still complete the g7 just absolutely peppering me all game teens/early who should be the next Ellen characters reckon Watson's very popular I think not in Pope's but I'm saying you see her all the time in like pranking and competitive and stuff I think people just like her as a character to Banglore will be fun but I don't know what you gather what would she have what there's a drowning there is that's not rageous pink no chance I'm gonna shooter that thing though it's got like 700 health name impossible I say we leave them to it because we're gonna get you in paint and I say we just went over this way this is like we turn some G's want to try and stay near our buildings and you use the building's your advantages cover so you can try and keep it close quarters you know that's the plan here we go it's wrapped oh they're up top he's flown on in as well look at him go Nikki missed we go check out here are you real no good backs that else is fine name is that the same triple tech man as early directing surely not surely it's not the same guy that we were fighting in a storm here we go he's not my third time finding the legendary please stay back mmm-hmm we tried to be go friends good it's not tough feels missed surely by the smallest of margins you would think solo loved with the g7 stole peppering me we've got whoever one down low where's the last team I can stick some loose right back home at like so times u2 legendary weapons will be ridiculous if I get stuck no ammo that's when it's no longer fun you know yes come on let me pick you up happened only these two buildings up top like the broody tall ones are still safe I have to deal with this low bar a little bit more it could be a different g7 Scout you sir are the Crypt I'm gonna Russian nice what they go would have been under late stop running this if you can do 50 damage you can put a bit more than that as well beta 11 damage it's the definition of teapot right there the good news is they have to move soon 1:10 ed see ya sittings fighting and I wanted to finish it off good grief octane is fun [Music] there are so many full characters on this game though and the Peacekeeper was slapping at close range they've booked it to make it more consistent at the close ranges like that I'm just like having a hundred island when I was like up close and personal GES nice game 18 kills in total nearly 2,500 damage that's a thing when you use like such close range weapons like the islands neither proud of the Peacekeeper there's no there's no poking you're not doing like a hundred damage at someone at long range and you don't get killed credit for it if you shoot someone most the time you're gonna be able to kill them or you know you'll have to fall back or something but there's no poke damage but we were always in a fight there that was an incredibly fun game she had a life line with the curse revive his mark because I was an idiot in the middle there thank you for watching though I'm glad I've got a win with a peacekeeper finally thanks for watching I do preciate and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
