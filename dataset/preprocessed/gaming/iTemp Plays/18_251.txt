hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends and today we are taking a look at the apex legends season 11 escape launch trailer that just came out this showed us so much about the new map that we are definitely getting at this point the new legend ash and we get a sneak peek at the car smg which is new in season 11 as well so let's start with the map it's a tropical island as we know the weather shows a bit more of a sinister look with the thunderstorm that happens towards the end of the trailer and there is a big focus on the wildlife on this island we have prowlers we have the flyers but also we got a load of spiders in there too which i'm not sure will actually be on the map when you play because we've seen npcs like these in other trailers before but they're not on the other maps for example the island itself looks absolutely massive for a start it looks like a central bit of high ground will be the focus of the map which is the huge mountain that you can see surrounded by low ground and whenever a map is like this or different poise like this rotational and movement legends are always a solid choice because there is a clear advantage that comes with high ground and those legends allow you to obtain that high ground a lot easier on the island itself there appears to be a lot of foliage a lot of jungle to explore but also we definitely saw some man-made structures in there as well so it's not just going to be us getting jumped by some prowlers as we try and make our way through some overgrown grass or something there are definitely going to be traditional points of interest with buildings and catwalks and like on this map that's it for the map though next up we have ash whose abilities were sort of teased in this trailer as well first of all she's always walking around with her sword i don't know if she's going to have an ultimate similar to genji's from overwatch but that does seem a little bit much for apex where they like to try and keep the abilities on the underpowered side they try and focus on the shooting more than the sword flailing you know apart from that we see her using a data knife which is a bit of kit that all pilots get in titanfall when she uses this on a dead body she gathers information on someone else on the map so maybe that's hinting towards her being more of a hunter than a dualist who can lead her team to the next fight really easily the first time we see her as well a projectile that sort of looks like an ark star tethers to someone and stuns them now this is probably going to be her regular ability if this was bigger or if there are multiple of them like a minefield then you could expect it to be her ultimate but it appears as though it's just one small area of effect later on this trailer there are a load of portals going on and when i first watched this trailer i thought it was just going to be wraith you know they look like wraith portals but wraith doesn't appear in this trailer at all and ash is always the one going through them so it appears as though she has a movement or a rotational ability in there as well in her kit and she actually reminds me of what i expected revenant to be we were told that revenant was going to be an assassin but he never played like one ash on the other hand seems to be able to hunt people down stun them and then teleport to them and stab them in the back with a giant sword and if that's not an assassin i don't know what is next up we get a little sneak peek of the car smg which you can see in action though we know a good amount about this weapon already because of time for two and i was actually going to do a separate video of me playing titanfall 2 using this weapon to test it out again but it's uh it's basically just a standard smg it's really powerful in titanfall 2 so definitely expect the meta to shift a little bit in season 11 when we get our hands on this weapon so let me know if you guys spotted anything in the trailer that i missed i'm sure there are a load of easter eggs that i didn't catch but thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds with some season 10 gameplay my friends 45 seconds rings far reloading oh my god i'm under the shot hey this guy's furious now as well because we stole his kill i was even angrier the guys tilted off the face of the earth okay it's the best sniper in the world easily top 10 this guy the only way to beat him is to grapple on his forehead it's it's the only way there's literally nothing else you can do this is the only strategy see it worked if he had a sniper there he probably would have headshot me and i'd have died uh but that wasn't the case it's gonna get close i need an extended heavy mag uh and also some shocking rounds thank you just not let me say thank you i mean that's okay i swear i picked it up that's a scam you guys saw that right we are good 24 people left that's actually kind of a lot considering the really tough start that we had incoming care package shield batteries for you if you want it oh you didn't ah i should have grabbed it i mean always grab it you know i should have just grabbed it 24 people left you would assume that everyone would fight mid-map like if in doubt run towards the center of the ring this is always the place to find people it's called scrap hill for a reason you know you always hear people calling this grapple always it's you know since i said it once that's all you ever hear about i thought i heard someone but it must have just been me okay the real scrap hill is the one across this rope guaranteed gunfights over this way there's always someone up here trying to defend his house it's like it's your house on the top of a hill and then everyone else is trying to steal it from you and you just have to keep them out see but we're the trespassers we're the bad guys here hello he's too fast okay he's punching him nice teammate another team i mean you should have at least arm switched unless you couldn't maybe my teammate already i'm switched go easy on me sorry i've shot you out the sky with the wingman from 100 meters i was extremely weak from the octane and padded on my face oh my god purple shotgun i just can't help myself i'm picking up shield cells when i see them i just can't oh they already did army switch that's sad uh the question now becomes where enough do we go trying to remember where the ship came in from and i guess it doesn't really matter people just land everywhere i'll i'll follow you teammate you've probably got a better idea than i do i'm clueless get me out this water my little robot feet are short circuiting might be able to run soon we're going to the desert hustle right here alternator don't worry i'm here let's go this way triggers broke there's another team here he's not chasing at least i'm sorry teammate that is the l star is ludicrous oh good grief i've got a plan though i mean i know i was missing my wingman but i almost didn't expect him to keep challenging me like that i thought he was going to pop a shield battery or something but got an l star and he knew he could do some damage no team i'm trying to help you out this guy's an now started we need to team up and kill this guy shoot him in the back guys come on where's the other team he's he's the greatest player of all time what are they doing they're too busy center fences that's a that's a that's offensive i've got no bats no this team's gonna yeah don't bother shooting the world's greatest l star player got a self a little thought first in the middle of the desert i mean who is going to go over there i'm actually infuriated with this i can't even see i can't see oh my okay i could barely even see the guy reloading i have um armor switches now because they thirsty that kill they have arm switches and probably some shield bats and i don't have any shield bats it's moving up you must have damaged one of them a lot careful we're getting hurted i'm dead double all-star two all-stars giving my shields a recharge incoming care package recharging my i've just remembered about the shield battle i left behind oh god what a disaster i don't expect them to be quite as good as the pathfinder though but the problem with gibby is that you can hit him for 300 and he will still be alive shooting you back and we're getting padded on no we're not he's going up top i'm with this guy good grief [Music] one second we got this at least those guys are done for giving my shield these guys are already fighting they flew over our heads just to land on someone else and have a fight with them instead why don't you just have a fight with us then i would have got some extra kills and and probably some extra supplies zero shield bats zero battage at the moment i'll get the elsa guy out of here constantly this has been a roller coaster of a game honestly i feel like i keep thinking back to the start of that gunfight i absolutely destroyed the octane and then i cracked the pathfinder i should have just grabbed on his forehead with my either eight i think that would have been the better play because that guy was an absolute menace with that all-star i've never seen anything like it in my life this guy's playing lgs this evening oh my god yeah we are being no i didn't jump get him get this guy get him out of here nice you too amigo we absolutely destroyed them and i don't remember how many times i went down i had such a bad early game that i actually stopped talking the early game was so bad for me i just kept i kept missing i kept going down i went down three times he went down twice i mean we kept each other in the game i'm sorry if my voice has gone before my car's decided to walk between me and the mic okay she's naturally walking off we kept teaching the game that was enjoyable gg is all around
