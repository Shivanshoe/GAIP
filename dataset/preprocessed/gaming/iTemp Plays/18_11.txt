hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course in the two games that i have for you today i managed to clutch up a fair few times a large part of that was because i was playing bangalore who can just do it all she can be aggressive she can be defensive she can be evasive she can knock teams off high ground if you need to with your ultimate and i definitely don't think i could have clutched these moments out with many of the other characters in this game two pretty good games today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my i was actually a lot of friends why do so many people come to this blind side i don't know it's over eight people are about to land on my head i just got pooped i was born i'm dead there's two people landing the exact same place there's all these like i can't there's nothing there is not below the party phoenix great okay okay this isn't terrible and because you're pathfinder you can actually get up there pretty easily you go halfway the rope and then you just grapple around i mean it could be worse oh my god on purple [Music] one outside [Music] and we're all still here i landed at a building two people landed for him i had to turn around like i said that my start was yeah i was i was going to land on this building over here and i i just got booped off yeah it was mid air like suspended in the air and i got launched like 10 feet so annoying aircraft at one mass i got hit by that there was no warning what she'll make it up i gotcha she's stuck down though oh no i did not reload what's your banner on ah how many nades just got thrown at me three four four different i took damage from four differently really yeah yeah four different names i was saving them just to finish it off [Applause] wait he's not oh sorry mate i just thought he was going to stick the res no he's cleaning out my box wait the team on me i'm getting red push yeah they're uh let's try it too i have no bullets so i'm just gonna die here i don't have anything to come below i have no ammo i got some oh my god if you come out here this box

i took every single kill no no no no i got a few kills i wasn't far off to be fair oh that's really close i wasn't far definitely taking all the kills i mean i don't care i'm not we won that's one got one different team or what i didn't know you could double lifeline though oh mate mates banner there was another team on us yeah good luck i got stuck you purple he double he double lifeline rest i thought you could only do one or two uh i i thought you could do that but then my teammate the other day didn't so then i thought maybe you can't but i guess you can uh the team up here has purple as well which sucks my death recap numbers is a ludicrous try absolutely so unlucky mate i've got over 500 damage really yeah yeah this guy solo whoever this is close they're underneath here he's flash the bluetone is flash but the ref has purple bloodhounds literally one revenant that nice job nice shots i'll be first there thank you this guy had nothing he had nothing left or soul and you got a purple back i felt bad robbing yours i'm spied i don't know this way oh i hear him what are you doing guy and he's just insecure too oh it just went down oh imagine how different this game would be if the first team that was on you thirsted you and got your gold bag and lifeline raised oh imagine yeah they're just all up with a load of hell i smell tonight who's ready to fly on a zipline i am like a wwe trailer i just came out through the rope through the smoke like that oh god i got your back you get the guy in front okay it's cool stick with the purple i don't know where he went this guy's one me give me a sec you got him he's panicking name inhale he's in your smoke down this way oh my god chill just wants to get one kill for his kill temple or something stupid super d duper ah i read it completely wrong yeah pathfinder kind of stinks i don't even know why i'm still playing him i look pathfinder but he's good okay listen he's fun because the grapple makes him fun but if you don't have a grapple you are literally the size of gibraltar yeah true with no abilities no gun shield no bubbles pretty bad it's not on here with grapple good without grapple bats terrible poor guy where's this mirage gone mate what i i have no idea what's happening i'm barely doing any damage to anybody and they're just another one one shot no there's still a what's inside i cannot kill this one i got
