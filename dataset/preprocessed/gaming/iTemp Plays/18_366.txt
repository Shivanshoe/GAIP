hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i am playing some solo ranked and i have finally settled on the perfect solo ranked setup now if you're playing with friends you can get away with using pretty much any gun combination in the game as you can just play to your strengths as a team you can snipe you could use double smg or you could use a shotgun smg setup and you'll be able to work the gunfights in your favor but when you solo queue you are at the mercy after matchmaking and you don't know the playstyle that your teammates will have so it's a good idea to have every base covered by your weapon choice the perfect setup to be useful for your team in every range is the r301 with anvils and then the eva 8 shotgun to dominate building and bubble fights as your backup gun as well i think that weapon selection is probably one of the most important things when you play solo ranked the game before this i was trying to use this antenna and it just wasn't working out we did finish second but uh yeah i didn't feel too useful thanks for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends stupid fan blades getting in the way things a little bit split up now i couldn't see him the sights are too bulky you've got 19 health okay just accept accept your fate and stop embarrassing me with this stupid 30 30. i've literally found three of them already you're a bomb friend that means he uh yeah he got a boxing gloves melee kill 30 30's for everyone on the team if they fancy not like they would because this gun is pretty bad i would much rather have double r301s yes shotgun bolt decent bag i can't really take anything else often these two thermites all right i'm going over a champion i set on it's not really gonna work is it if it was an arc star you can throw in the ground it disables it if i was watson i could have fenced it off you know that's a good idea i was gonna run away i'm not really sure what a firmware would do i probably took them all a little bit okay it's the gang we wanted a scrap here it is that helps anyone oh tell me you guys saw that i've got to see like a ballerina twirl suck me in i'm full health there we go no not oh my word that gibby just did a a 720 as but as we're scrapping uh are you gonna revive tonight you're good don't worry i'm coming right we're okay nope what do he mean no problem don't worry i'm here i got a triple kill everyone knows i'm really cool all right humongous scrap possibly one of the biggest scraps i've ever heard you're repairing myself i wonder i wonder if you had any healable see you guys don't worry i'll i'll boost you along so thank you it was really something really that took a lot of chase here we need to kill these guys quick otherwise we just get pinched you guys see my cat almost certainly made it all right this is why we have anvil there we go they don't expect it there's no way they're still challenging is kind of deceptive with the oh my god hold on i can rectify this there we go i'll join friend with the portal over there oh god that's you know free tank it all i'm trying to say is anvil actually uses a lot of light and you wouldn't expect it because it's single fire but you can run through so many bullets so quickly level [Music] well there's only three of the squads left this isn't this is atypical of stocked up all right i guess we can hold this choke point there's a chance that these guys come this way still or maybe another team just emerges from growtows or something there we go anvils i don't even know where they are yeah this is third ring i i sort of forgot we were kind of a long time into the game i hope that 44 for me and i'll run off how's that sound i could trade oh it's just not worth it i'm just taking so much damage recharging shields repairing are you getting pinched again yeah we need to reach this team otherwise we're gonna get stronger back but party oh my gosh it's max it's the same guys did max get that crater from well i don't want it i will throw the game if i pick that up as i do every single time why did i even try that i was so late i'm not picking up amigo i mean i have six bats i don't think i'll need six ten seconds the ring is basically knocking on the door i could use that i mean we got us i'm sort of stuck in there right thanks needed i got a feeling they're gonna try and go to this rope did they take the portal back i think we just got finessed anyway i mean we should have been we should have been prepared for that i still forgot about the portal i was ready for the the rope play or something but the rope was some smoke oh my lord she quick hey back back it up let's go this way we've been shooting these guys for a long time i missed every shot in the last so 30 off shots but still my kills one is heat shield as well uh i agree i think we should try and get some high ground let's get inside the icarus as it's called i don't think so i think he's trying to get an angle i really don't want to heal oh my gosh i thought he just said himself good i may have got a little bit overzealous i think i think the right play there was to probably uh sit back and pop a shield battery but i've been chasing them for so long but i just wanted i wanted blood i wanted to shoot him unfortunately i didn't really get to do that well the good news is i've got 9 kb 2000 damage and there's only one team left let's try and secure this win with some throw balls beautiful mobile respawn i mean heat shields are better at this point in the game but i don't have any all right let's get going oh my gosh the movement is not on flight what we got so in the psychological battle we are actually destroying them at the moment i was going to say i'm mocking them by healing in the open to try and get even more of a psychological advantage but they weren't even peaking unfortunately damage i'm farming i need light ammo i got a good amount of shots left but if i shoot much more with the anvil when we eventually get the close-range battle i won't be able to spray seem to be a little bit careful with the ammo situation we just need to crack one and then we can take the rope they're not gonna peek this too much though are they i think there's a world where we ever are we ever down one of these guys in do they jump i i guess they do need to do they already jump or are you saying that they are like they will be there hey someone i'm in singapore mode it's the greatest more architecture i've ever seen hold on again assist doesn't matter outrageous game teammates never in doubt it would have been a flawless game if i hadn't been overzealous and uh ran in with zero shields against two people with separate angles on me not sure what i was thinking but i had the squad behind me these guys i mean i was the only the only guy on the team without an heirloom so i knew i was in good company 2500 damage not too shabby nine kills three assists i'm telling you anvils and an evil eight it's my go-to rank set up now
