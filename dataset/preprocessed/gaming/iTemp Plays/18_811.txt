hey was a gauzy to preach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more epics legends of course and today I have the double selects fire set up I've got the Prowler and the Select guy turns into an automatic beast as I'm sure you're aware we've also got the havoc a lesser used weapon was this electrified I mean it's very common to see a havoc on the game at the moment you don't see someone find off those single fire shots of people but I was that guy in this game so I hope you enjoy if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to join the art empire on the sea wall in five and a half seconds my friends are my friends days y'all Lutz and I'm bringing my tool Niko's here dos amigos over to the okay please and say it's contested all right yes as though it is not contesting it you have taken the blue that's fine because there is purple that says no there is not my teammates taken that as well this is what you get for messing up your your flight path though you know I was for wide and I mean that's unlooted I'm gonna get my own purple okay the whole reason I'm playing a bit of Gibby here it's because even though he was nerfed he still takes fifteen percent reduced damage and his gun shield still takes 50 damage it's still it's still that rageous I'm still an absolute units three and a half seconds into the game here what's your battery Don must have been a funny venturing all right that's good there is a scrapper this is level one that was obscene me walk around shield this in Seattle here and felt a bit sorry for me but listen I got myself level three I can't believe this isn't even more congested right what's poison this one Oh probably okay you're taking that off your hands I have to to select fire weapons my where's the level two it's a need heavy mag there we go why did I pick up light ammunition after dropping the extended flight mag I've no clue absolutely not a quick any two of them really because I I'm a big fan of the Select trying to have it but if I do find once an expired value subscribe in the distance and the other distance and this is pretty a better way for us to fight because we got a corset and caustic is good at building fights compared to fields please come over people I mean it's good for caustic but he has to be involved in the scrap look at it look at us we got three level three shields combined level nine I guarantee these guys are absolutely struggling look he's trying too late no one evoke these are free kills now I'm sonar detected of these guys are so unbelievably weak what does need to mess them up please do a stripping down how can you flat literally I knew that if I just held down ABS there okay that's the thing sighs I can't I can't do anything to be strange with the habit connote and a proud unfortunately yeah I knew at that range if I if I just held down 80s I'll get the 50 damage shield I take 15% reduce damage and lifeline takes five cent more I mean she's just struggling in their situation that's not make saggy be a free 1v1 victory if you ask me popping ducking dodging and weaving frenzy we go we've got a guy on top once kind of pushing pretty difficult that range I need to select fire actually there and I have been a bit of a waste this is what we need not a third party that's not what we're getting we're getting crushed by another team here I'm afraid poor sick this is unfortunate timing I'm afraid it's one more of this team then there's a full team up here I think here's what you want to see when you're carrying a problem though level 3 extended heavy bag and a select-fire I have no shield cells oh okay yes the g7 sky is a good weapon yet we have to try and flank there's some gold loot boxes there if they see us running away they might just try and Lutz what I'm gonna try and doing set I got 36 seconds yeah they're coming down watch these sneak I've Porter would help but to be fair yeah I'm trying friend we can do for me if you porter us just don't die no mines again flanked by another team they'll be nowhere to run off to that's one shot I hope you see people should make meat you know in close quarters I'm going to absolute bottom oh so you get that is what you get I could not wait to kill you guys do we fed it's not even therefore never been I mean they were BRE knowing but all they were doing a Souness you know when you in like a long gunfight that was like a five minute fight I felt like with a team it's all the more sweeter when you actually kill them like that I've got a full auto Prowler you get too close to me I mean you gain the ones who Bach that's literally how he's going down and there's a scrap of this way too I felt bad for the course deke because he only came over to the hill to help me I think but then we got third partied and I tried to flank around and I probably still could have tried to get the banner but then the issue was that have had nowhere to run to Ottomans took the two between two teams it wasn't viable I'm afraid not with no the mobility if I'm a pathfinder I can party escape use this one else because I thought it the other fights I need further away well we know where gold armaments obvious guy knows better this guy knows better he's terrified get that gold armor just don't don't do anything crazy I'll be right back there you go just heal Oh seconds next player tune in one game so tempted to try wardrobe there but I wanna keep messing up and to or to slow down we could be game gate cut here so hopefully the portals technics to a letter getting shot they say closer then we trying to get keep us I could have friends I mean I've only seen the right okay do you make I was this one guy okay I know that beforehand I could've just committed in that group Tyrone do they know where yes they do I don't know if you can run around this the race fun no health I already see anything but maze I'll try close I mean if that lands if that arts are connects I'm pretty kidding that one person I've a lot of he levels I don't know if I can make it yeah okay yes thank you very much appreciated this is the seventeenth party of the game yes watch these tactics though they are desperate to kill me here yeah I gotcha absolutely bamboozle this team they all saw me they all saw me run into the right there and they have been misled deceived bamboozled fight the only issue is they will probably see me on the way out unless I take the Trump Tower I sprained my only option you'll need I'm not gonna do the close respawn because that was all there we go found him well they found me I guess yeah that seems gonna be by my tail they find someone else that's good their mind have a points - still Tracy made you real sick half man half Hannah point of course all right this is a good location to respawn because even though they traced me there might be finding someone else anyway well I can just see up top look mighty mites got a g7 Scout here ratted it be able to defend ourselves out all I have to do is get up top and hopefully just keep them at bay until my team I can loot up and run off a little bit okay Equipe sighs not even plain because that's not even playing he's fine he stroked it was a one pt okay that he knows I'm rushing him what's it gonna do about it and I have to reload and he'll do the same tactics I have no healable oh five shields at a sign of help okay came from it should automatically select some Mouse in the bum left if there was nothing there so just thought I had nothing I mean running off is still a better option because they're only three teams left and I don't want to be the one getting chased so we can get fur party day yet again says if these guys might be fighting anyway muchas gracias mi amigo very much appreciated I mean they're gonna get the revive and there's nothing we can do about it look good grief this have you seen it cuz I want to give you this I'm gonna keep poking at range a sec if I have a kiss Freeman Ellie Freeman early underrated well I know I said that but pretty much everything but beyond I mean that was outrageous that wasn't outrageous out of 10 you brought to me who's doing that nice I say we move this week look once he mate I've got a very good reason for this at the moment we are slap bang in the middle of the two remaining teams we do not want to be slap bang in the middle of the two remaining teams we have to sort of be a little bit stuffy here the only issue here is that I don't know where it ends I haven't made it to this stage in the game unfortunately throw balls would be good I three throw boss that's fine but this is good we saw position positioned ourselves so now we are one of the flanking teams rather than the team stuck in the middle have four teammate these are our tactics name all right he knows he knows yeah yeah I like it we're communicating through the interpretive art of dance we've got that team I think they're the set of tough obviously I mean that would be good I need to reload look I've gotta have a kind of prowler Khan use I'm afraid but thank you very much she to the thought depends this is the moment of truth because it's that tower he's still safe and even if it's not if that high ground is still safe then we are in a fairly bad spot but we might go out to dispel fee we deserved this this has been a treacherous game so far we've been 3rd 4th 5th 6th and 7th partied we've been traced to respawn beacons we've been we've been hunted yeah I mean they're not safe which is the good news however if we want to get to the safe zone that way would be point ourselves ride them to do two teams again I think we might need to sneak behind his team did it know a teammate don't do no teammate don't do it I know I know oh my god he's punching the dog till it come back they're not rushing I've got a caustic they've got a what's that family always a banker or something yeah oh my god you're a lunatic you are a complete psychopath but I do appreciate it then 20 seconds I'm just praying that these teams start fightin instead of coming this way some smokers out or maybe my teammate either start moving here in a sec am i enough to stop them assume lights name I trying to get the care package I mean I know your weight you can be saying the store for faithful yeah go back through this door that's right yeah that's right back it up I'll kill myself haven't I oh this is what's so sad about this game all right well at least I'm known for cute the future that you want to try and hold the high ground because we gave the high ground up but look how good it was the head of Watson ultimate to counter my ultimate let's move teammate I like the flank I don't know how you survived this long to be honest not a bad way to start I mean I was trapped nice I'll be struggling for Lutz he can't even look they either I think I threw my ultimate the wrong person they're on team this team behind was just they were just so spread out I don't know throw it that way now I think this is the end I this is just unlucky this team with the Watson and the caustic close range again you can do friends are you tribes is still master finished second date events because I got I got pinched that team with the Watson and the caustic there in the middle how much do you wanna bet that they knew word the deserves ending and they've been there since the fourth minutes they've just been there ready not this team they got the high ground but the other team you know three thousand damage we deserved that win will offend him all laugh it's just a lucky few mean nine damage but that's not found of course ticket it was the first gunfight to be going to and he was left high and dry and unfortunately we just got fur parted we couldn't get that banner not reliably anyway I tell you what was a good game it should prove you know he's proof that it's the old same sometimes the buffer becomes the but and that's life my friends thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you on the next one mmm
