hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and it turns out that we are only a few weeks away from season eight coming into apex legends we were spoiled with season seven with a new legend and an entirely new map but now we've had some time to play olympus and i wondered what changes that you guys would make coming into season eight personally i wish that my favorite legends would get some love i want pathfinder and bangle of buffs that would be tremendous it would be a christmas miracle in january i just don't know what i would do for bangalore my favorite thing about her like i said yesterday is the speed boost passive so maybe when you use your ultimate you would also proc your passive so you get to either spin through your ultimate or you could just use your ultimate and then run off and escape if you're in a difficult gunfight it's nothing crazy but she doesn't need anything crazy to make her more enjoyable pathfinder on the other hand is more difficult to balance he's obviously a top tier legend maybe not so much at the moment but buffing him can be a bit dangerous as he could quickly rise up the ranks once again but i still think that he should not be low profile he just isn't hard to hit anymore they increased the size of his hitbox and fixed it on his limbs and his mid-hit box is just a it's just a huge box it's a huge rectangle the mastiff every time it will hit that guy for like 120 it's kind of ludicrous so that's my wish the pathfinder for the other legends i would like to see some buffs for the lesser used ones like rampant i'd love to see more variety in the public matches in terms of who people are playing maybe the shields that she uses the deployable cover is it called when you use those at the moment if you're being shot and they get shot instantly they just blow up it's pointless and on olympus when you're playing uh not some mobile characters such as ramparts having shields would be incredible so that would be my change for ramparts another change that i'd like to see on apex for season eight is having a few more squads added into the mix what would a 75-man server be like we only need a few more squads alive in the mid game to make the pacing better i think it could work or it might just end up being even more of a bloodbath at the heart drops and the game stay the exact same length it is difficult to tell it can't hurt the game length though right it can't make it shorter that doesn't make any sense now i'm sure that we are in for some changes on the olympus map as well with every season comes to new areas to explore and this is always one of my favorite parts of the new seasons it really keeps the game fresh i've no clue what areas of olympus that i would like to see change i'm just looking forward to it and finally we have a gun at balancing i want the alternator in the care package but it comes with disrupter ramps in there because i missed that little gun it it made it a force to be reckoned with i think it would be better than the i-99 on olympus because it has uh it's got far less recoil and it's just more adept at those slightly longer range engagements so there we go that is my wish list if you guys have any suggestions for season eight i would love to read them in the comments section and i'll see you all with some gameplay in five and a half seconds my friends it got stuck on something i'm gonna go big bobby oh yeah there's like three four teams there easy third party central soup sandwich i love okay these things here because they'll have level two for me with no yep please have a sight in here no i have 300 ammo with an r9 with a level two extended and a g7 scale that is completely naked all right let's do it i got flatline alternator uh eaters delete us are you sure i'm not going to thank so far for taking my shield what did i do that for you have a purple no i don't know what happened was i killed that guy you armor switch for your blue and then i took me up and then he said thanks so far even we did like even damage thank you so far as i would have tested i would have tested we did like in a good even damage why would i ever do that because uh i just dropped i would never go back to that beneath yes thank you don't worry i've got you covered mate what are you guys doing here five minutes late humongous crap don't mind me i'm horizon i can just float in the sky for half an hour i'm i'm alluding you're looting i'm a looting i'm gonna die i'm dead um with single fire stuff you know where they they strafe just as you shoot every time you just miss everything i don't know if you've ever had that situation i mean that's what i feel like with the hemlock yeah that's not my you're offended or worse surprisingly very soon we're going back to 34. really weak but she's just flying again nice see what happens ah they're inside and there's also another team nice job good accuracy killing out the sky what the heck you're both fine cracked on gold and i think it's a good recharging okay one time's on a g7 on five abs is kind of uh they want to yeah i'm not gonna push up too much i'm just gonna hold this angle pretty weak oxygen [Music] in front of us then i guess yeah yeah using a phoenix kill thanks let me know if you had any lights up there 40 shots uh yeah i could drop these on my driver's side thanks did these teams change that uh yeah they killed one of their teams oh well use this bubble i got an arm shield though 29 times three which is what 87. this guy loves i think all right i'm just inching up i might all pop out on his head he's really weak he's really weak that's nice fake it i guess i hear the other time i think okay yeah yeah one's flanking about there this is behind the screen [Music] gonna get him not bad for an 11 minute game though a chili's baby back ribs do they have that over there no i'm just singing it from the office oh that's all you have known what it was don't think anybody actually gets the ribs from there what do you get i um excuse me i had like uh this little platter has like fried pickles and some other stuff on it chili's fried pickle platter that that's basically what i have let's just play anything you said i was going to sing it hello amigo what's going on amigo oh i don't want to oh his teammates who knows what the future holds thank you very much i need it that's tremendous it's actually like the theme song of chili's i don't know not like anymore i think that used to be kind of the thing but i don't think they actually use that commercial anymore oh they should yeah they really should i think they'll probably they probably bring it back every once in a while you know just for the nostalgia oh yeah what happened to these doors i don't know if they opened this much gibby could not pass through there there's those two guys they're just holding hands running together oh charging on my shields oh you know how when oh my god oh my [Applause] i feel change that skin real quick solo i think it's over there like in the middle that middle portion yeah yeah let's see you're ahead of me but i'm the fastest human on the planet so yeah the problem is let's smoke [Music] sensationally recreationally i'm gonna have absolutely no damage at the end of this game one of those just don't show it no one will know oh true what's going on here where is that i don't even know oh it's down though we're here over here over here big bad big head we're gonna knight him out skully i'm so sad oh there's the maxwell i was gonna watch them up here and see what happens i landed every shot on that guy he's really pretty weak we're inside the next ring oh my god i can't wait to see my damage you were doing 14 more if it wasn't for me right there i agree a young 14 damage from here my defense i didn't have any on my way didn't have any just where are they oh we need to get our comments right we
