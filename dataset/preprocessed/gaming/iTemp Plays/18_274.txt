hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using a gun that has had countless buffs to it since its release it's the 30 30. this is the bloodhound of apex weaponry and by that i mean they've been given a constant stream of buffs now bloodhound was eventually nerfed in the end but they had like six bucks in a row over maybe 18 months and i feel like it's the same for the 30 30 and i'm finally starting to find my groove with this weapon now i realized that the latest update to this gun was a shatter caps buff and i didn't have them this game but the regular mode is feeling real good at the moment as well so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends go away there's people coming here no that's your mirage decoy those people not all right i've got 30 30 in a sense now i got crazy loot from that are you kidding me i'm on 800 ping i'm no no cap 800 right now i'm on 90 so how is how is this working mate can you honor can you leave me alone i don't even need anything i've got a censor and a 33 i don't even have a we're actually matching we are the wingmen let's start this might be something good this way i don't have a wingman so now let's throw this i think this place i've been playing a lot of loba luba i'm up here guys looks like we took out i've seen nothing someone was up here i'll just crack well i'll kill one and cracked another guy no kill later i'll keep don't know where he went yeah i cracked him and then he ran reloading i always forget that you don't get uh like armor damage to when you thirst oh yeah which is why you're on like 800 kills and then you've got blue armor or something true it's not that i it's definitely not that i swapped 20 times again i don't see as many people complain about that anymore i feel like people are just used to me doing that it's because i come behind you and then pick up all your good armor basically so at least he's still on the team you know yeah true i have uh 300 damage and three kills but the two kills i had were literally one shot to 30 30. oh i'm dead oh these are they're full one literally he's a controller player so that's the only movement we can get he's trying to get headshotted speak for yourself well without like cheating inputs whatever speak for yourself all of us are bots at looting i think he's underneath oh no he's going back he's going back he's going back up top he over there 57. probably the same pass i miss her a lot yeah it's sad where knows every move oh look at this spot look at this spot i'm on the windowsill they wouldn't expect me to be this high open look around the corner they're probably just shooting beneath me at that point recharging shield oh no i don't know about the youtube choice check out this insane spot i've run over here just hop on the windowsill somewhere like the uh the tick tocks and like the um like the shorts that go viral for like apex are just like some like the tips and stuff like the little little things i i just we don't think about this though because we've been playing this game like every day for two years so we just know all this stuff but i forget like how how little a lot of people know like a lot of casuals just don't no you know what i'm trying to think of an example i saw uh i saw a video of a nice wig and he it was like a video of um like when you're playing octane and you pop a medkit and you know right before the medkit pops you you use him you know you see him yeah yeah yeah and like i mean like i don't i don't think of that as like a tip to tell people or like a special tip that like to give people nothing had like 200 000 likes or like 300 000 likes probably had like over a million views or something to be fair oh weird that is something i forget quite a lot but i didn't know at all yeah but i did know it i feel like anybody who regularly plays octane knows that but i mean i got i know you mean though it's like we take some things for granted but then you go back and you watch like your first video on this game so oh my god uh no i was a demon i refused to increase my field of view for like two weeks because i thought it would make my game feel laggy things like that like screen terrorism yeah yeah i was one of those people so if you've been playing on console your whole life you're not to notice a screen tear i feel like you'll be okay i didn't care at screen today it was the frames because in other games card always told us they didn't do f of a slide is because it would make it lag and i didn't want it to lag i remember there was like i think it was on titanfall i remember this time timeful or console apex where it had like a notification where it said if you can increase your fob on console it can cause like screen tears and everybody used to like freak out because of it oh i scratched tearing mates i don't even know what that means there's a hole in my screen people just be sharing that other voice comes i remember those times that was the first thing i did was increase my fov on apex literally the first time no i i decreased it i found a mod i put on 40 fmv just got a card fov that's why i never used to use two time scopes i was already two times zoomed in by default oh my god i'm good dude they're all just in corners they're all just in corners oh my god smooth one wait teammates over there i thought that was you wait wait wait whoa where's she going how did she get down there she scented i thought that was you the whole time see they were like i don't know if it was just weird timing but they it looked like they all were just in crevices yeah that was quite awkward fight are you using shadow caps or just right now guys oh i can't see him thank you one moment who is he watching me wow almost certainly me almost certainly uh i mean i'm kind of i'm kind of like that uh like that dad who who i beat you all the time in sport like every time like i'm a very competitive you would never beat me in any sport well i dunk on you i did any any sport i'm talking dunk like full over the like elbow through the rim type dunk i don't care how old you are i'm stiff arming you in football like i'm sly tackling you in soccer it doesn't matter and then it got to the point where like your mom was really upset sorry where did this come what's going on here your mom is like really upset you know what you need to let him win every once in a while this is not okay so i'm at that point i honestly don't know where that conversation where did that come from yeah well in this hypothetical scenario i'm your father and i'm better than you at everything granted given you know just like in real life level four i want that close please take it i'm gonna oh you got one i literally have yeah i'll show the show i'll shoot a check come on now come on no i was getting i was getting all kinds of confused mate i don't know where my head's at i don't know i said either i don't know where your head's that i just got roasted for no reason didn't do anything no no you deserve that did i this deserves i'm gonna stay with teammates i'm guarantee he's gonna find people before you do uh i'm dead are that would not surprise me oh wow turn those shatter caps on come on i don't have to hurt me what are you doing get out of here johnny lee it's not impressive you don't have shadows they got shattered i think it's got a bone arrow one two actually right here i think that i have zero bullets i don't think i blew that light ammo once uh i have nearly 300 if you need some charging i'm not gonna cap i know what you were thinking you're thinking you are you're you're capping is what you think i was like no okay i believe you i mean you're good with the g7 so i feel like either that's what i've been telling you this since the 30 30 came out that you need to use the 30 30 more yeah that's true because you'd be really good with it oh never mind it might be the mirage team i don't know if i first of the mirage i've done a mirage on a lober over there and i'll be honest i think i accidentally let them leave a lover lovers i just pinged you i'll be honest oh god no oh god is he shooting that is there are there people on you oh there's another team wait i thought it was over that way i'll find a mirage where's the crypto at i don't know teammate is i thought there were three of them that's my bad i panicked a little bit too much yeah your comms are a mess i think sometimes i just kind of tune you out i'm gonna be honest it's understandable not not not on purpose it's just like my that's just how my brain works understandable mate yeah that was the crypto and the low back over guess how many assists i have i mean yes i have 13 kills and only three seasons so well guess seven eight oh my god why am i why is this happening to me i'm never there they haven't i think it might be a full team aren't you that's what's in in there mate that's actually just crying i don't know where these people are hp especially you oh no you were going to get there said she's an armor swap and then she was going to win probably you are the apex champions yeah gg get something in there not even close you're actually i mean you went to school for math eleven assists those oh imagine security kills me i don't don't make me bring up the story again oh that came from
