hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now you guys know that i never use the craber it always sounds like a great idea but the craver has no aim assist on controller which makes it difficult to use but every now and then when i do pick it up i will actually land some headshots and it makes me want to use it more now this gameplay or the second gameplay that i have for you today in this one like 13 to 14 minute video i've got two game plays it may have been my first full squad wipe with a crater in three shots and it felt great i am now a craber player get ready for this transition i'm picking them all up so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah yeah you don't think that's a good impression all right i'll i'll leave it hey i'll leave yeah i'm not i'm not i'm not a huge fan don't worry about it but that's not enough i think we have to somehow figure out how to erase this from our memory because it's not okay i don't know if that's possible i don't know if it's possible for me to find a gun here we go ah i slipped on my controller this isn't fair this isn't how i slipped you flip yeah a little headlock come on come to the left come on no it's five six five oh horizons so close oh i thought it might happen could be this one's above us you hear somebody yeah on the tracks oh he just altered oh really yeah broke down recharging over there oh my gosh there's another one see him back there i'm going forward with an e3 are they already dead i i think i thought they were at first but i thought i could hear the guy but i couldn't hear the guy he was not here shot every it was sad but it was a very sad time i saw the little the little blue thing on his arm so i figured out which one it was but i couldn't really like call it out i mean you did a good job saying the train car i just didn't believe it yeah and then you just you just continue there's no chance you didn't understand me all right i didn't understand you i didn't believe you i think you could be deciding okay that makes me feel better no i'm dead i'm popping one of my former kits okay one of them's down so we have a little bit of an advantage let's see what's the wing man yeah it's got to go yeah i'm getting soon i can never revive the race i had time i don't yeah i killed him in our previous game i mind you we do just play the same people every day yes it's the same people [Music] i mean you're just later to the fight now i'm just other people someone's got a hemlock they're gonna have a level three extended or a level four extended did you hear the news oh i uh what level gold extending my coming next season that's a lie it's not a lie i swear i swear it's not like it's not even a leak they put in the description of their like trailer oh my god yeah i definitely fried that gibby and then i fried a car stick i think too no that was on me now i have 10 kills i may be at 1300 damage max i can't wait to see my i can't wait to see my my damage kills this don't make fun of me i mean i already i already didn't make fun of you the last game when you i had like half your kills for like twice your damage that's you've never done twice my damage do you want a gold helmet uh i'm not saying i had like 500 yeah you go thank you so i snuck in an insult and then gave you a gold helmet so i've won the argument hey because you can't clap back uh no you were correct it was not it was not twice your damage but it was a lot lighter oh wait i think i see them they're on the other side on this side of that building huge big peepers over here mom i said i got a i got big peepers what does that mean are you getting spectator what tossing oh i this is bad still top they went outside now they're inside behind him there's no way i'm trying to e-rate you please just accept your face and get overrated come on come on give it to me already get it where'd she go no she's so weak no surety she popped herself out this yes she's the last one it's not fortunate cinematic cinematic experience absolutely tremendous work to everyone involved uh gigi my amigo all right i'm sticking with the center right i have uh no shield cells at all i have seven would you like some are you behind me you ready ready hold on i am holding on on the hill down though i need this car near the truck all right oh thank you thank you i nearly had my ultimate but not in time i think she's up i'm just here for the loot yeah i mean i've been the biggest fight you've ever seen uh it's purple i'm not gonna complain after my look for the previous three games you're gonna you gotta get given something you know wait i'll say it again after my look from the previous three games you gotta get some sort of look so i'm not gonna complain about it a hundred percent that's how it works get off the pies in while you can is what it is there's ten people like well there's nine of the people left and look at the match it sounds like a good time because no one's dying no one's done anything nothing's happened i know this is yeah it's just so dry for like a good five minutes and then again the all right there we go finally i used my sandal haha i landed a crater shot oh that was for like 10 damage 123. 320. that look was tremendous oh my word i've never performed like that with a crater i should drop it i should drop it why would you do that because now i've peaked and now i'm going to start missing and i'm going to ruin it sometimes you're gonna know when to give up ah you just crank it even harder even harder okay use the momentum is what you're saying yeah yeah i'm down i'm sat up here like a decorative gargoyle waiting for one of the two squads to even risk coming in the open they're gonna they're gonna start crafting guaranteed me i've got a good shine that's just a guarantee right there yeah yeah yeah i mean i can see both of them so we're in look if i go like this i can see i can see both there we go perfect i mean if they don't craft oh what are they really doing why are you playing apex i know i'm ultimate too yeah yeah that's my favorite thing to do is bang if they're in one of you know those little towers those orange towers on this map oh yeah they were like little pillars or whatever yeah you can rope up to there's one between they got rid of this remember the one that was like here between harvester it was so it was so annoying it was the worst map design in the history design maybe it's my team i just i just marked them they're right there oh i could hear that the single five flat lines sounded like it ah oh that guy wait a minute i mean one of these shots has to hit one's low ground okay he's going to say yeah he's lagging that's not fair i hate one with my name was it the write no i think it's a bloodhound come back up i'm coming back up nice huge i'm gonna respawn i should have voted for my teammate um who are you oh you're right yeah cause then you could have pushed across and you would have been able to just come back one squad left you know scott arena right here 63 on one oh that's a nice with like two beats wait she's not up top no it went like a third third i'll just one there's one in here oh i stole his stuff oh wait don't tell me one of the things that you saw was a gold helmet because that was mine no no no no no that's right it's more than one guy right now oh is this last going all right there you go oh look at me with the crater i mean i missed the crabby shot then just flatline them but i did get that little three piece so i am so happy i'm still happy you're hitting some shots that's the first time i've ever done that in my entire life you are the apex champions that's just not true oh didn't it was a slow match there was no one to shoot for most of it that was that was a really slow game
