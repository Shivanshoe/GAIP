hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some bloodhound here with janks and they have done it again they have buffed bloodhound every single update that they do to bloodhound they get buffed this time they've outdone themselves though as their ultimate is a near permanent wall hack made even better by accompanying it with a gold helmet let's look at these numbers in the patch notes so beast of the hunt duration which is their ultimate uh our knockdown has gone from five seconds to a range it's now between five and 15 seconds which is based on the remaining duration of their ultimate the scan cooldown during your ultimate is now six seconds that's down from 25 you can just keep scanning everyone it's the old scan spam technique as they say no one says that but the animation of the scan whilst you're in your ultimate is also hard as well that's down to 0.9 seconds from 1.8 you are the walking talking wall hacking legend that your teammates have always dreamed of now the game that i've got for you today was amazing it was quite humble uh in terms of damaging kills but the story involved here that the redemption arc is phenomenal just keep an eye on the names of the players in the feed also quickly before the video starts i would like to let you guys know that my g fuel code is once more at a 30 percent discount that's an incredible discount so you can get yourself some of the best flavor on the market which is obviously tropical rain get yourself some water and some ice

it for you he's in an arthur one like a maniac in this matter that's what i was using last game i'm gonna carry this sniper a few that's ginormous we'll make a we'll make a a transaction here thanks to see these no the drone is driving off without the cargobot can you see look at this there's the drone there's the thing do you see that i do what the heck's going on here wait what happens if i shoot this [Laughter] i kind of wasn't expecting that result did you hear firing maybe this way somewhere something good i hear phone like train ish okay yeah i see the shots i see the shots did you see this the thing uh yes so they lowered pretty much everything didn't they and you can get like that wait past all the tactics you got a little wiggle too many cracks did you jump down yeah one of them's down low they're trying to climb up i think maybe no i'm going to get there first oh dare you uh gold armor is pretty much useless name uh yeah i i was i made a tweet which by the way people took the wrong way by the way was not all most most understood but some people took it the wrong way did you see my tweet no what was it what are you saying i tweeted out i said the worst thing about season six is that man he got exploded anyways before we were rudely interrupted by ice 88 i tweeted out i was like the worst thing about season six is that um it's it's uncomfortable my ocd kicks in when i heal gold shield because you pop it you cracked right you get cracked you pop a cell your heels for two now you only have one tick left and now you're conflicted about popping that last cell because it only heals for one yeah yeah you don't get the maximum efficiency from me it just bothers my soul you know it's not the end of the world no i'm in agreement it's it's a strange it's a strange one air package it's your r99 i don't even know if i want a knife yes you do i spent five seasons running in a nine oh look what it is level four they're everywhere that's crazy to see in there yeah i made that tweet i made that tweet and it was just like a bunch of people were commenting they were like they're like yeah get them it's the worst part of season six i'm like dude it was like it was a joke it's half a joke like it's like it's like it's an ocd thing you know i was like yeah the numbers don't add up it was it was more of a joke it's a strange one 25 shield is a lot now too it it is yeah oh yeah i'm actually a little bit a little bit perturbed that they changed the whole gold thing oh by the way are you perturbed yeah and take this i've already got one thanks uh i'm using a vault yeah yeah i'll go from the vault it's got a nice little ring to it yeah no nikita he's dead yeah don't worry we're gonna avenge him right now this very second they're coming up they come up the other side and there's a team down low too two teams here at least no i think there's three teams here uh there's a lot of people here and there's devotions running rampant i'm on i'm on a battery right now racing goods oh i'm making a play i think he might chase me this guy i missed but it was worth attempting i missed no lobos one shot what was one guy is that the lever just killed i hit the loba for 138 i don't know which one i'll just hit triple that's who i hit tribble for 138 i didn't realize there was a full team in there i thought that the two teams were accounted for there was another team in there you were right oh my god that was that was lucky timing hostiles what separate team no yeah oh let's kill the guy we gotta take a second to respect the movement i have no ammo my energy oh my god come on they're in a fight oh you have no i need like a bat or something they armor swapped off me that was the guy that i fried then he must have armored my body with my red okay well i'm gonna have to use small hills then keep punching you know they will find someone else anyway if i had two guns there i can probably kill them but i said an arthur i won yeah you were frying actually oh you want to show you someone's like down here still yeah they're gonna keep there i might have to run through train oh my god let me chill there's like another team gatekeeping this all you know train might be the play here plus we got bodies there if you can if you could get to train this is winnable yeah never been more winnable ever wait to see a lot of dude that was good plays in there thank you find the smg i'm telling you oh you'll be back by now it was uh honestly my fault i didn't expect it to be another full time where do you want me to revive you train right train yeah oh god do you have crafting mats um uh 40. i don't think it's enough a separate team different teams different teams i'm just going to run this way yes sir give me that worst case scenario i'm pretty sure 40 is enough for uh for a respawn beacon okay i can quickly check on this there's a oh no this is just crafting mats at least i think it's 40. i'm pretty sure it's 40. i'll carry that few you're carrying that for me yeah cause we can get you know the triple take ten seconds oh no this is a replicator i should have done either one but whatever see how much was it i've got enough it was 50 50. should i do right here that team's gonna come right behind you uh yeah maybe i'll do it oh god i don't know oh my god where even is that someone's like that way then scan battle oh my word once went down someone's got a divo just literally from my gun away did you think i could literally bring you back by going on this rope and got flying to narnia that's a devotion i can't even risk that help me third party oh when i come back i'm going to kill that team oh there's only five teams left and they're all like around it's got to chill for a second everybody's fighting for quote everybody's playing so slow this is such a it's such a slower pace oh my gosh oh this is one reloaded there's no way he chows that he's one shot chill boys they're all fighting each other surely yo save that save the thing save the thing pull me up there up there oh yeah right on the bridge oh yeah oh yeah 100 there we go here we go here we go i need your janks well played i'm not used to the same system i've been playing a bit of warzone i'm coming back and i have a vendetta here we go i have a vendetta yes they're all scrapping that's definitely all the teams i don't know how i'm live bravo we did it you're a little little bloodhound i don't know how you wiggled your way out of that one no hostel is close enough to be scanned thank god is that a care pack over there no it's a replicator of course it is why wouldn't it be a care package oh no oh no if you need a gun i've got you don't worry you know what i am good i have armor right here we got the recently buffed p2020 no thanks come get my vault we're good someone's following us that's it decoy enemies right here i fell rich i fell i fell everything went bad okay i don't have bullets you're the best thank you where's my light rains there we go let's go this way we must go kill this man we need his stuff i'll be shot by a different team i'm going up top ridge just got it nice jags oh the other team and we got zone rach we got zone two yeah we need to run i drop my red i dropped my red but it's whatever stop it where did this guy go did he rotate yeah yeah right here nice it didn't quite work out as planned downwards i don't know i don't know why the double jump does that i just want to go up in the air twice we're good we are so good oh my they're all far no strengths we're okay though we're okay do you need any better three more i'm using i'm using these cells i'll just use bats you good on bats i have two okay we're good we're good it's gonna take those enemy drones if that's okay oh no you took them that's fine it's fine oh no here i go i got lost they're all firing us here we've been teamed up on thank you we must mosey on in the zone yeah yeah is there still a rope here if not you know what we do we just hit the fattest pad of our life oh yeah oh there is a rope here nice they just grabbed that care package i have an annoying horribly stephanie that old team bloodhound only has gold i don't have a turbine i think scanning three oh this is such an intense little battle this is fun they gained both cracks one stain once cracked which ends cracked love is one shot bloodhound crack the silent evo is terrifying i need your armor don't sell fries yes it's a super fun game dude oh my word my shot was not good but what's on our side that that game felt like a story that was such like the apex champions they were both in the end as well good grief i'm pretty sure i kept that purple sniper stock in my inventory nice i picked it up i think it was still there i don't think i got rid of it i'm sick that was so much fun it was oh man
