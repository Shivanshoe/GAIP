hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and apex is doubling down on the scan meta first was of course bloodhound who received buff after buff and now they're pretty much a permanent ball hack in their ultimate then came fuse who many people forget after a recent buff reveals the location of all enemies within his ultimate then came sia whose entire kit is about scanning people and now comes mad maggie in season 12 whose passive is highlighting enemies she's recently damaged now is this a good thing or do we need accounts of this name all of these legends are an indirect nerf to bangalore as they all counter her smoke so easily however should it be the other way around should a bangle or smoke stop these scans or at least make them less intrusive maybe it cuts the time down by half if you are in the smoke i personally think this would be such a good buff for bangalore and give us such a solid place in the meta until that point get ready to get scanned in season 12 my friends i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends this is bold this is bold rich bald is my middle name okay i'm stimming in yeah it's a weird little name i went to the wrong side unfortunately you're the one who said it not me don't you don't repeat it on strange ants jeez first blood quick delete the bod hurry he was getting chased who's getting chased he's getting chased by a whole squadron there's a whole squadron get that mose i'm ready oh i'm good i'm good now i got guns now oh they're all over the world yeah they get him get him oh my i said i said mate i said whole squadron there's a wraith here we need that we need our old teammate i have 52 i have no shields oh nice shot nice shot nice shot i don't have my i don't have my scan just yet dude listen they're they're gonna be down they're down bad too they're down so bad i have no bullets nice right these needy cracks kind of nice got played i'm playing 20 i was just trying my best come on come on come on you're good yeah i knew they would be down bad that other team went down the elevator though so they're probably gonna come back up here yeah and then match okay what's next charging on my shields uh who's going down here first uh want to go together yes it's like when we're playing tarkov and somebody's got to go in the room first oh yeah terrifying nevermind uh so here's the thing i'm pretty looted but i don't have any shields uh i have one bat one cell okay so we're gonna have to make this a clean one yes we just gotta commit you might be best i just can't tilt my shield cell what am i doing here do you hear somebody nope which way that way no i thought it was like over here oh god that's okay i'm on the move i hear people fighting at that weird place um let's go this way let's go what do you think of maggie's kid the the tactical looks like like a fuse like a fuse all right yeah like a fuse and then the ball the bowling ball thing looks like her ultimate i'm honestly i i'm down to never use her abilities if like i'm just i just want to run fast for massive that sounds so fun wait run faster than massive yeah she that's her passive she runs quick with um was there was there notes did you see that no but passion notes they just released her full kit on their website you need to watch my video i got all the info if she runs fast with a shotgun then she's like gonna be meta yes shotguning and bubble fights like crazy and also she highlights people that she's damaged recently oh another radar character pretty much yeah she's gonna be she's gonna be really good attention uh i swear they were fine here but everything it's not always as it seems you know hold on yeah i mean it's pretty quiet i have a three times on a flat line again i've just i've used this way too much recently i mean i'm running uh i'm gonna run wingman aren't i when i find out our night switch i can kind of run whatever i want though because i kind of haven't been playing and making videos oh yeah like i have an excuse to do whatever you're fine careful no kill leader you should see my mccree kind of lethal dude that's not even his name anymore what did they call him now i can't remember i can't remember either because it turns out the actual mccree was a bit of a weirdo something right yeah i don't remember his name though cole cassidy cassidy which is it we can't just say is it both of them is it cassidy cole what if it's called cassidy it could be but that sounds silly oh that is that's the full name call cassidy peter yep nice job i hate these guys a little bit tickle them tickle them they'll tickle okay oh oh he's on the balcony i don't want him i'm gonna see if i can find a little bit of energy i'm already it's embarrassing actually kind of hope these guys kill us under the [Applause] there was energy here do you want to bring it to you no i don't care i don't know if you've even got the gun now i don't know if you're using this anymore drinks but i brought you anyway 80 energy that guy had some great on my efforts yeah this guy this guy just had a time all my efforts have gone on twice no i'll i have room for six thank you i had room for six oh man this guy does shatter caps 30 30. you got to respect that dude i saw i i can't remember who who it was i saw it on twitter though i remember who it was they did somebody had made a list of uh things that should be nerfed or something or it was just like uh it was like a talking point basically really and all got here no i went through the way my bad i'm coming anyways um he said uh to get rid of did i sample on the repeater or something really something like that yeah it was like really i think that's been i thought i thought you're gonna say shatter caps i was like there's no way fast crack scene for 130. yeah i actually hit every shot that time no i didn't think you could either i want you to explain yourself yeah i don't remember what sentinel bugs maybe you miss your remembering it's for the bow too but or maybe it know it's dual shell maybe i'm misremembering what it actually said it used to go on and now it's dual shell right i don't think anyone on there maybe maybe it was to put that eye on it oh maybe that's what they wanted no because i remember reading this it was something about a nerf and i was just like i was like really i've never heard of somebody like wanting to nerf did i sample did they hear the peter did they maybe say nerf the shot caps because that would be questionable uh no no that was definitely not no that was people people are pretty crazy with their suggestions sometimes oh hell yeah it's nice dude but before dual shell it it took dead or dead on sample right didn't it i could be wrong i think that's one of the biggest caps i've ever heard james i'm gonna just be honest it wasn't the biggest cat no it's a pretty oh jack oh god oh please yeah rich you know what i couldn't go on any worse no don't thirst me well they jumped down i'm so sorry i i'm gonna be honest with you that couldn't have went anywhere [Music]
