hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some more mirage today and i forgot how good of a medic this guy is not in terms of healing but in terms of respawns and revives the fact that you can be invisible is amazing and it made me think about how many more passives some legends have compared to when the game came out take gibraltar for an example since release he has now had fortified so reduced damage and no sprint cancel whilst being shot now his entire team could fast hill whilst in the gibraltar bubble and he can fast revive whilst in the gibby bubble as well so three extra passive buffs since release i think that's just how they like to both characters just give them another aspect to their game that they can utilize maybe maybe they could give watson a heat seeking missile launcher and then i i might play a few games as well maybe so i hope you enjoyed today's double whammy i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah yeah like inside a little bit uh reloading noise i need to drop down i don't really have the ammo for this thank you trying to get out of there i have no ammo or anything sir goodbye um silence there's a lot going on there's still two people this way too i'm gonna use my all okay i'm sorry teammate give me one sec 300 ammo pretty sure

nobody's look at you getting fancy with it oh you're not flying what's the what's the deal what's going on scared of flying did you not know ah with turbulence and stuff that's just very irrational it honestly is i'm an irrational man everything scares me though everything probably a better chance of you getting hurt walking yeah there is or even in the tax on the way home you know any other form of transportation is more dangerous if something goes wrong that's just you know there's no survival yeah that's yeah i mean that's kind of true and they say like oh an accident hasn't happened because of oh that's playing out there i don't know what is going on i don't want any cracks above you did you just leave or are they dead no i can't go around here okay dude this is only saw i jump down to try and help and then they look over at the top and they say makes a little bit further back every time it's because i'm stealthy rich and you're just running around like a headless chicken it
