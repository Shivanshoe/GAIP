alright but a bit of sorting Factory I think both my tomato diamond we're all going in the same door which she's I suppose the word is inefficient but it's okay because there's plenty you know flute to go around as you can see livestock and a mouse stabilizer and women there we go don't shoot me thank you sight are you actually gonna push that I'm if I'm actually offended hey where did you come from she's one shot she's got no shell betta my chairs making all kinds of noises she walk past the teammate to get to me they probably cuz I was thirsty but let's face it I wouldn't have died if I wasn't acting on emotion you know I got offended that this race had decided to push me maybe she thought she had to maybe she maybe she saw the teammates around or whatever Phoenix King some people call its waste I completely disagree with those people Phoenix kits are a 5 out of 10 he little I'd rather have a good small healable economy then one Phoenix kit you know but ya actin emotion I've still only got this wing man probably should have picked a different group there but it's all good it's a long game we can get some more I did a bit panitch then a total of 19 they reacting we've got a bunch of smoke for some reason you seem through that see how's it going for the pinch I can't really push this without my teammates not me I only have five bodies per click I only have one gun or sorry magazine Bangalore would be fuming new friends friend you've dropped off the care package yeah thank you are you been revived nice you can look this it wasn't my kill I tell you what I won't be taking this avakov yawns when I see this many energy rains that come with it I'm gonna keep this this purple where's that select-fire did you take it was it here what is this having skin is why you need a hopper select-fire I think you must have taken it I know I also needed scented heavy I mean it's not as bad as it used to be the wingman ISA can we form but it's my default if you remember the bad old days with this gun that's why I stopped using it so much because you'd need an extended heavy mag to make it worthwhile at least now you can sort of work with five bullets this is unloaded there might be some decent stuff here I needed everybody coming coach here I've got a purple extend apply Mac and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna drop the woman yet and the reason is because I've used the OL Knights no I'm good man I'm sorry they are known to not have a combo so much recently I've at least got to give the wingman a fair chance you know I've had two kills me it can't be that bad I thought so you think is I've had some highlight moments of the spinner but the wingman is depressing in a way because it's it's all on the thin if you miss your shots you look terrible and you've done no damage you know I mean I know you can say about every weapon on the game but if you miss your son a shot with a hammer you still probably got 20 in the clip you know you've got a second chance but with wingman you're struggling I'm gonna give it a go until it lets me down or it turns out that I'm terrible and then maybe I'll drop it off we'll see oh you've got a whole team even better who's that do portsmen in the distance I didn't see that one it we want to head over to that fault or what we could go to the scrap and then get ourselves some gold armor afterwards I mean it's not safe not too far away from safety here all right we're good it's hard to communicate the plan with your teammates when your microphone and reasoning but I've to be honest this is partly the better option anyway because only one of us I mean one of us even has level 1 shields and if we look the vault and we meant you get some some good armor puts in a good place you know you don't to get greedy there's you sniper scope you wanted I'm gonna get absolute zero loop from this vault and I don't mind too much because it's not my key but when you've got an octane on the team you can always expect all you want to one of those right I start this doctor it just used these little boosting and he steals all the loot in the vault so I kindly compete with that I might have to drop my hunger after dropping I'm not gonna have to stick with a big man if anyone wants that leak it's filth feel free to pick it up pretty selfish of me to keep it for this long but listen I don't trust myself with the women and it was a back-up plan for now that's it that's a life I'm backtracking now I'm committed I'm part of the wingman dem name like this lifeline a care package was called in and there's no market so can't see think hunch can't see a gosh darn thing there we go Gibby bye boy and I've got my ulti as well team XD see this is the moment we've been waiting for I haven't shot a person I've seen this the nines as he feels like laughs pretty good but it's in there laughter I think there we go I may just trim tough honestly I don't care I've it's been too long three thermal in me there's my teammate flanked though my tears behind them and I did a big decent and let it damage I think we I think we win this fight you've got a devotion you want a devotion and purple she'll tear race it needs me just sat on the ground just looking all sad and depressed gone bad I guess using a sure batteries you could overcome thanks friends once again acted on motion they're just impatience that one was you need a bit of high ground they're providing doing the two times I've gotta kill friends we did it mission completed just trim down we've got you they'll be stuck in the storm [Music] none of this is safe that's frustrating well squad dammit this song was a lifeline retreated over this way Hey [Music] you're not free kill please thank you tickled 19 damage this time it's not worth finishing we may as well leave him there it's fine looking friend you gonna try and Layton you gonna be disappointed they dead dead the one what's what's the update name I don't know I don't think I killed the wrong Octane's got ready I can't even ask for shields at home now to drop these hold on this may be stupid but did the octane did the octane even have purple before it picked up the red that's definitely one definitely one sting there I need to play progressives if I want to wrap the kill of appear at the end of the game still I seen people left her devotion then why does the team of three one shot beautiful this is a separate team teammates be careful I reckon this might be the solo I reckon this is the guide that we left but there's a full team of three over this way and it's not why they're gonna rotate all the way through the tunnel go get it up here I need need an escape plan just in case they start firing me from up top [Applause] LT that's will do friends I'm not sure what happen to the third one I swear as a team of three unless they just died in the storm I'll obviously the Bloodhound bit all right to the squads left we can still reach double digits we just need to play a little bit aggressive here I've still got blue [ __ ] off this is an absolute travesty I'm pretty sure that people that my teammates would have fired out here would have had purple is that purple shield no it's not I'm sure I want that I'm liking the havoc wingman it flew from the cave right so maybe they're just cheating on on this or in this building perhaps even if they aren't this is probably one of the best pieces of high ground in the game the same idea as long as you save your graph on Pathfinder you should be okay tempting I want to escape with but in Paris but I sure will take I think sorry friend but finally got myself some purple shields which is nice I hate you shield us I might've even save you I'm not a danger but I might [Music] there's a [ __ ] toys in there oh my god you're fuming you're actually fuming the triple headshot with the wingman [Music] I'm definitely part of the wing manda did I just kill everyone I think I'll kill the last two teams right by myself I'm not saying I T missing do damage but I'm pretty sure I got kill credit for them I did five kills I got him that 2100 damage in total we actually did 20 we've got 23 kills that's not too bad at all it's over a third of the lobby and we need to see anyone for about five or six minutes they did I get revived three times always it just the twice I've got a fin it was me three times which is kind of depressing however I think there was last two gunfights I proved them maybe I should use the wing learn more but you guys what you don't see is when the wing man goes wrong for me and then I die and then I lose the game you know it's an all-or-nothing good and most Atty firm eats nothing but still is a good game is a beautiful ending thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I see one in the next one [Music]
