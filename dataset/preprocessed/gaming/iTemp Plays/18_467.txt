gonna catch on the op bridge yeah i got i died i had a whole team line on me no gun there he grappled me he's punching me to death and literally grappled me to pull me in [Music] are they chasing him i just ran away i don't know round one beginning ring counter you're gonna regret it run over someone lands on in your head [Music] this could be the team that tried to punch me maybe i might have accidentally just debated the wrong fella no who told you to do that hey are they still top two teams up there now [Music] oh baby what the heck let's go oh my god jenks oh my word we are alive oh amp may see what happens i got no shields idiot jokes on you oh jumps on me i'll get finessed he's reviving recharging shields i wanted to punch him okay i'm standing what is this game i see where we get pushed again this is your armor i haven't make it for you i'm going back up to our safe oh yeah yeah we need that i should have died but i really wanted to punch him oh man how how are we alive that's crazy i'll let you lose and i'm going to split cells if you need i've got 12 cells i've oh someone's going somewhere he's on the ground i'm dropping he's gonna try to take this rope maybe a different password where are my bullets going how is this guy live someone's triple taking me there's two teams three teams i think now with the trouble i am i'm i'm having so much fun me too the king of the hill everybody wants an r9 oh here beautiful come to me if you come to me we can pad we can pad this way and kill this all right yeah never mind no no no hold up hold that thought there's a there's another team on the far left there's a raid a solo race over here and then there's a pathfinder team underneath us and then a team on our left okay yeah right now 100 gold on one i can broke this on top of that no yeah do that do that do that yeah this one come back easily where are they look down low under down low yeah obviously you mean yeah crack rate purple just hurt i think he might have been she's really hurt there's another team here though i don't know where but i have [Music] there should be there was a gold armor guy somewhere you didn't die oh they're in the water someone's out there oh i shouldn't have two subs i should have picked up that g7 oh good i'm grapping over okay bro this is a wild game it's been a lot of fun the john wick challenge that's what i'm calling this i'm running wingman at a p2020 oh in the left side of the water 75 crypto on gold we can push that right i don't know my ultimate just yet i'm on 83. was that here yeah yeah he res right on right here he shot at me too a little guy that's nearly cracked this is like oh no this game is so fun this is really fun i'm gonna slow heal real quick okay let me use myself so i can save my bats and i'm gonna crack me uh i'm gonna have to sculpt here sir no dude oh purple extended energy this is the god that's had it this entire time um yeah i have two bats and i've got gold so i might drop him one like that uh i have a couple bats yeah i got two bats tremendous tremendous it's crafty here too fancy all good one is enough one crafter for self a rope you can use six crafts at the same time just rope back imagine the efficiency the oxy might be by himself in that building we could push him oh i'd say just yeah let's go i'll go to the right door okay one minute before the ring closes on the left cracked the lifeline [Music] nice 45 why is he so difficult to hit someone like that nice got him i can't stand fine horizons i probably should yeah i should this whole time i've been looking for this gold armored guy the gold armored bandit where'd he go the cold armor bandit correct [Music] there let's go ridge i wonder if that if they just shot us like at a weird time for it to say another squad it was actually another squad yeah quite possibly i think it was just that team the anticipation is killing me bro we're older coming out of the ring i thought i saw something that way and then i went to when to cover i can't really do so much too strange that's a sweet fire i can't use too many more energy bullets they bubbled this is perfect for us i'm not pushing i'm not i'm not walking down on them okay yeah you've got a good angle though yeah i'll try and just stay safe i think horizon landed on you know no no no oh she did land up here they have a prowler oh they both died i'm back on operation backing up i'm gonna try yet she's in the building she's one yes finisher that was kind of a messy endpoint that was close that was that was good dude those are the games i love trios good oh i found some armor thank you for coming it's all good he's so close oh this one [Music] yeah oh my god i have the worst that's an improvement because earlier on you said you were dumb stupid and bad so the ring is in close price now you said that that's literally what you said people and the people need to know that's what she said why is my aim so bad well they're here oh god we know they know one i'm heavy oh tremendous thank you oh that's what i needed shotgun rounds what am i doing how much you have um i have five extra i have six in here so you can hit open at least shotgun thank you you're way more than me now that's all i can draw oh yeah they're going from left to right side 40 on wraith 140 on race 35 from that corner that was the last of that squad i can't believe i'm standing still you're lucky i like you just engaged what's you i'm smart uh down below right here using i'm hearing uh there's a good end up top here as well let's go multiple teams so this skip is down low with loads of course of gas i meant corsica oh we're twice did you see that with the buildings went past [Music] in front of us and then as soon as that team's dead you run away you know kind of weird the i'm offended just have a level one shocking ball do you really an absolute disaster this is a mess i'm pretty sure i passed like uh four purple ones oh right i uh my brain is not working right now it's okay mate once i'm two hours in my brain stops that's the uh the limit oh god they're just like bouncing around yeah on the bridge come on grabbing it past one horizon's up there she still helps here again look the same oh yeah i'm pretty sure uh this bangladesh uh one deep i wasn't sure if he was low sorry that's okay all right this one is rock pushing uh earlier on oh no last one nice i really i didn't know if that was the last one or not i just decided to crank it sometimes you do have to crank it you know yeah i really do you know what i was not depressed at the start but when i missed all those either eight shots in the bloodhound i i was ready to quit i'll be honest i was ready to i was ready to end it i think i could have i think i could have put two and two together and i heard you answer me you saw me looking depressed near the jump pad not a word it turned out to be fun game yeah it wasn't bad
