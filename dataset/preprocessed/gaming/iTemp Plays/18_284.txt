hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are using the hemlock today now i don't know if you guys remember but the hemlock was outrageous about two or three seasons ago and respawn responded and nerfed it a little bit and a big part of the nerf at the time was to the hemlock hip fire which made it a solid close range gun which you wouldn't really expect of a burst rifle now the buff for this event brought back some of the hemlock's hip fire capabilities but not to the level they were before and i wanted to test the gun out again now i like the hemlock before this book so any buff to me is a welcome change so thank you guys for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends you don't even hit fire so i do man you should see me right now i'm kind of a demon what's the end of that video one clip someone hit firing he'll be standing one foot in front of me but still i don't know i don't know about that you'll see it you'll see and you'll be proud as well come on it's a scam this is actually a scam this is the biggest scam of all time this is what i'm talking about i don't know i played two two grand for my ramp at heirloom yeah that's pretty bad i have a hemlock and a vault that's a great setup i'm liking all over the place believe me wait i have a do you want the hemlock can do i've got a boost loader right next to it i got a rampage if you want it i gotta i got a 30 30 i need a shadow caps i'm gonna die in here i i have two burst weapons man let's sit on the roof and i've got my ramp for shield i think they're here yeah they're up top somewhere i don't know maybe not well there's a turbo there and there's a havoc back there i'm so mad i'm actually not moving this is my spot this is so laggy shatter caps please they're actually the hardest oh i found some my shield's there oh no i needed to press my 34 it said 34 but actually 20. i thought of saving you mate no you weren't please take that i need it what i'll drop some behind you nice i got my shatter caps okay shatter caps uh i i think they hit i think they hit shotguns enabled got a level one bag i'm actually furious i mean you did take my kill so deserved oh that's a good trade those teams over here on the way i like these pings this is what i need oh i saw you running the other ways although yeah i appreciate it my awareness is explaining like two yeah your awareness is not there i need help mate i'm a geriatric oh no this is hitting for eight over here why that's too far away yes the guy went and sat behind the shield for me one actual what a guy so this is the issue is i need to toggle between oh and it's i can't because of my uh tap strafe there's literally something you can do mate it's kind of a mess i just have to stay in shadow camera i'm going to bind it to my foot pedal that's a good idea honestly it's not the worst video oh my god it's ksi in case i punish her is that like a collab is that his next collab it might be i don't know who punisher is but yeah yeah i reckon who the punisher is no you know punishers oh man i'll just uh shuffle them into you a little bit please save me oh my god did you just watch me die you should watch out for my perspective i'm literally spinning around like a ballerina i don't know what's going on i don't know what's going on me that doesn't surprise me i i had no clue what was happening you know the vibes they kind of hit now they weren't bad before apparently to some people i mean i they were they're the worst oh really because i never used them i thought they were terrible but i was informed from other people that they were not bad you know how that works these guys rocking i don't upon i mean you just hit fighting with the 33 in the hemlock oh the 80s scene is really fast now too really fast oh do they buff the ids it's uh it's on par well when you have the shatter cap enabled i think it's only when you have it enabled you get the same strafe speed as with shotguns oh which is pretty fast compared to the straight speed before oh my why doesn't he let me hop on again are you kidding is that a sick joke man i know you're gonna try and do me i'm not an idiot i was gonna try and do to you so do do what i'm not the one falling in the line what are you gonna do to me i'm not the one in the lava i thought you were just trying to push me back in oh yeah but what are you gonna do you're gonna punch me back in i was there i was gonna bring you with me i was gonna grab you yeah good peens good pings from the boy i'm still in chat mode i'm going to do seven damage per shot 28 28 28 28 great 24 yes come on do i have to spell this well you did that's what you're trying to that's not how numbers work i'm dead committed to this get over here where are you rushing down careful that um did you get the rice oh no she's a beer oh another team took care of that one i still got a goal 99 don't mind if i do he's got 15 bullets you're low below i've just been here for only 25. he's charge rifle isn't annoying at all where's the goal 301 you want it no go ahead look thank you though probably for the boys annoying another 15. i'm trying to do some poke 20 headshot you're good all right i am 100 down to go and kill this charge rifle guy yep and then use everybody left in my share the truth box thoughts i would like to teabag him okay where's he at they're just chilling on top of them there's my answer they are having a great time up there i took some shots for you so you could make it up there i'm actually a good gamer i know that you don't even need me to tell me i know that's just how it goes i did it for you though i'm doing my accent i'm taking shots i think they know i think they know what i'm doing wait these guys have never climbed this in their lives ah they know what i'm doing i'm going the other side i know she dropped down what are we doing whoa whoa whoa whoa oh that's honestly that's kind of kind of karma but you already switched off that one what are you doing no one tell me that wasn't me oh needy i don't need to heal recharging it are you popping a penis ask me on the roof now yeah you went inside no he can stay in there if he wants floor corsic fellas but you guys are actually dead the gun of the gun of the gun of the gun up i don't know if i don't have earth dude or not i'm headed this way can i take this rope probably will happen please i got that charged up you seem pretty fine to me i'm gonna try and go around or something i'm not burning i don't have my tactical for another five seconds i've only got 30 seconds once on the top breaks oh shot dude i'm so sad it's the worst day of my life i don't have any bats because my teammate probably has six of them why don't you ask for some you should just know these guys are on the roof let's come back down i'm going back over there yeah this is pointless i'm taking this tunnel um i won are you good you're good yeah now what's the point i'm gonna switch there yeah i'm not i don't think that's the point kind of a fact it's great what's this led up to i'm dead be honest i thought that was the last time you better stop punching my shield what happens if i put on a three time with the shatter caps just fired them from like 200 minutes to happen i mean i was doing like a solid eight consistently it's not the worst i need to see the jump no oh my god oh no oh no oh no this is happening i'm doing 11 damage all teammates are demon eleven what have i just witnessed why is he in the zone was there a team market that you saw yeah pretty sure yeah i got a volt either i've only probably like i'm fine there's of course he can mark it but halfway through target i'm ultimate too so my best to get my oh i should have kept the r9 i'm stupid oh would you leave it why don't you go get it ah it's too far away mate this team's chilling over here on four come also in a place story they can see it so opening fire you are coming home with me tonight no single hemlock all right i'm going they're on my live role 106 on one of them disrespect broke over cryptos dead that's why you leave your lob you know they get distracted so there's another squad so they're on my door two of them last one i have way too many heavy bullets so if you need some i've dropped 80. there's someone here you need to close your holds no let's just know where they are dude that strafe is actually done target down there were two people there but i'll be doing i'd already killed two of them it's another team that sucks and get out let's get out and i'll put my alts thank you and that way i am taking fire if you can grapple to me i'll put my old man 120 i'm high to hail sorry i thought you were gonna grapple so i just i'll use my ability i mean the guy's pushing me with no shields there's zero light in here they're gonna rush me in this building yeah there they are i'm going here i'll drop you a little bit of light close range laptop reloading just us left really cracked on the ref he's in this like little shop right i'll get to my back activating jump drive recharging shields my ultimate was like a beacon though 140 is there a hemlock there is that's not our that's not our goal by the way one mate either i don't know where he went [Music] yes they're just holding us he died this is pretty a full team i have one back seven cells let me know if you need sales or anything i'm gonna cells i just have no heals oh no you got it another squad is attacking us that's kind of crazy i mean i'm running double heavy now i have 43 in my bag here you go it's left over here force on the ground recharging my shield thank you anyone for 65 that team there is a difference oh is that enemies all my words i think what's going down i i have two med kits actually probably i don't have any heat shield strangers i only have syringes i'm dropping a med kit can we go back and get him i don't know it's miles away he's gonna die though he's gonna keep dying yeah that's the problem he's like trying to keep him alive after can you drop me uh something i dropped i dropped some medication i dropped to medicaid i think it's on the hill like you'll see on the way let me drop you some i'll drop you some syringes here as well i am repairing myself see how one oh does he have a heat shield he didn't pop it before maybe he's just asking you if you have one he has one okay that's good nice uh okay i have a medkit and six or injuries and a phoenix kit and i find you some light on the way here i'm gonna light now okay i might almost still as well come on brace it sucks best tactical in the game i feel like if i was throwing like a tennis ball i could throw it throw it like three times further than logan throw bracelet minimum this isn't real life though yeah but what's going on mate that's my question oh they're not gonna know how many troubles i have beyond one shot where do they go left uh west stage down this hill they need to come back they're not safe where they are they're in the right here got here careful they've got a shader back there there's a team here too yeah we're in the middle of everybody every so far he might go around my day i think they are actually i'll back on that shiela mate not that much no no i was trying to use my i really want to peek but i can't uh yeah i think i'm the only person that could one minute i think we just keep these guys and then we just look as long as you don't get flanked by the tunnel place we should be okay sixty on shield on the on the toilet down i'm not on the roof video i don't know uh down below jump drive god that hurts he might die oh he is i have no idea i can't nah that hurts too much mate if i didn't hop on sheila i think we're fine i don't have a bat uh i i got full bats i got i managed to get some bats i didn't get any heavy ammo but i've got my ultimate there you go here you go are they firing each other yeah yeah my bed will find something good here they're up top i don't know how i didn't get more than one shot there i am retreating nice [Music] [Music] mate that was a stressful game oh my word did you get a 4k you must be close uh i honestly have no clue you must have been close because i were doing a lot more than me if i don't hop on sheila our teammate survives at the end that is so sad hey you got the 3k i mean 4k just enough just just about
