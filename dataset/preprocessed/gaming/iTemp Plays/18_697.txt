hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have undeniable proof that caustic is the best legend on this game so he's been gaining in popularity after a series of buffs but there is something unique about corsic and that is that the only real counter to one is another one you could argue that crypto's emp is a counter because it destroys his traps but the cooldown is so low that he can easily replace them and it doesn't stop his ultimate which lasts for a long time as well i'm not having it crypto is not accounted to corsi please stop saying it is because because it's not the enp doesn't do anything over the last few videos i've played caustic today's one included there have been a number of gunfights that i am running a muck uh and so far and janks have to sit out because there is just too much noxious gas around the area however i can just stroll any with my digital threat prowler unaffected and just shoot them all in the back it's a great time honestly it's it's some of the most fun i have on this game now and hopefully you enjoyed watching if you do be sure to give a like rating and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends well that's the worst email ever the heck's that classic is the best one dude where he sits and rides the gas trap yeah sorry jenks no good oh my god there's a there's this boy there's people down low i have no gun again that's it let's speak thank you getting my good that's how it begins uh are you muted so far are you streaming uh yeah i am i wasn't and

just got shot by somebody else i think this is still the kill oh nice kill them good shots he had a blue light a massive long bow gotta hop off actually oh yeah that's good then i took that because i found a pro in the next box they are big scrapping i don't know if you can hear that i assume you can i got a drone watching uh the back door so we can go in the side here and we'll be able to see if they go back down uh smart let's go right in front of me it's called cryptos i broke uh one of them if you push i'm going to the right i'll push him from the back at least you can't kill him i got one this dude was trying so hard to please me oh my god oh wait they're all dead sorry thank you yeah he wanted his kill credit oh yeah 100 so i've played that you need any shields oh i'm about to use my one shield i have i dropped a bunch in there so far yeah okay cool thank you i dropped a one times age clock in there let's go to the store can i throw it on the wing man shotgun vault here that looks one more yeah i'm chasing i'm kind of quick he was 27 health i thought no no worries nice and serious apology i missed like half my shot so i didn't really deserve it i got a few fellas over here be right there my friend oh i come bearing an emp and alt accelerants for a second emp okay they also have an emp so yeah destroy that drone all right so far are you ready to fly emp going in oh yeah literally one shot that lifeline nice that that emp worked perfectly i did zero damage with the equation i cracked the lifeline just before yeah i lasered the other one too right before welcome to me playing crypto once again with the boys the slowing though is kind of big oh yeah yep i broke one yeah a hedgehog another one 50 flashes this guy on the pole i'm coming 45 purple this guy's one bro

thought i was coming over to you i ate every single one of these g7 shots i'm so mad dude he wasn't missing yeah he just did not like me that man just turned 4k off us yeah the g7 is literally attached to his arm oh that's convenient oh my god the fact that we actually have a break just to res me is insane yeah i'm surprised hey you want to know what's insane i had to emp do something yeah that must do like 150. never before big damage yeah i actually did it that was the one time where y'all didn't just fry everything before i got the emp off it felt good oh i'm kind of in an insane spot right now you will do i have 20 shots in this probably it's not very funny did you guys hear those gunshots huh uh i did it i did i heard gunshots i think they're back here i gotta hop out here let's go up here i swear i find excited heavyweight which is always good huh i take it back i don't know what i heard i heard somebody shooting a 9. oh i tell you what this map is fun for the third pies though they they come in like a power rangers movie like one at a time bro the you know the third parties on this map though are like bearable yeah like it's like it's easier it's almost easier to play defensively and deal with third parties in this map i think you're right yeah for sure sometimes go through this tunnel i'm excited to see what the new map looks like oh i'm so excited i think it's supposed to be close quarters no more close quarters than anything i think so that's what it seems like it's i'm excited i'm bad i love close quarters yeah that's so fun give me my g7 let me see the back my corset traps i haven't even found a gun no not even anything not even a devotion to complain about oh i'm a hundred percent throwing there's a full team on me oh we found you the last team too you're rich i'm gonna go emp them okay wish me luck they both have that the two people i've seen have both have blue and i've wait wait wait wait wait i'm just gonna get i'm gonna get it closer so i can walk up yeah can i climb this 100 i'm dead how do i get up there drinks uh oh come on don't let him see me are you good so far no you destroyed it don't push okay at least you don't have to get up there oh okay i'm just gonna sit right here give away for one second for my drone okay it's halfway i got a gold bed a gold helmet so it'll come fast how long are we talking asians dude patience

assume where these guys are going to come from please don't come out here i have knuckleback i got a mobile respawn beacon draco can make it in time [Music] i might not be able to get it and i've got the respawn beacon don't know you might die to storm don't don't die for some reason i was expecting an emp but you literally just used it you got them trapped here they can go all the way around but they can't they're gonna die they're so dead i'm just chilling this is your playground rich honestly honestly like literally all i've been doing these games is call stick with an auto parallel with the digi and they just can't say yeah it works so well you are the apex champions oh it's i was watching that game i had streaming that i knew the screen whilst we went for the emp i saw you trying to take the team it was close i tried so i was so close i both had them like i think 75 hp yeah they were weak
