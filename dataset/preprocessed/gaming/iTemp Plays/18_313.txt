hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have for you today my best game of season 10. this very easily could have been a 20 kill game but we ended a little bit short but that's okay and it also happened to be the game that took us to diamond rank which is great as well so i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right literally not a soul has died in this lobby so far so it's probably a good time to do the trials don't mind there is a team here everyone's got one of them down hello the first one was my teammates wasn't it well i left him on three health and my teammate already had one of them doing there we go okay the first one was a teammates for a second i thought there were two sears here who were both aiming at me but that makes a lot more sense i didn't even get an assist for that my teammate said let's rush the trials i thought i thought he meant let's go and do it but we let these guys do the first one and we've just rocked up late please don't press the button whilst i'm weak i mean i should be fine i'm hiding in a cake all right all i'm looking for here is a gold helmet i don't need armor or a bag or a knock down or a gold gun i want a gold helmet because i love to there's no real decent secondary weapons here the rampage is probably the best anti-prowler weapon i reckon they should juice these things up i reckon they should be impossible to kill gold helmet please that's all i'm looking for thank you like what if they juiced them up and the lid was like outrageous you know that's all i think they should do with it anyway uh okay a lot of people left we didn't get gold armor from that i've got one weapon i don't have too many bullets for it and there's a scrap over this way and actually i've only got one weapon i need a weapon is it right here explore it this way i'm detouring friends 45 seconds [Music] that is not an e right that is a devotion i'll i'll take the re45 fine there's a big scrap or at least there was ultimate there we go i would play more valkyrie if i could use her ability more i i don't think i've ever used a valkyrie ability like the rockets without stunning so attempting myself grapple up that uh back this bangalore also is gonna bring him off the roof though if i were there might have gone down probably one floor i need a bit of health that's another team kicking off another two teams there's a huge scrap going on i mean my loot's okay i could do more bullets and i could do with an excellent mag but apart from that i mean these guys probably have both of those items we might as well just go in third party i shot the wrong i shot the wrong person this guy's just gonna rest i'm a fool i'm sorry too man i i i honestly i suck i suck with eve right at least i don't know it's probably the best shocker in the game still even after the nerf in season 10 but reloading i know what it is oh because these guys had the loot top up on the old syringes may as well use my back efficiently do you make self resin i'm gonna be honest i can't see i i can't really see it's pretty my fault for grabbing into a load of bangalore rockets in typical high temperature on fashion but yeah i realized he hit me twice also got killed nice i realized it hit me twice um as i was leaping over the rock i thought i was like pretty safe but it turns out i basically had no health i'm playing like a big move at the moment a huge new to use you know the guy i shot team yeah he wasn't nice triple kill thank you team that was the most audacious grapple of 2021 uh but the teammates recharging uh they came in with the support of the necessary time my bag is looking clean i mean i don't need seven bats but apart from that yeah i'll jump with that if you guys want one of that rate on the floor i mean what do i even drop here maybe i guess they're 20 30 stack of light i like having a lot of ammo uh and i like having a lot of batteries and i like having small hills so i don't even know what to drop for throwables even though i know i should carry more of them they should they should release a whole new category of items you know you've got gold and you've got red in this game i want to see some rainbow i want to see i want to see a rainbow bag and it's got like 60 slots you can just carry what you want mate you just anything you say you pick it up you just pick it up and you don't have to worry about it that's the item patron special right there if there was ever an item designed for me it would be something to do with looting where i don't have to worry about what i've got on my inventory i could carry all the sniper stocks i wanted the rainbow bag i mean listen respawn i've used many of my suggestions before the the fast deals used to be in the gold bag i told them to move it to the was that yeah i thought so i said they should move it to the the gold armor and they did what was the other thing i said the alternator should be a care package weapon with disrupt rounds they did that there was another thing they did as well i can't remember so that's my next suggestion even though it's the worst suggestion evan i really hope they don't do it hello this is my rooftop i [ __ ] it airbnb it's got views of the lava yeah yeah i really love sia i just he's such a great addition that's unfortunate we need to get out of the zone look at this boy hey gotta charge get him out of here got a dweeb machine hey no three machines allowed are we good nice work okay uh third ring that i mean if i go from this angle it's going to take ages to get out i think this is the most i think this is the best one to use because there's lube right here that's safe it's going to hurt respawning but i think okay i've got 12 i don't know i said like that i've got 12 kills here oh wait here we go very little solo guy zwolf toten as they would say in germany that means 12 dead i don't know what the word for killies kills how is there a full team underneath us and we didn't even realize get whack him steal all his stuff daylight robbery right here we go i can just hear my seer there's red armor here by the way my series punching another scene in the back of the head he's actually just stolen his identity he's gonna steal his whole box and pretend pretend he's that's here all right 14 kills with nine people left i need to get six on the clock the ring's close i have the next nine for a 20 bomb i don't have a 21 on pc this is the golden opportunity here teammates i'm not trying to put too much pressure on it forget that might be something good this way don't don't worry team very close i'm a pathway to maine i know i know what i'm doing bangalore gave up inside rooney just had zero zero faith in my abilities listen i've got 14 kills here i know what i'm doing i do kind of [Music] three teams left every team has three people on it that's good i guess here we go here's a squad i feel like a i feel like a line that just came across a herd of gazelle and i don't know which one to just want to hunt get the weakest one the one on the back it's been left behind and he's cracked not that one is this guy take him down oh i mean we saw what happened to that heard of gazelle is that what is that what a bunch of gazelles are called oh you've got okay you know how like a a load of lions is called a pride and a load of crows it's called a murder and a load of fish it's called a skull what's a herd of gazelle called is it just a herd or is it like got some fancy name this got blue i don't know what i'm doing here team i'm actually indecisive okay yep whatever that building is we just fly to it and triple stack it and if there's someone in there roger having the world's biggest scrap i mean there's a team i think they're there and the other team's here so if we land anywhere else where we should be okay although to be honest we're going to probably end up in the middle like it's is that safe let's explore it this way yeah this plus okay this platform's safe i'm going there this is our new fortress oh the kills the team stole it he's gonna race oh my god he got oh my god that team's got a crater um i don't think that 21 was happening here a few a few kills could have gone my way but haven't enemy and i think it's so possible i literally have to kill everyone hey they're trying to respawn come on man got no light let me get the kill and then get this kill oh i'm sad i'm a sad sad man not the dream's over the dream is well and truly dead oh that's the guy that got free spawn obviously he's got no ammo where'd he get the gold from what did the lifeline have anything i'll just switch out if you didn't have it 10 seconds that's a nice combo actually oh god there we go trade downs i can't rush now selfrest nearly cracked if the guy's probably reviving i guess we're just diving this guy's head oh we down this guy all right there we go that team maybe got like three or four kp between them like they have blue armor and a crater like if you've got blue armor you shouldn't be able to pick a crater okay you've got to fight for the crater you should say no you've got to do at least 200 damage before you can pick up this crater get involved okay uh the 20 bomb dream it was it was just that it was just a dream i mean five assists could i've got the 20 i don't i don't know if i deserved it i was playing if i wasn't playing like a big noob at the start i think the 20 bomb was guaranteed but at the start i don't know what i was up to i was playing like a big noob the damage to kill ratios across the board looked pretty good so i can't complain it would have been nice though but there we go actually was our last game of planning let's find out if you like it then put a diamond on it and i do tremendous
