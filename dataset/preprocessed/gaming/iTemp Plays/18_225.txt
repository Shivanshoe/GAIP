let's reposition here all right we're dropping in we're dropping in hot i'm going that way kind of we're dropping a little bit too hot a little bit too hot unfortunately teammates sit down there which is good hello hello it sucks landing somewhere and getting zero guns then running away and someone's just sniping you the back with a charged up longbow another squad is incoming in that one quick scope jeff he got sniped in the back i'm coming back no just run this way oh god they're lunatics i'm pretty sure he got sniped in the back which means that we're going to face off against these two teammates with a longbow guy choosing the back of the head pretty sure i was correct let's go this way but i have to pop this i can't face two people with no shields contact what a mess i can't believe we survived that what an absolute mess he's celebrating with his best friends that's me hey guys i got you we got a little bit lucky there i knew that was going to happen as soon as that i think it was an octane i quick scoped him and cracked him and then he got shot in the back i knew that was going to be a terrible a terrible fight for us i was always going to be tough level three uh do i keep the longbow kind of maybe if the r301 had more bullets left in there i'd probably pick it up but that guy had some i have literally zero shields i need shields i've got zero i'm gonna have to craft zero shield each right now new kill leader watch your six heads up drop in the paint not another team no the other team's probably there right no this guy's boxes falling down we get one box with this whole team oh my god they're on me oh we got one box for that whole team i mean i'll mess some of them up though i'm all the way up top look at this this is i'm a big resident big red ball another team oh we're dead we're actually screaming great charging shields hold on big reds up top no i guess they're chased maybe on my way i am taking fire friends faster faster faster oh it's so sad i think he ran into either of the team nice try gg oh my god i'm back where we going gibby caustic oh it's the big guys it's the ultimate tank team apart from me give me corsica oh bangalore okay don't worry about it yay we've only got snipers only snipers allowed hello oh you got a vault that's outrageous get my shields back i don't know he's not going this way for some reason i guess he got the banner now he's zooming we can just we can chase he's gone like we can get him just start shooting him i'm a little bit give me a sec made it to his team oh there's oh that's a full of the team oh god i'm coming back yeah this is this is too scary you're out of heavy i don't have anything but there's some in the middle there's some here heavy ammo here shields are recharging evo shield here don't recharge your shields there's loads here i'm dropping some heavy enemies what are we doing here let's go this way saw someone out there stay focused new kill leader if they're getting cocky they're getting sloppy recharging enemy in sight there's nothing in here i'm gonna have to take a barrel stabilizer that's so sad that he's so sad i don't have these though hold on see this look at this can we third part of this i feel like we're just we're just not playing aggressive interfere oh there we go they're sorry the gift is going for it start loving stuff just honestly it doesn't matter what it is just launch it i'm getting in there oh god oh that's my own rocky there's no way they're not at this end oh come on guys i love this bangalore finisher i just i just love it i have to pop it as many times as possible per game some of these one of these i'm going to get you straight away just in case there's another team here it's been an interesting game gold bag i should probably give that to the gibson but honestly it's not too bad on me it's not too bad on me i kind of i trust myself a little bit i need energy that's the second revive you know so if i keep believing in myself then it's a good idea for me to have a god back too and that's the logic that i'm sticking with do you know what don't you get way more ammo now oh okay i need this i thought it cost 10. maybe they do maybe i think they might have doubled the cast but tripled the amount you get i don't know is that right who knows not me i don't have enough for anything get out all right how much do we get from this 60 i was right actually huge craftsman oh god this always happens i thought that was a gibbeal for a second whoa we got beamed yes this is the best place to be my smoke is actually working against the sea because they can see where i am it's in the corner nice job saying nice you'll be all right i gotcha nice good job team feeling as well oh i said thanks for carrying i'm not even doing like i completely through there with my smoke because they could see us through the smoke and we couldn't see them because they see ultimate and they see a place in a good spot uh zero light rains slight ammo here it's got so many bullets all right i'm i want to run off to capital but i fear that that same thing's going to happen again we're getting a shot right in the back of the head it's quite a scary thing to happen i hear a scrap indeed my friend might be further away unless there's someone else there there you go i think he's just pink in the direction this is the best part about scraps of  coming in late with a load of the good stuff someone close there there's someone here too painless knocking at the door where'd she go is she not in the lava i don't know where she went i'm scared my i'm gonna get too separated from my team so i'm gonna let her leave i guess she went in the lava i heard i heard it go off once uh she might have left she might have left i think she did yeah i'm pretty sure she did because the champion there i don't know if you saw it when i just went past it's like the banner's like here let's relocate here uh it was a bread with like a 20 bomb and she was cracked and she was in the lava like she definitely i'm tempted to go in there they've got white shields guys might be backed up to be honest yeah just behind there back it up back it up terry i've gone back this might be worth sticking he's gonna die otherwise what nice job huge oh god this is last tape last team ow they know i got craven i could just shoot this guy nice now i shouldn't have shot i wasn't dealing with the old craver all right teammate maybe one will be up top nice i didn't get a single one of the last kills but it doesn't matter good job team good job huge i mean me sticking with the gold bag i think might have won us the game because the gibby i think would have died if i didn't have the gold bag because the valkyrie rushed him and then we got third parted by this team with the craber i think i think it clutched up the gold bag pretty sure it did oh nice i didn't have that much damage the corsic's done a lot of damage to but the four revives with the gold bag had to go back for half of them i think
