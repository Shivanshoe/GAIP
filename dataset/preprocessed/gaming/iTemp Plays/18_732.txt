it was skies too twich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are also playing a bit of race who's definitely still a top tier legend on this game we've also been playing recently there are a few areas that I just keep running villages make me miss being a Pathfinder magnet now the main ones are train yard on walls edge and then you've got the cage on Kings Canyon great places to launch yourself to the high ground with your grapple and if you want a mobile counter in these areas you sort just look at the bun having zero fun getting shot up from a rooftop Army's Pathfinder is what I'm trying to say I might pick him back up we'll see having a bit of a character crisis and I thought legends diplomas a wall getting sore today so thank you for watching I Dupree chasey and I hope you enjoyed today's video I sea wall in five and a half seconds my friends all right the keys are at ease my friends I remember the last time I'll actually venture down here together with lunch at the same door that's okay we should both both take separate long routes oh yeah I was gonna go that way it's all right you know you spent your over to this way instead you need the gun it's great he also he's different all right well I've done know if anyone actually learned it here akiza with us I'm hoping that they did I would very much appreciate an early flight it never I've been landing somewhere that's not like a decently populated area all that's been happening oh there we go it's going form he must have seen me run back to Giza where you belong and be sure to say the least icon I can't say that I've never done that the question is where did octane gets him did he actually take the Geezer I'm not gonna come back for that compan team have any shields so I can't assume that he had too many good things in his pockets II bet I looted one build and they came out to try and help his octane friend he's off dangerous brand is his pace looted no doors and unlocked doors I opened even though the octane nice teammate you got me you messed him up our teammates are all good oh okay we shot the same time I mean we both missed a hammer point Mozambique I think which is a bit worrying because I'm gonna gotta level one shields here a mighty Knights when you gotta level one Evo's which is even worse there is Isis friend - this is gonna be fun I heard something poor guy thought he was being stealthy because we weren't moving he didn't have any reference to her ladies footsteps worth and I suppose we were a rampaging elephant will bind us all right well now that he's gonna end up at least now he's got a terrible decision to make does he stay up top okay or does he try and help his Mirage teammate all on the name now I have the high ground which is decent I'll race to think priesthood all day long now shoo I've got the gold helmet I'm a double the voltage stolen loot each I don't even think you got a speed business anymore do they catch that race was the original character that people live with dr. C race the race was the good character before Pathfinder however she's now I near as bad as Pathfinder is named about no say the path mine is bad I'm just saying that they the nurse Linda team were horrendous in comparison why is he so dark in his place good grief can't see a gosh darn things apart from the shimmering lights of the vote luck I opened the vault I'm cold filled in here at this time I'll call back before school peace there as well if you fancy that's not bad thank you oh no bracele throwing around here did you not see the signs no airborne a jewelry in scraps LCC please I'm going to have to put you down and kill you for I'm afraid Lisa knows those the rules I thought that would run in on rock it's not no top hey diagram where the off T you sure someone's got a shot on me that's not good news because that's not this close Tyson there's a third person somewhere I find you come run off into the sunset who was aiming at me maybe it was just the one person darn it we let them get away we've got away with a crime here unbelievable optics here close range contactor target melted that's the only place I can that's the person I thought they're not is it just the person up top can I get on these plates did I get this is so tiny I'm still trying to teammate maybe the last thing I do something that I would hope that I would not go back my friend you at the moment this is a fourth team I think there are two teams in big building there's a team at the entrance to the train toll who's Damon at first glance down that's great thank you please don't shoot me the same way I will send that teammate he's got scope ISA nice that stops him from getting down low it seems ask a question was this guy's teammate as well hold on pigs craft I know whether you the two teams are arguing this gun used to be a lesbian ripped up as well Oh God the icons have been there literally someone above me as well just keep going just keep going let me stop this by shooting him oops as long as he's going away honestly that's fine stand him off okay sure well realize he was down low I could have helped him I was aspiring another teen was running away the team's ranty somewhere August occlusion I've been a GF close no way closer than this this has been interesting scraps or CT to its name I first seen spare body nice these guys have heavy rains as well I wasn't checking Luton mothers looked to other teams around his party a terrible idea this is why keep running keep it going I've been shut out by like three teams I would assume they're on their last legs here okay finish now enjoy camp are my buddies went into friendly decoy I mean you so brazenly Lutz you brave than I am teammate but you're look at that phone each other now thrown dangerous respect this is why I don't have any of the stuff that I I need my guys needs a minute rings not fire but he'd be braver I always think I'm gonna get shot that's the problem right the team's up top who they firing it I assume the other team is up toughest of all I mean shots how many shots did he take the he's he's decoy grenade or decoy that's good it's called eco honest this is where I wish I was Pathfinder I can't shoot through these great I'll tell if you can or cannot show you three I'm not sure if I just missed oh thank you thank you I have 20 then what else am I gonna carry mez I'll hold on to it I don't think this team is up this way I think the other team are just on the opposite ones need to recharge my shoes the trouble here is that I don't really have a fast way across even if I make them what you didn't see didn't even see good grief nice piece up there yes okay even if I take one shields off I can't get out of there quickly enough this is why miss Pathfinder there there are certain areas on okay so I pray but no let's see wait how every teammate messing up I do the same thing yeah [Music] nice Alaska's a topic it's a good thing now he's a top there we go it shouldn't be that difficult it really shouldn't should not have been that difficult these areas exist or season when I'm thinking like Kings Canyon flight cage good it got great fun people camping on top a cage I absolutely despise its cage and it's train station every time I got these two places and diving board to be fair don't even get me started on diving board I just wish I was Pathfinder again when I rock up to these places especially for the people are just set up already it's horrendous trying to get any sort of action I mean that's a decent game concern we start off in gigs ax is a bit of a slow start bear entered with the solid matter kills between us good job teammate we played really well at the end especially juggled a grove pretty good good game so good point thanks for watching I'll see you all next one [Music]
