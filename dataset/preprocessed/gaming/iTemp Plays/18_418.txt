hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we got our hands on the triple take this gun was moved from floor loot into the care package and it received a number of different buffs so the fire rate was increased from 1.2 to 1.3 the time to full charge reduced from 1.1 seconds to one second it retains that charge briefly after leaving your ads the move speed whilst aiming down sight has been increased to match the other marks on weapons and it's an increased speed whilst airborne and aiming downsides as well now because it is a care package weapon it is pretty rare this is the only one i found in season 9 but i did manage to get my first 3 000 damage game on valkyrie thanks to the numerous 100 plus damage headshots that i was pulling off with the triple take there's a reason it is a care package weapon now guys so thank you for watching i do appreciate it be sure to subscribe to the channel if you're new for more season 9 apex legends gameplay i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh okay you guys are real fast nice to know it's the usual lower the kd the fire fast you fly genuinely i reckon on card there is a skill based spawn system that gives the worst players the best ones i'm not lying it's fact god good on the way i hate the vk someone is on your rooftop that's damage i just can't with this gun dude are you using energy um i'm not i have a gold energy mag i would like to try and use it uh if i see uh i see one i will let you know thank you i mean i had a devo at the start but i don't know if i want to use a divo what's the placeholder i would rather use a mozambique and a pk uh i i honestly i suck with the pk oh i'm terrible i'm so bad yeah it feels so awkward and just weird i really don't like you i hate people at least shame not a fan i'm way better with the mastiff yeah i can't use the massive either i can only use the auto shutters yeah i can't use that levolsky oh wait there's a turbo here we want sec i have two well it's kind of spicy i dropped the phoenix if you want it but i don't know if you do oh here um i forgot but i had a turbo so do that thing with the havoc where you like pre-shoot it he had to just start shooting him he went everywhere wait this dude just full sent into the fire i think he's getting on the back that's not the same right um i have two bats let me know if you want them um i have one i'll give you another one yeah you can i got gold oh do you need cells oh no i've got enough thanks okay i do need a little bit of energy but there's some up here comes up here i think he's flying away i don't know i thought he was using it already about to need to crack all of valkyrie's kit it's it's so loud it's i thought they were flying away so i just um flew up there myself let's try and catch them before they did oh mate do you want to try this again do you want to fly from up here directly we can make where are they wait did you go through the rift oh you went through the rift oh did they no wait he's no he's a look at the arrow it's a bug oh peaks camped oh it's so weird it on my screen it looked like he went through the rift oh i've never been so debated in my life how fast is it uh um i'm on 40. oh it's fast pretty sweet i just don't understand why lifelines all take so long six minutes i barely got it i just literally got it like five seconds ago that's so long it's quite a long right yeah calling lifeline back oh i can't do it here it's covered there's a roof mate yeah it's one of those roofs it's one of those pesky rooftops yeah or put that there you enjoy that more scrap more scrap i didn't mean to press that wait present i'll try and cover the i'll get the cover this guy's just shooting me with his arrows there's ten arrows in me are they coming oh mate i've just been is that that's not the same team right all right there's no way i heard footsteps this way so i'll peek this way oh my god they both i don't know they might have yeah they padded on you look oh that's unfortunate ddd this entire time i have no energy mate i'm really struggling got the banner let's bring him home only bow and arrows 140 for two body shots that's just crazy that's a lot of damage in like two seconds three seconds that's just kinda crazy i yeah i thought i'd really let you down but they when they padded i okay whenever i was like padded i didn't feel that's bad i didn't even hear them they just flew over there like 20 shots what are you guys doing though oh god robin over everybody's just got a bow it's crazy what these guys doing man they're just playing zone everyone everyone probably knows where the beacon goes recharging shields and i'm liking that mate this is an absolute tragedy it's an absolute tragedy man please recharging shields idiot nice brought it back let's go dude man that was the messiest gunfight ever like the only reason i took this fight is because they're sitting in docks doing absolutely nothing so i knew they couldn't be that good but i messed like i'm punching the air i'm like messing up my cues i mean this is this is always how it is first week of playing a new version ah yeah if i died those i've been honest i've been so angry with myself i could have played that like 50 percent better that's what matters you won't i don't see anybody i mean oh there's a triple take uh i know i've got loads of energy i've got loads i have 240 i guess i'll i'll let me guys let me go and get this guy's one i thought that guy ran armor but it's a i'm fine with it i'll i'll give you i'll give you this uh all right because actually the squads are kind of lasting uh wait wait wait enough i'm actually still anxious in that gunfight because when i was in the gunfight i was messing up so much that i knew i'd have been so angry if i died and myself i don't mean furious i know i feel i feel those it happens i mean you still want it's all matters yeah it's not always clean there's just a lifeline package over here that's not opened it's humorous they're gonna jump us john we could do we could we could really want that ready to see what people are yeah yeah and i'm fine to oh there you go i'm fine to take range fights with the triple tape yeah i got a gold bow so i'm down too turn around real quick to the back i am down for this i'm more than happy to take this range fight yeah i need to get better with this bow so this is not on the right there's no way they can even be opening fire sometimes further one's like here careful yeah i'm gonna get inside to say 112 on the one in the back he's he's up top he's up top i have to pop shield cells under you go away i've got a triple take he might push me i don't know dropped i think a little bit did you 2033 i didn't think he was going to push like that could still wait but he did his team's honesty i can't peak i can't pee i can't buy yeah there we go i broke 160 166 now oh my god mate this okay i need to practice with valkyrie good grief i'm trying to fly was i was trying to fly so i was holding one button down but i was also trying to let my rockets go and i ended up letting my fly button not holding my rockets so i'm on the ground just aiming rockets or someone you know you know what it is i can oh your lifeline right you've got gold bags as well please don't say they can see me can i see my legs no you got time you got time oh thank you i have no bats i have two cells um it's close okay we don't have to say this angle if you don't want oh i'm kinda he's gonna headshot me at some point i think it might just be a remnant i can i've got alt i mean there's two squads left wing's out i don't see him oh he just craving this guy's the best jesus scared dude i don't want a peek i already got cratered yesterday for the win i don't want it to happen where are you where are they oh no bow and triple take action i could i could alt oh my god if i get craved i

should have just gave it to him i felt bad man i did not play well but i've got 3000 damage like i don't know that's all that matters that's what matters was the scoreboard it's that long range it's
