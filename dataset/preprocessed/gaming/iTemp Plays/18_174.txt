hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in today's video i am using the last gun that was completely open it was the triple take and it was broken for maybe a week at the start of this season and the reason it was so good is mainly because of the headshot multiplier that it had you would land a headshot and he would do like 130 damage and it was ludicrous that's because it used to be a care package weapon and every now and again when apex put guns in and out of the care packages they're kind of unbalanced because they don't remember what they changed beforehand but anyway i've got two games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends right beneath me what guys need right from here it might have been that bloodhound lobo that could have been useful smaller it's done i don't think they're here nope they were they're tough okay they were up top did they drop oh no they're on the sides oh recharging [Music] amazing what you can achieve with teamwork i just gotta pass myself up okay there was scrapping in construction and i think that's where they revived as well release respawned yeah yeah i'm on my way yeah yeah yeah yeah get rid of those doors what do you what kind of game do you think uh doc is gonna make a strategic yeah fps shooter it's 100 gonna have a battery out yeah yeah yeah it doesn't i'll put one million dollars on it having a barrier i mean i don't deny it 70. get him out of here 23 flesh on him 21 special name oh we could have used that to get up there um horizon who cares yeah you can just go up we'll see cracks on one of them i think it's ash going for the flanker off the flanker wait she just was right to you but she's running on the road using the decoy escape no where's that team like the path go i don't know i never even saw bath he was up here was he though he was reloading on perch like a decorative gargoyle where did the ship oh the ship came from west didn't it we could just run that way yup yup i'm down where's where where did you sing east west west northwest north west west i got three times on the triple take oh you say that like what your thoughts on that no i'm just wondering what your thoughts were why'd you say it with that tone let's enjoy your thoughts where i thought you'd be like mad at me or something you know i'm scared to i want to be scared great one i was scared making contact here firing practice this week rescue how do you see not die there come on it's a clean pk shot uh what are you talking about and how bad was my loot i had a gray bag oh great bag oh bolt bk oh some of the boys landed on me check out that replicator coming in boys let's throw the boys on me but i'm backing up i'm whacking them though like i'm believing stop whacking him you're in here yeah i don't know oh we were retreating suffers it no i'm surprised i said i love this long to be honest with you all this is a bonus from that one oh you got it shoot that life line in the face oh they're barely resin where inside inside though on the door i think i should get your banner either i probably could have that's fine i don't know where she was like we were running together the whole time and then when i ran in like she just i don't know where she went i don't know what happened so otherwise i would have backed up she was really weak i think so she altered away uh i think that's where she got shot from you guys are lucky i thought we were running away i sort of left her zone's closing you can hold that uh the tracks shoot him from up there good idea i have all the energy in the world it's not another team to you yeah the lifeline out here what all right just some hindsight here uh unfortunately so far i know i didn't realize that our teammate got sniped in the back but the second team eventually made it to us the lifeline i think it was a maybe a wraith and a bangalore that team sniped our teammate in the backs they had to leave so far solo i could have used my ultimate far sooner and i could have grabbed so far's banner very easily just hindsight things though it's always good to look back anyway i've got a second game here for you i'm so damn bad i might just play mason keyboard oh you should do it you should do it i've gotten better i'm not like i feel like i've gotten a lot better than before but still like these lobbies are so they're so hard that tough i'm not i'm not that uh i'm not there yet especially like close range tracking is hard no no no okay that tracking is really so tough that's the hardest thing over there 63 cracks okay 111 oh my god mate what the heck's that that's one zoom in someone's in here i think oh oh teammates blast him who's he blasting his blood dude on the floor oh my god i thought that was you never catch me doing that that's true i'm doing a triple taking thing that's what i'm doing this gun used to be the best i don't know maybe that's good this gun shoots three bullets in one i don't know you you had it with the first one okay big vague titles vague like very like non-descriptive titles are the way to go with apex that's right oh wasn't it surprised um i mean they are in here but i'm not like in immediate danger that's what i'm saying i'm not saying i'm good would you like help this is the better question i mean if you're in a scrap you're fine you don't have to come over i can't i mean you know me i'm just kind of doing stuff i'm gonna help you they are in here you seem like you want it come on come on come on i don't need help i'm good i'm good the screen was nothing and i didn't mean anything dude desperate for help don't worry the boy so far didn't mean anything all dead all right i'm out okay we got him in my defense the best friend ever well i did injure them for you i got deceased they were both full shield and hell yeah no no they weren't full health though they shielded they were both maximum 20 health very fast [Applause] oh my god i made it wait are they they're they weren't here they're running they're literally not i don't know i'm not chasing not enough time for that bomb bomb 23 flesh 23 flesh on this guy just just try it just try whack him ready bam 23 flesh 23 flesh come on that was the single take only one of the bodies was landing i think they're coming towards us actually yeah yeah they're right here all right for us uh yeah let me put up a rope hold on we're gonna rope up hold oh that's a bad on mate save your right save your rope okay opening fire what's gold one is gold oh rudy can see you can see he's whacking ring will be closing is he doing it too no he's shot i'm recharging my shield i don't like doing that anymore ah yeah you do i don't i feel bad i actually this guy came out of nowhere i'm just i have software that's office and go back yeah nice that's your name i got lasered when i turned that corner i couldn't see him through his own through his finger you know just relax i got everything and you're like right on the edge of zone looking i'll i feel like that's when it's the worst and it was in the closet guts but when you're like on the edge looking into zone like it's easier you can see like you see more it's so weird supposed to change that when i hit him for twenty i don't i don't really understand what was going [Music] you actually would though that's the crazy part oh my god they're crafting right in front of me over there shoot him there's no way you left me down here without attack uh yeah sorry i can't see mate because they're crafting like eight things i'm farming i'm farming i'm farming i'm missing i'm trying to farm uh i can i can queue up now oh you made it oh there's a team that ran away wanna see my singularity are they still near that i don't know if that's going to do anything now they're at the train cars poor guys but one's got blade big punch angle or what it's a full team i'm young down to punch all three of them okay i'm done i hope it's not a couple it's a trio hey one one in the back was got a rampage he's got a rabbit he's got a rabbit oh he's joking ah on the mountain so confused like that fuse saved every grenade for that final battle all right that was kind of fun that was fun you are the apex champions it's probably a family of three three generations the son the dad the grand the grandparent like an entire generation embarrassed nice nice nights i had niners i feel so bad i had nine punches
