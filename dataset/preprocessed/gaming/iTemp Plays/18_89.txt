hey ring's closing and we are all in the danger hey what's up guys it's welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and for about a day if you were playing rampart you had the luxury of an uninten how do you say unintended unintentional buff to her sheila ultimate ability now what this buff did was it allowed you to play more aggressively because i think it was around a 30 reduction in the charge of time to the mobile sheila turret now that was the biggest problem to sheila was that if you were caught trying to charge it up if you were caught trying to play aggressive and maneuver with it you were just dead it would take so long in one of the games that happened today i have the buff and the other game they reverted this buff it's gone you can't do it anymore now what's weird about this to me is the fact that it wasn't just a mistake like oh we made it so you never charge it up like they put it to 100 seconds and it wasn't like they made it zero seconds whereas instant it was a 30 reduction which i think is indicative of a potential future buff to sheila because i think that's actually i mean it made it really fun i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah 100 fans are going this way well skill base is definitely crank there's like seven diamond players okay i mean i've got good stuff still but i'm still raging that's a good shot i'm here for 60 flash reloading my shields oh oh man i can hear a bunch of fights going on salvage obtains yeah we gotta go gauntlet that's that's yes they are what's going on i need to heal charging my shoes hours the valkyrie had purple she's scared of sheila he punched me off [Laughter] have 100 heavy mate don't worry about it thank you though okay putting up some amped covered yeah they're backing up oh man i actually love sheila at the moment it's so funny this is so good dude they're going to this compound okay i missed get back here oh come on oh they are running running i'm gonna get gibby alton in a sec i'm gonna run right through it yes but there's still someone over to the to the right they kind of split yo you should try to shoot the guy on the rope he's gonna be the last guy on the road okay i'm taking it now i'll get some high ground oh god that wasn't lucky that's him i want to take this rope across yeah yeah yeah i'll try and protect you his teammates should be coming this way i assume they're kind of running it sounded like a gun leveled up yeah yeah what was that i i heard that audio too my shots nice shots that's huge i'm gonna be honest i have no idea where this guy went yeah i don't know where that guy went this guy just insecure so i assume he's nowhere in there the audio since this update has been really wonky yeah it's going to be strange i don't know what they changed but they changed something it's been weird he's right here he had some good shots too but yours are just bad you know thank you i can't hop down there teammate behind thanks yes nice good shot just about uh that guy's cracked that bangalore we've got 40 seconds on teammates banner too my way down there it's safer for me to go grab it didn't you okay there's a guy on the on the crowd yeah he has teammates back there too right now go for it it's gonna stay safe i'm making the maneuver i'll call you back kind of they can respond to the same so it should be okay dude that was so sick frag out frag out dust in a flag he went off the left side someone just jumped down i have

oh my god i'm absolutely frightened 10 seconds rings close we got this another one down the aisle so i'll put a shield there like an idiot i'm gonna see if i can push him on the other side yeah very easy oh he ran this way here i need to craft some splits i'll see him give him some recharge five on him oh my can he do that high five headshot where is he he's behind this no he's over here watch my back i'm a little disappointed with teammate's behavior that's kind of he didn't know i guess but that is true no he definitely didn't know but it's still his fault yes i had to use the rest of the bullets so i just choose box for this the only it's the only proper thing to do i'm pretty sure when it was also done he crafted bats on top of that too yeah he may have he's pretty good oh no i just drew my old thing they might still be here it might be there's a bread too i saw is i think he backed up oh drank kevin the horizon is cracked up there i'm out of sheila sheila's all busted well now
