hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going to be using a variety of weapons because recently on my channel it's been a lot of wingman's a lot of i9's r301s and vaults and i don't use these guns every single game but the games i do use them because i'm more comfortable with these weapons and because they're just inherently good they have a higher chance of being good games and therefore have a higher chance of being uploaded to my channel a disproportionate amount if that makes any sense like i haven't used the mastiff since 1999 so in the first game i paired it with an alternator and in the second game i was testing out the either eight a gun i've wanted to use more this whole season so hopefully you enjoy it thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i mean oh there's about 18 people i'm not going up top no i think i got baited by mirage faded out of my mind oh my god are they slipped up i don't have a gun there's somebody here we're struggling my guns suck oh they have everything yeah yeah yeah they would with that loose bear i'm coming up i'm coming up oh someone got the party taking them out i'm just so bad he's below one's below so i tried to first your kill well i was mad at that because he took my arm ah my i'm so bad there's someone there's someone that kept the rope i promised uh don't know what's happening five i mean she's struggling i'm just chilling i'm fine she's not healed for like a good 30 seconds she picks struggling thank you yeah you're good you're good uh there's one thing about this game i just cannot help myself from looting i just can't everything just looks so pretty you could be walking but that's why lobe is good because you can walk past the bean and know that there's nothing good in there yeah but even then like sometimes it looks kind of like mushy from a certain distance so i have to go you can see it from like 10 miles out so i have to run over there and just check to make sure that it's something just to get your snipers go yes i reckon if you zoom in on it you should be able to ping it from a distance so you can see what it is yeah i agree if you want to go up top there's a they just want to yeah a couple of them did at least mirage i just got destroyed this is a separate team with a charge rifle by the way is she okay i'm rosie big hails took out an enemy reloading are you able to get to it let's not pad or anything show just going only one guy right i don't know oh my god are

full team dude how are you shooting me from this angle what's this three people uh yeah that's a full team over there and then there's uh which is i think it's just a solo above you or maybe it's a bureau reloading okay the car man i'm gonna try and defend your back i don't know why nobody's pushing oh they're going up now i have a phoenix if you need it i got you friends opening fire he put it

yeah it's like a new new new team this way i think he i down this guy i think he just oh my god dude i'm this is the last two squads okay i think this is i think there's only one team here i killed the path okay oh then yeah i think it's just a one full squad up top yeah it's a duo i'm gonna try and get that way and just go this way oh lifeline's one look at all the boxes i mean that was all you it wasn't i don't really do much we're going to lose there to a team that just sat like they landed rift like he's thinking where the heck not really sorry oh wait we need to sort of go they landed like docks or something and haven't seen the single team but they're looted they've been looting for the past 15 minutes if you like if you land in the wrong place on the olympus you can go the full game without really seeing anyone oh yeah it's just there's so much rng involved in this map fortnite was the game for like custom button remapping you've got people like editing with the big button on the ps4 controller yeah i remember that i was i was like i was trying all that stuff too i had what did i have i had l3 as like pickaxe i had auto screen on and i had like eddie on trying like it was just every yeah i um i even had a what's it called i would try that and like that's when i started playing claw because i would play claw and then i would click like the the pad the little little black pad on the ds4 and i would use that to like edit oh doctor yeah yeah i've seen people use that as edit too because it's really easy oh he's got a triple talkie that's scary they've just been
