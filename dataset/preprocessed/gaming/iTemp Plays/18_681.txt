hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and as we are all aware pathfinder's grapple cooldown was increased from 15 seconds to 35 seconds in season five and it still blows my mind to this day but they increased it by so much but i think one of the reasons they did it is because they were releasing loba at the time and she of course has an ability which gives her mobility so they didn't want pathfinder to just overshadow her but it turns out the lobe of really isn't all that good octane still isn't all that good and pathfinder is a shadow of his former self so what i'm saying here is bring back mobility to apex legends one of the best things about this game is the movement and nothing is more fun and spider manning it around the map as pathfinder thinking about it however the more mobility that's in the game the quicker the games go because everyone can get to that third party a little bit quicker and this is a bit of a problem in apex at the moment but they could counteract this by also decreasing the distance that you can hear gunshots to help reduce third parties now i still play pathfinder when i play with so far and janks because i need the mobility to keep up with these guys they loot for about three quarters of a second i believe and then they're off i'd love to see a little bit of fine tuning on pathfinder in season six whenever there's a new season they always fine-tune some of the legends and i've just got a feeling that we're gonna see maybe just like a 28 second call down that would be that'll be amazing it's not as good as 15 but that was a little bit overpowered anyway i'm renting thank you for watching i'll see you one of five and a half seconds my friends oh two teams went in um alternator mozambique all right 45 i'm big scrap up top into you guys yeah no armor no armor awesome dude i'm gonna die i've got an alternator no armor i'm gonna push him in the back i'm pushing him in the middle i can't even push these angle jenks i can check it though i got classic nice job just the bang alert oh he got gas off i'm gonna try i just want an armor yeah it is it's a little depressing that was me like the first what how many games today i have no health heals for you or me i have i have some i have two syringes and i make it i'm dropping here two syringes in the medkit right there thank you thank you what was it like oh do you wanna drop in the syringes oh yeah yeah here no no no here let me give you i'll give you the med kit because um i'll regen i think they're outside here too coming over just trying to get an angle on them before they oh they asked me i just sat up top i would assume on your cracks being shot by me watching the other door still got it nice job hey i didn't realize that was your octane pad i thought it was it wasn't yeah that was theirs i was there to say this one this one is mine this one right here is mine uh there's a g7

sudden they just all turned the corner i couldn't see anything because i threw a thermite in there which was a bit of a worked out though good job yeah we're back let me know if you've seen anyone from the sky i'll come back another team another team another team right now which way i didn't have any ammo either is there a classic anywhere yeah there's one in this one i think it's nice thank

team no how's it beautiful where is he i've known the roof on me oh is he oh skull piercer look at that there you go all right i'm gonna keep a lookout we made a lot of noise if another team doesn't push us i'd be very surprised me too can't believe i didn't get a kill from that like you might have too much yeah i've stemmed about 14 times this game so i'm facing yeah they're just chilling over there i'm gonna give me a gold priority yeah they have teamwork i'm facing back i'm good yeah that's a rough one did we we never made this rob did we no no this is a oh this one here yeah that was mine that's when i rushed the bloodhound because i he was really weak and then he just jumped off oh that's why you started depressing you though right oh yeah where did that come from only 30 seconds left oh yeah that's what i was talking about oh okay yeah over here on this one knocking something good this way trying to get behind them boys like if you want to like do anything you gotta like focus bro yeah i feel like i gotta i really gotta try we play we play with so far and i literally have to like focus to get any kills i'm sorry i'm so sorry you're too good i'm sorry don't be sorry what do you mean i'm so i'm so locked in in the soloq mentality that i'm just like kill everything thanks what about me i'm also pop i'm also popping everywhere yeah you are but reclined at 90 degrees yeah i don't know i don't know how to kick back i'm trying i'm just not as good no command nah that's insane how many you got i'm not even kill leader um i have ten i have uh f4 nice isn't too bad the star was terrible for me too i went down like three times in a row these boys are scrapping i got my uh i'll do this one here anyway opening fire this lobby actually this is like the last the the most

the bloodhound down the qb nice i hear him shielding over here by me but i'm just gonna leave him i don't really care i'm not going down there i can't get up easily new squad on me i guess oh the red pushing i have no shield bats if you guys send them back i'll be at the totem yeah i'm gonna die switching the enemies we've been trying too hard for that we're in full try hard mode right now but very full try hard mode pretty sure i downed you guys already i literally have not gotten a kill in like 12 hours i'm sorry i haven't done anything do not say sorry i do have 299 so it's kind of nice i'm octane so it's not really fair it's so rare now that i have good games so this has been a good one for everyone i think yeah this is so much action yeah this is this is like they're over here they're just shooting in the sky i can't remember the last time i had a game like this don't end it like this come on fellas i need to swim a little bit like come on boys is this why the lobby's been like still alive yeah they're just tuning in the air i'm gonna shoot them they just ruined the whole vibe of the game just killed them you've got white up you've got white shield you've been saying thai game waiting i'm fuming yeah i'm just gonna laser them i'm not even gonna bother i could land a shot i would hit you you know i'd shoot you sorry buddy i don't have time for this nice dude they didn't even shoot back are you like come on you're so anticlimactic for a video how long have you spent trying to get a good game so far how long dude i have how many days how many games how many hours just to end of finally a good game like that i have not had a good game like that in a very very long time man give us some time dude give us a streamer mode we all dude we all had a good game
