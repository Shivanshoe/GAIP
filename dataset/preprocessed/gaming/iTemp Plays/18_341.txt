hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i have my fastest game of world's edge that i've ever had it was a sub 8 minute win what's edge is my favorite map on apex but i'm still really happy that they're mixing it up in season 10 with some new areas that look incredible and very very intricate actually i'm happy about this just because even world's edge where the lobbies usually last decently long is suffering from a severe case of everyone land in the big city and have a humongous scrap syndrome so hopefully these new areas that we are getting in season 10 help spread the players across the map more evenly and we get more of a survival feeling back in apex legends public games thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm going to uh my place that i drop every time well no if you land a broken mate i'm actually going to stand here all the time are you kidding i've literally never seen you land here from that last game all you do is land at market and take my guns you are you are having a laugh all that happens you're having a giggle mate that's what you're doing i'm gonna use an alternator and i'm still gonna drop 3k damage let's go right now it's good you just uploaded a video saying it was good so i'm doing it again again double oh i'm dead i'm here i can't see what i'm aiming at i've got no sight i didn't do anything but huge i wasn't even worried i saw someone kill extended energy back here i wasn't even worried i need any sight at all for a g7 literally i'll take anything give me a digital threat i'll make it work i need all the light ammo but there's none i can give you someone using oh yeah here you go uh yeah oh can't get in there a little bit more i've only got 23 there but with a g7 that's like at least three squad wipes what's your secondary vault with 100 ammo okay oh i don't know what was happening i'm pretty sure that was just trying his absolute hardest to be afk and i just kept shooting him he was leaving he's got delivery coming he kept like running into corners and then just not moving recharging i'll use it to get over there oh okay he's on call then man you know me yeah yeah just shoot me back one uh i don't know i shot him before you though i shot him before you even knew he was in existence saved your life actually no you didn't i was covered out of your mind he's destroying you was i yes there's damage this entire just gave me plastic i should have killed the guy that's on the floor first i uh one of the reasons why i like the alternator so much is because even without attachment it's still really good oh yeah yeah i love landing on the alternator come on come on i have six kills and 600 damage i'm repairing myself well i haven't first anyone killed it no i thirsty one guy yeah there's a lot a lot of people just a ridiculous amount that's a fabrication i don't know what's going on are there people over here uh yeah no no that's not on this map at all no i'm climbing this look at me go i'm all the way oh man how do people play with that aim you see you three times but it was like out of 12 shots uh leaving cap is always a terrible idea it is but i get bored i know what you guys see you got rope i do harvester is sorting people are firing the train train you can wrap around you there eventually i don't know what's happening for teammate just no mobility just trying to keep up with two mobility legends is using everything that they possibly can i thought one times g7 fiend mate this is crazy hey you say that and you never use it arenas ever but it matters ah they're all aiming to me come on man is there a team uh in the tunnel i don't think so unless they're trying to further us charging on my shield where people are oh just here let's go here rogers one no oh come on guys come on guys let's all kill me please don't look at me please don't look at me he's beyond one there's damage this is taking too long nailed that whole squad don't slow down that was such a short game that was first oh no no dude he just walked up to the last second oh i said good job guys gg you are the apex champions nice that was such a short world's edge game oh no that's the old one oh that was the wrong one the heck was that me i i i pressed the wrong one seven minute game yes a seven minutes how are these guys so fast i just took all of that i'm sorry now you're good i was gonna leave it to you there's a three or one in here but that's cracked guy mate huge uh yeah we have to find the team and use half your resources kind of tough it's only a small place i got wingman i'll think there's a lot of rocks oh that's the dream wait where i don't know i just saw it going off somewhere oh because we got to find out this main mission yep i have a blue light mag i'm using wingman vault thank you i don't know if you need heavy though that's someone on me nice dead that was kind of kind of impressive you like that one i think i think i like that one more than the other one i don't know like they're all really impressive stuff so yeah they are they're looking for are you doing all that and not top shaving i don't know i'm just a master at this oh i didn't hear i think he went back up though already saw the devastation at the bottom of the set at the bottom uh wanted no part of it absolutely i think he died mate what did this just fall from the sky or something just fell from the sky i'm not lying to you oh are you serious maybe he did maybe he did leave at an all night with a good on my mama and a purple mag wow i just gave up well i'm dropping a pad here see the fear i put in his heart no please no oh my god oh it's you hello oh that's what happens in the two times hey [Laughter] i'm terrified for my life i've never been so scared i think we're the biggest moves where you going there's no way they're getting there that way no i'm scared i don't want to be over that's a terrible spot what do you mean are you scared we're gonna be here instantly i just bumped so much damage from us that they're gonna come with red shields wait what whoa man do we miss a bunch of tasers or something ten seconds the ring is fairly close there's a crypto yeah are you sure wait he's got white 50 45 see if he shoots me he doesn't even realize i'm see here he surprise me uh i think it's two solos is the saddle right somewhere that's all it been to i'm not no they're already on the ground i just rocked up i see more damage to you than i've had the entire game uh i've been doing i have like a solid 100 damage per kill got 250. this guy's throwing hands he's just punching the arrows yeah oh oh my god stand in front of me much there's no way you catch him i mean he's gonna run right towards me let's do him man my phone's on right run around almost is i don't think that's lying this is rick astley nice i stick he just took so much damage i like pulled him back into it that was great it's great giving my shields a recharge might you have any bats uh i have four i have thirteen i'm trying to you're serious shield wait hold on hold on shield wait don't don't don't pick it up i want to see it i want to see if you actually have that much where did you get all this from your kills yeah i can't carry this much chill it's so hard last one okay okay i i i he's not one i've hit him like 15 times what are you talking about i think for like 130 mate one just means somewhat weak just playing only hit one shot i thought yes come on man oh dude i'm sorry i'm sorry i'll do that i'm going to use one of my eight bats man come on i have a phoenix kit that i tried dropping you four games ago this is crazy waste of resources you have a creeper no family recharging shield okay this is getting destroyed by the re not because the guy hit me first and then this guy shot me in the sight ah you're right is that where it ends yes came over that's what i was hoping for i'm leaving okay where's he over there he's over there over there let me see him punch him out just show him i don't even see him right here oh it's trying to average like 100 amateur kills what's up what are these games you are the apex champions poor guy that does feel bad yeah that does feel bad that's kind of mean honestly honestly that's what i mean
