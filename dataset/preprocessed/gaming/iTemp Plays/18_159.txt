hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more 86 legends of course and the way that the second game here that i have for you today ended is a forgotten art in apex legends it used to be that everyone at one point wanted to box you at the end and it hasn't happened to me in probably over a year but it did it finally happened again and i took the opportunity with both hands and i used those hands to box him and i was kicking him as well it was crazy hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends why don't we have a third teammate it doesn't even say disconnected the game just didn't give us one mind you hold on i've got an idea i can create our third teammate out of thin air there he goes two of them now we're a team of four team of six team of six oh sorry teammate you can take the rest of the building i've got a bk i'm fine okay they're over that way a big scrapping of construction for some reason why would anyone land there it's absolutely on me oh i'll take this going to miss every shot that's the plan that's the dream they're crafting enough i'm actually crafting at the start of the game i'll just try to say whoever won't help me if this guy's crafting take him not me hit me so hard sold oh boy [Music] reloading enemies look at you reloading sending out my decoy as much as you do friends all right let's go third by some people there's 20 people left i took so long to kill that one guy there's 20 people left what's edge that's not the gun i'll get free watson target spotted god me i have a banner someone's getting this squad back they would use that one i might just stick it there's a lot of things happening [Applause] there's a death box in this blue container the one i'm looking at there's a death box in there this watson jenny's still here oh that one i mean either either was fine i'm gonna have a scrap i love throwables now i i never used to pick him up but i actually love throwables hello spry kicking just cry kicking on wednesday afternoon what's he doing i'm not watson i mean uh obviously i mean a mirage you know i'm slowing my shots oh my god oh she's levied i thought 120 is as she's going over the top i want my first damage marking our surroundings please no one kill me oh god decoy over there uh what do i need i need bats that's in a bit of shotgun perhaps maybe a tiny bit heavy oh that way i have the fences oh my god when did he get here try to leave closing in one minute [Music] i may wait a little bit too long to jump out of the ship i'm gonna i'm gonna be honest but i've got a balloon a nine-nine i need some more bullets white rhymes it's tremendous reloading one two [Music] yeah i need a bit of light i need a phoenix kit uh did i get the bat i did recharging i'm going to save it on there's a peak in here i'll take this instead let's be honest i ended a few shots there unbelievably i i've eight it's only eight but it's something at the start of the game i think he might have a wingman too that's enough with the wingman that helps thank you some sad enemy spotted it looks small oh they've never missed it just gotta got one spotted i probably come out to my team i'm coming yeah that big scrapping oh my god it's that one bad guy over there now i need to fall off i'm pretending i've got blue i'm not healing i'm dead ignate i don't think he's going to do anything this is the other side of the wall i'm still trying nice [Music] switch that for that so i get some extra bullets i'd say every time otherwise someone is going to ridicule me for it i'm really hoping this is a gun because i've got a naked pk on my back come with just any gun and i'll use it any any one of them i'm extending heavy this guy or a shotgun vault yes that's what i needed i can switch to that for maybe an r301 or a g7 skate if you're still on the ground if only that'd be such a good combination hey look at this or at least there's a lot of fire the heck was that noise yeah yeah yeah yeah here we go got them nice shot i didn't mean to let go i was gonna do a sky one i was trying to line up a little bit he'd be ejected see where did he go where'd the ejector see go don't tell me he lobbed into the i think okay we are both terrible thrones apparently got a bad guy there's one right here i need i got everything out of control was that the team that revived he said different team evo shield here level three is that correct i don't know if it is charging okay i've got an alternator i have a lot of bullets i have so many shield cells it's unbelievable i need an extended heavy mac i shall be on the lookout my friend if i see one i will let you know someone replicator here follow me killed it's probably nothing right in the gold box probably but i still want to know what he's because i'll never know otherwise faking him out with a decoy fox wants to beat me there and he's abusive here boosted loader hey excited heavy maybe extended heavy mag here level three that's the box for this man he's a happy guy enemy spotted he looks small i should fire this guy bam bam bam like take his shields off i miss it i don't realize i'm here just yet because they can just go up top and it'll be really annoying did he see me yeah someone's out there yeah i've already seen this by now this way times a little bit zoomed in there giving my shield to recharge hoping they can't just seal chop they've seen i got red and one of them has white ones got blue you have no shields or what give him my shield oh i thought he's going either way my death perception is terrible well they they have to come back this way escape them more friends are coming together it's a different team with a random caustic track i am repairing myself they need she's got purple oh you get that kill oh wait that's my decoy i'm an idiot two minutes to find other people i think well they're shooting this way no so it can't be that not that bad i literally just tried to let my teammate get a kill it was my decoy reloading enemy down does she have a gold knock down i'm pretty sure there were three of them beforehand i reckon this is their teammate that was sourced took over this way enemy killed i took care of it don't worry this isn't a good spot for us because we can easily get gate kept i think we go right side to staging let's move that way unless you want to go through the tunnel i guess which will be i don't know i only got one minute i'm gonna craft some llama first five teams left so what four teams left and eight people there's one solo three teams left and seven people makes sense they're gonna get banner but the only place they can really respawn is here i mean there's one more if they want to go through tunnel bit of a risk i think optics here close range got one here really close let's check out over there do not mess with watson it's a watson and a corsica i don't think we push that it's a waste of i am time fire friends giving my shields a recharge this is a waste of time all right lucky us we're already inside this next ring do something big there opening fire on the enemy over here don't mind i guess we can buy this they just i don't know how they lose that i really do not know how they lose that situation it's actually kind of impressive to be honest with you i think one of the teams is solo so we should probably get involved in this you see the last two proper teams i think i thought it for you oh he's teammate i'm gonna take this nade no i'm not i'm gonna follow teammates oh the path two squads left and i'm on my own nothing stressful about this at all have the banner someone's getting this squad back in the crafter i don't have enough crafting mats in the crafter but i don't have enough crafting mats donnie finally stop them from using the respawn beaker match or something you know i'm doing this in ages i haven't done it in ages hey drop your armor drop your arm back and i'm talking to myself fantastic it's been so long since i did a boxing match come on for the win are you not chopping your armor oh my god oh my gosh okay well i didn't know you did no no stop stop stop ringing closes and i'm still talking to myself heal a peel or peel up here look he's gonna go i'm i'm keeping one good i'm keeping one good give me this 30 seconds that has to go getting hurt over here go bamboozle 10 seconds till rain closes maybe in progress sending out my decoy yes let's go let's go huge that was so stupid that was so stupid i was the worst organized boxing fight of all time you are the apex champions oh man did you all played oh man that was close that was close i deserve that win though i feel like we deserve that win as a team well played everyone
