hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the other day i was looking at the character select screen or the legend select screen here on apex and i thought to myself which of these legends am i the worst at and i came to the conclusion that it's watson i'm terrible at watson she does not suit my play style my fences are terrible and my watson generator placement is incredible i'm just not good at playing watson but there is only one way to improve and that is to play her and and just try your best so here we are i have two good games here for you today i hope you enjoy them thank you for watching i'll see you all five and a half seconds my friends i want my heirlooms yep i could use that what will happen because i've got more heirlooms than are in the game i have pathfinder magazine i think lifeline and octane i've i've been on console and pc i feel like if you have if you have duplicates like nothing should happen but level two i don't know i don't know i should give me some money back that'll never happen yeah that would never happen no they should let me jaw wield them give me two octane stims

fire out zipline deployed voting out of the trident we brought this one okay here i damn one of them what just happened i don't know we came coming crazy with the car wait a shot what was that it went this way come on this way we are inside the next ring she might run into my crazy fences oh my god he tries to go back up there couldn't be any uh good luck to you my friends yes okay the velcro is one on the other side i'm gonna revive teammate oh she's climbing up top i think the enemies are shooting at me forget about me they had strawberry and banana look in the feed time's over look at that huh there's no way that's it there was there was three teams that lined up right where is people oh no are we really annoying i know no one's here what i'm going to put the fences down on the rope even though no one's here i hate you as if this place doesn't suck enough yep guess what i've got on my first beam by the way but i got a car with a purple mag and a purple barrel stabilizer that's actually huge dude the car is really the only gun that i feel like i need to have a stab on me too the recoil is kind of crazy it is my pink was supremely accurate like an atab temping okay a little bit further along nevermind damn that far someone hit my fence i guess that's what they've done someone hit my fence antenna if you want to go back no just oh man i mean listen i i'm down to go back to antenna if you that's what you really want that's good i'm a team player okay i mean no stop stop online wait who's he fighting there was a team this way somewhere i think that's who was sniping you oh my god someone's in here hold on let me help you you're the kill leader congratulations if we're lucky the team i hit with my fence i still stunned so and i'm back in the game she's such a bonehead i'm i'm on the way ping the arrows he says i'll try i yeah i mean that's all doing all this extra looting for arrows i can't even find any oh i'll take the line i guess you've got a bow check nobody runs a bow around here so i can't find anything from bodies [Music] on the roof is repairing my damages that's one thing i don't like about elven rings when i'm when i'm bowing around people right and then i don't get my my arrows back what's going on there you know richard you can easily just hop in the crafting mini and craft your arrows back oh okay well that makes sense yeah listen i wouldn't expect it from a little elden ring noob like you but i'm an elden lord okay i got your back i killed the cat the other day so i'm pretty good you know what i killed that robot cat what the hell would ralph think about that well he's not a robot he's only cat so i don't think he's mine uh i've got to admit as well very shameful on my end i started doing that really cheesy roon farm listen you are yo to your left players great the ring is closed that's okay though no shame in doing a little farm it's your first souls game i did a lot of farming i couldn't be bothered but do you know what farm is no it's one with the ball but full spawns and [Music] 2 000 to go are you the path are they getting on the back i think give me that's a recharge oh engage on the back [Music] good shots mate sorry i picked him up i tried to get him out of there because they were sort of in the open flanking as well that's my fault mate i'll try to grab him for you because the box is in the open he smoked the box uh hey thanks danny dude there's nobody on literally 180 uh come on come on i just i knew i was gonna die i don't think i had time to do anything so i just went for it you know come on come on could you hit that guy i think he's like it wasn't much because he was in a fight with that teammate so i think that's you know sort of nice oh look at that batteries do you need um do you want this ball uh oh no i'm okay thank you i should have told you i took those bats i did only die for it repair it no big deal mate getting yours back one minute tremendous and i was able to get my arrows back i played this entire game with 12 arrows it's recycling this man cares about the environment i just keep picking them back up i played this entire game with 12 arrows it's incredible the greenest man of all time hostile in the water good spot there's another one on the far left [Music] yeah please do that he's still shooting me it's ridiculous nice what's he doing he's just jumping in the water he's going he's going for a paddle damage farm oh this is a big punch angle big punch angle big punch where is it good job find that rocker thank you unless he kept running punching don't touch strafe don't you dare tap straight around around the tree around the tree yeah no idea what's going on hopefully do i play and all it took was me to let jax die clutch up let's go good get farmed you're the worst teammate in the world in so far i actually talked about that you are actually the worst are you kidding are you kidding
