hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are doing a i guess a reaction to the dark depths event trailer that we got earlier on today this is an event coming into apex on the 11th of january so five days from now next tuesday it should be here i think it's a tuesday usually the updates are a tuesday but anyway we get a load of new skins we've got one for horizon there there is one for uh i think revenant i think there's one for ramper as you can see there's the lifelong one i think the best one is probably the fused one so those are the skins um but the biggest piece of content in this event is actually going to be the new arena's map habitat which is perfectly synced up now i'll be honest this map does look really nice it looks amazing if this was like a proper poi on the map on like storm points i'd be so excited to play it but because it's arenas which is a gamer that i haven't played since 1997 maybe the latest i don't like arenas i don't know why it doesn't tickle my fancy doesn't get me interested that much at all something about the 3v3 something i like about apex actually and i know this is going to be controversial is the big scale fight where you do get third-party which is frustrating but when you come on top of those big scale fights where there's like five or six teams at scrap it all and you actually win and you survive by the slither of your teeth those are the best games they feel the best and you go out to new windows but arena the 3v3 it's very limited it's very short it's very a small scale it's just not something that i really enjoy however i am sure there are a lot of people watching this that do enjoy arenas that will like the look of the new map um i think i might have been hoping for a little bit too much here because i was actually hoping because we are close to season 12 than we are at the start of season 11 we are over halfway through i was hoping for like a town takeover at this point but i guess we did just go through the uh the christmas period and it's the new year now so hopefully that should be coming within the next two or three weeks as i would expect so thanks for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds with some gameplay my friends that place is even worse uh it's better than this no it's not a hundred percent it is no this place sucks yes i agree again this place does suck i agree i have a mozambique oh this is awful this is so bad i'd like to apologize hemlock here i'll take i that a car so this has not gotten any better it all sucks probably worse actually i don't have any aims these because this window has a bar in it just letting you know those the vibes mate not lucky us we're already inside this next ring hey down low i took care of it don't worry reloading this place is the best shield pretending yeah this place kind of sucks wait look at that oh wow landed on my head i thought it was a full time terrified need to recharge my shoes this way listen let's move here that's where we should have won no like wingman vault now with so many bullets look at this look at this yes i don't know if you need heavy i have 76 before my wingman sir uh that's right okay interesting phase maneuver okay explain why speed like enough explanation or no i mean we're going to do it for all the attachments though i got only cells and stuff on mine uh yes i got a blue a purple i will say i find this way yes look at those crafting mats i mean that's the only reason i was doing it we're going back to craft or what i would like to have the squads remain it be morphine dial isn't even mean i'm not even reading that our teammate i just like looking at the name sometimes boy i like that one oh there was a bat in there that i didn't pick up and i don't have bats the weak man never ever needs to charge my shield or like it fire yeah hit by the wing man that's the survive it should be i'm trying to do more often are you didn't think this in here for me oh what frank grenade sorry that you already had some i had a termite get it together alternator who's the loader please alternator loosely loader if you're not taking it i will way too much and you left another frag right on the floor without pinging it where it was on the floor near the care package that wasn't mine i was just there hello using the decoys sorry [Music] one right now i have no big heels this is awful i have here you go here you go hold on he's popping his syringe you ready one of the worst days in his range that might have been a magic that was a medkit crap i didn't have any syringes thank you i'm gonna save them though good job that like two week period when i was having a troubles and literally every call i made was the opposite ah you said two weeks two years they won't find anyone this guy white i think they're shooting problems oh you're right it's a care package way too i don't need to tap straight from i can land on the side of it and just zoom off into the sunset yeah but you can't tap straight off the side but yeah that's where that's where it comes in an oil kill today it's fine all right all right let's we haven't won yet it's so busted this is my favorite gun back in season zero believe it or not that sounds like something you'd like it is yeah it does sound like it anymore 20 damage per body shot unreal mind you the wing man was like pow pow pow pow pow yeah we know it was automatic but that gun still like even though it was it was insanely broken it still took like a little bit of skill he said to hit your shots it's harder yeah you just spray that thing i was playing on steady [Music] think you actually do though oh my god it's on my face and neat that's fun well that's the actual two teeth it's not seem to fire i'm busy still i killed so bad of course you can hear isn't that guy dead can i first the call stick why is his trap still there merchandise that's only when the team does a thing now i think it's eliminated just why is this ray flush how long have you been flash [Music] i knew i heard him over here i just didn't know where so i gave her i'm criper nice you said i was stealing get rolled
