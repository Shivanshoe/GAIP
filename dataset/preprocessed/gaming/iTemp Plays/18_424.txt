hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now in season nine one of the biggest balance changes that has been announced is the removal of a low profile low profile for those of you who are unaware is a debuff that reese one gave to a few legends who are either harder to hit or just unbalanced in power it's five percent increased damage and also every limb shot counts as a chest shot so if you shot wraith in her ankle it would do as much damage as a chest shot would with the extra five percent damage on top of that it means that these legends can get exploded it probably worked out as like a seven or an eight percent damage increase on those legends lifeline wraith watson and pathfinder all had this debuff in one of the recent changes respawn removed low profile from pathfinder and just with this small change brought him back to relevancy no longer was he being blown to smithereens in every gunfight you got into it made a massive difference and now respawn are removing the debuff altogether which is huge for lifeline watson and wraith and mains of those characters are going to be rejoicing because these characters are going to be far more tanky in gunfights so thank you for watching i do appreciate this and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends haven't been finding r9s all day just found one knocks i don't know why i've carried on throwing that it was because i was so focused on like trying to make it through the window that i wanted to see if i'd make it does that make sense i think uh not really but i'll take it that's fine that's what i was interested in which once you kill them i'll drop some syringes you know on me if you need him i wanted to prove to myself that i could do it you did i made it i'm taking shots firing recharging my shields i'm moving in two teams though don't worry this guy's top i think this is the most awkward angle please fall down yes oh i'm going back i have a feeling someone's watching us that one's broken [Music] no that's why i just kind of run around all over here right here i'm gonna shoot them in the next ring 17 17. okay i'm rushing i actually can't see him properly [Applause] yes these guys oh big 13 big 13. wait they run into another team okay because we actually made them one shot just destroyed them there's no way they won that gunfight after after dealing with us you know they're dead from each team they're fighting back skull goal grenade i'm the worst i'm the worst don't you dare i'm gonna punch him reloading no i'll punch him i'm not punching oh he's got on oh he's shield battery here replicator falling down reloading us pull squats down we made the right choices all right popping about why am i shot by everyone that sucks because i just like double headshot and body shot i'm oh that's crazy i was getting shot by the lifeline the shoot the team that delved on my head the team of two and then the dude with the sniper four people all at once that's actually unbelievable oh i actually shot some some people some people i mean they they stole my kill too but probably because i missed why did i find a scorpio that would have been way easier i had shot like four people oh okay you just gotta spit fire he just doesn't miss at all win this what although down low one second we got this did that good we're inside huh i think so i think so um i think so let's he self-raised or somehow managed to get him i'm just crawling inside punch him out oh no auctions out boxing's up over here too she just she's bad she's bad easy so rough man when they like when they came up top i thought they went back down low so i was gonna and then she started doing this climb jump back either eight action i don't know what was going on yeah well nice clutch though that was all you nice that's nice got a vault in blue not bad oh zambic let's go this way they were fighting in uh that place north whatever it's called yeah yeah i need to recharge my shield yeah yeah yeah just climbed up new kill leader watch for them my god i have no balls oh no oh i tried to get it nice jesus that was way harder than it needed to be play part in heaven on here so i could hear someone shot your decoy and i was saying he's nearly cracked you say you shot my decoy he shot your decoy and then i was standing directly behind it that's what my game's been like today just took a beat in my accident punching a tunnel i hope someone takes that portal to the worst one you've ever seen i pulled off the roof didn't know where the pad was walked about for me looking for the pad and then the bottle ended midair have fun with that one guys you know what you know what's so funny is i saw you start the portal i saw your character in the in the mini-map just not moving it i'm like what is he doing i fell straight down because he was like there somewhere because i started the pool before i realized there was a pad so i was oh that's probably worth it just terrible timing that's inch perfect oh dude i'm just angry talking about oh nice god the file is going crazy right now dropped more more more where that surprise yeah she's cracked and he's up top he's inside i think he sounds like money saw him oh it's oh no oh no oh one squad oh nice and they have swift i'm city sure he's now scoping there's no way this guy's zooming in i think he's just shooting around he's just trolling he's gonna learn very soon okay i'm dead i mean i didn't die that time either are they they're looking at it yeah they're just looking at me i that definitely doesn't distract no i'm gonna use this one and then when i use this one you can use that one oh that might work i mean i just get like halfway up i will too okay this guy's on the way my strategy is unrivaled we're guys i'm just trying to have a good time cause he could spit firemate with the spitfire yeah he deserved it you are the apex champions okay nice
