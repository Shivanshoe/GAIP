hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i'm using a gun that i never really use it is the peacekeeper now at the start of the game's release at the start of this game's life cycle the pk was exceptionally good and even then i didn't pick it up i think the general consensus at the moment is that the mastiff is a better performing and more consistent shotgun however you still see professionals pick this gun up so it can't be bad a game that i've dropped in here as well is me using the either eight which is another gun that you really don't see me use often i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends he's so whoa he's so quick he just overtook jenks why what oh oh the gibraltar mate look at him go why am i so slow i know that when you're like together to begin with i would be 20. i'm good they just got purple over there and then one of those shots then you know wonderful okay [Music] okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh they're on the far side they're over there this is the it's a yeah revenant lobo caustic right okay oh yeah i forgot about these guys one's closest on the wall here a lot the love is one nice 22 flesh i just overshot that girl which way you want to go because this firing charge tower is uh as well actually uh energy depot okay i should have saved that i don't want to walk to the rope give me a sec oh you're playing all teams i don't realize it i'm not saying watch out for the new kill leader friend half the squads remain let's keep winning you want to see how powerful is playing yes let's see this grapple we have time i'm not even looking i'm just going in here we go oh yeah you're not supposed to laugh close your eyes dude what the heck you're not a pathfinder it was an accident 90 on valkyrie nice why can't i hear someone next to me i can't see him someone's over there i think someone's out there they're far no i missed how far from the ring i didn't even heal i thought it was a third is it a separate angle i don't know i fried a bang really bad though i didn't heal i can't believe i'm standing still oh teammate i like you yeah yeah nice we finished the squad using my phoenix kit i didn't uh i didn't give him the benefit of the doubt that he was going to hit any of those shots uh yeah i'll do that a lot yeah because at least you can you have the choice to land separate or um yeah you still you're still fighting for survival you know yeah this whole just aimlessly walking around it just like so much damage i might get the back slit oh i just outplayed the chest so bad so looks here oh there's no way you just shot me nice reloading [Music] teammates [Music] oh i think he just walked through the gas oh you want to play your 301 simplify game huh oh my god i don't want to look up but i guarantee if i do there's going to be about 50 teams here this is going to be absolute carnage please give me a gun i'll take it activating jump drive look at this armor switch a champion just fell they must not be very good wow looks like that was the last one in the squad enemy taken down guys got hammers are you able to crawl uh away from this i don't know if you get cover over there we should go this way reloading oh my god i'm the new kill leader that's great news got our friends banner this is great i couldn't stop the horizon revive because there are so many boxes here and because there are so many boxes she got a free shotgun level three she got a free arm switch i know i had a chance that proud of the close range you landed like two bursts on someone as they sprint around the corner you're doing ridiculous damage did the guy with the charge rifle leave his high ground cheers biggies no he didn't know he is enemy over there they should it's zipline time there's a team up top we need to be worried about two though oh god let's go through audacious [Applause] recharging shield you okay teammate i need my pearl back it must be kind of close to the red a6 giving my shields a recharge making contact with enemy killing and drilling let's go this way listen to it someone else popped a respawn over here many teams are going to be coming over here in a second i am repairing myself man this is taking so much concentration to try and track these teams on the back i'll help you did we kill the octane the octane left evo shield here level three oh my god that guy's needy dead we got this here so it's okay yeah i don't have extended heavy but i do have the fast mag thingy so sometimes i do have an extended heavy does that make sense might be getting flanked contact yep this guy wants to get involved now if we get third-party before these guys when they're in the middle of it reloading can't get shot in the back oh my god i'm trying so hard for this win i am i think they're just on the roof so we should be okay these guys want to respawn teammates doing such a good job by the way not beneath this are they maybe we should have just taken the pad yeah they can get banner doesn't matter the guy might actually just leave unless they're playing together we did such a good job hard enough that damn but the watson gave us some protective fences at the back i should probably take the heavy and she gave us the watson gin before she died beautiful teamwork you know oh they killed that team looks like a three stack there's two with the same clan tag which might mean there's a third with the same clan tag the rings close 10 seconds i think they killed the team that we were fighting beforehand that death box eh making two enemy squads left i have no shotgun i mean that is so unlucky i nearly 3 000 damage damn it man landing near me i do not do a good job thanks squad all right that's a decent start i got the crypto i grappled out of there they didn't expect me to land at the top like that kind of a genie strategy can't lie wait i have i have ten syringes okay scanning the area recharging one second watch out i might as well do it give it a go see how it works look at this look at this idiot what's he doing here i go watch out oh back it up team just chill here oh my god it's it's every last team enemy taken down let's make sure we're not flanked here took out an enemy this team down low yeah they're going this way in here that money to come in i don't know i don't think they'll be coming in now because there's a fuse out there that's the fuse i doubt i think i know separate fuse my guy's still down this is like every squad i think this is just turning to an absolute bloodbath i don't know where people are i can't really see my teammates are on one of them i think she faced backwards onto them one minute the ring isn't far enemy we just eliminated the whole squad one absolute blue path i mean i'm a slightly different angle here team over there when everyone's just phasing i have no idea what's happening yes we did really well to stay live there when we got flanked up top and we dropped down the pk came in huge against that fuse that's what i love about the pk if you can if you have a little bit of cover take that extra second to charge you up and you're landing like a hundreds if you're hitting people in the head it's actually so good at those those engagements even better than the mastiff in particular engagements gg well played i left already i mean i don't care that's only 1400 damage we had one fight and then nothing happened and then we had another fight that was two fights this is how these lobbies are at the moment they don't see anyone
