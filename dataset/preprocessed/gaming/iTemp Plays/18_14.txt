hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i have three games for you all of them are on storm points and because i'm still trying to mix it up with the legends here i'm trying to master all of the legends we're playing watson again four three now the reason this video has three games of storm points is because unfortunately storm point has fallen victim to the same issues that paul's edge king's canyon and olympus has as well is that sometimes the games are incredibly short like in the first game that i have for you there was one squad left before the round one ring had even finished closing now that should just never happen especially on a map with such few rotational options at least on king's canyon and all the other maps we've heard you've got the balloons to get around or even the tridents but these are still great games and because they're social automation you could down straight to the action so it's action-packed i hope you enjoy them thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds mimi goes hard because nobody i don't know it can't be can't be can be she's going on more's edge though yeah super building yes well i'll make all these bins by the way i thought we would land in here that's just you i can't use my ability i get a lot
