screwed up it's all series or as I would call it in yesterday's video scripts per orbital no i involved in FM now for some reason g7r l1 some Blue Shield's teammates in a bit of a fight Gibraltar Zin a bit of a scrap as well what are you doing I mean salt did you even you would even try that drop some smoke down if you're gonna do that I've got to bait this banner out careful teammate he's good he's moved I guess that was a Miss creep by the way with the old grasshopper didn't mean to this grappling to nothing this please done please don't I feel that was someone else I was tempted to drop off tonight should be okay cuz they're both fairly weak one one up top and one stay down though I think you broke man cause they're damnable who is making a map report just cuz we got a lot of things to do here I mean we have to respawn at tema in a second I need to heal up a little bit it was pointless having purple shields he was like trying to get insides away yeah I'm subbing Ewing teammate that should be free kill there we go we might be able to use these guys by actually good grief scraps or city's living up to its name today this guy's got at least one teammate I think you just have one teammate I think who's coming over to get a banner as a pathway and him I wonder he was scared I bet had some good loot though oh it's a shame that he only had level 1 shields bless him that sucks but he came over he's got incredible loot while he did have oh my gosh she didn't have many light rooms though or struggle of a mighty nice probably gonna get that first anyway with the old respawn you can take the XP you get xp for respawn and don't you because I don't really care about my level but I know a lot of people are trying to like work on balconies and stuff I bought mine all the way to the top they want I don't have four kills the action involving it's warranted way higher than four kills my bank was left this by the problem of this free spawn beacon is that there are so many I guess would use that one instead they're still more over coming soon so we're bout to make a movie but there's so many different ways up there's like five different zip lines to go to inside the building and three outside the building that lead up to so I like to try and stick around their respawn someone because you can expect a thirsty part you have three apex predators trying to get some more kills wait it's not that one it's this one false information sighting at least until the kill leader and I don't think I've ever said that sentence before and as soon as I've said he I've lost my kill leader title someone's overtaken me very tempting to go to the scrap in the distance but I want some good loot here I want a goal tell me I don't I don't ever help me I haven't picked enough there's no way I haven't seen one so I want a goal tell me I want to go back I want a gold on gold armor you know and I want that not just for me I want it for everyone I want three of each if possible we go back turbo charger bill tell me I'll take that read lost dark log that was not good though that was not good in fact that Pathfinder in scrapped or City have better loot I would say level three extended I mean I'm gonna use this and if you're gonna take that you'll need those attack what do you have a look at level three extending at a golf barrel stabilizer yeah shield batteries four days a Phoenix kit like he was way better loosen that luke volts face absolutely and a horrendous if you ask me you need like I'm also in dire need of Lima you've reminded me scratched up I can not not fight this time I literally mean scraps of loot if possible even other storms pushing us a few live rounds won't go amiss the good news is that stress don't go an uneven scratch-offs you think I'll return you I'm coming back okay do you want to go up there anyway oh here we go I have to be inside he no one's investing that much into the Watson if the Watson fences hit the streets of me again poor guy only had 22 health or whatever it was but I don't get ready get Samantha as well Boston man rocking up though I can cover have you got your shields teammates give me other know how long it takes eight seconds it's ten seconds of Phoenix key it's good race coach another wife has been using amid Guinness your battery I'm here I'm back by ten rains and that's all me switching get back involves level one mice teammate I think I might be never actually but I've got so many things I wanted to try and talk about afterwards there's a lot of decisions in there that I'm sure I'm gonna get questioned on but I had a reason for form I promise you the stones gonna be lovely scary that one's that that's too far away there's one close it's gonna be in the stores yeah this way here we go come on walk past when I smiles took my scraps and stuff four squads left and that's what they're gonna scrap over that way Oh teammate is left anyway forgetting the reason I looted I think the first thing going to talk about the reason I looted lie ammo before reviving the Bangalore to begin with was because if I had to cancel a revive because we were getting rushed i wouldn't been able to defend this like at all I'd have had to run away I had no rounds on here Montebourg those came from but it's because I managed to pick both of the month before I picked why I'm Allah and I'll tell you why you this I've increased my menu cursor speed so I need to get my muscle memory on the memory on the sorry on the cursor speed of to scratch my lieutenant may even be worse than usual somehow not entirely sure that's possible but if I'm inaccurate at the same time here we go that's that's my ultimate you can't be using that I'm gonna need you to drop three shield cells as let's rent for using that like at all well that Pathfinder meant the chance is still something there if you thought you heard someone but the Pathfinder I don't know if there is actually I don't think people would be this close and not come over to being joined Norma's crap that we just had this way this is probably our best bet at the moment it's in a choke points we get to see whether one of squads ease I think that Pathfinder must went all the way around the mountain but the good thing what what you want to do when there's this many squads left I think I always talk about this but you want to be in a position where if you hear a fight you need to be able to get over there third party you don't want to be involved in the fight straight away you don't it be one of the first two teams you want to be that third team you want to be the third party that's my friends is how you close out games may be a little bit boring sometimes but in past seasons you could get away we playing really aggressive before I know there's three apex predators in life at moments and they're going to screw us over and I don't want to get screwed I want to win still plays the ultimate can you actually stick it up here I saw this on ready calm or is it to err calm it was one of the comments maybe their patch deep what can I say I'm not here we there we go there's a free spawn beacon I'm sorry yeah respawn beacon being used and they're scrapping this is this way this is the time my friend this is the time we get the hair King freak involved and hopefully we third-party my Gibraltar should have his ultimate not amusing over there I only have to do shields anyway it seems okay to not stop to of this was left that's good we go we want them to be fighting Mazal pick up the gold knock down shielded could save me we wanted to be fighting and then we'll just swoop in shooting twice a retreat seven tasks and we got a win that's the plan or not this is gonna materialize especially when you hear a Craver being fired in the different stories that he's ultimate oh please keep it what are you doing up there with a peacekeeper I don't mind the peacekeepers pretty better these teammates fine back there so I'm not sure it's gonna shredded Schumi started you gotta call nocturne he doesn't even have a gold knock down please knock off thanks again please have this is the end of the game he's arriving hey hey go teammate and Cal do I still got my double digits [Music] shad said the Gibraltar have a lot of patience at the start because we were still we were smooth yet so many fights at the start when he was still down and they needed to get it get the old respawn I don't want to book did you saw him pretty happy that he got the kill there the only definitely deserved it nearly 700 damage these 3,000 damage from your boy a double-digit victory one revived one revived from the Gibraltar the clutch revived from the Gibraltar on top of that scraps or city-building fell like it another shield there I think we I think we just lose that game because he gets shot boss he's reviving me and I think was screwed man Groot as the saying goes that my friends is a solid win and I'll tell you what I'm happier with winning public games at the moment than I am with ranked games because for I know we killed seven apex predators there you only really know what their rank is when they kill you and you can see come from the banner but I'm happy with that thank you for watching what to appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
