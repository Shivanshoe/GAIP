hey what's up guys it's reece welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in previous seasons i have been well i've started a solo to masters uh video series and i saw it like i petered off at like d3 maybe d2 because it's kind of the same sort of thing but this season i really got hooked into the challenge of it even though it's king's canyon i'd prefer to do this on to be honest any of you the maps world's edge uh olympus or even storm points any any of those three probably would have been a little bit easier as a solo player but i've been loving it and i've got two games here for you today that are taking me that one step closer we make it to d1 we have only got one subdivision left to get to masters and i've only got until tuesday to achieve it i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends okay we've got to give you on the team quick tip if you don't play much ranked or to be fair this works in public games too you've got to give a new team you want a shotgun because you're going to be fighting and when you bubble fight you want to peek in and out of the cover and the best thing to do that with is a shotgun my preference is the mastiff but it's going away next season it's in the care package where was the field here it's cool level two hello oh hello huge i'm really hoping one of them has the bad pass flatline skin i don't have it on this account you'll be stuffed yeah but on this account same place to win devastating for the boys they land behind us so is that our teammate okay i think it's my teammate landing i don't have a sight for this flat line this is going to be tough i got a flat line re-45 when i want a shotgun that proves not too bad to be fair recharging we might want to get out of here i've had it two times man this guy's dead no it was my kill i didn't get the good oh think of the gun i met the three times gosh darn it maybe i'm getting shot fields i thought he said i hit him 150. but then i was like why is he challenging then and it turns out he is just a psychopath okay i'm okay on kp like i'm a bit sad i didn't get that one i really wanted that i really wanted the um here three times but it's fine man whatever i'm not going to take that have a bat i'm fine to recharge i was shooting okay a decent range with a wait is that a low broken please two times maybe no stocks not bad protect themselves what's the team looking like reckon they're gonna get masters they split plateau diamond two dime two's not bad plateau you're kind of struggling unless you play all weekend uh as i'm recording this it is friday evening so he's got friday saturday sunday monday i mean that's doable you just gotta put some timing assuming that means that these guys are playing together i'll mess that up [Applause] watch out i'm opening this guy is that where they were i mean with any luck this guy gets it did i really not hit one of them with any of those nades seems to be unlucky if you ask me where these boys come from they're getting shot from there as well using a phoenix kit this line deployed let's go here i have no bats now by the way that's on white armor we can rush this oh my god how'd they get that off so quick yes look at that are they gonna fall down to the sky the other two they are they are that's huge well done oh my god the attachment is unreal how much heavies do you have 200 i was gonna drop you some but i have less i'm on plus one rp let's go that's humongous making big games big big game big games i am so happy that worked out like that because i needed those four bats these poor guys i mean what happened to these teams over this way i am down to camp uh for points i mean if he lands a shot he does 45 damage finance shot i do like 19 18 maybe at this range it's not worth it i think one of us should sit up top because this is the easiest place to get thirded this hill um there's always people here good shots good shots i'm not gonna watch my bullets anymore be something good this way let's come this way just come this way just come this way let's explore this way we have to go this way before this other team comes through we don't want to go bunker come this way it was going to get pinched and we'd have to go through bunker could be anyone in bunker care package over there target over there making contact with enemy one of them i guess we don't have to push that i'm using my phoenix kit i didn't grab any uh grab any syringos darn it cool off guard there i got i took the course together the fight my teammates weren't in the best position you know we got caught out in the open what am i heating there what am i i was safe here this is huge this is like guaranteeing us rp and placement points superior positioning if we finish anything less than like third i'll be furious because a lot of these teams are gonna have to get into the meat grind here in a second yeah get rid of those traps darn it what's the word for it well you just got like this what's the word for that i don't know i got like this and they just i think that's what i think that's what they call it that's the call so i could be with about 18 hours after it one moment is he crafting ammo he's kind of psychopath please don't die he's going back to the fire ammo die for 12 heavy rains oh we gotta go to them i didn't even look at the zone okay contact with target i have to be that way quite a guess what's up i don't know let's go this way cancel that they're all on the roof if i could do the tactic man where do we go might be something good this way so two teams there one on the roof one inside and this team i mean we are safe here wow looks like that was the last one in the squad two enemy squads remain they're kind of fighting they're not gonna commit to anything yet though recharging shields that's the biggest ark stars ever i'm solo here so i do have to be careful but i want to make this annoying final ring need to make this annoying for these guys and just keep poking in and out of cover as soon as they focus on me poke back into cover let my teammates take some of the flack and the people beneath them because they're all gonna have to fight i'm about to sit on this wall too to be honest i hope teammates gotta give you all yeah yeah i did zero damage to that guy i love that i love get the arm shield so huge game for the ash absolutely ginormous get back i'm getting this hold up in the old-fashioned way there's a great distance between us have a point re45 and a wingman two of the smallest guns of all time but they pack a punch oh god no let's explore this way careful you are completely solo i'm here for rp boys these guys are playing together what we looking like okay and they're diamond four i'm hoping they're not like 7200 rp because then they're playing like they've got nothing to lose and i've got a lot to lose because i'm trying to make masters so yeah playing solo but we'll see scanning the area enemy over there i mean the guy's full shield mate recharging shields reloading ah man i don't need stress i'm going to re-revive him here in a second okay i was going to do i just wanted the purple armor you guys have to be careful these guys are not going to be playing careful at all i can just tell i can just tell oh man it makes me scared the thing is it's like i'm obviously not scared of the gunfights like who cares but then you get back to the lobby you see the minus rp and you're just thinking that rp has like a time value directly linked to it like it takes so much time to gain rp but you didn't get purple armor did you get a gun you got a gun it's probably a vault because they switch out their close range gun that's huge where do we want to go nothing all i want to be honest with you enemy over there recharging my shields i'll do enemies hey i'm destroying my team in the back i assume he's got that nice christmas guy don't go down because there could be another team reloading the way we're playing this i'm not sure i like you or not okay you're kind of you're kind of frightened i don't appreciate it i miss a lot of shots okay i thought i had my grapple so i was kind of facing them the lobo cracked one of them so sometimes it's nice to almost play like a bubbly game and actually don't care about what happens because i'm positive rp now so whatever happens i'm happy it's got some great attachments oh they've respawned target spotted yes let's go this way forget it i'm the one that's leading the charge now who cares get involved why so hard to hit oh guy that sucks are we just rushing him why not no we're not okay good spotted i see an enemy over there if i know these guys and i absolutely do by now i think they're landing right on top of them he landed right you're an absolute lunatic man you guys are maniacs he literally landed right next to him so i'm whispering in his eye nice you got the damn there making contact protect me where'd he go don't let him shoot me i'm popping the finisher in the smoke where did the race go that way again the care package this guy might want to come back scaring him he's got to go around did she try and steal the gear baggage it's nice i like it how many of them did they just jump off the mat i mean i'll take the rp that was not an exciting game really well the start was but the end wasn't i didn't really do too much to be honest these guys maniacs you are the apex champions yeah we didn't do we didn't do crazy numbers but that's a lot of our pain i think i'm diamond one which means i only need one more tier i ranked up to get to masters i've done this all solo how much rp is this how much to work it out 607 that's three wins
