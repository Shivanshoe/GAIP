our team oh no i this guy is a purple and probably a lot of loot and now i'm just running through this it sucks i'm not with you guys first damage one of the biggest guns i've ever seen it's a shame it lasts for one and a half milliseconds well coming with a long bar just picks got that ramp up for 110 there you go so quickly got this guy okay okay okay you're not doing crypto stuff that's not what cryptos do relax he's a quick scout back i five kills what are you doing i have five kills you are literally crypto what is wrong with you stop there is people on me and i am uh with crypto i am going to unsubscribe from your channel forever i have eight girls uh let me know if you have anything i'm desperate you need to go go get a 20 you're like this is your only chance to get one are you kidding my only chance are you kidding me are you ever gonna get eight kills off drop like this with 30 people left all right well you need to find me some heavy oh yes yes yes there's a little bit of a little bit i dropped in front of you where is he oh you're a mess you're a mess you're already throwing the 20. it's already gone it's it's not possible anymore almost broken 26 26 it was supposed to be like a funny call out but i said it very seriously 26. it sounded like he's heavy desperately i have 10 kills wait uh i have 34. i need everything i need everything thank you i only have a 99. i'm fine dropping 20. he's really like he's got a pk nice good job good job good job good job i'm living kills we got this oh no no no don't stop the reply teammate get some armor i will assist you i i honestly rich i don't i i think it might be no okay here we go i don't have the bullets for this now we're fine we're fine everybody calm down i'm chill they're running oh god they're on me this is just a random guy almost broke one he's in that window careful hey i think we gotta go upstairs okay he's one i can't reload i actually can't reload i'm stuck on your body there's about eight people here and they're all shooting us they're not even the same oh so close to it there's blue armor in there too i'll wait to use my ability you should be able to use that as a rope i agree i'll uh scan in a second big scan [Music] how's this man alive mine's on a two-second court i guess mine's a little bit longer than yours just a little bit definitely yeah there's another guy here powerful i don't see him happy sweet oh you got one i got one uh i need to change one of my guns he got your all right yes nice i've probably had it for three years honestly i've already spawned him oh probably it's really fast mine was at fifty percent oh right in front of me it's actually a really broken combo what can they do just always have them in your in your sights you can just pre-fire everything straight wait wait wait it's probably a really bad one what are you doing on the side of the map i'm trying to see you no never works sometimes oh i better win that you better win that what are you saying what are you saying about that not working i immediately worked i take it back entirely apology not accepted right here same on me uh one second one can you i've got five seconds i've got yeah i'm good i've got five seconds of my ability to if you want to wait a sec i'm going to win i'm just getting back [Music] other ones okay okay okay this is this is actually a really broken combo i'm like where you can pre-fire everything yeah it's stupid all right now where to fragment yes i am so sorry about the ultimate comments that i made um this does not reflect me as a person and i i've grown i've learned from the experience and i've become a better human being since i just really hope that you can uh forgive me for this i'm gonna take a few days off from making comments uh but i will be back uh soon thank you to all my fans i'll tell you what go on no i should be in pr i mean i can like was that just off the top of my head that was good very convincing thank you it's from the heart man i meant it i'm so sorry i still i weirdly don't believe okay mine's at 66. we need to find ultimate accelerant that's our problem i just i wasn't okay somebody's on the other side of this uh okay okay yeah i'm gonna heartbeat that's sort of weird what's going on okay yeah yeah they're they're running they're running they must have no they've all caught they've all caught it i'll see them flying off mate don't worry okay that was a close one can you believe they didn't even get it gold for us like we can kind of crazy that's actually that's actually really cool that you can scan it too because that just makes them that much better for cops i've pinged it for you and i was like wait a second i hate silvers in this game which is like the biggest bait ever and just always makes you think that you're going to get away with it and you just never do it in here big scan big scan i'm kind of far i'll crouch walk over oh god oh god oh god no please oh you're dead you're i'm selfish so hard they're coming over they're putting oh they're maniacs oh my god we need some moles we need some cyril cyril cyril oh the pre-fire is unstoppable oh get that repo get that replaced and she was silenced oh yeah she went free joe says she went free mate i just have you ever seen a better say yeah let's be honest though this is my idea and let's put that let's make sure that is said during this video so everyone can see my idea okay okay thank you and everyone that watches the videos that just have to go and subscribe to your channel okay well now you make me feel bad for calling you out i mean i'm gonna i'm gonna edit that part so that's not going in there oh um this is a great idea from me that's what i did that was great to see her like run up and just go down for the revive i was confused for a second i was like wait what happened that's great because it's an interrupt isn't it so it just happened just as she was trying to like passive revive it's like one sec like two seconds or something i think i think it might just be that one why am i following you i thought i saw that valkyrie from earlier on you know i wanted to like decision of all time it was the valkyrie that flew away from earlier uh the worst decision i've ever made because people saw they're they're doing the thing huh i've eight bats they just i can't rush him anymore i got a little bit from that one too so okay yeah trying so desperate to catch up but it's just impossible oh let's be honest i have to give you a game every once in a while otherwise you just will stop playing with me at some point you have dropped a 4k on my head today so and i did about 12 damage i came so i understandable thank you i mean if you would have that one game if you would have survived you would have probably dropped the 4k on me i'm going into this ring because i didn't see your thing what did i think don't help me and i'd very much enjoy that oh yeah we then we bought oh my god the scans are just getting more overpowered sidemate requests unstoppable nah i'm gone i'm actually dead i'm actually dead are they up top of them the mountain behind it uh they're on like the edge right there i'm landing on this big rock behind them i'm knowing that you threw it on the heat shield be careful i know i near you you be careful oh wait it's the last team i need to be involved in some description okay okay i'm climbing a mountain right now i'm hiking i'm stuck i'm stuck down the mountain i'm falling down the mountain i'm repositioning you're the worst alt i've ever seen i will i will see you in a second i am coming around careful with that heat shield i uh you got a scan you got a scan yeah he's right under me no he's not he's in sheer fear wait this isn't the last guy no that's the mo over there i'm dead i was punched i was punching you said he you said he you said he was there which employed one guy and i get shot in the back you are throwing i spent about five minutes watching you trying to climb a wall put down the worst ult of all time oh this is a tragedy this can never go into video who are the apex you underestimate my standards no you overestimate my standards i have got no shame we are at an all-time low right now no look at your damage you farmed at the end you farmed get robbed i've got nothing left
