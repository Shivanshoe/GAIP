hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and recently i have been trying to use some different primary weapons i played a good amount of ranked this season and i just spam the three times r301 every game it's my bread and butter but i've tried to mix up the solid assault rifle choice that that primary choice and i realize there really aren't that many options in this game at the moment so you have the r301 the flatline the hemlock the havoc maybe the l star and of course you can use a gun like the wingman is a primary weapon but in terms of actual solid assault rifles we are kind of limited apex seems to have this philosophy of only releasing a gun if they are massively different to the ones we have already the car can use different ammo types the rampage can be charged up with a thermite and though i do enjoy these unique traits that the uh the guns have and it mixes up the the game itself i can't help but feel like just releasing a new gun every season would be better it wouldn't destroy the loopholes as you could play loba or just have more of those gun racks to ensure the players get the guns that they want to use and they would use the existing ammo types so there's no issue there either look at warzone there are about 400 guns in that game maybe there are too many but you can really make the game feel different just by mixing up your class setup now we all know that apex is better than water come on now but i do wish we got a good release every season to look forward to i feel like the r301 will be better until the end of time let me know what you guys think i might be missing the market but thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends we haven't had one a stage drop we haven't had one drop there help i think it's a bug i don't know why they forced i got a gun 99 rampage off the drop okay we win i've got devolution gotta hop up here tempo do you ever watch someone that is like you know the pictures you might be one of these people you know the pictures when you like hover over loose what you know the pictures like if you hover over it on the ground it comes up the picture of the gun like the big box you can turn that off yeah i've ever seen like someone with that off and they try and look at a hop up and attack them about 20 seconds happening on stream on stream like people just like janks plays it off gangsters and he's he's just staring at the ground for 20 seconds he's like is this a dead eyes or is this a is this a jewel he doesn't know he can't tell he has to read it never noticed no way nobody one knockout basketball professional very nice see fuse is the best yeah okay she went either way she did a big wall bounce jump again it keeps using hello my buddy's going to connect anytime damn it definitely definitely like that you're good it's probably this horizon let me know if there's a shock involved i'm too lazy oh in this specific box there's not okay now can you check these ones for me guys come on no no no no go on go go level four boosted loader remember who hooked you up you are coming home let the horizon go healing up you'll be right which is fair enough yeah she didn't really have anything so i think she got bored oh yeah yeah yeah where where did they fly to her right it looked like yeah it's my last bath thank you i have one spare heavy after this i just there's multiple low balls i know there's zero heavy i'm afraid i'm afraid there's i'm dead i'm not going to use that and start complaining about heavy again if you want please use it okay now there's actually no heavy oh do you need some he's looking at you i don't know he's going to be like a 60 hellfish looks like you know oh my god i've got some heavy food you need oh i'm using the car i'll play okay recharging fire the coffee zero shields uh i have four bats 11 cells let's see where i can find something good i'm actually the best that guy's beamed that guy's weak i i don't think you beamed him there's one close right here no what well played did you just see me like a hundred from there what you like jump jumping pk charger that's okay i hate using the hemlock with this self because i can't switch between burst and single i was single firing from that range and it sucked spitfire here yeah it does remember who hooked you up i've got your back i got this guy jump headshot he gave me for 312. he did that like after i hit him for like 152 or something i don't know i don't mind scrolls behind it trees i knew i heard her in there so purple these ones lower routing back there they're separate yeah the levels over here obviously up top donny she's right on the other side of that she's coming towards you oh that's terrifying with that squad left let's go crack him in well that's a scary one oh they're following us apparently let's split knuckle sandwich uh on the roof of you they can't push that dude's got a craver behind him but i don't know if he knows i missed everything octane's coming to you love is running away wait what did i just get hit by oh she was right here the other one's broken get out you're getting ready bats one minute and i'm so close to rick never met a problem i couldn't dead mate juicing me shields ring ain't far she's closing in 45. grenade heads up i bloody love this job okay so i do have another game here coming up soon so stick with me here but i just wanted to talk over the end of this game i think we win this fight by default if the ash doesn't have self-res or if i have more than one battery but those are excuses and i can't really change those factors so it's always better to look at what i could have done better it's not that deep obviously who cares but if you're looking to improve your gameplay it's always a good idea to look back first of all i have my ultimate the entire time even a poorly placed ultimate here would have been far more helpful than just not using it i think i could have used it at the very start of the fight or once i had down the ash i think either of those times would have been perfect secondly i really think i could have took out this massive fight on the roof the octane wouldn't have had full health and he had to reload and i still had a decent amount of shells left to my mastiff and i also didn't have a big bat so i should have just risked it as soon as i dropped down the ash finished the self-res and it's pretty much game over but fair play to these guys for winning i played it bad next game coming up i'm already getting shot what how did that happen i'm not with you what i'm fine now i just got shot from narnia kind of burned how did that happen up on this top one so excited i need a shot if you find them please here you go i dips the shotgun first though right oh they're on the roof oh i didn't quite have the angle second floor um i'm not sure i think one's playing the story that was the last one in the squad beautifully done that was moira i thought i'm not gonna take a shot from both series one don't worry i drop i drop my shotgun level one i'll take it they're going to the top middle part here okay okay but i'm on my way don't worry i'm going to go down again i've got you going got us a new kill leader probably one just i'll let the res go off oh and then the guy was awake i almost down one of them recharging my shoes a lifeline i don't have any med kits so i have to drop i bet this lifeline hit like eight headshots on me thank you have a headshot any chance uh this guy did no i died yeah she'd land only landed headshot surely a little scanned yeah i don't have any med kits recharging shields i'm taking them try some absolute no that actually that actually helped us i honestly think that saves this it did he was sticking we couldn't push us he did like 40 damage on that one guys that was good i think it's because i think he did that they're in here they're okay yeah there's a box they're looting down there can you i'm just hiding right now they're on the other side of this though yeah they are can you get to this when once you finish that one i down the lifeline so that seems kind of screwed oh you don't know my lifeline yeah yeah yeah are we good to help they're in the middle they're shooting the scene for us yeah my phone's got blue check goldberg or not yeah run the other team round i think i think oh my god they could just find someone else instead the last two teams big knuckles to come in mate the game's over that's actually going to kill him yeah don't even bother down the hill wait i'm actually ticking i'm actually ticking okay big ticks big damage i don't have any dropping for me definitely gonna take with these definitely gonna tickle these 100 big big in this close place one on your right one on your right oh maybe that was it celebrate three fireworks or what you are the eighth advice did you have a lot more i think it was way more than that full like way more just so many more i only went down twice
