hey Lisa guys it's rich welcome back to some more apex legends I've messed the intro up I'm gonna stick with that one uh I've mixed it serve remix of my trumpet anyway today well played some more caustic and the reason I'm playing more caustic is because as I said yesterday caustic is incredibly fun to play and had that one video idea that I'm still trying to go for the long intro vo that you're watching here in the background is me and I'm chasing a train make sure get some loot II there's an Arthur I won gold I went to this supply bin as well there was nothing I'm sorry I forgot he was the actual next with my bin of the god P 2020 I forget you it's begin with but I do go back for that so I had a gold are 301 and I go on P 2020 unfortunately both my teammates go down and then after this they they leave the game but that is not the points of today's video today is actual gameplay is me playing with two high ranked high stats high levels players okay it's been a while since I've had teammates like this so lets us introduce them here okay first of all I got Perry's plane Pathfinder he's got the Pathfinder heirloom he's got sixteen thousand three hundred and seventy eight kills he's got the apex predator season two batch you think that's good okay Jordan it's got the ripe heirloom he's got the twenty Cup match the 4k damage badge the apex predator season two badge and twenty three and a half thousand kills and it's also got nearly eleven hundred wins with a full squad online not even just wins in total that's with everyone left there at the end I think I've got like three hundred total wins on his game and then you've got a temperature on he's on explain bit of caustic he's got a one hundred and sixty nine kills and he's got at least you're in good hands it's got 171 gas trap times activated on there as well so my teammates probably saw that and thought this guy this guy means business okay book definitely win this game hundred percent by the way in the background I don't if you saw that I was running away from a squad I knew there had to come the same way as me so I left all gasp traps there they triggered them the storm finished the kills and I got their entire squad killed by my gas trapped in the storm all three of them and then I was all of sin I was the kill leader unfortunately though this game doesn't really go to plan here it was looking so promising but and I didn't make the jump on top of the mountain this guy's got a devotion I mean I do measure buff in one but as always a synergy fire when there's three squads left the other the other team come out like cockroaches and absolutely box me back but anyway I hope you enjoyed today's video if you do be sure to you've like rating I'll see what in five and a half seconds my greatness look at this trio of apex legends apex predator trails here a beautiful site I don't think of I think I've ever seen he's apart from obviously front not a public game anyway anyway scrap its hasta titties my friends me amigos we've got ourselves a charged rifle isn't the greatest weapon to start with are we still playing caustic which means our product placing a few more of these shut around you no one chases me I'll just come back to this rope get up top and they'll be stuck they'll be chasing me trigonal more gas traps oh well I got a six times on a charged rifle and I'm playing costing I am the definition of toxic on this game the moment scraps all's fairly quiet so I think I might be able to venture out here please say no one's nearby because I'm not sure how much I'm gonna have to defend myself with this court loadout this'll do it's a lovely better shape a little bit closer there's people like that way as well scrap this way too I hate you looting in supply bins now I swear you guys are greed in the comments so you guys saw also thought that some it was different with the with the supply bin loops I can't be accurate while slaty okay I aim it like some light ammunition and it doesn't pick up the light ammunition on the ground it's fine in supply bins it's horrendous and I know that either I got a little bit of a buff with the double tap but I've always been terrible with the array chocolate one day I'll trade today is not the day I had I have 75 spare light ammunition how does that happened we serve I do something so bad oh there we go give me the light Emily see what I mean I mean your friends if I needed weed machine with a 6-time cyanic I'll be murdering these people thanks there we go I like just a casual little double mate I appreciate that one day my teammates of course in classic apex predator fashion are using women's women men wait wingman wingman den wingman demand our 99th but you gotta appreciate it 99 here so I join them get any right I'm only kidding if the one always livid I'm not enough hey hey come on guys I'm the only one here with an heirloom look at this only because caustic doesn't have one I'm not sure what caustic air caustic Salem would place hi friends hi friends hello hello we good thank you that's not a problem [Music] yes that's how I sound like if I was a Pokemon that would be that would be what I'd be saying that doesn't make sense because Pokemon only say what enemies would mean that my name would be my friends it's the worst purple name ever anyway there's a new kill leader and he's got five kills and there's only 23 people left do you guys remember the good old days of Apex when the longest weren't filled we've apex predators and the games of last longer than eleven minutes this means you looking at - pilot play a little bit more aggressive here to try and find ourselves and more scraps to get out ourselves to my little bit difficult caustic absolutely no mobility available spaceman the only thing I don't like about him I've always liked - no matter what game I play I need mobility in the character that I play because I'm so some would say aggressive others would say stupid in my decision-making and I need to get out of jail free card I'm lying to him but I'm sure that train yard will not discipline Summers has got respond and most from these clothes one there you go scrap in the distance toll jet train you're never disappoints so far I've got two assists I think give me the eye friends hello friend I had six grenades I'm pretty sure we picked him up gonna use your ulti hi friends hi friends let's go up top ranging doctor stoves right here just even gonna take us up I don't from that's possible it's the thought that counts he fell deep - OH Gold B 2020 yeah Jordans fine how you up there our squad this is another team might get to shoot someone sound automatic prowler when we are Miss which I'll get the pop revive I didn't mean to shoot wasn't shooing his body that God I did a hundred knife I've damaged their eye about sixty house and he adds 195 let me grab the purple sin deeds I'm going to revive let me revive you Hey look Jordan my way he wasn't gonna revive anyway this is more efficient than they say all right that's good because I've got a city I was feeling a little bit useless I was arriving to the fights a little bit late I wasn't going to shoot anyone don't use don't you dare say that's fine the different voice line I'll appreciate on or do appreciate it this guy's got a vault keys or I'll just happy that I managed to work the clutch up but it's one useful I have no light ammunition surely this guy had some okay yeah you could say that he had nearly four hundred I think left behind some medics anyone needs him alright vault I'm anis can't get myself gold shields I don't know what else there was nothing else I need to be honest old bag would be like golf helmet probably give that to the Pathfinder because everyone knows that pathfinders ability is still the best one of the game even if they nervous when did they know if that was it season three they added like a bit of a delay to his ability but I got used to within the first three times I did it back that's fine Tommy Pathfinder didn't break took a blast fine as well her cooldowns really long so it actually affects you a lot she dropped it for the path one day and because of that he said thank you to the right that's often I'm prescribed to me Lucas well on the same wavelength here we're here a scrap in the distance and it's a fight to get to the fight first it's a fight to get to the fight they could have went around the mountain there's to respawn bit can see those they still might want to come back if the if I ended why are the respawn beacons like doubled up now by the way they're only ever in pairs which is kind of weird all right looking kind of dead behind the team I'm the slowest one at least right can use their ability to speed up a little bit and the portal may on nothing I'm coming I'm coming miss very slow I can't climb that coming up oh my got the speeds there we go fortunately for me my teammates are still for a fart this must be what it's like play with me those paths line it cuz I I don't know what it is let me I have to be doing something I'm grappling at all times hey I hit one shot I hate someone pick up a shield sell in Scrabble city I'm here and I'm running over there and now I call him get into the fight because this let me know how it goes over there it's a recharge incoming care package I love loot it's gonna know for the moment soon so many friends this is my moment I'm coming in I fight go P 2020 oh my god I'm just reload someone sorry sir they ran off cowering in fear they must have be I'll take that no resist and when the arms gonna arm switch I think my team has to take in the zipline anyway we've come full circle this is where we sign off it's where we start off our adventure we've gone all the way to train yard through the vaults down to new Mirage Mirage this is my old look novice cook this wire okay I found a sub I thought I had an Boris Iran and I realized I was doing 12 damage don't be 20/20 I don't I don't think we're too killed without the Capri 2020 2020 there I think he would have major turnaround Achilles awesome Hey ah that's art Perry that's toxic with my friend he'll later eliminated I'm javis these managed to find that many people yet five kills when I had zero the Rings closed 45 seconds the pressure is exhilarating I need to find him I need to be ahead of the curve here instead of always chasing behind I'm gonna be that I'm gonna be the trendsetter instead of the bed-wetter that's that's the track that's the change we're going with mines right here back to being the bed better unfortunately I have to move nice nice nice that's not a friendly one I'm trying to help you get the army switch ha don't worry guys I coached it I pushed it with a pea 2020 again it saved us once more all right one squad left I've gotta see I'm actually quite happy I got six kills here considering we didn't really get any action until there was 20 people left I mean I'm taking these witnesses take me for granted to be honest with you it could be another full team of apex predators for all I know sue care packages might be worth checking they might bring some might bring some people might bring some attention to them what do we want from this yeah okay the answer is always the devotion krei but if you want a bit of fun but if you want to absolutely melt your opponent's you want the devotion at all times there it is oh I've got a pizza 20 I thought about that I don't know how you continually saved us so many times I got look at the map we are all as bad as each other we are all kill hungry bloodthirsty in a pieces I've chosen the wrong place to go we came from scraps or CT and I'm not at this angle so shortly Jordan's on something here that could be turning out in one of these buildings hopefully there's a core stick in one of the buildings and he placed his gas trap so then I just walking through the gas unaffected and I stroll on in I assume he's already checked the Bellamy side he did come for this fight that we good I get that pretty quick nice [Music] right it's the best got on the game it's not but it's pretty good he said what it's like to plan a full passing by the way because I've played in a full part of this game means once last time I played with koban Jenks in the late nineties it feels like he was a long time ago I didn't need your tape I've got hey I'll put those two revives - I coached up against that revenants he had pretty much full health and I had about 50 and your boy pushed up to revive to revive you know I'll take you Paul Jordan did knowledge more damage and I got to fewer kills but crumbles they's the most relaxing way to play apex okay usually if I'm out the fights even if I have to backup and shield the fights over we've lost it the teams done for it was nice to be able to know that I could shield up and I could rely on my teammates to win a gun fight or two and let's be honest I got a little bit carried but only because I couldn't get to the fight because I was caustic I was extremely slow there's a fun game nonetheless I hope you enjoyed it tape if you did be sure to leave a like rating subscribe judge one that might Empire and I'll see you on the next one [Music]
