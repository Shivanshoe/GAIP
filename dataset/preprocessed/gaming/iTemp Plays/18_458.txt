hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now rampa has the lowest win rate of any legend in the game according to the devs who should know uh this sort of thing however she is still useful unfortunately i was not the one playing grandpa and making use of her shields and sheila that would happen to be the final squad that we were playing against and we ran into and we got completely baited or at least i did it was it was horrendous now rampa is a tough one because she is useful for the players who made her and adapt to her place are needed to make her good i think that this shows that respawn don't always need to make changes to the game based solely on data of course rampart's win rate is low when her kit isn't enticing for most highest goal players in public matches compared to pathfinder octane or wraith it doesn't mean her kit isn't good because it quite clearly is effective so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends firing reloading big scrap friends flesh nice work okay nice nice nice nice nice i don't know how this pretty killed me i thought they were really weak they must have popped a three second phoenix kit classic classic shoes i am repairing myself i hate getting silence this is the worst oh it's not a good feeling no do you know what it's not i've come to that that realization yeah i don't think most people understand it's not ideal it's not good because then you can't do anything yeah and that's just not fun no i have zero cells and zero bats i have two bats uh 10 cells i can drop you exactly half of my stuff uh just give me cells don't don't give me butts i'll give you you know that no no no no no just give me seals it's calling me oh they're flying in the air one okay there's more bass in here i'm gonna carry him just for you um i'm chilling no no no no i'm solid now well i got three progress um uh yes is he popping off over there i guess i'm fighting that's all i need to hear i've no med kits but that's fine oh drop on behind me don't hear fighting anymore all right no i do never mind yep is that yours yes i'm dead i'm stunned from your old still sorry still stunned so i survived he's he's like 30 hp that's him he's just chilling there and he's full house i don't know what he's doing he's been in that little place for ages i don't know if he wasn't even beforehand or what but he's still not coming he's still not coming i know octane padded uh like west oh okay you are gucci i have zero energy though more oh i don't have any energy you need to tank that for her like a demon i have one gun i'm literally just using 30 30. nice i don't know everyone just shot was uh armless that was fantastic new team they're messed up [Music] nice kind of messy i'm just trying to use my 30 30. how can he popping off that little thing i can't use it i know it's obvious but close range you just get no strafe speed i just get beamed every time i try yeah it's kind of it kind of feels like the wind man sometimes close range at least that we might you get good straight speed though it's the only difference i just can't hit my stars at all you know scott left all right let's beat him watch my back let's do it three kill eater yes nice i did kill three people there i rocked up third party killed three people that had no shield so i'm on 1900 but yeah yeah not too bad it's not the worst thing ever is it nearly 200 damage i think that's all right dude like this gun doesn't work it doesn't work like it shoots like i don't know i don't know if you know this doesn't work decent damage but it just altered us for some reason they could have at least waited that time he's just going in i can't do anything that he's ambitious he's the word that springs to mind there he's dead oh what that's what i was shooting i guess oh my god these music if you need i'm dead giving my shield hey i'll use to shoot the door on your face i think that might be a whole squad is that just one person i oh i'm pushing that [Music] yeah i'm running too late right now i should change that how selfish let's pick up a sentinel uh i have no shield cells oh this guy had loot i forgot about this guy havoc i have a turbo this is tremendous oh wait wait hold on to this though hold on light ammo here yes sir thank you sir there you go doesn't catch you need to here oh there's a guy here if you've got a final craft two teams here definitely oh oh all right i've got two bats let me know if you need one after this uh i have two med kits they're struggling by two syringes i just yeah uh do you mind dropping a syringe unless you've used it i used them oh okay okay okay i think that guy had the two med kits in my defense and we're alive that's a good defense i should be a lawyer someone's in i launched a nade behind it did that actually yeah yeah good because i are starving myself in the face i need to know that something went right here oh i think they've seen friends this guy's got vaults he's got all my energy that's a nade i'm don't i won't come off that's a knock start careful another long range this guy's kind of close to me okay i got my old buds so thinking of just coming up and chucking it on their heads chasing you what did i hit you with oh what the no i got oxide again that's unfortunately taken down oh my god good job just as you came up they they hit me a little bit that's i should have oh man i don't know tricky one are you saying you should have helped me because i agree i totally agree i have things for you no i don't i don't know where i got the information from i've seen people pretend to be the marvin that didn't work for them i did a video when barrage for arch came out i pretended to be a mirage just sat in the hot tub that's actually i have fallen for before it was great i saw a cliffhanger i'm ready and i was like i'm seeing this they're right on us oh you've got a devotion nice niceness i don't know how it's always you getting shot by both of them um i think it's because i have the worst movement on any player i've ever seen that probably has something to do with it i mean that is just not true the ring is nearby oh these last two teams scrapping men just need to try and get involved somehow yeah spectator mode activated okay so they weren't fighting oh maybe they were okay yeah maybe the pokemon maybe they finished that team i didn't realize that we can wrap around though very safe around that entrance is in the middle of both of them and if it gets to the point where we get forced out because the ring is screwed oh man you must really want to win you're talking tactics now i'm trying to make sense here oh it is a surprise to some i i have different gears you know false end i'm nervous can we win i mean those are the only two options i don't know what's going on i play different when there's three squads left that's that's my i don't know then it becomes a tactical battle because whoever's the third party gets a free win here tell me that hit tell me that hit i'll just go into it like an idiot than one nice i did something careful with that third party probably coming from safe i grappled into your ultimate like an idiot well at least someone got it you know it's what they least expected though the last place they'd check for me oh devotion i mean they have to come this way i don't know why i'm offended how dare you shouldn't be maybe we could sneak in that building and just keep them this way forget the snake i dodged everything any shield cells uh yes as well i have eight i love them off so i don't know i have to move in just to say oh my god no make sure you don't fall off an absolute disaster he was behind that yeah there are no stairs inside uh no no no these stairs here let's go this way all right should i throw my on their face then then we'll just run on them yeah you can do i don't have any throttle there was a nade here all right here we go let's just see but that's the right there as well we are actually very very warm i hear a lot of good things about it they say the people my glass got they say
