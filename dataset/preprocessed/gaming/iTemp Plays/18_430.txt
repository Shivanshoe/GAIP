hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i get to share with you my experience of playing the apex legends legacy update early i'm looking this way because i am reading off a script that i prepared earlier but there's a play test with hundreds of content creators involved me being one of them fortunately and we got to try the new content early we mainly played the new permanent arena mode which is coming in the legacy update which is of course a 3v3 and what i'm going to focus on in this video is mainly the arena stuff but we'll touch on the new legend and we will touch upon the new bow weapon as well the arena mode trailer dropped earlier if you wanted to watch it without me wittering on but i'm going to be talking about my experience of playing arena and how it feels to play now arena is actually a fairly quick round based game mode and the way it works is that it's first of three rounds wins but you have to win by two clear rounds this can continue to a maximum of i think nine rounds so if it's a close game it can go quite quite a long time really but if it's a complete blowout it'll be over in three rounds and you won't get completely embarrassed it won't be a six nil whitewash for example now the beginning of each round you're spawning with some materials as the rounds progress you get more and more materials to find more and more weapons or upgrades or heal the balls or even throwballs are in the shop as well the weapons originally come with no attachments but you can spend more materials to upgrade them giving them level 1 upgrades in each of the item slots you can only afford some of the weapons in the first round as you get 500 crafting materials i usually went with the flatline as it's quite a versatile gun even without attachments but towards the end i started using the wingman because it was better at long range than most of the guns that people were choosing but it was still really effective medium and close range as well it was such a fun gun to use against most people were choosing like that to be honest the spitfire and as you can imagine the spitfire was a really good option as well as i said the more rounds that you played the more currency you got to spend in the shop so you could upgrade your weapons these skates with the first upgrade was so good because it came with a one times h cog and a level one extended mag on there as well and as you know the level one extending back on the scope gives it fifty percent more ammo capacity per magazine so it's a really good option for medium range and if you're a amazon keyboard player buy the charge rifle because the level one upgrade on the charge rifle gave it a six times sight or something i played against this gibraltar we were beating him two nil and then he started buying the charge rifle with a six time scope and he would tank like 45 damage shots from my wingman with his with his arm shield um so he didn't have to buy healables and then he poked back out and hit me for 70 because he had a charged rifle with six times on it and it barely cost him anything we ended up losing against him i was actually furious oh andy secondary was a spitfire so if you're out there could be well played good tactics but still really annoying incredibly annoying now on the map are some materials that you can go over and collect which will give you those materials to spend in the shop in the next round for your entire team actually there is a supply bin that has two shield bats a phoenix kit and a med kit um this was actually kind of huge because a shield bat in the shop was 150 material i think so if you could get over there and secure two shield mats for your team alongside a medkit and a phoenix it was really high value a lot of people started running gibby just to run to that middle supply bin and throw a bubble on it to secure those healer balls now the care packages as you can expect started to drop increasingly more powerful weapons it started off with another one with like a two times but towards the end you could get crabbers or prowlers now the new legend valkyrie has been announced of course and i'd say that she was like a middle of the pack legend in terms of usability in public games her flying leaves you extremely vulnerable she cannot fire while she's flying even after stopping her jet packs there is a short animation that stops you from firing at people but you can use her rocket ability from the sky as well which is kind of cool her ultimate is basically a mobile redeploy balloon your teammates can hop in with you and it sends you up into the sky for an easy rotation whilst airborne valkyrie highlights other players in her sight life for her and her teammates which is quite useful if you're just looking to find the next person to fight you can just land on them again with your ultimate in terms of arena her usability was actually quite low she'll be great positioning in the regular battle rail game mode because there's more high ground to get to but in the arena mode there wasn't really any dominant high ground that you could fly to and he just left you really vulnerable even her ability in the battle royale would be great at clearing up a third party fight you'd do a lot of damage but people weren't really grouping up in the 3v3 they were just looking for angles i did get to play on the new infested olympus map actually was more fun to play on the regular battle royale mode i'll upload a video playing valkyrie of course where i have footage from the arena mode and also the infested olympus mode just as soon as i'm allowed to now on to the new weapon the bow check bow it's called i suck with the bow check gun i am terrible however it was incredibly powerful a lot of people in the discord were saying that it was obnoxious and really good clearly they are far more talented with bird weaponry than i am because i could not make it work well but i appreciate that it's a high school scenic weapon because i think the wingman is as well and i sucked with that gun for a long time and now it's actually one of my favorites to use so i'll just have to practice with it the bow is a chargeable mechanic much like the 30 30 repeater with a full charge giving it more damage of course but there is a hop-up where if you manage to fire it just as the charge gets to full it increases the fire rate of the weapon for the full charge there's also another shotgun s hop up which split the arrows for a burst effect so you can use two different hop-ups on this weapon the 30-30 actually gets this hop-up as well because at close range the bow was kind of difficult to use and of course close range of 30 30 kind of sucks but now with the shotgun hop up on it it's actually pretty good and that's about all i can think of to share with you guys i can't wait to show you one of the arena mode games i had the very first game i had i randomly queued up with ragtag we were in a 2v3 and i dropped four and a half thousand damage in an arena 3v3 mode it was it went down to the wire it's such a fun game so if you don't miss that be sure to keep checking back on the channel if you're new of course hit that subscribe button see you like five and a half seconds my friends one of the biggest things this generation is oh yeah let's check out this it's not good i am i just can't hit this lifeline oh the other one's on my door romania come on man i actually kind of wanted to die to see that lifeline i'm pretty sure she's on console she's just destroying me sometimes it did be like that she was like really slow all right our longbow alternator this is the dream alternator i wanted to use different guns here we are there you are using very very different guns look at his one on me yeah who's this guy my way scratching around giving my shield to reach out there's some inside uh follow me such a good champion [Music] i can't wait to fight two of those type of legends next season it's gonna be bad it's gonna be great it's gonna be tough yeah like how do you know pro players and they have to go to like lands and stuff how like if i wasn't gaming on myself i feel like even if everything was the same it would still be bad uh yeah i mean they i think they're uh like when you're a professional gamer i think you just get used to like that being uncomfortable situations like that playing in like weird weird scenarios what are you like because you have to use like earbuds with like uh like the headset over it don't you yeah you do because the headset's like noise cancelling yeah you just have to use earbuds for the comp and then that's that's so strange to me stop over here i'm gonna zipline right behind him that's good idea i'll take this one oh they're porting uh towards the other two i can't believe she opened the door for me i killed an enemy no donation the recharge uh so this is two teams yes one team's going that way they're probably gonna try and go up and take the rope because i think that's the life of their teammates i think you're right i think they're gonna try and get behind us to the team i hate the writer 127 in the head nice they're running more knocking i'll give you so low i hate the blue 10 behind this too i have one last sniper shot out stay focused i like how we get comments saying that whatever we say the devs listen you know i saw a comment like that today and it made me laugh like this dude wrote a whole paragraph talking about how uh he hates how streamers talk about weapons being broken because they always get nerfed right after there's no way you think they actually take our input in they nerfed the solo queue legends and then they implemented massive sbms yeah they love it and they they really do they're they're nerfing everything that we that we like to use that was great because you could sell life yeah you didn't need a team all the content creators was going crazy with them mainly me you know number one kills per game on path i mean i'm pretty single having 27 bombs every week i got him single-handedly nerfed one dude round three just for you and only you yep they're here i'm grappling no dude i'm the worst pathfinder ever was that guy clueless absolutely lost this guy was playing a different game he wasn't i don't know what he was doing he didn't hit me with a different universe he called me this guy was just a crab walking in the corner with the fibo oh no clue no no how does that get cute did one of them jump where are you please kill him yes yes you know i was gonna commit to it nice still getting the shield back sorry this guy is probably still confused the octane was self-residing and he was up top so i had to first him oh okay i'm fine with that that is damaged
