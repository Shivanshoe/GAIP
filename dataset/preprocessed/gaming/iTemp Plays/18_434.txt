hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the season 9 or the apex legends legacy trailer dropped just a few minutes ago and the animations and the videography are as stunning as always we got to see so many new locations in this trailer alongside a lot of valkyrie footage with her abilities on show and also the new weapon the bojek bow as well so first of all the locations of this trailer are amazing you can see here that this looks like it's a closed off map so it's safe to assume that this is a 3v3 arena mode map that will be part of that update when legacy comes out now some of the trailer looks like it's on king's canyon but they could have just used some of those buildings or even the locations for the 3v3 maps and i say this because the buildings are slightly different to what we are used to and are also in different places compared to where you would expect them to be so if you're excited for the arena update it is definitely worth re-watching this trailer and keeping an eye on the surroundings as i'm sure these will be part of the arena update so valkyrie is the start of the show in the legacy trailer as you could expect we got to see a lot of what she can do she obviously is very good in the sky she flies around so quickly and stays in the air almost the entire time and i'm not sure how much of this we can take as her abilities in game as this is just a trailer i mean watson's fences pulled back on antenna stopped him in his tracks like the ropes of a boxing ring and she can't do that in game it is safe to assume however that she will be flying about and have those fine abilities as expected on showing this trailer is what we can assume to be her ability which is a huge area of effect of rocket barrage which seems to do an incredible amount of damage this could definitely be a fight winner if you place it well maybe combine this with a a horizon ultimate for maximum damage and then you're also playing two characters who are flying about so you're pretty much invincible it's unclear what her ultimate ability will be from the trailers but it is safe to assume that it will be something to do with being airborne we also get to see a little bit of the new beaucheck bow coming in legacy as well of course valkyrie is the one who is firing it it is hard to tell too much about it from the one shot that she fired it is firing arrows though as expected so probably will have its own ammo type it wouldn't really make too much sense if it was firing engineer for example but this is probably pretty obvious there are also two nessies that i saw in the trailer one in the hot tub and one on the bottle that fuse is drinking from as well if you're interested in that and there we have it the legacy launch trailer as always we can expect a gameplay trailer coming soon with more information about the legacy update and there is an arena gameplay reveal on the 26th of april to look forward to as well to not miss any of this make sure you're subscribing to my channel we upload daily apex legends content and have a great game here for you today as well so
