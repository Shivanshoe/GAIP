hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i asked so far to watch me play live and coach me now i was streaming my game to him on discord and the idea was that he would help me with my decision making uh when to push what positions to take in a gunfight and helping me with rotations and things like that but it didn't really work out we just sort of ended up shouting at each other so we just played some games after instead it was fun though i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends okay that works too oh he's now he's confused now he doesn't know what to do break off right now break off break off break off break off yeah yeah yeah go straight down straight down nope not down straight down no no no no no no left left okay what are you talking about this is straight down that's not what i see that's exactly what i mean you got a better loot already i don't like the outside i'll use this i already have better luck what do you mean you don't like it's the most broken gun i know i don't like you how do you oh my god rich that's how i've dropped like 10 5k games this season is literally because yes but i don't how do you think i'll get my 2ks though true all right oh take that g7 up right now what are your lobbies how is there no one at these did you see any paper went to lava what exactly what are these lobbies well i just died off rip like eight games in a row so they think i'm terrible i'm too bad they're pretty correct i'm looking for a vault i don't want him in that left already dc okay so what you're gonna need to do is go over there and punch him right in his dumb face can i can i kick him oh it's gotta be a double-handed smack all right well this is now i can still make what's edge i've got stuff to work with here i need to find a vault or probably should i go to lava or do i just go fragment i mean yeah i would just go fragment because then the rotating you're going to kill like one team at lava and then you're gonna have to rotate like a mile so it's not even worth it i am just amazed that there's nobody here let me drop this for the team because he wanted one and i'm off i wish i had a vault i don't have a close range again uh havoc's all you need havoc is a beamer if i'm gonna go here i should switch out the g7 for an r9 or what i just realized it may be really hard to like coach you because we have completely like polar opposite play styles in a way a hundred percent we do we have like completely different play styles i still have security no i'm not saying you don't like to fight but you're much more like selective you're you're like a little bit more you're more patient and you're like uh selective with your positioning that's right and i just kind of like don't send a top string yeah yeah yeah yeah and it works out sometimes sometimes it doesn't but all that i think that's why we we do so well together like in uh like duo ranked is because we have like such polar opposite play styles and it's kind of what you need i feel like when you get a bunch of people who are just fraggers sometimes it's not good we hold each other back in like sometimes i'll be trying to be too i mean sometimes i'm trying to send and you tell me not to but sometimes i know sometimes you don't want to send and i still do it anyways yes see big zip line up top big zip line up top of the g7 remember yeah yeah yeah crank that g7 i want to see i want to go see i can get up top nope down the road i want to see at least 500 damages more damages where's the break in this thing mate now my doorbell's gone in the middle our doorbell's going wait was that actually yeah oh no you put up the map now i can't see oh we are in a quite the predicament right here does anybody know though probably not wow you are actually missing out on all the kills i am just severely disappointed i am
