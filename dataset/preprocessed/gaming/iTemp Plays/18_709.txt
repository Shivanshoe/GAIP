hey whiskers eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing with sofa and Jencks once more and we decided to go for one of those trihard badges that I've never got before it's called teamwork 4 or the 10-10-10 badge to get this every player in your pre-made squad of 3 has to get 10 kills in one game and I've never got this badge before mainly because I've never played over the 4 pre-made team for longer than about an hour but also because it's pretty difficult it's more difficult at the moment than it used to be just because of how quick the public games diag you're basically in a kill race Oh with the with the Lobby itself but the game that I happy today goes right down to the wire and I'm sure you're going to enjoy it so thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see more in 5 and 1/2 seconds my friends same it start I mean I'm gonna end up this door getting no loot again because I said what happens every time alone at this door oh yeah same same over here okay master come on pink my people 2:28 to the 17 headshot are you having a giggle of day morning that's just this bracelets left she's probably gonna rest soon oh all right I'm heading over here gasps trapped in this building is mildly irritating voice 228 and a 17 headshot of Nevison 8.0 all right I don't care yeah go get him dude

little tea drop it I knew otherwise oh you do be triple taken it's run along something at us ready nice alright boys what are we at I want to see you like this boy mi6 how many you Everett Thomas thinks payroll a six Bobby never mind not doing it oh no I still well I will happily take some of them ranges sometimes it sure I think it's definitely possible though just because so many people will probably kill feed snipe so as long as we're able to just hold off the teams I think it's definitely possible I think we we all didn't like one team yeah it's it's full if we all kill one team plus one I've been to the game once you get some defensive teams as well some people just don't push up true so it is definitely doable mm-hmm cuz I feel like a mid game we get third party dree aliy really really hard nobody can die that's all that matters on the end nobody does out in here on me okay I'll just you sir hooray I got the EMP comment I hate you blue EMP off someone saw the kill I know that you good I thought something else is going here right okay so what are we looking at now six no um okay now my seven this is okay we're doing this here fine Cohen's crop case we have to intervene it's the only way are they in storm wait it's not thirsted still doable look who's running I'm Rico stop it Hey no thirsted one she's won it once back here is in the storm storm remember I'm not gonna kill anyone else LT tachi thank you thank you it's cool right I'm not ready I think he's up here rich yeah thank you my I'm gonna get the scan out I think he might be out the Rams yeah I think he's packing around what are you what do you guys that still say I hate few people but I'm gonna wrap it right we're good so you already have your 10 yeah so I only need two more honey 484 this is doable three squads yeah it's a fun game I'm pretty I think the one guy that got all sending back cuz I don't want to accidentally down somebody all call out there I'll see you on the left anyway I don't think it's a full squad yeah I don't think it is it's a solo or maybe a duo was that a red that you just sent back yeah yeah there's definitely two of them you destroyed it oh my god nice job okay there's a clock on the rig you can shoot him in the back Ridge yeah go count seven eyes on me he's the ease right here easy kill money gonna shoot him he just came over to you I can't even see anymore oh good
