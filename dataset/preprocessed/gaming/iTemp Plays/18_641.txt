all right team i am back and today we are going to be doing something different we are going to be reacting to my first ever apex legends video if you look here on my video manager it was the 7th of february 2019 and my first ever video was called a kill leader my first win on apex legends battle royale let's give this a watch because hey what was the guy hey friends what's up you're playing a bit of mirage i see tap tap fire in the r301 finally i mean this is just the intro let's get into the gameplay yeah i'm taking us to skull towns skull town i think it's called skulltown i actually came here in my last game and pretty level three i'm hoping i checked the banners this game because i'd like to see what kind of level i am good grief i've got the binos on today the field of view must be at the very most about 35. it's looking like i've been here right that was next to some shopping shelves so i assume that piece of life just picked up it was like a shotgun pistol yes it was re-45 you may as well this is the burst pistol uh no such thing i'm afraid any uh assault rifles i'm pretty sure i thought it was a burst pistol because it sort of resembled the rafika from uh the call of duty series no thank you please change it out there we go you may as well yeah why not give it a go it's the old peacekeeper pretty nerf as well pre-nerf peacekeeper this must have been an absolute beast of a weapon did you see that no i didn't i don't know i heard this guy there's definitely someone else further to the right so we've got to be careful of that i'm going to come some sneaky tactics maybe i could just run in here you might have heard me but oh you've absolutely bamboozled me look at the old look at the old pictures look at mirage look at oh god look at pathfinder bless him he must have been an old model i'm coming teammates i missed just missing just missing shots not much has changed get him got this thing quite slow yeah you don't have a shotgun bottle that's good i'm reef i know you need a shotgun bob don't steal the loot this guy was level eight oh it's the glory days the glory days of apex take me back level eight uh medkit shield shells okay shield shells she sells shield shelves by the shield shore you're fine what's going on over this way the old lifeline revives you got to do manually you could literally just get the peak out there or just go around the corner you know you know before this wraith has like what 20 30 health something like that thank you very much i appreciate that one i can't believe that's actually worked out he's level two he's level two oh i tell you what that shotgun that's because you're bad that's a pre enough i mean i had the pk and this guy had the wingman you could literally tell me back i'd get 50 kills i'm i'm not the greatest player in the world i'm really bad with the wingman and the peacekeeper but pre-nerf both those weapons in these lobbies against level twos i'm pretty sure i could get 50. unless i go into a quote this is a closer range area maybe i should just switch it over again just yeah this is efficient just keep switching the heavy mango tends to have on the fully water oh yeah yeah yeah this makes sense this definitely makes sense you're gonna be feeling about in the in your inventory switching over the uh the extended map oh bridges i love this place this is like my first my first main place that i would drop as bridges looks like nothing's kicking off though unfortunately all right okay i'm definitely tatifying that that flat line by the way yeah that's it bamboozle it reload and tell me i've been shot in the back as well you know what i reckon i reckon mirage day one was actually a tier one legend pre-buff but no one had a clue what was going on no one probably knew there was a legend that that could do the decoys uh i bet everyone was just getting bamboozled left right and center someone else with him wait this guy didn't fall for my bamboozle he's one of the greatest players i've ever seen how did he know oh r9 on the floor i was going to say nostalgia but that literally was a thing up until like last month our teammate is on the ground bleeding to death and i'm here deciding how many med kits i need to carry i'm really sure what i need he's uh no two no he was already dead i could heal up here and then he was already dead what is that i'm still not i think my teammate needs to be revived you're miles away that's what that noise is you're on the way of the storm okay let me quickly loot this stuff now you're not losing you're just you're confused i'm looting for way too long i actually don't think i'm going to get this pathfinder's banana shotgun no i'm just so confused with all the loot you know memento he's only got 15 though he's only got 15 seconds that's the issue oh god he's timed out if i got a hate message from that pathfinder honest i mean i'm carrying two ultimate accelerants for goodness sake i'm gonna leave a comment why did you leave the the pathfinder no iron man i'm sorry i didn't realize there was a time limit on it and i didn't want to get caught with no bullets i'm sorry oh that's what they all say poor pathfinder wait can you see through stuff with this it's like a millimeter scanner from black ops 2 i believe so because it's doing like a scanning thing and it is a gold sight all right well we let our teammate down but listen you leave and you learn okay i didn't realize that you live and you learn if you're pathfinder you die and you don't learn anything because you're dead because your teammates were looting an evil eight uh for for about a minute and a half it's worth trying to switch that one for the side that guy had big scrap in the distance there you go told you you don't need a barrel stabilizer you don't need one just get please just get involved just run over there a bit of a scrap card which i can't remember what it does oh it sends out all the standing decals you go invisible that guy's down i'm i feel like i'm going to clear up here i feel like i'm going to get at least seven kills teammates sniping i'm bamboozling everyone by sending my decline to a rock this guy's got no shields teammate don't loot them don't loot them watch out i like her from day one we'll get in trouble took earth i mean the rival was there from day one unfortunately yeah you've absolutely destroyed them i i very much doubt they're going to be coming back for more after that performance do i actually switch it out for that take it massive shotgun give me that oh wait the massive was a care package weapon it still would have been a good title fine believe me for the love of god please please go to the shooting we have two minutes they're scrapping a skull town and you are not this guy's level two as well this must have been the first five minutes the game was out i like how i've already unlocked mirage by the way in my head i think the fact that you have a friend can you be quiet the fact that you have to buy the legend probably means that he's he's better you know that was my reasoning so i played mirage because you had to buy him who was the other one you had to buy was it caustic who was it i can't remember my teammate's not shielding a punch i'm trying to get into shield up it's not happening i'm still carrying this ultimate accelerant as well it's just it's just an absolute disaster it's definitely the most amount of kills i've had i mean i'm only level five so i haven't really played that level five bless me that was really cute yeah yeah confusing with that there's someone else's i thought that actually fallen for you there did they fire my decoy no they did not he's still got white armor about 35 minutes into the game with me please what is the god thing that you had turbo car charger reduces i'm literally reading what an attachment does and my team is getting head shot by a sniper this is oh he's got he got crabarized good grief these are the last two teams that are fighting as well wait no not to lose oh you're fine they're scrapping i remember this this guy went a bit crazy with no shields why are you pushing up like a maniac he landed a crater shot to be fair no that was him that was him the last two teams are literally fighting each other and i'm panicking looking behind yeah maybe he just threw a grenade and he went over our heads all right i've got here look matt there we go he's popping a phoenix i don't think these guys are this close to me i don't know if you want want to upgrade your sniper uh four med kits two ultimate accelerants no shield batteries and three shield cells that's the classic level five bag does it just come with attachments on it or what yeah and it does a ton of damage a ton of damage oh we got the oh i'm not really sure how it works where the bonco jumps what's this music hold on it's kicking off stick together the music's pumping this is safe man oh making contact oh absolutely bamboozled his name i want to know if he still plays and iron man nine kills for less than 900 damage those were the days my friends that was my first ever win on apex on ps4 at least and was my first ever video all right maxi anto03 i believe his name is oh lifetime level 10. that might have been his one and wait matches he played one on the 22nd of february this year but he's only level 10 and he's only got 27 kills on all of them with bloodhound which is the person he was playing here that may have been his only win and it's recorded and it's on youtube matt if you're out there you're a good teammate you're a good guy good snipe at the end i saw he was beautiful all right so this is my first video the second one is called my new most kills on apex legends um and that was the day after but a week later i uploaded this video because i found a gold wingman and it shreds and this got 1.2 million views so i'm going to put this on it's a 21-minute how long is it until i get the wingman i better not be clickbaiting myself here so i don't have the goldwing man stop and there was someone camping in the corner the whole time i guess i didn't even see him watching the video back i absolutely did i've just gave him the swift one too imagine if this guy kills me like this video would have helped my channel so much back in the day imagine if this guy kills me and i don't get this video and he's fuming at me for destroying his robot take the wingman it was a gold of scorpius there we go that was worth that wasn't it gold there we go i was actually so close goldwing man it's got a one never gold attack like a gold yeah i don't know why either i'm also confused it's got a one times two times variable which is a terrible sight but it's the wingman with 12 bullets and a really fast fire rate back in the day so it still shreds so i it wasn't clickbait and also it was a bonus here we were also fighting at bridges which is great there we go oh hop off i can promise you i'd yeah yeah that'll that'll work i'll promise you why sorry if i don't throw it i didn't you really can't see what's going on that guy's looting oh it's a decoy i'm being bamboozled i'm a mirage maid and i'm bamboozling myself oh they fell down oh good grief there you go there's a scorpio coming to effect double headshots that was him he's got four kills and a ponies the kill leader yeah that's a bit of a scam where's your friend i finally had the digital threat if i knew i had the is digi really weird that's kind of creepy actually i feel like a a robot that's programmed to react to things in exactly the same way every time people used to use their mics and communicate back in the day i never have because obviously i'll be sitting there talking to myself the entire time you're getting up there oh okay i can't believe this guy are you just going to push me apparently i'm almost not expecting that that's like a gold play thanks french that guy i believe was level three so the ranks are i mean we are getting good there now level three oh for the love of god you don't need any more loot you've got so many things you've got so much this is why nowadays i can't stand looting i i will go in a bag and i'll know what i need in my head and i think all right good i need to shield batteries and i'll go straight there that's why i always miss like gold helmets and stuff i'll just scroll right past things but i would still rather loot how i do now than back then which is looting for 35 minutes if i check this i'm going to skip sick of it what would i even want out of this care package you've got the mastiff and you've got the crater i know for a fact that i wouldn't take the crater if it was a massive i probably do a massive shotgun there you go i think i was too scared i think i was too scared the spitfire back then as well was unreal man look at this area this this is like race labs area we've got the shattered forest it's all burnt down right labs is just around here on the right than this i wish i could switch the sides look at that oh i've got i've got the zoom image though on this target okay thank goodness oh my god i'm gonna actually start shooting someone all right you actually find it let's see hey get involved get involved how do you say on my way in spanish voy and camino i've learned that since then i don't know many spanish words you guys told me that i see him i have times have changed i know many spanish words now look how fast you can fire this weapon it's ludicrous what a stupidly good gun with uh with only three squads left just new body bags you'll see yeah loot body bags that's that's my favorite past time that's all i was doing this game i've got my ultimate hopefully it confuses them i do not need to drop down confusing me by the looks of it get away from the rocket sir i cannot see anything what fool decided to drop their ultimate here okay i want names oh my god he's chasing me good job teammate there we go i don't know how that's worked i don't know how that's worked i only i didn't really do anything there friend i mean chopsticks reacting as if i was like the best player in the game i was what level five still maybe i'd reach level 10 by this point i assume the last person or last team even is one person it's always the way when they're hiding yeah use that shield battery for what 32 shields yeah you're one of your 22 shield cells times never change i just think it's so anti-climactic it felt like i didn't do anything oh he's coming up he's coming up 10 kills so far oh here he is he's near the rock please somebody saw him oh my god i didn't that wingman fires so unbelievably fast it's crazy how was this a gun in the game i cannot believe it no one do shreds a basic wingman from the floor would have been would have been shredding people great work friend that's my new legendary skin by the way i hope you i hope you like that yeah it's tremendous eleven kills seventeen hundred and eighty dollars damage my teammates coming out with a kill age which is nice and a bit freaked out now well there you go two videos from last year 18 months ago these videos were i hope you enjoyed my little reaction to the little throwback session if you did be sure to leave a like creating subscribe to the channel if you're new around here and i'll see you all in the next one bye
