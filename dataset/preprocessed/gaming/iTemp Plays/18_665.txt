i saw it through the window coming you're good i'm gonna make my way to you unless you want this blue i guess no no no they're all up in here i might go through the way are they all the way up top or in the middle part nope oh my god no way you just got like double tackle i think mate he's exceptionally bad he's exceptionally bad oh my god she's gonna have my armor but she has literally one health i hit her for over a hundred a lot watch over the lifeline apparently she is a god where am i i forgot where i was let's go rich trying to race for my boy my man were they separate oh they were because the lifestyle was insta that's weird they're just coexisting almost so slow i can't believe she exploded me yeah i really can't believe that that was insane i walked in i started firing the devil i'm like oh this is a wrap i'll show you where i killed these people they had like blue shield and stuff okay just here this way i thank god for you just on my pink thank you thank you it's quite right oh yes sir there you go yeah what kind of massacre is this yeah i bopped them i got them good yeah that you did level it up buy your purchase make a purchase rich make a purchase 15. get ready sort of sad i'm not playing president it's fun he is fun oh god our friend they're both here too uh almost cracked off purple are you dying i think there's another team on the left you see him in the street oh god really i think so yeah he's like far not should have already healed i was buying bullets dude i thought i showed that i told you everything's gonna have a sentinel you were right you called it oh god yep i wanna do good luck my friend what the heck man let me off oh i don't know what i'm doing here [Music] i've been altered i'm scared it's tough i mean it's a bloodhound no matter where you go he knows where you are yeah it's like you've got walls i should not be up top i don't know get him out of here i don't know who we think he is get him out of here let's go rich so rich bravo my man oh my word i'm not kill leader i'm not gonna lie i kind of figured that it was another team because the team that i saw in the middle didn't have a pathfinder and the pathfinder team had to be a different pathfinder team because they died because they said so when you got bloodhound scanned i was like there's got to be another team oh okay but you handle both of them i don't mean so many thank you get out of here they helped out a little bit i don't have too many bullets but hey thank you you should probably take my code yeah this will be dropping a replicator hold on how much does this give you 25 i don't have enough to craft you a portable one i don't think it's in there anyways is it not oh oh i feel like it always should be that'd be cool i feel like that's the best thing they could put in there it really is there's a response came down i can get you a can down hey we can win this we can win this yeah we're going to bring it back 100 sauce gets you up top i mean i reckon that pathfinder was like no footsteps but i went up the rope how was he not looking at me because it happens to me too i just like people probably do the same thing that guy's probably playing with no headset oh yeah are you kidding me oh there's a couple prowlers over there yeah yeah i'm going for loot 100 we got this redemption arc something i mean someone is popping off in this lobby and a massive oh we're laughing yeah yeah massive and and prowlers over there with blue armor i'm good yeah we're good kill either no it's i don't know who's popping off it's so difficult to get a load of kills nowadays but is that a care package that is hope this is a weapon in there for you it would be nice nine i'm taking it i'm taking i'm taking it i'm gonna come take one of your guns yeah i'm gonna drop on my ammo for it i don't i don't have loads but i had some they're fires on a train you've got enough time to just try and get looted here i'm go dude there's so much ammo everywhere i'm good man i'm gonna come grab that volt i got a mastiff nice it just sounds like the longest distance fight ever like snipers and scouts and no one's going down wait are you someone's honest oh no no someone's right here the rev they're heathen i can reverse them yeah do it do it do it do it they're right here do it i'm gonna guide the back wait oh they pushed that way oh my god
