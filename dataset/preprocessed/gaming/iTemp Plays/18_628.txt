hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some more flashpoint as well i have two games for you both of which are on watson and this has been sort of a well it's been the week of watson on this channel i played her for a video before this limited time mode came out and now she's my favorite legend to play in the new mode as well and speaking of flashpoint i have seen nothing but praise for this on twitter in the comments and from other people in the community and i'm in full agreement and i think it just goes to show that we don't need new guns and new legends every two weeks for them to keep the game fresh i really think that just more limited time modes like this one will keep apex fun until we get to play on the new map which i assume is going to be in about five weeks when season seven comes out and i wanted to ask you guys as well if you had any good ideas for other limited time modes i would love to hear about them in the comments anyway i do appreciate you watching thank you so much and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends um is there anybody else here oh yeah i think there's like one or two teams here i'm a trustee g7 i don't have an armor nice nice very nice hey i'm looking at this button up top literally had a p20 20 because i missed all my shots yeah i went like i don't know i went like all for ten with my wingman so i don't pick that finger i literally don't know how anyone uses that gun not a fan i think if i lowered my fov maybe but it possibly can really see anything no i don't see anything on a wingman especially when they just don't leave they just sit there and just stare at you uh what kind of gun do you have i have a purple uh heavy mag uh i'll go g7 volts okay someone's got rez down here on my way i hate the way when you walk out of the little bubble it sounds like someone's flying on you oh is that why i keep having to look around i didn't know what that was it's the bubble watch as soon as you walk out of it you'll hear it you also have your headset really low too don't you i i heard that yeah i definitely heard that but i still thought of course i got it two times so just can't hear anything with this it's very sad he's right in here do you have uh i have my all oh yeah i'm down further down the corridor so even once once like one shot and we're not in the healing team so once again i'm pushing just one more in that same spot they run off it might be up top i think he might be on my own i think he just came back down okay [Music] you know doesn't have much health help nice very nice i had a feeling he was going to take my old suit straight back down oh no okay this is not good i think we have to run to yeah i'm trying to take some challenge i did yeah i think we have to run to uh poi yep zone oh there's no white armor i want to take it though i have my alts and i have another um ultimate accelerant so it might not be the worst thing ever for me to use it but there is a just behind this mountain and i don't think many people will be here let's risk it yeah i think this is the last one this is the last one yeah that's the zone oh my god oh okay maybe people will be here we can go cage would you reckon yeah jacqueline which is i think we just got it i don't think we got a choice i don't think that i like this end zone too this is my favorite one i don't think i've ever played with it here i like this one a lot buddy we have to survive all this right here yeah they're right on it he has white shield he only has weight he's gonna run away surely i say we go under can we go under yeah [Music] they're not pushing though on nice angle those cracks finish the bloodhound that goes down this is probably the same as before okay reloading i'm just leaving oh that's a scam stupid lifestyles i'll have my uh i'll have my ultimate that team's dead nice and this is the team are there in there they're in there are they in the shield there they are they are i need to hide frozen yeah yeah we're good mate we're good passes yeah they're inside bottom floor on the outside of the door i need to use a ultimate accelerant they love slime racing at that top i need to i need to heal my 13 health i got it nice i'm dropping on him get i just dropped i just put like a thousand bullets and to give me shield oh my god mate i didn't have my i couldn't i didn't have enough time to use an ultimate accelerant like how much i put into his shield i don't understand this guy has 2 000 finishers on on uh caustic this man hates everyone i have such a terrible setup i'm gonna drop this mastiff i've already got a shotgun in the form of triple take ah nice it's [Music] no i was trying to stop the lifeline race okay um oh no because i was very angry then i know i hate seeing a lifeline as it gets me mad it's so annoying i'm gonna i think on this mode if you level up your shield it should give you the come on oh like the extra armor yeah like because now i have to stand in this to get my blue armor i think that's a big scam yeah i i think that'd be sick i know i'm not sure if apex knees is bad because of the armor switch thing oh my god all right don't worry i have a what's not don't worry oh i think they're resin in there yeah i've just wasted on my stuff okay i just got a head shot hold on i don't know what i'm thinking that's wrong with you yeah i don't know i've missed everything mate i missed out ultimate accelerant let's go we are not even close to uh poi either oh yeah this is a struggle like i need to stop picking those up just because they're purple the mobile response like what am i doing i know i i end up with like 10 of them in my bag just my watson generator blocked my nades because that's where i threw thermite so i didn't see him go down i don't know i i'm almost positive that it does oh really i never knew that no i think it does block you your everyone's like no matter who it is it blocks all right relax buddy that's ridiculous um yeah maybe just leave them there's no reason for us to push in that too much yeah because we're just gonna get lasered before we get to zone and i can i really hope there's not a caustic okay yeah did he just double jump what no that looked weird what was that he like changed my his uh momentum yeah oh that guy's weak him twice when he's flashed oh my god um i'm gonna go make sure there's not a caustic in this building like last time i need 176. they're a rev trying to red push i sent one back really are you just shooting the flyer no no no the people down though they're trying to port i'm just watching this back and i was definitely shooting the flyer this is what happens when you're trying to snipe with the one times i can't see what i'm shooting here i'm chewing the poor bird this mode is fine i like it it just it makes the fights feel a little bit more rewarding yeah i think it's less sweaty too let me see tomorrow's always awkward oh my god i hate you caustic so much i hate you so much oh my god oh my oh goodness me is this man he needs to go he literally used every single caustic trap he had available just and we took like four damage and we've healed it up oh he's right here oh they're right here from up top nice have you got your jump pad no i had one over here though right there i don't know if that's possible yes i fell down this is a big scam that's outrageous how did i see you like bounced off the edge that was so weird it's hot on my tree what i should probably change his truck tape but i did just he's on for 120. yeah headshots are so scary on that gun there's this guy's weak standing i think one went around this way nice the other ones are down here oh that whole thing right scratch back here oh she left died nice job thighs dude those end games are so fun i love that i love those end games so fun dude annoyingly another close range good apex champions you couldn't use it as oh you're firing the damage though if i'm in the damage up i would would have had obsidian shield if it was a thing
