hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i am showing you guys some early firing range footage of some of the gun changes coming in season 10 tomorrow first up is the new gun of course the rampage here it is firing on all cylinders slow fire rate big damage per shot easy to control recoil even without being charged up it's still a menace of a gun but you don't want to be up close and personal without the fire rate boost here is the fire egg boost attainable by popping in a thermal grenade and you will destroy this weapon next up is the alternator with the destructor rounds no recoil fairly slow bullet travel time but that doesn't matter this gun is just so powerful probably one of the strongest care package weapons we've ever seen on apex just how you remember it here we have the spitfire it speaks for itself it's the pre-nerf spitfire it's amazing we all know how good this is and here's the biggest change in the weapons outside of those three the l-star can now use barrel stabilizers and energy magazines and the downtime between overheating now is basically the same as a regular reload when you have a gold mag it's also really easy to control now this is going to be a very powerful weapon in season 10. so there we have it the biggest weapon changes coming in season 10 of apex legends coming out tomorrow i hope you guys enjoyed the last few gameplays of season 9 i have you today and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends or is he just good that one the other day that i watched what was he he clutched up at the end and then the team was just moving it oh yeah he was so happy i was like so uh when uh i got that res off yeah oh my god teammate just got deleted yeah he landed on the he got purple and a gun there's oh he's so low i i just threw that so hard i should have killed him uh he's the only one he's only one i am nice i should have killed him

is over then who cares it's over uh two teams left i'll let you i'll even let you take the rope how did you get that much damage man because just a farmer i need to craft a mobile because if you die i can kill someone first them and drop their team at mobile respawn or i have a mobile so when you die i'm going to do that you can't see my idea i trademark it's that too late already in use already i need a big pad i need a big pad octane come on come on come on come on come on come on i wasn't enough damage i needed i needed more than that octane does not want a third oh you're actually dead the

actually get a good amount of damage from the guys on me though but he didn't have a red shield or anything ah i got to farm i farmed on that team the apex champions wait damage count oh you know what it was a good it was a good effort even close it was a good effort in my tank and see what happens
