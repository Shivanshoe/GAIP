hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are showcasing the tier 100 of battle pass skin it's for the wingman and it's called a precision of caliber and this is a reactive camo as with all the t100 battle passings now when you get a kill with this the gun itself reacts the smoke extracts and as you get more and more kills more and more colours are added to the glow of the weapon as well now i'm not that much of a wingman player myself i'm not that great with this weapon but i do decent in this game that i'm about to show you and i hope you enjoy it so thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends you see the new dive trail wait is that your oh that's clean is that the that's the masters one oh i should have got it it's nice i'm gonna detect down here it's a massive building that's so clean i should have grinded that where's my flat trail oh here we go i've got the reactive skin no it's not absolutely isn't r99 here light ammo here my reactive wingman skin that's okay by the way oh it's actually gonna be nice playing with the classic now yeah you can swing around yeah oh i just keep every time i think of like the changes i just think back to my cowboy pathfinder that's probably my only grief with this update is uh a lot of bugs to say the least yeah i'm not sure if it's me that's missing and it's just the game saying that you i don't know what the feedback is there like is that supposed to hit or is it it's it's definitely not you like i've got clips even in the the two videos i uploaded i uploaded two videos in both of them there's like gross no regs disgusting like disgusting no regs it doesn't they don't get much worse than the ones i was hitting everything with the wingman though there was always with a wingman that's weird my scandal is horrendous do you hear that i do g7 right this way conduct a search right here did you see the uh the octane buff wait no what what did he do wait wait it's like a reduced cooldown he's all right it's like 60 seconds it's jump pad you get a pad every minute that's crazy like mirage is every minute it's unreal it's pretty much an ability yeah they're gonna nerf him he is so strong it's insane they're definitely gonna nerf his i reckon just they're all called then i reckon probably yeah like in like 75 seconds or something like this is just buff one of two for now oh really okay someone's like beneath there too i just got two no wrecks okay i'm putting this down i headshot a mirage there's a logo right here weak it's so weak somewhere how many is it this guy yeah it's it's got to be something with the wingman that they changed that made it exceptionally bad i'm going to put my faith in it because i like the skin that is true oh well another treasure pack only got one but still oh what's the voice you see there was a treasure back here there is a treasure back here shield here i went all out with that one yeah he did there's a treasure pack here thank you treasure [Laughter] i'm struggling to recognize where i am half the time because the beautiful red light it feels like i'm an entirely new map even though obviously i know what he sees it just feels like i don't know where it is the colors in the lighting are amazing wait this is nice isn't it yeah yeah because that's like the little yeah okay all right this is where there should be a house right here this used to be all grass yeah did didn't it and it had like weirdly spaced out supply bins just randomly in the area randomly there yeah this is a good touch this is actually my first time being here yeah because i was talking about knowing the location i'm like wait a second no i don't this is beautiful i love the colors man all the grass this feels so nice that's why i think that's why i liked world's edge so much with all the vibrant colors yeah they made it in season four didn't they they made it all red after that it's all like this which is which is nice yeah it's really good oh they ran down that way the barrages look at the mirages cracked nice bang for 50 my slide was horrendous is that over uh yeah and that's my all right then he's dead he's really really he's he's choking to death still oh you good no coming up hit one for 80 something up top around there ish yeah they rotated actually they're above me they're right here they're here they're triggering my trap on the left bloodhound has 40 hp they knew i i knew that this was going to happen so i've placed that trap down there preemptively again crack shields on either guy whoever it is those kind of clothes yeah i knew it was bad when i saw you jumping towards me that's why i knew it was uh they should have killed me they definitely should have killed me i messed up did they wow i wish i had my ultimate twice oh team behind me come on come here come in i think i'm shooting him wait that's a goal it's going to be a skeleton it is nice i'm coming cracks crack shields on the right lane yeah you're not going to push that again oh that's it yeah there was no people over this way though there's another thing somewhere i'm feeling that with octane i'm just getting pad after pad i'm 90 on another one she uh she portaled or tell her what would you even call it she's right yeah she's braceleted that's the verb bracelet again look at that wait that must be no no no no no no no no no no no no no no the call that is 25 seconds yeah there has to be two we got quit braceleting there she is oh she's she made it that far yep you know that's the bracelet maneuver my friend where'd she go oh someone's respawning wait where is that oh that's right behind us okay should we go for the respawn or what do you want to do i think that's i think that's like dig deep into labs no oh we can land we can land oh yo hey care back over here this could be uh this could be your peacekeeper oh nice i think you just took it actually it's right on the corner it's right here what do you think is over here i think that i think that lobo might have taken it the light just went away oh she's pricing it again she is oh that's such a way that oh she messed it up she messed it up nice another pad he's going to stay on the road flash okay we're shooting out the sky we're shooting outside oh we hit these come on where was she oh i was aiming way too high my friend i was wait looking i thought you somehow got inside the balloon she has the peacekeeper she has to have the beast she definitely does another care pack over there too i have no idea where she would have gone me neither it's one thing about oh i hear that she's going over here head shot nice i hit her for a hundred i hit it for a hundred years coming down is she actually oh she just chilled it should have shielded is she going to take her again hit her again for another 100 on my ping bon down low okay doesn't work properly and i kept um i just like basically i'll punch the floor on in in the middle of that fight so dude i hit her i i put like a clip of my nine into her and like nine shots in a row were no race that someone's tricking my trap where's that i don't know this guy this guy up here has blue armor oh it's a classic battle i only got three more sniper bullets uh i should have picked some up for you move again blacktops cracked classic is kind of classic playing right here aggressive on me okay i'm coming back you saw i really hurt eleven i can't see him nice i knew that the um the animation takes forever doesn't it she must be behind us putting the bracelet back on screaming at the screen right there all right i'm playing weird strange in a good way uh sometimes yes sometimes no it's a little bit of a mix going on here all right i reckon this last team is the one that uh revived so i reckon they're saved somewhere are probably correct that's my power production sherlock rich on the case once again oh here we go oh my wingman's going crazy it's all reactive and stuff i've got the primary colors on the go nice wait what color does it change to it's like glowing green blue and red are those the primary yeah that's kind of cool okay this guy's got ready uh sorry basically though this is all you you got this i'm i'm way too far away oh my god there it is nice i got mirage altered and i'll tell you what my life flashed before my eyes i got double tap skated i was like this is the end the wingman's looking nice mate it's looking tasty you are the egg i like that champions i should have got you to drop it for me to see yes actually that's a smart idea we'll do that another time i'll stack it up fun game
