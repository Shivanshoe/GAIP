hey what's up guys it's reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some revenant who i love playing but he is looked down upon so much at the moment whenever king's canyon is the ranked map on apex revenant becomes a menace and it's because king's canyon is quite bad for third parties and with revolt you can get a no risk full send third party because if it goes bad you just spawn back in the safety of your totem with 150 health also when octane's jump pad got buffed recently this combination got far more annoying because of the distance that you can cover for your entire team you can third party someone half the map what it feels like but it's a fun legend to play i love his design and voice lines they're amazing and also in the first game of today's video i'm trying to get used to a regular ps4 controller i usually play on a scuff but mine is just broken so my aim is shaky in some parts but it's still decent it's not too bad considering i'm trying to use a new controller but yeah thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'll go here i'm running this one comes up um i went below i think there's two down here with me so i might be dead uh don't worry man i've got a mozam and white armor oh i got a ball okay okay and this oh i'm taking the report so many teams a lot of teams down there okay they're all what's going on dog i'm coming up oh thank you huge one boiler more people down there uh i have a med kit hold my house on the ground okay nice that's nice yeah i got my kill which is good and there were two more people so if you need those let me know i don't need them um i have two cells i can take them i drop something lt's on 50 scan i forget that i crouch quicker something i always forget about rev yeah crouch is kind of nice you can creep up really nicely rising's cracked oh oh okay i think they'll still live get in here somewhere we're going to spain another team are you kidding or anything i have a 301 with no meg so annoying such a broken jab another one below at some point i'm gonna have to use an uh a a horizontal at some point cracked wait behind me i think this is yeah all right we're in the middle of two teams i'm like extended so that path and that octane i think got away right uh oh yeah this way oh my god how annoying wait look at them just go i'm never going to catch up to these guys either they're so fast that is gone bunch of speeding boys you know made kind of i think yeah just beneath me last few squads wish i had my old seat this is a nice place for silence well there's probably some there though anything yeah it's really it's really flexible i just can't wait to do that i completely get that way too much effort okay i gotta be on this side of the map right yeah they have to surely didn't react to all that shooting so oh yeah over here i have my oh my god i'm gonna put my where is he i don't know i hear him the rev oh back there i thought one of them went in here oh maybe maybe that's what that was he just quick scoped you well these guys they're in here on this building he thinks i'm cracked oh boxing nice just loving the box to do that i still want a game mode where you can pick the same legends i want to see one playing pathfinder i mean how that would just be it would just be the greatest ever or just everyone yes it doesn't have to be here for two weeks just like two days three days a game automatically picks it for everyone so it's like everyone's just playing and if it sucks you're getting lucky it's like everyone's playing watson it's like oh but then you imagine everyone's playing fuse the whole map's on fire i had the greatest idea for a video um you you come in like as the dummies you know you know no no hip no difference in hitboxes name it boxes everything and um you have a you have like your ability and every time you use a like you start off with maybe like a bubble and then every time you use the ability it changes oh my god this crack goes behind you oh there he is or maybe it wasn't crater i think he charged since not me that's mine usually again we're getting all scared for nothing i know he's getting annoyed that's what you have a thing you know the crab clip i had the other day um my mom reminded me where you were trying to like save me and the one where you went like 12 or 12 right uh oh yeah it's that one killed like 14 do you reckon if you get crave a hedge i mean the crab is already disintegrate just explode just do a thousand damage you just explode you can't be rest your banner can't be picked up just but you're new game it just automatically uninstalls the game for you it's like go try this all right 100 they hurt ready ready oh he's blind well done genius my controllers disconnected oh my god i can't play bro where's the what is find this all right i don't know if the path i don't know but i'm gonna drop them no they're gonna go into the storm for heat shut down i'm giving them my second chance i'm giving them a second chance they don't even want to res i've only got two crabby shots left he's putting the right shield up for him they're still so scared fight do something cool i've got two shots left i'm just going to shoot to them go for it go for it go for it come on come on come on oh man behind that oh you got that one down okay the other one yeah yeah yeah what do you got he's down here somewhere oh he used on the other side of this okay one shot left right here right on the edge of the door right on the right on my ping [Music] oh my god it's a massacre nice when i when my audio is going bad my controller disconnects so i have to put it back in like the wire is kind of loose and like my pc wants to use is an audio source it gets confused for a second champions uh so what what is your excuse referring to um there is no excuse okay absolutely popped off with the crater
