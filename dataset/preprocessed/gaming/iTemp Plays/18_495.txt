hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i have what i believe is my highest kill game of the season so far it's quite difficult to get damage and kill credit when the people you play with are jenks and so far who are obviously incredibly good players and also main octanes they're always in the fight first it's tricky last season i got a 4k badge whilst playing with so far just because he was practicing mouse and keyboard so it allowed me to step up to the plate and put in a performance you know hope you enjoyed today's gameplay thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends best bangalore skin ever by the way really good we're going to be matching we're going to be matching two again oh yeah come on badgers let's go intimidating 7 19 13 in successive seasons that's progression right there in the progression i'm going straight to the middle part i'm going to land in this tree i'll come with you we'll land together i'll go straight down with you hopefully not just the windows track signing down the other side i'll meet you in there okay i'm down to push that so am i do you have you made uh no thank you i've alternated r3 so much gas hey oh i'm vlogging are [Music] for that one of these guys have blues oh they are there i'm in the smoke

respect 120 here 120. i took the vault extended like magazine here level 2 ammo did you hear the fight down though as well i did hold on here hold on here let me do a thing here gonna put it on the wrench i missed it it still might work though oh beautiful it was here i see some crates some death boxes all the way to the other side thinking that they were in here and they're not oh they took a pad oh i'm not [Music] hit one he jumped on me he jumped on me i i hit him a little bit he's probably got 20 shields 20 shield totals he's on a bat right now purple oh no you're you're ticking you got the bat though i gotcha that was the last of us another squad you can switch this purple up top either one well thank you three zero rings close oh okay horizon just flying through the air that was kind of funny i was not expecting that no what was i ten seconds healing that's a fun stop six kills a thousand damage okay yeah all you dude you're cooking i'm gonna need to find some light ammo i have uh i've got i can drop you soon that second stack is just one bullet situation like that i uh wish i would have had a little bit yeah yeah i was trying to i was trying to fight up close that bloodhound with my repeater and it was like see there's so much i can do that's the problem i was having before i was no scoping i was zooming in it's difficult it's honestly kind of tough you're really limiting yourself whereas if i had a nine you just would have died yeah to the right i thought i heard to the right too yeah yep that was the whole 411 bullets is a beamer it is is that what i was going to say no you i thought you're going to say nice title the r3l1 is a beamer yeah like have you guys tried the arthur one we're in season 8 of apex legends are you familiar with the r301 it's been good since day one it is good though it is good i i wasn't lying [Music] launch my smoke from the smoke launcher crazy not to let him fly i guess extra damaging might accidentally get a kill too imagine ah one day i'm right behind you i heard your smoke and i thought i heard a footstep but then it was like your footstep in combination with the smoke not even looking not even looking oh he would look let's get in there that's like my favorite thing about octane when you hit a pad you just kind of like go yeah oh yeah it's the go bun i'm gonna hawk yeah yeah must go faster it's gonna be a big nade trust it's the biggest name i've ever done in my life to the right okay it was a zero it's a zero zero this is the biggest i've ever thought of this was huge no that was a little short it was almost the biggest need though huge thermite octane got purple oh i messed up oh i messed up who am i getting shot from give my shield i don't know why this guy is so trying to thirst me why thirst me do you not hear like three teams fighting each other nice i have a phoenix v if you need it do you need it yeah drops it dropped it dropped it if you slide into that pad i think i got it perfect where you'll slide perfectly into the other side 100 i'm dead i don't know why i challenged that he's not going to push he's not pushing you're looking this psycho will be pushed he's got 20 health replicators coming in for a landing thank you give me a second charging i mean he's heard that gun somewhere uh he has one single hp one one single hp in here yeah yeah [Music] eat through all of it i have a ton i can drop i'm dropping a lot of energy i just don't want vaults i don't find any there's 130 here 77 in this box and then another 60 on the ground ah thank you perfect right when i dropped my vault i found all the energy and the extending mags and everything that i needed oh my god this this place is just a mess the energy d-pod dude i love it here the old energy d-pad i am looted i have so much light i'm dropping some light i'm picking some back up get it together i need light i'm dropping some light i have too much light i'm picking it up yeah i'm picking it back up i'm running i'm going on a rope i was keeping you updated and what's going on the play by play yeah yeah all right not even looking we're just going in once again it's the play oh it was a really wimpy pass i should have waited that was a wimpy oh just he would have been a good one well we got another one right here this one we prepared earlier i was just sitting there marinating waiting for us to come back a second time hello we're inside the ring one last thing first you lose your cool then you lose your head where the people are there was a package down here somewhere wasn't there i saw a light and now i don't see a light so wherever it landed i don't know where i landed though it was somewhere in this direction i thought right oh right yeah right right hedge on this ramp yeah blue armor on one i'm gonna go die again oh jump massive shot give my shields a reach up get ready for a light show what have we got in here hopefully these guys have some throwballs because i do not need 412 you get what'd you get nothing a purple knock down shield and a purple shield oh god i know right literally scammed it getting worse and worse i mean there's only two squads left so it better be something good should not be in packages bro guns should not be if i have one and i can just change out the site if i wanted to i don't want a variable scope yeah i just it's i'm just baffled by it i don't know whose idea that was but that was not it that was not it would have been nice when the game came out because those videos were bangers those are good yeah it was just fun finding a golf gun i'm gonna put it all on the line this place freaks me out honestly rings next door when we came from all right fellas get it together we came from this way though right so i don't know if anyone would be this way unless they underestimate the rats yeah half of one i see anything to solo this package is open hmm they dropped a gun for it this is a fresh one mozam gold beak and they dropped here somebody dropped a nine i probably have a problem let's go let's go they're dropping an smg i don't know i don't know what to do oh right ahead they dropped off the charge awesome mirage
