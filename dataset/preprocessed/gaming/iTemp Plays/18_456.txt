hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing the new most annoying legend on the game horizon at least for me it used to be caustic but since his nerf he's a little bit less effective and he's not the best on olympus anyway because there's a lot of open fields and you can catch a core stick out fairly easily horizon on the other hand my word i'm sick of it i'm sick of people floating in the air with 100 accuracy strafing like a maniac impossible to hit and then they just float down towards you with no audio cue because they're flying in the air so you have no idea what's going on and then there's her ultimate which always catches me when i'm half a second from making it out of range and if you stand and shoot it you die to the ark side that she threw at it uh but if you try and run it takes 10 seconds you can't even grapple out of it and as a pathway to me that's kind of infuriating she's just so good which i suppose isn't a problem uh for most people it's more of an issue for me because of how difficult i find it to shoot people who aren't airborne maybe i just need to get better she's a fun legend to play though and that is why we are playing it today i hope you guys enjoy the two games that i have for you and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends if you can hold your own masters it's fine exactly i'm actually in the line here i'm not here okay he's not thrilled with that choices up here there we go he's not gonna know oh this guy is tilted oh my god jake's top rope oh i'm sorry dude i don't think i've ever jumped on somebody's head from now on that's crazy i went for the kung fu kick if that worked it would have been spectacular i spent most my time looting this is why you should never loot as much you should just why here i have 100 damage i have one more one damage and a hundred of it was on a down car it was all gangsters five maids yeah i mean all my damage is from grenades i'm risking it all there is to me [Music] we can push that was such a good alt dude we didn't even try to coordinate it but we did i threw throw it through all my frags right where you threw your oh my god beautiful the accidental coordination that's when you just you know when you're on the same page you're on the same page oh i suggested that it should be adaptive like however people are left that's how much the circles should close to avoid this basically you know they didn't steal you from me i'm just a genius you know no they probably stole it they probably stole it from me i mean they stole the gold armor switch oh hey i don't won what a good emp by the way somewhere i have my ulti again and i've only got one night i got so many needs okay
