hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing a legend who has been simply forgotten about by apex i cannot believe they removed the lifeline's revive shield only to give it to another character that comes out after her that doesn't make any sense now for clarification i was actually one of the people that didn't like her five shield beforehand i actually don't mind her like afk revive system at the moment and i think she would be a good character if her ultimate was good she's got such a bad ultimate on the longest cooldown in the entire game i think if they make it so you can push around your drone again so you can move whilst healing with a little drone that was great and if they rework her ultimate to literally anything anything will be better than the care package and i think lifelong mains will be happy again because it's a bit of an insult to get rid of lifeline's revive shield and then just give it to newcastle i would be absolutely raging that's like as a pathfinder main that's like taking away pathfinder's grapple they're like i was too op but then a few months later being hold on a sec we've got a new legend and he's got a grapple good oh and he's even been the pathfinder's watch i'll be furious thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends uh i don't think anyone's landing up top but no we got one team landing up top with us all right i'm gonna get out things am i gonna die cause i've got no gun i mean you're gonna die i got angry i got angry at them i don't want them to know that i was mad oh no we're very aware yeah there's a huge scrap there i definitely dropped i know don't wanna go though we should have taken the gravity launcher really wait no one came we're superior more athletic more impressive bigger hands physically i mean emotionally spiritually philosophically in every manner proverbially you know now you're just going too far you're just with the right in here there's a team over there they dropped nice shot on that guy i don't know what that one's really though behind this model oh he actually you try that's actually a good attempt to be honest and some other guy got away by the way i think someone already took it maybe i don't know i mean yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of people here very true we're taking this executive decision take it now executive decision oh god mate no no no no no please shield down i didn't even make it i did i did we're fine
