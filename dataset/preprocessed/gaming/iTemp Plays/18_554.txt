hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing with janks and triple take man in this game half man half triple take came out of the woodwork once more third party and us from the craziest high ground you've ever seen so we set about getting our revenge later in the game remember that it doesn't end when you think it's going to end you will see what i mean thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i don't know the last time i landed here i have no idea it was since i've been here too in a hot minute as they say why did he was living there hello where's one did you take it i took the guy okay that's good oh my god oh my god let's go race there's so many people over here uh i'm just gonna make it i need one damage for shields let me know oh that that right that right that shield right yes oh no i took it i took it because i didn't have shield either that's okay ask am i that thanks jump jets scanning came from that way yeah he scared me while i was in the smoke that was kind of scary we'll check him for smoke uh rezzed them they were resting and the second he got up he scanned me through the smoke oh my god so i was like worst case scenario see them and they can see me man my chair is driving me up the wall i need a new chair i got one recently a nice fancy one actually i was thinking about getting one of those herman miller that's what i got i want to get one is it is it worth it nice i was looking at them today yeah logitech that's what i got that's some of that that's what i was looking at it was like uh i don't know it's one of their chairs but it's like the logitech crossover crossover yes yeah yeah and there's a few changes honestly if you think about it if you have like any issues at all because of your chair you'd spend more money fixing it and plus the added aggravation and stuff you know someone's here okay i'm coming they're getting shot by triple take guy though wait they're not the triple t guys nope oh so there's two teams here yep are down one behind the bin drops level three extended standard energy mag here level three that triple tape okay guys stop they're not on the same team team above and teamed up yeah yeah yeah they were shooting at the guys down low before i dig down someone can i get up i'm coming okay i need to recharge my shields how do they get that off another squad's attacking oh my god they're both one shot i got triple taped in the back yeah this other team bro they jump off triple t guy knocked me and he knocked his arcane and he's just not moving okay [Music] i have a magic kit if you need it i have one i have one thank you healing up eyes are open though i'll take the mastiff light though i know i still have an r3 if you it's not desperate because it's unboxing ct thank you i don't mind cuz i've got a wingman 160 light in here no where did the octane go like this way i don't know can we please kill this triple tape team oh i thought that was them no no that was not the triple take team the box there were boxes at the end of the wraith paul but that sounded like two teams like underneath us punching each other no no so that race was punching her teammate into the portal the race got away the race punched her octane teammate into the portal i say and then at the other end of the portal i'm 99 sure that he got thirsted by the triple take team that was up here that still i think the other oh i don't know what's happening i want to kill this triple take guy though i want him out of here i don't know where they went they were up here yeah this is where they were this is where they were standing they were standing there right there yeah and then they thirsted him from right here with the triple take that's okay so they probably jumped off sherlock jenks is on the case they jumped off and they went towards circle we need to get him i'm hungry for blood me too the only bats i have zero blood don't assume you would no zero my knees are aching from the chair bro there's no there's no it's the hydraulic system the air it's there's nothing in it anymore so it just falls to the floor so i literally oh my god you're sitting with my ass on the floor by the chair janks you know it makes sense down here down here down here okay sorry i couldn't think that's good this is so expensive i don't know i just want to know like that it's a really nice chair cracks 105 oh i don't know who it was but it was one of them i found 182 on lifeline nice how did she get shields probably oneself all right give me this mastiff enough is enough we need to keep checking death boxes until we see a triple take um did she have bats and jed one bat it i took it good healing up eyes are open though wait i just got killed credit enemy removed he just fell off the mountain i just fell off the map that's him actually outplayed you know it was a big brain played by me destroyed demoralized a long-term investment to make sure that he died oh yeah oh yes that feels wonderful they're running behind ps5 i can take us up top okay how about we pick me up they're probably going to chase his team unless they spot us someone's raising they're probably going to go to that yeah all right now we're going to be the third ropers we're going to come in late there you go here you go hemlock kind of scary i got a mess if i'm just going to jump in their face and probably get one person [Laughter] oh here we go this is it the fight of the century cue the epic music he's already playing wait someone's here you did reload he went straight down easiest just thirst of my life you better hit your shots because i'm not stopping i don't care how much you hit me for any [Music] i hate those horizon fights on controller it's so difficult to attract people oh my word thank you right here i just swapped out that gold stuff very much appreciated oh why thank you i can't believe that triple take guy oh my word that's sensational i'm so happy that's the most frustrating i've heard you know in a good while there's nothing worse than just i have a thing in my bomb i have arcstars i need to bat be phased we ain't got no brakes i hear a rope yeah she's up here what a play but it didn't work out unfortunately but up full play cotton let's see how that one worked out yeah it was kind of it was kind of close last time there you go it only took until there was one of the team to find it i just wanted our stars that's okay though look i can just heal up here there are so many boxes here it's crazy state is always popping off oh yeah i should actually take a bath i have four if you need to do you need something i got one i got one i can drop you one you're smelling it they don't know you're down there so they're rushing me they're hard rushing me my face cracked he's falling off i'm saying octane race so i think them i had to find out if his name was yeah check the name for kimmy i should have let him kill me i should have let him kill me i will never know it is is it him yes yes we did it they went back to their triple take in fact they couldn't have because actually they probably did they probably didn't they probably just yeah they got their own triple take oh it was it was it was the octane with the triple take same name that that was him bro victory we never forget you know we never forget
