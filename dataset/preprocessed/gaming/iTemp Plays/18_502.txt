hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are sniping specifically we are using the longbow dmr because this gun has a new reactive camo in season eight at the tiers 100 and 110 in the battle packs and when i've already used the longbow i i have a great time it's one of those satisfying weapons i feel like all of the snipers on apex are satisfying weapons to get kills with hopefully enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends sister i got my no oh no it's been a while it has indeed okay there's no longbow here there's every other sniper though [Music] it's very unfortunate with the charge rifle yep i mean i could use that until right i suggest we get messed up here oh i found one yes very nice i don't know if you find like uh level four oh my god i need it let me know if you um find a like a two times or a three times

at us go mate oh my word we just sniped everyone on the server he's annihilated i think before it's my size oh my word i think i missed one but in my defense i shot it at a decoy it wasn't my fault you know dude i saw he altered and i there was i didn't know which one was him but i saw one decoy running right at me and i was like i'm going to shoot this one and i head shot him and he just instantly goes back and then another mirage was then he altered as well but i heard him reload his gun it was a dead giveaway wait i have two syringes i saw a load of medkits where we came underneath this though right i dropped like six is that where they were i don't remember where i have you know syringe um i gotta make it i'm dropping some right now oh miles away i'm very close i thought we were like right here should be good though that was worth it though beautiful snipes that was fun it's my third one the greatest octane ever it's not playing with me huh it's not like playing with me
