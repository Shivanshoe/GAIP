hey everybody it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to get another collection event on the 21st of june which is next tuesday in it it's called awakening and the collection event is for valkyrie's heirloom which actually looks amazing alongside the heirloom we are also getting a town takeover on olympus for lifeline and she gets buffs alongside this release as well so let's start off with the loop it's called suzaku and i'll look this up this apparently means vermilion bird which kind of suits valkyrie's theme it's a really good looking heirloom with amazing animations by the look of it and i hope that i'm not culturally insensitive to call it a spear because it looks like it's beer it probably has a more technical name but i'm kind of just needing it my apologies now to get this you are going to need to buy the 24 packs in the collection event or you can use your elm shards i think you have to wait until after the event though next up the news is on the town takeover it's called lifelines clinic this is situated between gardens and the grow towers in the north eastern corner of olympus now he's hoping the drop ship takes over that way instead of power grid and docks for the 800th game in a row this area has a med bay where legends can heal up passively much like uh lifeline's drone there are also hollow displays which shows if someone is inside healing or if the med bay is recharging the emergency platform has the best loot of the poi and it's in the back and you can use a care package console there you can only use this console once per game so you've got to be quick now this pi is really interesting i like they had different almost mini events for these now much like uh caustic and kryptos takeovers on king's canyon as well now we'll be home for this as i leave the next day on holiday so expect a few videos or maybe even a youtube stream before i leave another big bit of news here is the wingman and car are entering the crafter replacing the r301 and the rampage now i'm glad the car is going in there because i suck with that gun and i don't want to land on anymore and i'm kind of happy the wingman is leaving us too even though i love this gun it's a it's a bit annoying let's be honest it's a little bit annoying now moving on to the lifelines buffs i'm just going to read this straight from the patch notes combat revive moved revive cancel option from lifeline to the player that's getting revived a dock hill drone healing pool increased from 150 to internet it still lasts 20 seconds though and the healing radius is doubled as well her care package has been reduced from five minutes down to three and a half minutes on the cooldown and the weapon attachment panel now comes with a shield battery instead of two shield cells also there is no blue beam on the initial drop but it will still show after the care package lands so the buffs aren't like crazy there's no rework but at least she's getting some love let's see how this works out for her i have a great game here for you today guys thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends ah she's gonna gloat about this all day to victory a very weird rendition of that was my uh yeah if you enjoyed it i didn't like here and go to the left not me i'm next to him okay all right that was fun but mostly level one your help is very helpful my damages med kit here and also thanks why you left oh my god my gun isn't loaded um that's punch i don't know why why not yeah why not reloading recharging why not they're fine over here this is the way it wants to go that one was bad that one was really nice if you saw from my perspective it kept it kept changing oh it was bad man it's all the way a match 99 oh man i hope this makes it into a video like i hope we have a really good game that you just have to post you know there you go but it's funny it is funny you could see from my perspective it kept it changed into and i didn't move and it went straight back down to the bottom one i don't understand the game it was a big it was a big bug we were about to get finished you know she had a note here look let's regroup we're about to get stunned through the door uh yeah it's been watching my incredible elite watson games oh what it is yeah i think so damn should have gone to fragment that's why you always go fragment even when you think you shouldn't go fragment you go fragment you definitely should we shouldn't have gone home yeah every time embarrassing really embarrassing call from supposed idl you know you talk about yourself you you said let's go harvester oh no i'm talking about where we land i can actually on um of this no you've got to trust me trust me this time trust me i really don't trust me i'm going to okay oh god thanks this present makes me happy right grenade what are your bats give me a sec what the heck is that what the heck was that oh launching surprise too i mean i can't compete with that i can't compete with that that's a really good question 54 flash they respond behind us too yeah i'm gonna kill those i've got a g7 oh yeah g7 yes nice where'd you get that from me there was a random death box on the top of streamer and it was red i thought oh free red armor i killed that guy i really risked that three challenging [Music] reloading anyone in here so you know the ring is near 45 seconds remain i'll give you taking the road it's really low nice uh yeah they're just gonna get batteries again and then uh yeah yeah i hope he does there's no one in this lobby so wait i heard him i love celebrating with my best friends that's you i know where you're at he's right here where could he be where could he be we'll be caught outside the ring if we don't move he's a tough one don't get him don't kill him he's going to come back and see all of us i don't know he's going to breathe he's interested he's going to rest wait he's actually he's actually he's going to come back don't kill him as soon as he goes off they won't respond [Laughter] what happened oh no [Laughter] oh that's so good we're going to get banned ah i've done way worse you've actually teamed or what we said i actually teamed with like a solo in uh in this one game to kill this one team it was great so that's strategic now we've just got four people this is an advantage yeah this is this is this isn't good he's got no health and no shield so he's not anything it's been his old game resin yeah that's hilarious it's very funny oh my god why did he just come out like that what happened i've seen zero audio on him took down where's your omega omega oh you got one oh nice we're gonna be best of friend what if they kill us i'm gonna no i'm killing his teammates just laying for five again oh it's too long i'm gonna let them lead i'm gonna let them loot and then we can fight yeah okay i'd love to have heard that comes when he got out of the drone yeah cause they were all together so they all saw it yeah that's hilarious i mean they're not going to have three red armors though so this just isn't really fair but give a chance he's got a no no he's got the mozam ah 3v3 boxing match come on can we have it that would be so sick let's do it start to start punching here is that pretty lame so maybe a little bit come on three i'm not dropping my guns i'll drop my arm up you know yeah i'm in a place around here let's get safe let's get safe i'm taking armor oh got a team up on someone first i might go say go for the end of the game [Music] yes that was actually so great all natural that was actually great that was so much fun i'm not a fan of boxing at the end but in that situation with that game you have to that was great dude i actually love that so much i want to know who those guys are they were they're great not the gibby mate he was blasting me with the mouse
