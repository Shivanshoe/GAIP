hey wassup guys it's rigged welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and at the moment I'm just enjoying these last few gold games until we hit planned them but you do start leave behind some of the lower ranked players but I was in platinum last time it wasn't too difficult but it was the season where everyone was just - boring - save there are feet so it's kind of hard to compare we'll see so in the game you're about to watch you fight Winnick I would make it to plant him I'm gonna spawn anything I'll let you guys see how it ends so thanks for watching and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends or I can tell my maken ampler alright unless I am Pat finder and I think I'm okay I'm gonna talk about it I don't even want to talk about it the good news these new pieces no no one is actually here with us which is tremendously fortunate because this place is usually popping off and I messed up for London and then I mess up the grapple are there any weapons about any cookies this is we are extremely looking than no one's here because I am a useless so far I scream in horrendous lecture was like here we go thanks team this is very much appreciated come with any ammo ammo perhaps well there's a scrap in the dissents and I've got a triple take and sometimes that is all you need here we go some light ammunition things are really kicking off probably the bunker I'll be to show you I'm ready I've got a blue stay in line mag I got a bunch of glioma Nishan and people are scrapping a bunker and if you can get there to third part of these kind of fights one team is always sat by the door his bond team is always inside and one team's trying to get inside so there's some of the best ones to third-party teammates I'm gonna need you to come over here then there's someone here I'm gonna bother Lewin this full eight because I assume this more live down low actually teammates I got one of these if you can see my coming you saw three there we go and that team means he's still alive inside as well Oh photos gonna probably shielding didn't have any shields still a team inside that might poke their heads out now she's in choke that means I can't drop this chawl take I'd be careful going in there there's a reason this team was struggling provides a guess I'd say there's a cup there you go Torchic trout no I'm I'm gonna buy that way I'm not bothering team I am NOT any up on ready calm okay it's not happy caustic sorry savage here you fancy some syringes you were choking on the the cost of gas actually after oh there we go it's crap in the distance you just see you just go to the third pass instead what's the point in rushing of course it can conquer pointless activity I've got a bit of a theory here so much way it's not really clear it's more of an idea imagine this and I know this would never work get rid of that you have to bond syringe forget it I'm just going the scrub sounds over as well it's not it's not much of a theory it's more of an idea okay imagine these four plain Loba there's an Emmy Korsak been annoying you pop you're low but ultimate down in the black market and then you steal caustics gas mask from his face big scrap scrap is waste once more they're on timeout can you imagine seen in the gas mask from his face so then he starts choking on his own corrosive gas and then you can just walk in there I mean maybe it should only last by 30 seconds but just imagine imagine is to imagine the scenes imagine if she could steal people's or I'm just talking about my your ideas here all my fails everything burn parties I've barely been it up an actual gunfire here I five bullets one spare but be sure about running their snipers no one else friends then so you just struggle to find Lutz still got to find the ammunition solid Shelby walk the walk the heck is hot the heck is going on I've got a guy happy now to weed machines but someone inside his bomb [Music] okay all right so just left me to eat my salt going to take the race grace purple I was sort of expecting to the race to fall at any moment because the creeps I was right behind them but I guess he turned around trying to help the Lifeline the day long yeah all right let's see if anyone's pasta knee careful crypto son was launching grenades up this way I saw him definitely running away hey guys coming over now I've been inside here LifeFlight are you facing away you weak conditi is Timmy you are game third party the storms coming in and the Sun right next year um I'll come back I'll come back well sure what I can do to save you with no sniper ammo dancer Korsak in this gone it's gonna try and wait for him to go this face friend come on we go alright okay I know what this looks like it looks like I've just desired to my team but this says this has an added benefit okay that wasn't me Justine Karl firstly what's Lobby but this is also allowed that course it came to leave the arrow because the storms coming I don't want to fight the Corsica team we don't think we downed any of them Vaughn v3 with one weapon it just seems pointless you know you like the area get called down a bit little bit you come back and you're gone back you get the revive you get your teammates banner option called you back in the game it's about time he to still need sniper ammo I'm not responding you there not a chance so I'm 99 you can see won't even let me pinged it you'll see it I'm sure you'll see but good thing that ranked is that there are still six of the sponsor remaining leave anything good behind any attachments must've got a golf tell me from it I don't even have my grapple race EPP some HD shots anyway the Patapsco man it's a bit of a lunatic confusing the courts have scaler I personally done unappreciative enemy this is what happens when you start engage on people in the ends of the game you just get collapsed upon now leave me alone we might need to push this team I want to try and get a lifeline some Lutz and a feat one for seventeen Olympian no no we can get some little for lifeline they re struggling badging into wine this guy how's it you know I see oh my word did the Bangalore make it is the Bangalore I Sophie - are you going to shoot us in the back and then just run off into the sunset I mean I'm pretty sure I'm the only one that landed shots today I don't think he didn't whitey might write them off to the Crypt I was in his drone and the lifeline doesn't really have too much and that just ran off unbelievable there's Evo's here it'd have been nice smell to rush them and get some good loot we'd have been south but neither circle is gonna be so small there's gonna be difficult for us to be able to lose these many teams left let's double team and we could partially steam instead yes I just want to shoot someone yeah yeah yeah Gary going Krypton this is the combo right here mess him up he knows the jockey shield doesn't work for doesn't work for a long time you please stop my word now these guys have completely ruined that push this is what happens we engaged the end of the game you just get shot for five and agree to give me one sec is revived I don't be able to take the ring oh I have to find the matter i revived e that would have been so cleaner that's such a shame whichever angle we got we're getting third-party smite the what taps game teach at least we're soul I've kind of another lifelines name our friends banner we can bring them back oh I do I'm not allowed to drop a position choke triple take is actually against the law boys you put this one on this envy the clean science eyes on the game scrapping teammate and their big scrapping I have to precision choke weapons oh my I've been for about 4,000 Oh please don't beat okay but I think I'm dead of a safe zone so far away I moved on a teammate you might be able to make it no he ever here 455 I hear 455 that second shot with a peacekeeper I missed a mixed I must have missed these guys are waiting for us at the edge of the safe zone anyway look it's the team that ran away into the sunset as soon as we shot them like twice they ran off they got there they got their RP you know they deserve it if they want to eat that much they get a win for that they just ran off I was there and we were the ones in the mixed scrapping me lifeline and and crypto I'll tell you what I think we win that if I hit more than 55 of that P skip at the end I must have just been slightly off target because usually the Peacekeeper just slaps people of that range oh I wanted to win that one it's a good game still let's see how much our people need all right well I know what couldn't close the planet I'm a child please this is 200 it's 200 won if you've been well but we have made it mm yes I believe we would have actually made that well one more good game we have more more gaming gold one more decent game and then we make its partner where we just get a little bit more serious looking forward to thank you for watching I do appreciate I'll see you all in the next one
