here was the cottage which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today I have a ranked game for you and I dropped over 4000 damage nearly all of the fighting happened at the same place in containment and also there was a so much action it was almost non-stop it was probably my favorite game that I've played in a while it's so much fun when the fight is like that I resign in life by the way so it sounds a little bit different at the moment I think it sounds a little bit off but I'm still working on it just in case you're wondering hopefully I can clear it up a little bit soon so yes thanks for watching I hope you like it I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends okay I'm not going to that doorway not with the 15 of the people you've had the same idea okay oh I got the gun but I didn't get the energy ammo it's a good job I jumped off you come on take this love you slower I think this is one actually there's just one ice skate it's gonna be a full team in here should give me the the two times four times as well like they're only gonna use a song actually I've taken the Prowler I've decided against you already I'm like using a shield battery on a level one shield I absolutely refuse the gun it's good on the Spitfire and maybe a few snipers let's be far it's not all that good there's still people scrapping up this way Blue Shield's good things come to those who wait what's messing up friend that 4,000 damage to him I'm not gonna feel too bad about taking the purple shield from that kill I know there's gonna be another team actually looks like a teen this is rocked of late I need one of them to come through this doorway oh it's next fire I'm actually tried the the Prowler in full auto again give another chance maybe didn't shoot smash it look like a decoy delivery friends up knock one of them we can just overpower them 3v2 that's a big scam he's runnin away Oh blood homies homies opaque we weren't so good to having your thing that's that's a ludicrous again just left on there on our screens but was there four seconds I know I was free to work to stop the old revive there all right there we go three kills two is not not as many as you could have had you know from a hot chocolate containment but it's a decent that all it is not running I mean we've got a kills plus a ceased crazy already maxed out at five early days we could just camp to the end of the game which wants to but this is silver one I was wrongly today I have literally no attachments absolutely nothing on my havoc to remind you that having doesn't need anything having said gold gun from the floor like eyes killed two people with these with his with his right heirloom the [ __ ] of the Kenai now he's now is killing you stolen it from me how here we go that's the containment one I guess he's destiny for us not to leave containment another team has rocked up lights another team wants to scrap well they put don't to be honest okay I think they just wants to peacefully respawn there teammate but he's asked the blue team flying in that's five people he spotted he's bathing in the blood nice number great though need to kill myself for that I got of course it can arrive an inside is there anyone to shoot it I mean I can hear a lot of stuff but I can't see anything to heal it first my teammate there's not much I can do that I'll foot the path - aims I'll keep the Doreen he's just standing there the Prowler of his own that's my fault - my apologies don't work walk win I will revive you don't panic one second teammate I'm gonna respawn yet I may I'll use this there could be a purple shawl on his way back to his loot alright six kills they're a little bit late to the fight again but I've under the another three kills tonight that's not too bad in my last ranked video I kept saying this to Zion one I thought this was iron rope it turns out I'm not that far down one because I'm silver and two because iron doesn't exist a pony bronze is the lowest plate two measured legal legends but the good news is were actually close to the high ranks and I thought silver is knowing near but it's a lot closer than iron would be if that makes any sense I would be horrendous but this isn't this is manageable Silver's manageable I mean you know a good game here Mabel frankerz up to gold I'm not sure how close I am and then once you're in gold and you start grinding as platinum planning is where you start playing against the diamond players and then you know it's not too bad just when I thought I had a spare second it's popping off a containment once more this is unbelievable let's go in the doorway but you know that because you've got a big scam me and my drumsticks I'm in your head leaving the same squad I have feeling you love a gold birthday huh err gob back as well this guy gets us Alfred off he's coming straight back in the fight alright well it's another at least two terms of content these guys sold out this guy still has teammates somewhere let's go to go up to him gosh Don I've never seen so many things popping off with a containment here as far my favorite drops mind right I think I've said that about every single drop on this on this map because it's so fun to lend rank labs new skull town containment is always good for this very reason I think it's a sole third party ball but people just keep rocking oblate and if you can manage it this is where the funnest games happen I think he's trying to get the banner he's been one step foot steps his whole time I don't have any sort of mobility sometimes run open my drumsticks I'm afraid poor guys just trying to get his teammates back it's last one down under bum bum it's good honestly I'm laughing no maybe a level three extended to have you be good oh this one's low brawls Mateen the action never stops here there against the diving board dweebs I must roof there inside on our teammate careful this may still be inside no I sit down by its chin on the staircase snow piece as well as any medicine but London you [ __ ] me with a wingman can I get my shields back please thank you the skill tapes experience and strength someone's still 16 it is that I was that you guys aren't you guys okay well I found where the lower autumn is like you know I don't actually think I need anything in my setup is pretty good gold chills would be nice here especially on lifeline or red Eva but purple is served me well so far start completeness st as a teammate this one's be to this punch fields whose esky did you come from just hope that find its chilling just in the water short-circuiting they're trying to evacuate the man that's what this way to I can this is victory for teams I'm gonna go I have go go stop oops oops that's light there's just too many of them there are just too many of these aren't Silla players or cracks our minds oh my words that that was that was an unbelievable game okay see what it wasn't in love with I don't because I was like MC got balls or something I've been annoyed if they man should get a revival oh okay nice he's on a team Pete I'm sorry so a character they've already got the 4k damage badge on so I've got nothing for that absolutely nothing didn't even win the game 15 kills oh good grief we came so close we came so close er to a dominating performance there if there were two people at the end I think I could have managed it down the path winding with one clip of the or one mag of the of the private of the full-auto prowler but I think I'll put me now to take out the octane but when you're getting team shot by two of them like that it's it's always gonna be difficult 4000 damage though the action never stopped that was such it that was one of the funniest kinds of Apex I've played in a long time that lob you felt like a fox when it came out you know you'd have to worry about it too much look at that they go 150 RP and we are getting closer and closer to gold which would be nice so thank you for watching another installment in a solo run grind and I'll see you all in the next one mmm [Music]
