hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now recently an apex dev said that some huge apex patch notes will be coming out and it made me think of changes that i would love to see now bangalore is famous for how little she has changed since the game come out they nerfed her passive a little bit they buffed her ultimate a little bit but she's largely the same legend since day one whilst corsic and gibby have had change after change i'll be going over some of the ideas i had in a second but first i have some really exciting news for you guys now i'm really excited to announce that benny central so far and i are doing a kill race on apex legends all sponsored by lenovo legion now the kill race rules are simple so far benny central and i queue up on the same team whilst working as a team we are trying to get as many kills as possible and whoever has the most kills at the end of the session is the winner of the lenovo legion versus two kill race now i've known that this is coming up for a while so i've been practicing my kill stealing techniques i have a surefire way to secure victory for us team tempetron it's not going to be easy but i think we can pull it off especially because i will be playing on the lenovo legion tower 7 with an intel core i7 and an nvidia rtx 3080 gpu now i know what you're thinking you're thinking hey i want a lenovo legion tower 7 with an intel core i7 and rtx 3080 gpu well i have some great news for you over on my twitter we are running a giveaway in partnership with lenovo legion to win the ultimate lenovo gaming setup including the tower 7 the y2q 20 27 inch 1440p 165 hertz monitor and lenovo accessories including a legion gaming mouse keyboard mouse pad and

10 we should get you 10 percent of all legion products thank you once more to lenovo legion for sponsoring this video and make sure you guys keep your eyes out for the kill race video coming soon so back to bangalore what i was talking about now one of the ways i love to play bangalore is aggressive you smoke out a fight and you go in with a digital threat no one else can see hopefully they don't have one but this requires a legendary item to pull off now what if you could see enemies in your smoke if you just ads even without a digital threat i think this will open up a new aggressive way to play her and won't restrict you if you couldn't find a digi another change that could be fun and interesting is seeing some sort of close range weapons buff much like rampart's lmg buff maybe a slightly larger mag for smgs and shotguns or maybe a quicker reload this would also be an aggressive change for bangalore which would work amazingly well with her kiss and playstyle already it is tough though because she is really well balanced she's still a good legend but she doesn't get picked that often uh and this maybe could bump up the numbers so let me know what you guys think about this in the comments section i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends so good especially once again um there's a team that landed in there oh wait why am i going this way i'm really with you i have a master attention yeah i went to the other side i have arthromastia purple in a mozambique um they're over there in that building they probably have good loot too though because this event that's true i'm a master i purple and they were waiting for me gonna look for an arm switch in here okay there's a white in here i have two cells please give me a sec just back up what'd they do they've still born running back i can use that i can just kind of sound like this way to relocate here yeah they're outside the back there let's get in a second one's tough i think 52. yeah we have blue and purple though that's even more crazy we all had purple pretty much apart from me i was the only non-purple member extended like magazine here level three nice job though for waiting for me how dare you wake me like that oh sneaky's recharging my shields uh if you see like a barrel stabilizer please let your boy know what do you the charge station i'm not coming when it's absolutely destroyed hello friends making the right choice listen they're only trying to use the charging station melted his face ruining people's days so i'm just going to raise the hot raisin like salvage uh i don't know i didn't see that did you see that oh maybe it was that thing coming down i don't know i get confused it's crazy how far you can launch your smoke is kind of crazy i i always um i always trip out on the uh the fuse the fuse tactical that we can go so far it does how's the ultimate a big value honestly that entire time i was looking at my phone all nice i was like afk running and you were following me so how does that feel um i was there to to support you so i hear people look look it's graphics graphics um i can take them off the high ground with my ultimate i think they may have already hopped off there's a team on market too second team i think there is there we go that guy's got red up there too yeah i think he's the masters guy i damn saw him with my barrage oh he's so loaded hold on hold on hold on definitely know the team here though again these guys are screwed they can't keep up they're actually insane they're up top no i'm up top come with you fact these cracks okay i'm i'm terrible right now so i'm not really doing anything but yeah six kills it's not common whoa i'm dead i'm actually dead you're dead i switched armor about eight times there's a nice little so far special yeah yeah give me one second to phoenix i'm looking for a heavy out oh my god i almost jumped [Music] you need to have ammo why i need light there's a lot there's so much light everywhere i wasn't looking for until just now i didn't realize i had 31 spare it's there's so much light i i don't have any room for lights i'm carrying 18 shield cells okay well i have i still have one bat how does this happen to me i'll have my three i'll drop it thank you would you like a phoenix kid i have one thanks would you like some med kit save drop um hey yeah why not i'll i'll manage oh they're scrapping i know and i hear arnold's lines too so there must be close range to each other so that means the fight's gonna be over quick right here [Applause] oh i don't want to die to that guy i'm putting some damage with a smoke launcher today i can't see i'm i shouldn't have put down that airstrike that's what i mean people say use the airstrike but then i just can't join the fight oh my god i feel so bad i mean you are pretty bad look at that 12 damage less let's do it extended energy mag here you always have purple armor and star um getting a lot of purples one of those days i'm gonna miss it but it's not here like this it is the game mode right yeah got an extended sniper mag here level three i know you play octane to snipe so big bad blood tastes like victory i saw his purple predominant i preemptively pinged it yeah there's a purple extended light in there too okay uh perfect extended energy in the building sorry right in the in the building you landed yes hey come on go look for it it might have been blue definitely yeah you definitely like all right extended heavy mag here level three energy ammo here you're forgiven oh my god guys right in front of me did you switch to white armor where you going brendo that's cracked but the guys beneath you like cracked beyond belief okay i'm going around i am healing hey yeah yeah hello i literally did one damage a big uh 91 damage there they're fighting it place the place another one i mean right uh yeah yeah yeah i know you know i know you knew sorry i heard him i heard him pop eels i thought he was like popping a bat or something charging him no he did not he was struggling um there we go don't kill him straight away free kills he's dying he's dead hello friend oh he's popping a phoenix i'll let him pop it he's popular [Laughter] to getting to it uh what do you like was the loot good what do you just turn around and kill you or what i mean he had a 301 he had a wingman oh you were dead did he have an extended light um i don't know i've changed from a scout so you know okay no one's going to say why apparently i guess you like cutting it close huh poor guy all right 20 people left 17 of the people we've got to exterminate them yeah um yes it is i love this and force them on inside my mark yeah yeah that's the plan i think they're already inside that i can't come outside i don't know i don't know where october there's nothing what i first did the horizon their team ever still around somewhere okay guys was that the octane just now no i don't think so all is another hand okay multiple things the same thing i'm here for like he's nothing to 360 origin i think he is giving my shields a reach he's do you think he swaps we're just not hitting at all and also my nade was on top of them yeah look at these boxes i'm leaving red in here for you actually no i'm not good no i'm not wow because i have like five four bats it's any med kids please let me know yeah i'll get the gold then you make it i don't have any medkits yet um yeah i just have one all right let me get a nice little screenshot of this this is why the lobby is dead right here look at this i can't even get them all in the same screenshot oh my word oh my word it just keeps oh gosh there's some right one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve flags here thirteen fourteen and then the two people

nice good job good job wow out damaged outclassed once again yeah yeah make sure to tell your viewers uh what all right i'll give it to you 11 damage how does it feel
