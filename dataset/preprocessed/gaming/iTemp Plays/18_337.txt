hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we got some of the patch notes for season 10 of apex through gamespot there will be a link in the description for their article and i'll be breaking down some of the bigger bits of news from the note so first of all let's do legend buffs and nerfs first up we have caustic now instead of five ticks of damage per second caustics gas will now increase in damage every other second so five five then six six seven seven etc with no limit on how much of this can increase and his gas cloud created from corsic's noxious gas grenade dissipates five seconds sooner so overall this is a buff and for the average player a caustic buff never sounds too great it can be incredibly annoying to play against but this isn't the biggest buff of all time and i think it's fair as much as it pains me to say i think this is a decent change next up we have revenant who has an audio notification of when enemies are about to lose their death protection so it's a nerf to his ultimate but it's not much of an earth at all and it won't stop people only taking gunfights when they have this it's not going to change too much at the end of the day horizon is getting a big buff in season 10. according to gamespot her maneuverability in her grab to lift is being adjusted close to how it was pre-nerfed but it's not a total nerf now i like this change she was kind of gutted in the recent patch but she was too powerful beforehand as well somewhere in the middle of these two states would have been absolutely fine in my opinion next up it is fuse his area of affectability lasts twice as long and enemies caught in his motherlode ultimate are highlighted again not a huge buff but apex are usually quite careful with buffs and nerfs i think this is fine we'll see how he plays but i very much doubt he's going to be the next meta op legend with a change like this next up we have hop ups anvil receiver is being removed alongside quick draw the traits of quick draw will be automatically implemented into pistols to a slightly lesser degree quick draw of course being the least useful attachment hop up or bit of loot ever placed into apex legends the new hop-up is called boosted loader this hop-up goes on the hemlock and the wingman changing the guns so they reload faster and get bonus ammunition if reloaded at the right time so this is really interesting a slight buff to the wingman and hemlock with his hop-up is great i'm excited to give this a go alongside this we also see the prairie come out of the care package and the pre-nerf spitfire and disrupter rounds alternate to take its place this is a great change in my opinion i am excited to use the trailer again but i think people are aware of how powerful the burst mode is now on the prowess season 10 will be burst mode parallel meta guaranteed mark my words especially because the e rate was enough slightly as well now these are the biggest changes coming in season 10 of apex let me know what you guys think of them thank you for watching today's video i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends my strategy here is to go to this left side forget the buildings you go here you get yourself a gun or mozambique or do the job get yourself a shield battery a lot of digi and then what you do you just literally just jump off the edge someone else is doing the same technique first blood i've already got one backpack got an evil shield here all right the boys are back in town it would appear good news is i'm a gibby and i can retreat for absolutely free never mind my teammate what's the one firing recharging shield my teammate is apparently a demon i do not expect this i believe he's level 30 so he doesn't matter he's going in that's tremendous that was the last one i got three kp from that i'll take it why does this rope just fling you off into the sunset now i don't know but they made that change like two months ago but i still never get used to it just send you flying and i still don't know why uh we've got a crafter here it's got 11. that's tough i'm crafting the amiga contact with target walking around in the water one down recharging shield let's get an angle here they're trying to buy time for the revive going in they might be trying to run oh they run that way the max is sits now isn't it they changed that a while ago i don't mind if we just chill i'm just trying to make diamond here in the distance guys also oh we could have saved the pad but let's just uh get us here a little bit quicker we'll just find a better place for the ultimate are we running red octane yes we are okay but listen i'm playing solo and ranked there's people in this lobby guaranteed who are in a three stack which is absolutely fine in rant obviously it's fine in pubs who cares um but their strategy is to rev octane you know i'm just here as a solo so i don't care where do we put this ultimate i mean they're fighting here maybe maybe drop it down he's coming yes he knows my brothers that's another team i'd be careful squadron you need to be a little bit careful about this engaged name that's what's so good about revolt it's so good you should get out of jail for free card you know we get third party doesn't matter okay i think we're trying to wrap around to make it so that we are not the ones getting pinched this is a good strat this rep knows what he's doing in fact this team is just fleeing the scene i don't like you guys i mean we've got a we've got an octane but i'm gonna be got no mobility i'm not going to run into the uh the ring oh there's people still alive here anyway i guess i'm going to challenge surely teammate going i think oh that sucks i'm missing i need to heal i'll come get you in a second i really want bubbles i don't know if these things are going to come from behind again with the team that ran off really balls in seven seconds reloading that's not what i pressed i still don't know what happened to this other team they must have not wanted to fight at all hello 66 rp i think the platinum is like the sweet spot for like it's a bit of a challenge like people are definitely taking it more seriously you know pubs is probably my lobbyist in pubs are probably full of object objectively better players is that the term i don't know in in public games however everyone does full sense and it's way easier to win in public games in ranked people do take it more seriously and it can be more fun when there's something on the line and i think phantom's the the sweet spot this is this is good you're okay over there right especially because you can play platinum solo until have a decent time his team teammate there was a comma involved but ended up the same team team no one's got any bats this is very sad uh if we're gonna do this we can't really take an extended trade three seconds i've got a phoenix but no bats are they're crafting anyway okay okay he's crafting but he's got a sniper i just need to dissuade them from coming over that's all i need to do a bit of time for octane to go and get his old loot back he's a stupid legend i don't care then i'm playing him the arm shield is so broken and i've got no bath team nice he's down one i need to push i didn't reload i i was getting pushed from the right i had to push up and i didn't have one masterfully loaded that's very sad that is very very very sad nice team they're going thanks guys i mean i have enough time to loot these boxes there's no way they'd manage to come over here all right there's no ammo though should i grab this purple i need heavy ammo i i yeah i thought there was gonna be more stuff there but it's all right i guess i'll just try and be the support player should i take this instead of flat one maybe i've got no ammo for the flatline these guys have a triple sake my arch nemesis i'm gonna be honest with you guys i can't really see and then i hit someone for 11 which is a miracle with the one time to this range i should have known that triple tech man would have been the one to gate keep me out of diamonds i shouldn't have stopped my syringe i should just double jump over there give me my shields recharge i need to find something to loot okay he's the best i need it the charging shield taking fire i'm gonna keep that here at least with this charge rifle i can do some damage at this range i'll i'll uh i'll come back when they get closer taking damage over here let's get this spitfire i think it's actually getting beamed are they up there how did i get up there give me my shield to reach out nice that proud of scary good job team i saw them die at the end i didn't mean to good job though they're fighting on the roof i had to go back to that spitfire took me ages to get on the roof they must have had an octane or something so i heard them i heard them portal but i thought to get on the roof where my team were they'd have to go my side like well they'd have to go to the left or the right but i don't know they got up top there i guess they must have had a bad or something nice 2600 damage my teammates were actually pretty good that was a fun game in the end we brought it back after getting respawn gg
