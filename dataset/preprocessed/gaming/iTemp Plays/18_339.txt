hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today was not the best day of apex that i've ever played but i did get this 3700 damage game with loba now why was i playing loba this doesn't happen very often well in the start of this game you can see the frustration from both me and so far it was one of those days where you landed on a p2020 and the enemy next door got a mastiff and blue armor and he two taps you and you are dead and variations of this happened so many games today that i got sick of it and i thought i need love with the loot lady to help me out because i am big struggling if we didn't have my ultimate we probably would have died to any of the five teams that ended up pushing us she definitely helps the team out so much and sometimes can be the difference between dying and surviving we do cheer up as the game goes on by the way sometimes apex is frustrating but you play it for games like this i hope you enjoyed the video thank you for watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you are new and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah it's hard to i'm gonna have like a 30 30 game you could be doing good all game then you go up against a red armor wraith and bangalore 24ks with 99s and eva 8s and you just there's no winning that good luck good luck uh oh my god unlock the corsage uh just trying to loot if i can i can't though oh i can't wait oh my god everyone's got literally mate i've fought three people this game every one of them is a spitfire this is so desperate to kill me you didn't even touch me when i was up hold on leader interesting there's a full team over here they have gold and stuff oh really they're definitely holding hands it's your lucky day i've got you recharging shields they're just hiding in that room together i like what they're doing with me let's play your life it's your lucky day i've got you i don't know how that works this team is the only reason why is terrified right they're literally in the toilet i'm coming over to go there let's go here jesus i'ma climb up the other side everyone's gonna spit fire one's in i can see him in the toilet i don't have a throwable recharging my shield i'm climbing up trying to come around break this low talking about there's another team pusheen i killed the uh down the right alright here i have no bullets i have a zero octane's crack but he's got a turbo diva can you make it this i'll drop my energy oh but she's cracked down today so yeah they're pushing in another squad this is unreal this is unreal being shot from like different buildings okay nadeed good night from god downstairs come here then once again yeah yeah i'll tell my time now you pretty suck that lunatic beautiful i think i think she's down though did you get yeah yeah she's just nice crack syndrome come here this is coming from below i'm on top of him stop still reloading all right i think this guy jumped yeah he did he's coming from down there yes the effort we have to put in to survive this is just just mental sort of stressed out everyone just keeps pushing us it's got a turbo diva i can't take him i don't have the bullets for it that's what i got from that oh i've got nothing i had a stalker um he jailed uh two um arc starts you're not as good as your heat shield one before i'm afraid i need to get it together mate that's solid though yeah that's a it's a priority i mean if there's nothing else jump drive was my ability this bad ralph ralph says down there meows himself he knows his name though he's running up hello ralph your fake cat one of your many fake cats i have three cats okay three fake cats no is this even the best way to run off of either way was probably better probably nah this way it's quicker it sounds like this is just the longest fight ever anyway i think they're fighting from like different parts of staging oh it's all kicking off here mate i might just run in and die for the boys oh please don't do that i'm tempted there's an enemy near me there's another team fighting yeah what's gonna like why is this team not looking in the team get kill credit my actual purple i've switched so many arms this game for like 60. oh you're gonna land right on them am i oh god they run this way well they haven't healed surely i'm finishing i need to finish up you look for that guy didn't have goldman i'd be furious i need my there's damage rich yeah you could have after i finished my kill i would have been gone what do you mean it's not possible do you know something crazy but unless you don't have one assist uh uh how much damage you have i could amount i have three point two that's a good amount 3.2 oh yeah all right that's good i'll show him uh 2.4 are you yeah you're gonna try and farm this last team aren't you uh why why would i why would i farm to uh match the old item patrolling damage i mean i have to let you out damage me at least once once a day just for the ego at least once every four to five weeks you know i want to talk and steal this prowler with my uh ultimate i'll let you have it oh you've been baiting me you've been baited you're dead you're dead you're dead you're actually dead actually that's crazy it's just me running me open by myself oh no don't die i'm tempted i might die right there she's [ __ ] off the bat she's cracked big big blaze i had no help mate i had no house please don't die jeez i was close i had to commit to it i had to get destroyed mate i went into that 1v2 with no shields just saying okay i don't think that's i don't think that's what happened it is and then you were watching i think you got the the workers and that was good that's a good game i honestly i didn't shoot one bullet at all that entire last fight did you not no i did it oh yeah 2.4 i should have i should have left you i should have gave you the brawler i just picked it up and just ran around i'm sorry if i knew you weren't shooting i probably wouldn't have played that as aggro so i wouldn't have died i was i mean i was i was there i was watching you with that spectator all right well gg gg
