hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing the new update which came out earlier on today and i'm showing off the caustic town takeover this place is where water treatment used to be and it has four guaranteed gold loot spawns and you can see how you access those on the screen at the moment you have to drain the toxin at one of the computer panels and then you have a set amount of time to loot up you have more than enough time to loot each of the four legendary loot spots so do not panic uh it's actually such a fun place to fight at the moment there's plenty of action there's tight corridors get your r99 or maybe you're nerfed mastiff and get yourself over there and get involved my friends hope you enjoyed today's video if you're new to the channel be sure to subscribe for some more apex legends content i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh in that middle one unloaded for you

right though um i mean this is your game don't give it to me that's mine it is i don't deserve it finest keepers run fast hit fast win fast i thought you couldn't die by the way what happened to that um i did it i'm alive are you back home oh i see never literally don't know what you're talking about why did you reckon we'd find someone oh if it ends of course a treatment we should just sit over this way if we're gonna sit somewhere might as well try and find the new place uh where uh yeah caustic treatment i'm done i mean there's someone that way right unless that was you know people turn up to this place late just checking it out are we gonna do those shows dude you can tell top right squads i always forget about that this if you're ever confused always i'm always confused i've got you here i go that's why i'm coming in the team like you you shoot people i'm just there to let you know if it's yours or trios yeah there's not much uh thought process going on i'm just shooting stuff you know a lot of a lot of shooting i want to go up here it's not worth it please it definitely is this is sick what do you mean someone says i'm in the air for about 15 seconds yeah i'm good they're just on my thing it was a very very good thing watson's cracks on the right she's in this corner she's strong now why would i ever laugh at her the worst thing is if someone third pies were the ones that's gonna die wait can we just like get off top of something how does this place work i don't know um i almost broke oxy they're their left side i think i think that might be the heat shield i'm gonna i'm gonna arrange all right i'm just the best pathfinder ever want some more forty i'm looking over the head very nice i'm so smart see protected oh you're just actually in place tactical genius should we leave these fences here i mean mine's all bent as well i stopped us from coming in oh my god what the hell you doing all right there's too many noises in this in this game i don't like it man whenever i see a watson fence that you can walk around i always think of that meme beside the baini right baby rhino it's like this animal is so dangerous even the baby rhinos in the background you see the baby that's a good one what are all these noises i don't know freaking out and what is this lobby why is there still three teams left i don't know why they wouldn't come and fight over here the room is a tree big plank big flank big plane for the boys and i don't think they're selling cookies they're not sending cookies so be careful oh my god they're following us about they're going up on the side these guys may be oh these guys are absolute weapons legends big patch broken oh good job this guy's is he still alive he's a track star oh my god he's a track star are you kidding if you died i don't know i think ryze is still alive where is he ping ping ping i don't know i i i'm wrestling he just came out of the bushes oh god i can't see it sounds like you needed a real gamer good job all right i'm gonna get i'm gonna give you this i'm giving you this game all right padding your stats how many bats you have um i have three you need one oh yes please but also i'm getting away from this heat thing shield battery here okay good luck this keeps happening to me it's happening to me and then you come in and you get to clean it up because they're already almost dead so that's what's going on your guy was not awake before at all he definitely healed all right when you take 14 minutes to kill him richard that's what happens you seem like that look like they're doing a bullet drop on this it's crazy yes an entire clip my hand for 12. oh my god the triple tank is too good i missed um i hit everybody that was you better stop i'm i'm watching your head i'm watching him i was [Music] she's 14 people hiding in bushes oh what what are those stats five kills four stats one knocks i didn't know that they had all that that's cool what does the knock always i guess because if you get a squad wipe that's only one knock because the second guy just goes straight down right so that would be two kills one knock that makes sense
