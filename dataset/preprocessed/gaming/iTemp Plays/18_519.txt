hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we're playing some more apex legends of course and we got another trailer for season eight earlier on today this time it's focusing more on the new legend coming to the game's court fuse the trailer reveals the finer details of his abilities and also showed off some season eight gameplay including some more of the 30 30 repeater heavy rifle so let's start off with fusey's passive here called grenadier which is throw ordnance farther faster and more accurately stack one more grenade per inventory slot than other legends now we did get a sneak peek of this passive in the previous trailer but he launches the grenades with his robotic arm and they go flying the speed of them looks unreal the distance is crazy he full-on yields them across the map also do you guys remember when they changed a lot of the stacking numbers on apex to reduce the grenade spam there once was a time where you could stack batteries up to three shield cells up to i think it was six is that right six and grenades up to two when they reduce these numbers they also increase the size of the inventory spaces by two to compensate and now fuse gets these stackable grenades with a bigger bag and the grenades are more useful because of his passive this guy's rocking up to a fight with 20 souped up grenades it's going to be scary now on to his tactical called knuckle cluster this is a cluster bomb that splinters out into mini concussion mines now i thought this was going to be a damage dealing ability and it may take your opponents like 10 damage or something but the description makes the ability sound more like an area of effect stun grenade imagine stunning someone then launching a precision arc star right at them so they're stunned again and then the arkansas blows up so they're stunned for a third time you don't even get to play the game there's a really interesting ability so far it sounds extremely annoying to play against a good fuse that i will say now on to his ultimate mother lode launch ordnance that surrounds the target and a ring of flames again i think they've done a good job here of making fuse more of a utility legend rather than just letting him rock up with those 20 grenades a damage dealing grenade ability and a giant bomb as an ultimate these abilities are ones that you would use to set up the damage which is mainly uh coming from your weapons still this ultimate looks amazing for controlling an area denying access to certain paths or routes and even set up for other ultimates like horizons gibbies or caustics fuse really does look amazing to play also in this trailer is some more of the 30 30 repeater rifle it's not long at all in fact it's just one shot but the recoil looks absolutely minimal and the iron sights look clean now there are details out there at the moment about this gun uh showing that it has up to 12 shots per mag with a level 3 all level 4 extended magazine and it does 100 damage with a full charged head shot and 74 damage to the head uh if you haven't charged it up at all also at the start of this clip he just one shot to the door with his kick so that's also worth noting so there is the latest in our season 8 trailers i hope you enjoyed the details if you're excited for the new season be sure to sub to the channel here for more content and i'll see you
