hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more warzone of course and today we are using the new finn lmg it is incredibly easy to unlock all you have to do is get seven melee kills with an lmg in separate games i suggest using the sa-87 i believe that's the name of it as it is the fastest lmg throwing the breach and muscle for increased melee damage and the heavy heater perk the increased melee stun runs down grades and you can get your kill and back out if you wanted to really quick and easy to unlock the thing and once you have the fin the lmg ar hybrid you can throw in a double weapon xp token if you have enough and play shoot the ship to get yourself some attachments it does not take long at all and here is the class that i was running for this game of today of course you can make some improvements with uh with more attachments i was very close to unlocking the monolithic suppressor so that would have helped but this gun is a complete laser beam it has next to no recoil it can be a little bit weak but some other attachments really work well to counteract that and in today's game we dropped corey and i've got 5 000 damage so it's plenty of action in there with the new weapon so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends holy sick aren't they what is that the actual shoe yeah does it light up i don't i don't know i'm hopping a choir by the way really early gas is approaching your position let's go little bit of quarry drop mate a little bit of a quarry maybe off that way a little bit i'll end with you in this building i should have kept that marked actually oh well uzi bit of armor things you love to see got a scar probably the greatest game gun to have ever graced warzone it's sad how bad the scar is my god i need something a little bit better mate autumn oh good give me armor i just found it oh wait i've got eight almonds you have eight armors yeah i don't even know what's going on but you even found the pack all right let's let's go over to them i'm down i've got there's another floor loop crew in here hold on how far more suppressed they are here guys wait i'm being hunted too they pulled the uno reverse card on us i can't see either of these guys can't lie what i'm going to do are they i'm going to throw a decoy yeah always works where's that guy you tagged off to the other buildings did he uh i don't know he flew him from gulag so he's probably trying to get some loot another enemy soldier incoming it says in my thing they're going to be up aren't they they're going to be tough is there any jump spots to get up there like no i don't think there are not i can remember oh my god these guys have 17 seconds you just make one 10 put 10 seconds down [Applause] okay cool in and i'll get i really want this this uh bounty to go yes are we both going to use the new oh yeah oh baby i'm gonna go up top on like this thing oh yeah yeah i think you've got over there no i just i've got a pistol i've got ghosts on they called in their own loadout they did yeah that that buy coming up oh god okay but do they have a really ranked up f-i-n-n i doubt it you know i doubt it how can they use the brewing still oh oh there's the loadout wait they yeah they just got it contact oh god yeah can we fly over they're not coming this way i don't think wait i could go we'll be up here this is this is the pre-game lobby oh my god yeah i'm moving up a little bit mate i don't know if you're about to see from there i'm going to see if i can get like a enemy over here oh yeah see one two one there nice another one there as well down down [Music] they're probably going to be going for an instant res in fact they think they've already got the res off [Applause] i've got y'all got you come this way ali come this way coming just so i could i could if he rushed i did his armor back left [Applause] [Laughter] i don't know why i think about the power in the weapon maybe it does need it to shoot a little bit quicker but the it's pretty much flat like the way it shoots yeah yeah i've got selfridge uav if you want to get a cell phrase i just got a uav from oh nice yeah guess alphas we've got two uavs and two cellphones that's right uh oh someone just choppered up top there people are firing at the chopper see it's on the right oh god oh god yeah that's close so yeah yeah yeah after they come out a little bit they might land on the roof how are they firing themselves what are they doing they're throwing someone on the roof let me get this bouncy there's a few teams here i'm going to uav just in case yeah find another uav mate what just did you call that one is yeah i can stun it for you may get half of the ladders i've stood it for you stunned hold on didn't he marker i think they've moved oh wait never in near the corner they're both corners reach both corners i killed him so do i go for ghost and try and pick up my lmg um yeah i'll give that a go because these guys have our uavs i'm killing them man they were bad they just hopped in this chopper yeah they've already used this uh loadout actually you know what my weapons class is already got ghosting it's not what i'm saying oh destroy vehicle they hopped mate why is this look at this what the heck are the scoped in loading the scope isn't my dean it looks like the longest game let's go and get our stuff yeah let's get revenge yeah they're on my heartbeat they're in there oh my god i'm gonna crouch walking mate unless we can like two in there two in there honestly potentially in the exact same corner that they killed us yeah yeah still in there 100 still in the exact same spot you get ready to climb the ladders had to destroy one of their explosives yeah this is this one here too they've got anti-explosives they've got anti-explosives [Applause] yeah in the corner rich on the corner they didn't move that's insane we won our gulag mental oh my god there you go you got your lmg back yeah boys taking somewhere oh god not bad oh where'd you come from nice good spot mate really good spot gone do you have an smg got bit money got a bit of money yeah let's go nice nice should we just leave him uh what the bouncy like sorry just meant like him and his whoever's his teammate yeah oh yeah let's go get out benty let's get him remove that they could be in that window be careful i'll remove the thing in a sec i've got another uav if needed by the way oh nice uh do you want to call in yeah friendly maybe it was a ghost glitch then it could have been i don't have i've actually i do have one c4 i have a stun and an origin where which building are they in do you reckon i'm gonna check this one up top oh i heard something great with you [Applause] make this originally stupid that's so good video on this instead um i'm going to uav again we can get so much this guy's still on blue he's definitely trying to get some loot over there there's someone at gas station yeah someone like gas as well i reckon can we get ourselves some self-rest again because we're going to feel like yeah let's see if this oh that person is coming across maybe no armor no armor just on the buy here dead nice easy easy i think he's trying to get his teammate back or something blessing selfres uav let's go should we call in one of ours just to push this tv oh yeah is there any way of getting up without going not unless you go on that thing and then glide across but it's difficult to do i don't know if i want to push this yeah this is almost nice to be honest with you remember we spent like half an hour there's someone flying in that way going this way there's also someone heading for that truck rich you know the one you killed someone on oh yeah he's getting his loot i think from that truck mate yeah he said he says he's coming he's coming he's coming see if you can bait him over see if we can come over this way yeah he's coming he's coming he's coming he's coming there you race beams no no no no no someone's behind me too hold on okay it's close sorry there's one shot on that down down good job you okay do you get him or he's in here somewhere fine nice mate yeah he was flying into his load up behind a little bit nervous of it this team is still in here 14 meters they're definitely just pre-aiming it i'm just gonna run away somewhere nice job mate nice split nice uh we could uav again i could just buy another one yeah i don't have one at the moment i'm afraid these two then we've got someone on there oh wait wait wait he's going back to his loot mate surely oh yeah you're right the guy's up top yeah yeah that's honestly if you fancy does anyone need this yes i actually do this is like an origin game for me you know it's like there's 23 people left what oh my god i'm going to origin this guy again it's insane it's so good you're just running into room shooting yeah he's definitely just chilling in here oh he's running off a little bit yeah yeah he's running into the open like what where'd he go things left oh he's down low down here it's a little bit weak but at least you have to worry about recoil okay he's gone over the back this is you this is your fully loaded unlocked is that your first uh kill with it no it's not but it feels like it these guys are i don't know if a plan is to get in that truck oh someone up there as well rich heads up is that a building there not sure they're going to be no they have like fields real estate over this way i'm tempted to go for this guy that's toxic he has to push down this hill in a sec got 56 seconds oh yeah you're right both of them are kind of screwed i mean it could be a second one nice coming up behind you now he's just on my marker could be selfie i don't know yeah he thinks that's he did i don't think there's another one though just on this hill up top higher yeah yeah has to move in a sec no need to overturn he's rotated off to the right i would have seen it i'd have seen it i think he's still behind there mate he's all up top fine i'm gonna turn around for our bounty yeah oh there yeah they got in the truck i thought they were oh yeah they hopped uh oh yeah they're in that building right this one's a laser beam i want to climb this ladder but i also think it's just setting charge i just hit some of the eod yeah i'm coming up behind you easy one nice wait he's got dead he's got it good job mate let's go gg nice work the origin just walked in there with it i think he had one too he did you know he was an origin brother yeah oh my god let me pick it up where is it where is it it's just uh that thing there look at it holy does it hit fire how's it work yeah just hit fire it just hit fire okay i see someone really far away yep are you beaming together if you're ready [Music] why did my gun start shooting down that was really weird you're trying to control the recoil but it's non-existent so just yeah yeah i heard you saying that he said i'm pointing down what am i doing he said yeah someone just ran straight past that ghost i felt like opening the building i'm gonna go one level high i mean i've got a sniper down that way too these guys are shooting me now i'm happy to fall back i can go around and rotate the other way there's a sniper looking at me this way but he's probably safer than this he was on the edge of the storm too i'm going to go into into quite a little bit by thing on someone yeah big fights going down this hill on our left rich hey this little copy down here maybe i think yeah i think we're i think we're okay i think there's a team on the right and then there are other people on either side i think yeah up the hill here you see on the left side up there as well i'm gonna try and like camp here this is a nice spot mate honestly look use this wall not bad at all yeah i can hear shots i can hear shots there i see one there sorry about it behind nice good good job i think someone's in this blue building yeah yeah oh yeah i'm being sniper in that blue building and then the uh oh my god look at this got an airstrike so i can mess with them a little bit okay hey i wish i was filming my gun it's it the the recoil is downwards that's really weird shooting down what's going on me i don't know what's going on all right so should i airstrike the building and start the building maybe we may have to go now mate if you've got a dead silence i don't know russian mushroom machine hopefully that displays don't be me i made it across i mean we can let you just come here i made it i made it i made it let's go let's go down that hill back yeah yeah let's hope let's let's get them dead are they pushing nearly down these people are obviously just chilling inside somewhere play playlist play life the outside place people right yeah they're outside people like that rocks sorry i didn't i didn't know they could see you that was really stupid of me 2v2v1 just let them interact with each other and someone's still on that back rock at the edge and then two people are camping top floor of the building with the king contract so this takes me okay that's that's going basically to the players outside that's a rough push what if these guys i might try to do sneaky front push i don't think i can have the time yeah they're there don't have a gas mask i've got a gas okay well that's fun thanks for the games everyone these guys using a hybrid rammer when i downed one this team they didn't rotate quick enough that's sat in the storm he can't climb over a tree trunk he died in the storm because you waited to kill me as if that team camping outside the building ended up oh no it's literally just like who that last storm should be slower because at the moment like whoever gets the looking circle wins [Applause] it needs to have the option for people to slowly make a move from famously sprint in with their gun up in the air yeah it does
