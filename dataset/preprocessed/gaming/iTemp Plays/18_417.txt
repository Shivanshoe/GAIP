hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are finally playing on world's edge which is by far my favorite map on apex legends i know this is going to be a fun ranked split and i'm going to go for masses again just like i did last season and this was a great way to kick it off 18 kills four and a half thousand damage and action all the way through the game this is one of those games i didn't need to edit down i hope you guys enjoyed the video make sure you're subscribed to the channel if you're new for more apex legends gamepl i haven't been here in ages i'm like i like to land one floor underneath explore this way okay someone else did but there's nothing we're fighting over nothing i'll go and train i have to yeah i only have a g7 someone in here yeah i think he's below i don't know i came from down there mr chase i think he's up top in the side door oh that was a mess a lot of comments i apologize oh good a lot of comments are necessary if you want it um i could use a medkit here we are not with you amigo do you have any light rains ah yes you know memento teammate wait who's he fine he's just shooting at the guys in the middle someone just bowed my guy here oh don't worry i'll try and watch that coming on this slide recharging okay across the world i flanked this guy was that a was it a horizon yeah yeah oh okay i think she threw this fresh box off here oh my god three i need some energy just let me lose run out of energy i need whatever the secondary gun she's got crashing and burning over here 156 i'm good crazy that was really fun yeah there's some more people too just beneath me somewhere uh he was just hiding in a corner do you have any bats i have two do you want to have one cell after this i've got some i got themselves too that guy had some as well you go yeah he too he took everything oh i took some stuff too i think fragment is so fun fragments the best i missed it first time back and look at us i have six kills 66 and 200 damage eight kills forces 1400 on the left hit these are below okay spain reviving right behind us yeah i'm probably gonna be real quick i'm going this guy's a psycho who's flying i was the right side oh she was down back she started teabagging when i when i came over to it but i had to get killed no mercy where's this join everyone so you made it across it's one of the funniest games i've ever played myself actually just rolling through everybody it's so in in fragment it feels so oh this game is the best wait there's no way to be firing back there right that means there's two squads i need energy and uh i need heavy too if you see any okay i'll be on the location our teammate's so good i love him these things are outrageous his vision's insane just sees everybody thank you someone's like they're going up and down this rope they probably see us i'm getting heavy ammo they jumped off the rope my rope oh my god i'm scanned i'm actually scammed i'm okay i'm okay oh yes nice huge that's a huge bubble oh my god i can't believe that just happened that's i know we deserve that yeah 100 we deserve that it's like whatever guns this guy's using i need to use an r9 after sad day attention i'm dead this is a separate team why is that not working oh my god i think he went uh below right oops uh i don't have a mobile respawn oh that's fine just so uh just play his life no one does zero people have them making contact with the enemy one minute to ring close up recharging shields here i go let's go this way oh i'll do so i'm gonna close soon too yeah should probably just get ahead of me really i just want to stick together so we don't get beans when you're in a corner so is there a respawn there there's a restaurant left there something good um oh yeah but yeah just do you think i was stuck down like about half an hour like my rope didn't work my like my i had enough time to use my ability twice that's how many times i messed up all good all good you guys got this it's gonna get you back let's i'm getting shot that's a big res thank you all good what hopefully kill one of these guys here's a guy here i can fly while i'm doing one of these guys has white armor and there's like there's actually a detonator loose on this we should go this way all right um i have a 301 fly line up give me a second extended heavy mag here level four i can drop your bats um two med kits good [Music] like 70 off just a little further i 400 light rains slightly unnecessary perhaps one could argue i need a shotgun you need a shotgun all right over there they're just chilling over there jesus flying oh she flew on top of it i don't really have an angle stop swan reloading down oh valkyrie's actually so cool over here she's really good i'm just like bouncing around oops wait i'm not i'm literally not trying to be foxy yes you are honestly you should have seen me struggling you are the apex champions he sounds fun that was so fun oh you ain't kind of crazy i was going kind of crazy kind of crazy nice dude that's a banger yeah yeah got the eight assists in there so it could have been a 20 but i'm not going to go oh don't kill him i'm 120 you know who cares yeah he could have i don't know i didn't know you're you had that many kids
