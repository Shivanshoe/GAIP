hey what's up guys it's welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in the game that i have for you today or at least the second one i've already hey what are you doing you're running the intro i've never had this many teams firing at just us and this happens quite often because when you're the aggressive team you're the one that's going to get third-partied of course but my word we were sitting in a building it was getting that bad we could not move without getting shot it was crazy i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you so much for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i mean sometimes you got to i i it was charged up i had to try i always say it's fun going it is fine can i stop landing on all stars that's my dream that's my new year's resolution i didn't want to land on a rampage so i'm happy about that okay someone landed over here i hope she's sitting there oh my god i fell down there no scopes in here i actually landed the shot landed i'm a demon actually that saved me i am a demon i'm not afraid it's a mission strategy that's a wife on camera it's one of the best i think they're in this uh i hate that maybe contact with target good thing oh my god this game so silly okay i am terrified to fight this person oh my god she's dead oh my god that's [Applause] else is behind me two different teams i need to get out of there go for the remake behind you there's another squad shots fired and they're hitting me giving my shields i'm not with you broken enemy shield i think i've got asphalted on reloading you know i think this place needs a little more i'm out of light ammo oh yeah recharging shields i've done the valkyrie but she's probably going to get realized do you need help where you are are you good i'm good oh nice oh god i'm dead i didn't think they could make the roof because everyone else that used that pad never got on the roof one yeah public game oh look at that near me wait there's like three teams here why yeah i know i don't have anything though uh there's literally yeah i literally didn't get anything i got purple on my 45 throwing what's up oh my god this is that is honesty uh it's fine because i try to do a wall jump with valkyrie didn't work oh yeah very very rookie move giving my shield while jumping not really because it's like accidental jets doesn't it yeah like triggers the jets right yes i think you might be able maybe you can but i don't know how to do it i feel like i've seen people do it but i don't know how yeah same reloading oops just thirsty some guys i'm just chilling i have uh 13 white boards i have uh enough to drop you i'll try to use the rampage he's in every one of our games damaged are you serious [ __ ] about how do you land on that guys it's a loot demon do you have any bats uh one okay that's why i have to just pop one high five bullets where the heck is that it's lp breach i can't work out where this is oh i'm the worst pathfinder ever you're not even a pathway to me i am you're not you play every legend just like me yeah but my main one is pathfinder hence oh pence and sophie can be your main if you play everyone yes you can it's the main one i play it's not because you play them all oh my god mate you are gracing me chelsea before a gunfight fighter where's pathfinder of all time okay i'll go give you all seed i'm not with you i stuck it he's in his alt a lot of damage a lot of damage he's running he's running all right i have how many kills you have um why because i'm kind of cringy right here why because i have one kill and whose fault is that it's a fair premium for the bad grapples uh but exactly answer your question i'm averaging about a hundred damage per kilogram okay about 110 damage per kill okay you know i have seven kills like that about to have red i'm gonna have red with one kill oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what is that what did i just scan get over there oh valkyrie's the best legend ever ate the valkyrie for a good amount of flesh [Laughter] 100 with the pk i don't want to take a minute and see what happens that's why i don't leave you killed anymore oh my god he had to have pk i almost wanted to get thirsty so i could see how much damage that was that was like you did oh my god the guy's just the best too i'm using a rampage no scoping so i mean he was zooming i've literally only been hitting one out of 10 grapples this game it's fine because i don't know how to use this legend i'm using the wingman head with the ring man the strider oh look at this man you are busted oh you're flying rudy circs though like you we need to work on that oh i came for uh oh different teams okay let's do what every uh valk team does and just uh getting a fight and then careful doesn't matter there's like 18 over there bridge on top of the rock again crack the path beneath you i'm flying up i'm flying up there's a falcon here somewhere i'm in the building what okay i have a small hail what the heck is that it's on the roof i think it's on the roof careful might go to the sneaky spot if he does i know i'm pre-aiming it just come for me just come from just pad across and come for me reloading from switch nice drag out yeah there's a team over there there's a team on the on the complete other side oh this lasted teams repairing that is funny i love how that octane padded across to challenge me on my door that i was holding unreal why not yeah this team's right here i don't know what's going on i think i'm not left if you want from the roof yep alert five valkyrie actual ready for burn taking fire wait does that cancel it yeah did you just say five thousand three on here ninety-four challenge this is the same team as earlier i'm pretty sure yeah uh so it seems like swinging over here it's fine i'm already at eight i'm already 86 yeah i think it gives you 75 if he's cancelled i actually didn't know that we went on the bloodhound this team pushed up i pretty much happy over here both teams there's two gibbs and two blue hands by the way on standby fern is good let me make it across yeah i played idiots traveling with small children this is a blood sport they're all collapsing on us both teams are just like collaborating i mean one of them already started moving this is this guy's solo i might land it on backstage a little bit behind my back oh yeah recharging shields on that band-aid opening fire the phone's on my right run all the way get me on that i might just back up okay wait wait oh we can't wall jump oh man i'm turning we had a bounce on our head i'm telling you i'm tilted you are the average champion an actual bouncy scene on our head 300 v-bucks minimum only 300 minimum maybe more i mean you started with zero kills for like the first 15 minutes per game so and then you did give me the opportunity to get a kill but i just went and got headshotted so okay i tried i tried
