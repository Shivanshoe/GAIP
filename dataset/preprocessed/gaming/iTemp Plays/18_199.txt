really got our friends banner this is great ah giving my shields a recharge i really want to play with you so i'm really trying to get plateau here i can craft a mobile or i can just go to the only one that's available which is all the way over there well i made it it's all matters can i craft a mobile respawn yeah right here that is a bold play easy easy very very bold easy craft now where to go put it that's the problem anywhere but there oh here we go is there somebody up there yes uh maybe other side of high ground where those buildings are it's like a couple little little compound buildings that's right north face like right here right there's a small right close yeah there's like a few buildings right there that's right on the door might be the only place you could even put it why'd you kill me do you remember when the truck killed james yeah he was like i want to stand there i i said it like three times like uh don't stand there i wouldn't stand there he's just like okay he just tried to get shot i'm not shocked just lands right in his head we couldn't see that green circle that's funny i want a third be so bad on the top row from the top rope [Music] i gotta charge up rampage tim if you can oh my god be careful all right he's so lucky yeah yeah yeah yeah i love you i love you it's a tragedy another game where i've got don't drop training i think there's a team low ground right they just i think so yeah where did your other teammate go your other teammates he took the gravity cannon don't worry i'm here oh man was that 180 on the bloodhound are we trying to go up here i can't yeah he's still cheating that has been charged for a very long time yeah maybe he just has unlimited thermites you know maybe mate yeah let's go this way never mind did they shoot the fence with like 15 bullets no what were they shooting oh they shot the low broth don't go up there man the guy's way too much effort trying to get you bad boys back no oh they're committed to that making contact with the enemy i don't know where to go mate to be honest with you uh cross cross across the go to the far edge fire zone for that uh what is that gravity kind of what is that way oh yeah yeah it's a safe might be something good big bad what do you need shields maybe there was just something i got an easy body shield i'm all right maybe you need shields there's just a low brought mate i mean i've got no shield cells now hey you guys need those kills over there oh my god i can't take too much damage oh my god you just gotta challenge that guy i don't know how many over there i don't know how i'm gonna get shot by the right if i do yeah i think i may just hold that on maybe you can play top oh my god oh my god no there is not mate there is not much i can do i don't know but every game i'm john master we win so seeing kind of a pattern here uh that's true sure enough is this where i died oh no i died on the other side there is a team here i have a rampage don't worry i'm using the glitch yeah i'm chasing mean i did 90 damage to them and they did not do 90 damage to me so but there's a few of them they're not chasing recharge contact like russian pushing me hard i'm going it should be only it should only be two i'm just pulling back what time i say uh they're driving back okay kind of split 56 on this watson do you want me hey yeah the valk is on the roof over here so i'm not going to get to just yet two teams i think is it really if you can hit him a few times and they fall off yeah recharging my shields cheater i'm cheating because you're eating like a chicken why does plane wraith make me feel like a trial but it makes me feel a little like a little bit bad you know it makes me feel better about playing i'm so low to the ground i feel like aerodynamic actually can't be i don't have a hitbox do you have the kunai i don't know yes later i do i'm spinning it right here oh i have it on playstation how many heirlooms are there like seven i have no clue if there's seven i have like nine if there's nine i have like 11 whatever it is you have double yes guess how many guess how many films i've got in my level one bag oh none because you're cheating like a cheater five ah you're a cheater fun fun thermites they call me yeah can i'm gonna hide real quick yeah reloading i'm dead hey i need to recharge my shield there [ __ ] rapping over here on the roof i need to know listen to that thing that's all i hear is around babies yeah we're going kind of crazy enemy taken out this is running why are these things only running someone's down here dude oh my god it seems only knows how to run enemy taken out looks like you've been hitting the range my thermite's running out or is it she's gonna take gravity cannon i mean nice i might as well just run and take it all right as well oh that is um that's a nice portal too uh i think you'll be okay okay selfish they're right here i've hit two wingman shots can i not stand on this to shoot them oh my god that's so annoying i've got a thermite by the way i'm taking shots on the back left side close to me recharging my shield she's at this crawler then it's the lower cracker is this someone can you see anyone here uh i the yeah other side other side i think he's down though oh did he get down broke one over there i think great i tap straight around the corner behind us now okay i'm not i'm fine i'm trying to get to you so low he's literally one hp might be the worst part ever might be the worst ball ever i mean he's gone now no don't don't put me that way though the team is over there now yeah that's always the worst part and it was in the middle of the field online do you need phoenix you're in their site they're pushing us by the way that team i broke one of them behind me we need to get out maybe this probably can't go that way is it just a little over this way i don't know the best one their team i think i could really do before right now couldn't i i think i'll be right i don't see him man i'm the worst race ever oh they've all dude they're gonna hold us here uh left side i think this is a little nexus just bread oh my god mate turn around oh my god we're gonna get waiting two hopefully they get you on the back there's this team in one more team so they they all get you on the back how is this dude still in zone none of my guns are reloaded anybody's popping about on the way down none of my bullets are registering i'm getting like four clips i have no med kiss by the way i have 12 syringes can you can oh man i think we just go do you pour it or not no ultimate's not ready they poured it out there they're their guy nice job that was him broke one of them nice i'm trying to get to you i'm not full health though done one nice 40 seconds i think we just get it i mean it's not gonna take the iron oh okay i was gonna bought it yeah thank you fine i mean it's not taking over oh yeah it's not even the end of the game really is it we have to go though actually can you make portal for me yeah yeah do you want to start it now okay yeah uh yeah yeah sorry not starting now please i'm setting a portal oh there's a comment but that's fine oh you okay my bad there's a pad there too yeah uh i don't have any med kits for you there's a respawn on the way but i feel like he's just he's just in zone isn't he 40 seconds yeah yeah we have to go we just have to go to zone we might be able to craft one maybe yeah i only have 15 though i don't know how much you are 55 they're 50 right i think so there's a replica to the left let's explore this way so someone's just a solo right because if the falcon uh yeah wraith i think that you opening stuff yep they're firing i'm gonna craft it anyway there's energetic this guy's just running oh my god she needs to die i'll shot you through the door oh my god i'm stupid i'm actually tilted nice well on top yeah they dropped that they all dropped they all dropped somewhere back here we can take that uh yeah it's a safe can you stay on top of it i'm safe not really just about are they still behind that rock are they yeah we can jump i'll go left [ __ ] with you yeah they're on that rock i broke up gibby he's one of my 10 back right here okay just hanging fire there's i'm the worst race like ever there is no place because she's small if i'm pathetic at the end i died because he's big yeah i am i mean we won that's all that matters it's all about the three worst portals of all time yes we won nice good job three bangers six kills let's go
