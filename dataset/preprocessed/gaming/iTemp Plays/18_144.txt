hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and for some reason apex keep on taking away my most used weapons it started with the g7 my all-time favorite gun on apex l reliable they used to call it or at least i did and then they put it in the care package so i barely get to use it and now this season my two most used guns are the vault and the flatline as i'm sure you would know if you watch any of my videos i'm probably using them and what's happening to both those guns the flat line is going on the replicator in season 12 and the vault is moving to the care package although i do get the alternator back which i am pretty happy about now what guns do i have left in season 12 i'm going to be running around with a p2020 and a hammer point re45 i'm going to have to relearn the entire game i'm going to have to learn these new weapons the good news is we are one season closer to the scale becoming four loot once again season 13 please three months i have to wait thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it today i'm playing with janks i'm playing lifeline we had a great game thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds yeah yeah dude last game every team except for three teams in the entire lobby one checkpoint yeah your teammate's like no let's go meet man no but then he

there's just one team there pretty much these guys are in shambles nice i'm not gonna lie rich you're kind of wrong with that when you had the 3x on the flight line i was kind of scratching my head a bit but nah i'm telling you it's a secret sec dark magic people aren't supporting you people don't know about this like this dark magic now you can try you're just banishing people to the shadow

octane he's one i missed about 12 g7 shots nice i hit one i hit him with one bullet i trusted you nice nice it was an absolute beast by the way i i can't believe the rocky just hung out underneath us the whole time when that full other team pushed us yeah i know shout out to the boys though huh that looks like i'm like excluding you good game goodbye not the soccer team but gibby definitely you yeah give it a good it was solid it did well to get your uh banner whilst i was dealing with the team as well
