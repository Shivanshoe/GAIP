everybody it's Rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more Apex Legends of course and we are playing some Rampart today who I actually think is in a really good spot at the moment but you wouldn't think so because of her low pick rate now there are legends on apex that are just always going to have a low pick rate no matter how good or busted their kitties because I think Rampart I think uh and Watson is probably the other one that I I think both these Legends are in pretty good positions at the moment I really like playing Watson which surprised me but she's not the most popular Legend on the game and I don't think Apex can do anything about that now I know that not every Legend needs to be played loads and loads it's fine to have some Legends get more play time than others but I'm sure Apex would like it if the numbers were a tiny bit more even I hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends we are very late let's be honest but I've got purple armor and a rampage okay that's a person I have nothing I don't even need it I'm gonna be a side she locked her friend out oh no oh no I'm not happy my Shields that is a sad day for the boys these cities that friendship is in a shambles are we in Germans I know we can't no no we're in trails I'll check the leaderboard I have no light at all by the way here you go oh okay that's just not good no I need to pull back a little bit 115 on your face I'm covered hello hello I couldn't get the light because it was in a cloud of all right both these guys left I've made some more light hold on I'm coming I'm gonna I'll use my resume I'm dropping you some right here let's drop right there how do I get hit by that foreign I think so I spawned in on purple a rampage and a bat is that even yeah no it's not because I had a Mozambique oh my God it's 35. is there a bean and you're you're all the only amount that you had I spent 20 I thought I had enough I thought it was 30. oh my God too far they're running um into the Zone by the way oh let's go all those people call me an idiot in the comments delete your comment right now I'm a genius I don't believe it you're still right no I knew that's gonna happen I believed yeah you're 100 like that ranked game where James was like I'll hide the diva I need to have you asked you over on top of one this is normal it's not my fault I don't know about that it's not there are other influences at play that are out of my control it's so tricky to think about I can't even get my own loot you know I can't stop worrying about other people's league and I'm really struggling yeah I need uh we need everybody to just record their gameplay and just see how many teams they miss on a regular basis people understand people love to think they never miss anything yeah because before I started like streaming and stuff I used to think to myself like it must be it must be so nice being a streamer because uh like Chad just you never miss anything you know if you miss anything Chad just tells you now he's the worst part of that yeah or YouTube but not like live streaming you know it's worse on YouTube because you can kind of do anything about it yeah nobody like tells you like hey you missed that they just call you an idiot yeah they're here by the way I'll just set my shield too far back um I'm all running Batman yeah yes they are Mr busy 420. I'm not zooming out they're gonna come to you I'm here for 70. 28 that's all you got the third one I don't even actually just like blue 20 feet into beer Commando bro okay I changed my mind the most that makes terrible whoever said it was good oh get that guy do you all soon you don't have to say that on there I still can't decide if that's legal to say interesting I don't know can you I don't

nice so you come on I think so I think there might be another team wants to kill the Horizon Zoom I don't know they're Reviving knocked down low I think yeah I'm trying to get to You're Gonna bleed out in a second I'm trying to get to a safe nice little cozy spot you know oh this is not cozy all right Armor's broken okay Eyes Are Open no no I only have an re someone has to walk today okay well he knows he went outside he's won look at this spot oh that's actually really good can I get on this one oh God no oh yeah I do not I oh what's that thing that thing is like a Dwight's friend said it's a volleyball oh yeah that's one of the best lines of the entire series so aggressive there's a blue over here I already jumped that's because there's literally no guns we're gonna say nope there's none I don't know they don't exist s yay I'm going to you there are two teams there that was the last one last one in the squad at 20 heavy 9 40. what do you want why would you change that I'm angry there's a goblin shark what else what else do you expect I'm angry at him someone's that kill husband wife oh that one of the one back there is one HP there's one underneath yeah there's two of them one's close one run back or they might have both ran back he's in his corner sneaky enemy down oh you [Music] Dirty Dave uh reloaded do you want me to pick you up also because you're mad Maggie should be running a shotgun shotgun board here that's my gift here I just don't want to that's the thing they just respawned Estates I'm in the drive I'm in the passenger seat that's that doesn't sound like the passenger seat oh okay well now we're bowling the passenger seat okay guys look at this okay yeah I'm looking I'm looking I don't know it was it was a tactical reposition something you don't know about they don't care too well it's too uh what are you huh what are you again what do they call you look at me uh I didn't realize it was like three teen years though no I'm breaking the low ball Oh They'll rotate enemy taken down follow the team um I need to swap guns okay there's no nine on me I'm gonna go oh no I haven't seen oh I'm not going to shoot them attract an enemy shield look down an enemy charging my shoes I'm small handed but I feel like I should oh no oh no oh no like that's crazy trying to help good I'm good I'm good 2017. yes because they got crypto to remember oh having a crypto altered themselves you know you silly goose I'll get up top you're good I mean that angles that angle's impossible like it's actually impossible he's just sitting up top somewhere I think he's distracted I'm about if you need it I have zero bats there you go I did your small health to keep this back but it's all good oh I need it thank you oh you're fine before they in the middle I think he's here that's where the Drone came from okay this guy just did a Driveline he could have seen under the same with the team I'm blowing below I'm backing up giving my Shields a recharge I only got small heels hey if you have an enemy and one success here okay they may have my Shields over there so between uh far left I downed the cap over there but I'm down there's a there's a crypt over here I don't like this guy [Music] I don't know how he altered twice that quickly it's the color really that low it's probably got ultimate exercise nice I need your Shields I have one Shield cell s I need sales and that mid kid oh what a mess I've got a feeling I got the kill credit oh I just saw something happen I think foreign part oh no sir would you need lights sorry thank you good um we can go left to the Rope Yes actually Zone's closing oh yeah I can get ahead of him should we just run out I'm running from this angle there obvious to wait for you yeah there is a Sheila probably it's actually huge and Damage Big damage come on drop off that Squad and Buddy's Jason Bourne I mean that was kind of impressive blood cool there's a shield in some way I don't think that was here maybe maybe there was but I I think I heard one I'm Rampart and I landed on a gold Spitfire that's fine over there are you serious yeah oh my God oh wait for mine over here one's pushing I think huh they know anyway now yeah I don't know why he's sticking everywhere the volatility was weak even though his body behind there let me switch great different team yes you'll do the one he's the one climb the Rock what is happening I'm so confused I missed all my shots yeah there was a plate I'll kill the blue tangent and as soon as he died goes in octane or honest uh we got the team maybe both
