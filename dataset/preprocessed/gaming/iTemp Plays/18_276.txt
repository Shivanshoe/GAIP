all right well i wasn't really paying too much attention but i guess i'm playing revenant which is fine and i think my teammate might be okay he is he's not moving at least stand in the corner amigo get over there oh i find these little pistols but wingman re-45 isn't actually that bad i was landing there for luke what's he doing on the roof i've it's the start of the game are you supposed to be looting my teammates back over there amigo kind of that's sort of general direction uh there should be some more stuff in here i sort of need these weapons those bits and bobs why did he sound so close it's only the weapon there you go hello pk that guy's devastated they have blue and purple and they've both been headshotted oh my god how is that how is that even possible i will headshot you all day [Music] recharging shields no i'm not gonna hop into the lava i'll come back on either one no i won't hello this is my gondola get out of here and you i headshot you as well listen i don't even want to fight i'll be honest my teammates down is mine i accidentally took a gondola it's not what i want to do i need some loot i i literally have one bullet how did i get that kill why didn't he just revive him that's a sprint that might mean there's another team over there they might got flirted or that guy might have just left i mean i did hit the fuse i had shot and body shot him so i think like 120 maybe he got scared and run away and his teammate just left that was interesting i have 870 damage i've got about 870 headshots as well i think the wingman is the only gun in the game that i actively go for headshots i don't know why i aim a lot higher when i use the wingman that is quite alright teammate just so he knows just so he doesn't think that i just left him left him for dead i'll leave him here boss here for him i could probably climb this this is what i always forget when i play revenant about how good his uh his climbing is now since they buffed it you can just scale everything on the map you can't wall jump though ball jumping for some reason kind of a broken mechanic i don't know if this is the best way to go yeah i think we just got cappy to find our next fight there's 22 people left everyone's a full team so that fuse died i don't know why that matters but it does to me i'm trying to track people in my brain around here new oh weapons guy's close they don't look that close they need loot oh your blue armor here yeah they're pretty far i don't think he's actually going to challenge i need some attachments i'm in an extended light thanks where is there's no way this is a separate guy my teammates okay my brave totem stopped me from getting a kill coming for you down oh the bow guy not your teammate i've got a boner charge rifle this is a third party what kind of team comes up with a bow and a charge rifle i've got a naked 99 sorry that's a lie i got a blue star what's going on yep i have no idea as always wherever i am if i'm if i'm involved in a fight someone is be aligning it straight towards me from across the map with a bow and arrow you know i swear my gunshots are louder than everyone else's everyone on the map can hear when i shoot are they oh the third party gets third-partied how the turns have tabled i got a respawn here there's a lot of loots hello friends okay in an ideal world that made like our hedgehog and the nade eats him for a hundred anita died yeah they're distracted anyway i was the ttv that oh he's the kill leader thanks again that is quite all right i am gonna have to defend you on this roof though the response should be silent but they it does make a noise for the first little bit so i think they know yeah they know it's got a pokemon i think we just definitely say it doesn't matter if you don't have good loot sounds like he's got a scout i think so yeah with a headshot for you the ring is in close proximity 30 seconds killed one is he stupid all right you guys can deal with him i should have just revived anyway if i revived thank you if i revive tim i can just hoover up this box i mean i need a few things too but i don't really need light ammo i was going to switch it but then i forgot my team i had hello i was just hanging out the same guy oh that's another squad might come in handy amazed nice job two separate teams i'm pretty sure we can just go around it's not a problem third ring we've got healer balls edge of the zones right here these guys should probably not actually fight to be honest they were in different parts okay i have two thousand damage and six kills somehow a lot of poke damage has been done that's why i like the wingman you can just it doesn't use a basically any ammunition so you can just poke people at range if even if you shoot um like a full mag and it once who cares you know 45 damage for nothing [Music] uh this is a pretty bad angle and it would be a wasted ultimate i think i think we just keep on rotating i hate pushing this like train track the worst you got a care package too spitfire or something or a crater if they did they probably used it against us just now and they're using an r301 actually you want to stay kind of close these two teams are fighting i don't think anyone died and they might start kicking off again soon still kind of low got some water fence in there trying to bunk it down i think hostile over there it's not the best position for an ultimate but i'm giving it a go anyway don't tell that same thing that carry on running who puts a watson fence inside a big tractor and then runs off for me i don't know why i'm so desperate to sign to watson that's a good job i did sign so she might put a fence down there i would have been absolutely done for i got a gold prowler i should probably take the wingman back i need a poke weapon especially when it gets like the last few squads and no one wants to commit to a fight they have to just land some damage at long range oh that's two teams are fighting one moment i have no med kits good news is pretty sure the last guy is solo bad news is i'm pretty sure it's the other i'm pretty sure it's like the best player in the lobby apart from me in this guy you know we've i think we've already dealt with this guy once we can deal with him 2v10 that was more like 160. yeah him for like 160. bodyshot headshot he's gonna get battlefield here i don't think he's full health he's weak teammate there you go it's your kill what you want to do you know first you want to finish we're going to let him leave good job teammate oh that's nice i don't think that makes any sense if i mean he i just never know what to say there we go we had to kill him twice but we got him out of there we got the job done that was possible because my teammate was very very patient i left him by accident to start the game if you remember i hopped on a gondola got on some public transport went over to the next town i had to come back nearly 3000 damage only eight kills for that but that was a really fun game i had a great time ggs everyone
