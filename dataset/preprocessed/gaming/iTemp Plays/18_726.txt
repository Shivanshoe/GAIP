maybe supplies eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some war zone of course we playing this a lot behind the scenes ever since it came out and with the new season came some new weapons to the game and I wanted to level them up and try them out in the burial wars our mode the one we are trying out today is the CR 56 a max or the Khalil as it's more commonly known and this is the class loadout on screen that are used in the video that you are about to watch the only reason I'm using the suppressor on screen is because I hadn't actually unlocked the monolithic which is probably the best attachment in the game for 90% of the guns have the zodiac barrel and the rubberized rear grip to reduce the recoil I have the merc forged for bet he'll fire I'm using the 45 round mag which actually isn't a necessity in solos mode enjoy these trails and quads it definitely is but if you're a solo player those abilities definitely adequate and you can switch out for a nice sight or some of the performance-enhancing attachments now the way that you make this gun work on warzone is to try and avoid those longer range gunfights you will lose them against the m4 and against the grey because the Galil has more recoil however it definitely feels like it packs more of a punch in these weapons so you need to try and keep your gunfights a medium range that out damage these guns and you're good to go so it reminds me of the icon this game packs more of a punch you get more really cold because of that and therefore it's more difficult to use at the ranges you can use and in form of growl ads so today I'm playing the solos mode which is definitely intense it's a little bit more defensive than the other modes and I've probably played less than 15 total solo games and I'm still getting used to it but we end up with a bunch of kills and I'm excited to try need to do some new awesome content to the channel so thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in five and 1/2 seconds my friends all right RGB tease me me goes Eileen Claire call these RGB and I think someone's trying to steal my contract here because it's got a red roof a green roof and a blue roof but there are more pressing concerns of the moment it's a how light footsteps are good for a reef is that how like my foot steps are I finish mine off whatever I'm gonna risk it at least no install my contract you know build Serge contractor side of the game to secure yourself some money always nice problemis no-one's flies in here and we saw what like three people flying in so I assume they're all spread out hold on Jeannie's tactic it's supposed to start firing and making noise and stuff but there we go over now four knees distracted I'm just then white I can hear footsteps in here okay they're just kicking it this is the best thing about hearing footsteps is it makes you paranoid and then you spend the next sort of 30 seconds being really cautious because you know people love to sit in brooms in random corners and then nothing happens this feels like a massive waste of time you were kicking off but unfortunately I didn't get to mark out where he was and the sauna in here right and he's dead yes firing me why my deepest apologies there you've probably heard me flying and thought I was gonna land on the roof or something that's why that last box is just through here we've earned ourselves some cash money 8.7 a muckrake send me auto sniper this ago I think it's one of the little market and rifle kind of things might be worth it old there and I'll try so I think fun but I've never really use a sniping like the semi-autos in war zone at least an opponent you know where I am this guy was on the radar ones down low so you see just finishing the killing step someone's down low beneath this as well Oh friend when you finding from I think he was going to use the buy station he's just flown in from the gulag I think price got absolutely no money he's trying to fly into one of the most contested by stations on the game I will stay here until the end of time I promise gum bamboozles or bunny hop to keep it the momentum around the cornice this is the one on the roof yes looted that already well I've got nine point two I can't for Marlo dates and the load-out should become an increasing like that the free one so I guess we just thought waited out there we go there's two boxes though and it's in the place where a ton of people one slide outlines it bar next to me this is the place where I landed and unfortunately everyone was here it's a big scrap new TV station this might be a little bit annoying to get to there's a so many rooftops around this area I want one Khalil right literally right on Milo date someone knows man oh okay joining forces are we it's the war zone stipend division out to kill you boy you know let the recall free so I heard someone's footsteps this way - didn't week's drop down do you mean to fall down the ladders that plates an absolutely nothing for me you've got nonce pay thanks mate this is you've put me in a great spot named sous chef Gilles you one of them's a headshot it's not bad I'm not to do here we've got that we got the buy station new TV I guess give me my girl and given my semi-auto sniper that looks pretty good all right I was impatient enemy UAV overhead always turn around and I don't have c4 I don't think it would have reach anyway and he stopped taped take that there's no way I'm gonna stand here and challenge you I have one armored plate and you have mental high ground and the storms coming in I've got a doozy spy station I can't walk around with one armor plate on it's the only reasonable one I can get to as well without crossing a massive field these are even more vulnerable gonna be a fun time TV station as well everyone comes here this has to be in the top three worst by stations on the game it's this one the one I airfields I'm not really sure maybe hospital is pretty bad as well California analysis is get out of here give us some panties here a TV station see told you even always here just in friend amor corners it's cuz I'm grand for inside your outside inside I think I hope so cuz I've done taken Corral at this angle once the UID what we doing here friend head tip my armor is or than you have no idea why you were looking this way there's no way you heard me we can get one of these bounties I guess tell us where somebody's could be rotating him from the safe zone from the storm even that's nice we ranked up for seating on a Ledge as tremendous work wasn't a bit of a unfavorable position at the moment though he's actually stood between like two points of interest I saw Mary over to the airfield there now I'm now I'm gonna chase him and I'm going to be the one that stuck in between two points of interest I hate crossing these areas especially with this girl ill because the girl isn't as good as them for the of the grow a long Ranger you hop name okay then the eb our 14 level six now apparently the best girl in the game who no say that he's nice handle like a really long range good to accompany the skill old because it's good at close range and it's good at medium range we just have a little bit of kick especially compared to the ground me and fault like I said and whenever a new gun comes out on a guns like buffed or whatever the benchmark on whether or not it's actually good it's how it stacks up against the inform of the ground Niccolo swamp pad you just got to try and stay in a situation where it can stand a chance against those two guns and that it's not that these longer range and spans retreat it means ease off or in these places that everyone lies down like this on you IV please my friend going on bag I have the good stuff is that my bank if that's not my bound to this on the UAV and there are two people over here right on top of each other you'll find the airfields and the hangars but it says he's up top there is like a pyro place in them I think he's behind there cars drive enough to him as well hi Softail here we go why would you hop off that way that's what you're getting shot from it's gonna be a free kill and you've hopped off the wrong way three people special looks so nice wasn't the radar very briefly but forget this bounty that's annoying I got all the way here just for the bounty two died to someone else I mean I still got a little bit of money oh my god ten grand no I'm not using that buy station in the airfield I love ghost which is fine the issue is here the people live camped on these buildings because this is a popular lot spot you never trust people in solos it means it's bad enough enjoys trios and quads with people playing defensive but when you'll by yourself which I know so eerie about this game it's just so punishing okay to use this he ain't closer they just refreshed once more no he's R enough all right a circle is centered outside is he it might be of like around the building ground floor well that was you okay why was the circle so inaccurate maybe felt like he was just my own top the building for some reason it's work tech also on top of that building it's in the hangars 13 grand now so I guess I try and make my way back to the vine station if I can I know got seventeen and a half grand this guy's money just fell down the ladders apparently I hate using buy stations in silos it's the worst but no one shot me last time I got 17 grand a bit criminal not to use these might be time for self remove pretty far maybe here we shot it enough backs but the armor box because it's more I've got the armored satchel so he can give me eight and also this may be the last chance I get to even use a buy station so I may as well just spend my money for these guys to rotate in late name there we go mmm it's on all the Box are just wasting my money I could use the Vice Station again I guess I point for my DYC we need eyes in the sky typical sauce superstore way you have to rotate through as well I need a scar see sort of where it gets tricky I won there but gain teams kind of difficult these guys have to rotate from superstore I might just do the same thing here I might start a gate keep this person for a free kill if the freeze kills you'll ever get I think I think the moral of the story here is use ghost and if you if you don't have ghost try and get to the safe side as soon as you can that's someone wall call in a UAV and that person ball gate to keep you at the edges dawn only two people on the radar all right seven of the people how is that guy on that by station at this point of the game and not getting shot at that's a Christmas miracle theme why just rotate to the safe zone I don't know if anyone's even down this way you would assume so given the size of the circle and the factor seven of the people left oh here we go I'm self-opening vulture I might be worth I'm got a semi-auto sniper at this point the game my god you save me and get a shot together assume me [Music] this'll work on our way [Music] Wow boys gotta go and thanks this like five seconds he's gonna die in his chugging is coughing fifteen kill web the last I heard there were fighter top five people there are five people left what on earth happens the rest of the people I thought there was gonna be three people that tiny circle apparently not Jesus think with this weapon a cake it's not less let's be honest here it's not as good is the grave it's not as good as the m4 if you want to only go for high kill wings if you want the best chance at winning use those two Goods if you want to try something different with it a little bit different play style try this weapon out but you've got to try and keep the gunfights a little bit closer range don't go in the hills don't go where there's a lot of trees trying maybe stick to like the city area and try and get a long distance weapon as a secondary if you do have to go in those sort of big open places because you've all get been for those guns 15 solo we we clip it a little bit more aggressive but I haven't played too much solos in this game that was fun thanks for watching I'll see you on the next one mm-hmm [Music]
