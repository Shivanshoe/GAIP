hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and this has to be the most amount of gold items i have ever run into we had our choice of three separate legendary care package weapons a gold speed fighter i had every gold item and so did my teammate but he decided to run the red evos instead i mean it was mental it was a mental out of 10. we got a lot of these gold items at bloodhounds trials i completely forgot this was even a thing on the game but it's actually a fun little place to drop in you do some little pve you get yourself some good items and then you can get into the scrap afterwards so hopefully you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends now forget it let's just go down i was going to leave the supply bins first but we've committed blue time trials at least my friends this is the first time i've learned here since 1994 i think and i do not have a weapon i am struggling here we go on 99. now just need some armor is that the other team is that you that's you enemy over here a weapon spawn i forgot about this i've got 299's i'm fine get ready reloading someone took first blood from me are we gonna rush this with no armor i mean they had one level one armor over us but also one of them was firing a p20 20 there so it was probably even it was a fair fight i would say all right nice job teammate oh except this guy the wingman this can work got a bit of a strange skin on this though get out of here hopefully they're just gonna distract each other um this is going to be a little bit of a wreath but i think we just try this what's the worst that can happen we're going to die some proudest and we just have to try again let's do it teammate put this syringe on i'm just going to start it because attacks will happen to spawning i think can you like hide up here no do they think that they thought that [Music] listen i've been practicing i've been doing the quests recently literally two powers we get a shield battery this is this is the one we need look at this it's got the good stuff got a helmet bag and shield but i think you just have to do it all this one's got a gold helmet too that's one each double team now i think all right go tell me i might as well just take this because my team won't get one from the next one anyway there's a shopping ball here for you in the market for one all right this could go terribly wrong i mean the rev just got knocked from the level two one 11 damage tremendous oh god oh god i need to reload give me a sec i'm not leaving you just need to reload oh aren't you silly my friend you just left right over here there we go it was a bit of a race but we got it where's the good stuff here we go uh there's a helmet in there tina you take the bag because then we got one golfing gauge oh thank you i didn't even take this i thought i already took it here then we got two gold things eight i've got the helmet in the armor you've got the uh helmet in the back i was gonna not that selfish i mean kind of if you think about it the uh the gold bag actually benefits me but at least he can carry more stuff you know it's still um it's still a nice thing to have my team i didn't grab the level one shield i should have pinged it out for him your battery for you i need a light rain stick my hand was literally off my controller when i'm running this building careful who's he firing up body shield here level one i've got a bit of a big frame play here hold on i just want light ammunition and my teammates should be able to arms to shoot having to scour through everything one of the boxes 575 good grief that's a lot of ammo set as they are scrapping okay so you can't get on any sort of verticality with this with this bracelet can you i mean i'll probably mess that up a little bit but come on my teammate got purple from that which is nice i don't know how i've landed the headshot and i don't know how i've got level three circular h m on my wingman the the worst site of all time for the wingman in my opinion i'm not sure which one's worse the two times bruiser or the circular hatchback honestly i can't i can't let a shot with either of them honeyline to that because it was like a mini little quick skull get out of here all right this is good well what is commonly known as luta magrude i should probably take the small ones because it's obviously so good with the uh with the gold shield none of these p if any of these people came up to blue town trials we would have been screwed magrude right there we were on our last legs revenant was down i had level one chill with no light ammunition and we were getting what's that it's got gold loot so i'm going looks fairly big too this could be another gone bag i was on my last legs with with ammo and all sorts of stuff if we got a third party would have been dead oh great this wasn't worth my time all right let's get out of there teammate yeah i completely forgot about bluetooth trials honestly i don't know why i mean i guess we haven't played this map in two weeks but even before that i don't think i've ever have partaken in the trials since they since they came out it's a nice little way to get yourself some some good loot and it's a fairly contested drop as well and skyhook is also contested and this is one of the best rotations in the game because you can go from a jump tower to jump tower you slide down here straight onto the next one and all of a sudden you're in train yard which is a pop in place where's that there we go i bet we'll find something good here oh is it portal i see an enemy to get their little feet burned interesting enemy here there's someone here actually i think that was the noise that the porcelain like yeah it was he still down i thought i thought that second noise was his teammate coming through but he was the portal that's been destroyed coming for you is he just leaving you behind it's if he's not going to come back for you it's very sad and i feel bad for you but i might just take his stuff enemy killed i'm not entirely sure this guy's gonna come over but they did kill a bunch of people this may be worth that time got knocked down volky might as well get ourselves some even more loots nevermind it's been looted what a waste of time that was what on earth is that what is that animation friend that's going on there is that what it looks like when you bunny up or is that just like a spam crap to jump kind of thing like what this guy's going absolutely wild i think he's actually going to he got the notification that i had the vault key and i think he's just running straight there oh my god angle's so hard to hit with that passive okay scrapping someone else as well you could run away run it's a good job he didn't realize i was getting loaded up on my word you just counter-strike my wingman shots that was impressive stuff reloading so there are two teams here because there's a team on the bots in the ultimate and then there's a team lobbying to fight them i can't land a shot with this wingman good grief now for my teammates with that score piece there right so yeah nice teammate i should literally just stick with this oh my god we need to get out of here someone got respawned and that race definitely re revived the logo from down low we need to teammate careful just run get out of there there you go told you well i didn't because i might run on but just run don't lead him to me here oh my god don't shoot me good grief i need to drop this gun this is this is and horrendous sometimes i'm popping off the wingman and sometimes i am not i don't care what gun you've got i guess i'll check either both of you flatline i will never mind i can take the um and take the peacekeeper i have three phoenix kids this thing is just so gosh darn difficult to use sometimes oh god back three phoenix it's a bit overkill yeah i've got one friend i wanna i wanna please keep it took time i had a gold spitfire as well you are coming home with me tonight still got 20 shots in this i need to find a purple stock i know i've got a gold r99 all right well at least we're not using the wingman anymore because um i feel like i've embarrassed myself too much already you know through the squads remaining someone was shooting this way i think i think he only finished the kill though unless he had a gold knockdown or something i see an enemy over there we can keep these people here in time okay nice i need to get closer anyway look at my setup rotating here yes enemy here i have no idea how people melt people with this r9 from that range i don't know how they do shoot me provide your friends get him off what are you shooting me for i guess he's trying to dissuade me from coming over but and then the next gunfight we're in i managed to miss the entire clip how does that happen literally from 100 to zero right there i think it must be struggling i need lights i have no syringes either get my ultimate here in a second i'm struggling on all kinds of stuff don't mind using my last med kit because if i get syringes here with the gold shield they're just as good and they're a lot faster too need some light give me some syringes there we go full stack all right two squads left devotion oh i could i mean if i took the peacekeeper we could have had a full gold set up as well here we go is that a crater i might as well just take that oh nice oh okay oh fantastic loving that apparently you can't go through the metal rod you can't stand on that apparently can i even climb this revenue will be apple too so sad 45 seconds until the ring closes we've got time but not much i mean listen i appreciate the single fire havoc very much do appreciate the effort with that thing some may call you a lunatic i'm not one of those people i'm actually a big fan i have two gold weapons my teammate could have four gold items as well but he's gonna keep the red either looks of it we've also left behind the devotion and the speed fight we could literally have had every single gold item if we wanted to two gold weapons each and then the full exodia you know helmet bag knock down shield armor each if we wanted to we're all outside the ring has been outstanding all we need to do now is uh is win the lobland revenant combo who'd have thought it that's the diva if i run out of ammo on anything i mean i don't know how against one team but i could always switch out for the fresh divo i feel like i've used my ultimate to decent effect this game not my bracelet my bracelet still needs work but but the ultimate after all right you know often okay there's some big plays where where are these i mean we may as well just rotate if they're just hiding in these compounds then we'll get the safe zone first if their chin in the safe zone already then we'll okay they are the top enemy there you just won it's gonna split fire i see you three engine five [Music] oh nice teammate unbelievable scenes there yeah you've got to rotate early as i said if they were turning the compound we'd have had the um the better positioning and if they were already in the safe zone then it gave us more time without the storm behind us pushing us you know it's just better to rotate early in that situation who would have thought combining forces two and a half thousand damage three revives got three kills from the team as well 700 damage i tell you what we actually got a december kills considering we spend half the game pve shooting prowlers and obtaining obtaining loot so yeah thanks for watching and i'll see you on the next one bye
