hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we're going to be playing some arena and then after that arena game i have a regular battle royale mode as well so so far and i played arena mode for about an hour and a half straight and we won all 10 games that we played which was great however the matchmaking was kind of weird because we were a duo we had to put a solo on our team and because we aren't a three stack we very rarely got matched up against other three stacks one of two things would happen either it gave us a cracked player and put us against three of the good players which i preferred or it gave us a player brand new to the game i'm talking level level one level like below level five and he put one brand new player on the other team as well when this happened this game our team that was level three clearly he wanted to try the new 3v3 mode and he told us at the end that we got him his first win which was great it was a wholesome game that i very much enjoyed before we get into the video though a word from our sponsors lenovo and microsoft [Music] thanks once more to lenovo and microsoft for sponsoring today's video i hope you guys enjoy it thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i thought that was hilarious that's gotta be the greatest video of 2021 by far right this is not fair i test level three again you know what it is is because we're such high we probably such have high level uh like ranking sbmm that they're putting like the worst possible solo queue player with us to like compensate and it's like that's not fair for them though poor guy no because like he's got 21 on their team it's difficult to balance but it's not like do what we do what happened before like you know that twitch that wasn't a three stack those twitch streams they were a double stack and then their brandon was also a good player like just with us as well which one uh last game no the one where you got your reactions from oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it was it was a two-stack with like yeah goodbye i think that the bluetooth wasn't with them but yeah i just i guess there's not enough people that play this i don't know i don't know cracked in here anyway half under our grapple behind us nice hold on hold on i've got this oh that was huge that was huge you like that that was sick i like it there's like a moment of silence where you're grappling him and just my wingman is actual duty sometimes mine is hot trash yeah i wouldn't know what that feels like doesn't happen off for me it does not oh look at that grapple nice nice nice how'd you get knife how do you get knife i am a cheater oh that is so cute that's actually so awesome pat is down oh mommy man sucks mate my wingman sucks i'm in line give me one give us one oh i missed of course i missed the one shot oh i missed the graph on him the double same oh i participate you're helping they're not over here no they're all right they're this guy's alright really really weak i'm getting both though recharging shields smoking out these guys i don't have any healer balls by the way um i have two bandages oh teammate what that's not good i just played you like me that's my fault i didn't buy any healables it's so funny to me dude what the god thinks still what no the the lifeline just like so just does not know he's just brand new brand new game he was doing the running in a moat how do you do that i don't i don't even know how so i don't know how he knows how to do

on lifeline right in the middle of the enemy taken down broken on you nice let's just give you reloading 38 gj very nice yes man that's actually so wholesome dude i knew i was like i'm gonna get hit with one body shot and they're gonna send and sure enough they hit me with one body shot just sent me and i just i just died it's so whiteful um i am i am in the rain i landed a tree so i'm being looted i'm coming over i'm the most new person here i would assume they can run as fast [Music] in here he's afk free kill three go go free kill there's damage don't you take it don't you take it i knew you were gonna do that i knew you're gonna do that i literally waited because i knew you're gonna do it why did you why did you bite i want people to see i want people to see the real item you're the one cleaning an afk guy i left him i saw him i actually saw him well yeah because we have the guy who's actually attacking us so i have two kills and priorities damage yeah figures and i think the 100 came from me first definitely did you think oh okay yeah i deserve that because he took my other one too let's go just running this purple i don't know why they're off the scene so much where did they actually pad i don't know yeah purple glow oh someone's close i've got some gloves cracked air and i sli you know how when you slide off like right on the edge of something yeah it's just like perfect it's like double head shot at him and then body shot at him in the middle of all that oh no feels good being killed later mm-hmm how much damage you have 300 uh-huh well like you know you know when you just feel like you've done a good day's work it's well deserved kill leader everyone in the lobby is like what is mario she's in the feed a lot you know okay or you need ammo and i don't give you a moment [Music] you went through the door to avoid the punch mate you're a genius how do you do it how do you do this you know what i'm gonna use sentinel queen man get too much uh no yes um i have two i have a gold wing man and a gold uh i'm annoying okay i'm healthy yeah i see something gold over here package right here it's a gold armor um make sure you're losing the mobile response what make sure you're losing mobile response for me way to make zodia oh my god i have a gold helmet gold armor gold uh rez gold knock down gold sentinel and goldwein that's that's ludicrous literally every single thing is gold that's insane i should have kept that four to fifty times i mean i'm really far i'm coming though there's somebody behind me be good yeah i'm gucci all right there's some it's a guy over here behind me i don't know who he is oh there's a car it's a copy car bad guy over there they look into that party might be same team i can i can pinch these guys i'm behind them they both won but i think the course had got something off a course with a spitfire by the way what what no not dude it's caustic oh i thought you're going to be mad at me no no no no no no no i'll switch this way oh on me i'll meet me oh thank you so much give me oh i just went right yeah i'm not really sure about the tactics oh i was already mid-throw i can't use my res i need all gold i need to keep everything nice i had like already thrown my bracelet before you killed him so i pulled you through the game i was committed how many how much damage you have 1600 okay oh yeah you're probably gonna have more than me this game oh that was a change if uh i forgot what i was using all right my loadout right now what is it i'm using a sentinel and a wingman oh yeah trick trump not very good with the wingman either does anyone have any decent light mags i'm popping off of the g7 with a level one right now hey do you mind popping your oh no but you've got ultimate here all right here we go no please yes oh i've been asking i'm committed i'm committing oh thank you i'd have probably died uh probably that's what i'm here for they weren't hiding and i didn't want to hide you know we had a gentleman's agreement and then i stubbed you i mean yeah that's what i'm here for a desperate desperate need of what my reigns oh vladimir um check the guy down here i don't remember what he had well i have my all i'm out there's one down low as well i just found some oh this guy is 300 heavy of course he got a 300 heavy as well i have 16 cells here falling down i don't know what i need i guess i just need nades level two light mag i'll take it thanks mate that's a big goal see yeah yeah this is definitely the most awkward loadout i've ever ran um yeah i can imagine my three times g7 unrivaled going kind of crazy unrivaled i've got an re45 backup as well see that's why you need to start playing more arena because that's where that's where it's really going to come in handy on the g7 or the ra yeah well or no poke damage like just steampunk damage all right it's almost broken oh my god all right broken shots if you have to know what do you think damage that guy oh my god mate when they're this far away it's so tough with the stupid g7 recharging all that all that stuff you were saying i know i didn't say anything i didn't say anything i'm putting that out of my video no you do know it's gonna be in mine last team last team last team spin move i want to see some punches oh my god [Music] to me oh to the lobe of maine of the century
