hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are using a gun that got buffed in season 13 but i don't really hear people talking about it it is the peacekeeper now the buff was increased limb damage from 0.8 to 1.0 now i assume these are percent values as in before the buff hitting an enemy in the arm or the leg did 20 less damage than shooting them in the chest in season 13 this number isn't reduced at all now this is a big deal because with the amount of pellets that you're firing per shot and shell it is very likely that some of those pellets are going to take your enemies arms or legs and those particular pellets are now doing 25 extra damage from 80 percent up to 100. now i don't see any comments saying that's a 20 increase because it is not i think this makes the peacekeeper a more consistent weapon because you're not punished for being slightly off target and i believe they've done this because the mastiff the other popular shotgun of course is now in the care package please let me know if i'm wrong here there is no way these values are referring to straight damage they can't be pellets never did 0.8 damage to a limb that doesn't make any sense this has to be referring to percent values now today i'm playing some mad maggie and have a great game here for you i hope you guys enjoy it thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends god we are late we are so late but i actually don't think anyone's coming over here no no no attack that he must not attack that okay i'll take this one i got both guns but the second one was a mozam and you can loot the rest of this if it was anything better than a mozam i would have dropped it but i don't think she would have stuck around and there's probably way better guns in there anyway we're fine first fatality all right we got actually decent moves in order to take that alternator if i was anyone else other than mad maggie i'm gonna try new shotguns even though my beloved has disappeared the mastiff getting behind this is the dream offer party action that's a terrible idea oh my god [Music] all right pk i'm nearly purple armor i've got a wingman like i'm actually really happy half the team half the teams are dead but it's fine i don't think we'll have a problem finding people everyone's going to be on the safe side of that why am i on 44 ping i should be on like 10 scan i mean i can't really tell the difference when i'm playing but that's still a scam good job on this lifeline there's no way they come back down and i think that must be the last one we killed their teammates i'm like half health there's no being shot what's gonna say there's no way i can hear it from the top this guy's screaming jeffy bats no we're in the next ring okay i guess i just suck i'll make bats i was very tempted to uh put my arm in there but more cost effective to do this way okay i was hoping you weren't gonna focus on me give me a second i'm absolutely useless shields don't die i'm on the way please do not die you're getting flanked bam i missed huge why are you challenging this are you not stuck doesn't that stun you oh i cannot challenge that i can put my thing down never mind to hit the octane there's a real terrible angle nice teammate all right i've got the revive i'm the medic let me let me provide squad this is revive number three and go for a new world record because everyone knows that revive gives you an extra 300 damage so if i get to like 10 that's a 3k badge well i think that's pretty good more heavy oh he had a three times flatline i've used it so much i'm going to use the wingman i haven't actually used the wingman that much recently there was a period of time where i used it non-stop for about three weeks but recently it's just been the wingman i feel like i'm sorry the the flatline with the with the three times on it it's so good round two all right well that's two so either they've got a straggler which it would appear to be the case that's four times did one of them come back i don't think so that might be two teams over there oh okay i'm not going there i don't know how to do that i can tap straight but i've never practiced with the gravity cannons and i'm not about to start when there's potentially four people waiting on the other side race can do it because she's got a face i'm mad maggie okay we are or at least i am absolutely nominee i am in king's canyon and you've left okay they spotted me i'm taking shots careful teammates don't die i'm so slow i'm so fast it's like i'm playing on ice skates oh my god my arm is switched i'm dead so yeah thanks for playing guys that's what he switched oh god please no that's a bass let me off the switch sweet sweet all right that a master's badge so yeah get 1v3s i mean i'm probably dead but maybe these guys want to lose instead of instead of chasing me there's a good chance [Music] okay i'm just gonna run this way then brings the sneeze away and closing in 30. grabs too loud i don't know if i can take the gravity lift it's going to take me to the zone it's going to go this way i guess you got to respawn over here uh there's a team on me then the other two teams are fighting like antenna so i think it's actually a safe respawn we should be fine i can't believe the octane left but the wraith is the one who has stayed hopefully she didn't go afk hopefully she's still actually here the alternator alternator here wingman alternator you got better than me shield battery here shield i don't think these guys will push us the only team that will maybe push us is the one that rocked up on me because they won't be distracted extended level two it looks like confined to be honest thanks oh you know me i'm all about the aroha did you get everything are you left wing man here's the wingman gotta get the wing man all right if this guys wants to run off let's team up on this guy then a little revenant where is he where did he go probably this way bring it back to his team that's rain on our parade we back up just a little bit try and keep a low profile there's a chance that team pushes down fights each of them then we can just sit on the roof and shoot them both that's the plan oh they're rep pushing please don't say that rip pushing us i don't hear him there must be red pushing either okay see ya they were pushing us now they're getting shot by another team here we go now they've got involved what is this it's a stalemate no one wants to commit to anything which is fair enough are you still in there are you trouble taking man's still top are yeah 45 my old arch nemesis coming back to bite me take that he hit her 79 uh okay i've got a medkit and two syringos sorry three syringes she just take this no just take the med kit ultimate's ready the syringes won't take her to fall sir no please i hate triple take man half man half triple take back on what's this map called storm points just to annoy me we're down to two players here we don't even have a full team we got portrayed by our team but don't bother me go take this instead yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm just dead i guess i'm i guess i'm just i'm just screwed magruder i've got one bat left i need to i need to not get hit this is bad this is raising my blood pressure to an unhealthy levels this guy's getting a care package shoot someone else please i'm begging i'm gonna go craft like 55 mats this is two bats and a med kit do you have any mats by any chance i don't think you do oh well goddess get murdered that's one of the bad's gone at least i get to give one to the team out i guess give me a friend there you go i've completely forgotten who cares these guys are scrapping this is that this is our cue to get involved i think there's no way triple tape man is looking at me or triple take men i guess i think they're a plural there are multiple triple tech men spotted look at him smell a rotten egg over there we might about to get angle on these guys the thing is i don't want to wrap around behind us and take out a spot so we sort of have to rotate a little bit here try and put some pressure on so these guys don't want to push us if we let them come behind us then we're pinched i i mean i'll try and cover you we don't have to go down there though we're in the next ring come back amigo quit pissing around move here stratosphere to that why not yeah i know but i think there's much we can do to be honest even if we dance around the roof it's going to take us three hours to get up there we can't first them and games like these are so strange where's this zone gonna pull oh my god obviously i mean we we could not be further away from the zone how are we going to play this that's not safe gravity cannon's safe to it i don't know if we can make it past yet though we'll have my ultimate is this that best option i'm absolutely destroying these guys getting embarrassed here on the wrist that's two cracks i'll crack someone inside my maggie tactical if they're gonna do the robots we might just we might have to be line it here teammate this is our only option i think i've got my lt might not need it to be honest recharging my shield i don't think we need him they're gonna hit me a little bit i'm sure there you go thank you beautiful these guys are fighting robots holding ground here i hope that's really annoying them look at that 28 damage free of charge i have one bat and that's it they call me the one back many people have called me the one back before and this is this is evidence of why this is this is the proof how long has it taken you guys to kill eight robots come on come on you could you you can do it i'm gonna help you out there you go uh okay so what's going to happen here we've got this t on top we need to make sure that this team here doesn't use the green jump pad and like land on us that's a flyer do you have any shield cells i can't use a bat for this i need to save it what an absolute idiot this one must be struggling too this guy's one that's gonna say there's no way you're taking that i need shields i don't mind taking a bit of damage here because i can use my back then but i can't use my bat for 50 shields guys are scrapping need to big frag um we are going to get pushed into the open before they do i think where are they they both behind the rock i think there's only one behind the rock i think we might have to rush this i think we have to commit you ready teammate just brush this guy man all right you by yourself with this guy i think oh see ya i see ya the wraith was isolated because this guy newcastle's shield is just ginormous i guess i have to shoot the fusion of times in the back i forgot we had an octane teammate look at that what a beautiful game of positioning that was he's gotta have you gotta have a plan you gotta really think about this game that was tremendous gg's all round oh man what an absolute struggle mad maggie's honestly still pretty good i just kind of stuck with the pk apart from that fuse kill that fuse kill was pretty good ggs
