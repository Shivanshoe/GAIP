hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing wraith today now raid is probably the best legend that i don't play that often apart from perhaps gibby because i would assume that gibby's better than wraith i think at this point and i almost never played gb however rate is pretty good i have three games here for you today with three very different loadouts and there is something about playing wraith being tiny and using a wingman like the gunfights are so fun as wraith with a wingman i can see why people use this setup i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you so much for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos well i kind of went into autopilot uh okay i didn't realize it yeah i'm gonna land through the top this way out the front door pick up a flat line and a mastiff oh i love the mask yeah i got it maneuverage octane should be up top from below me that's the last of that squad dimensions looking up nice takedown such so good recharging my shield okay there was a corset running around with purple so be scared there's a problem looking at us funny as well mate not to make it to going to leave i'm more scared of the prowler than i am with a classic now i have to kill the problem kind of feel bad nah purple armor or not uh i mean it's scary concerned about it he's right here i almost have a jump pad 95 okay [Music] oh yeah we're gonna need to get you some i have three bass as well though if you need that i got one i'm good thank you do you want a second one well i mean if you're gonna offer it i can't say no thank you oh this way making contact with enemies oh how did you roll the ash 63 flesh right now 70 crafty sky i killed ash down we made the right choice yeah baby recharging my shields maybe maybe not i'm going to grab my purple back charging careful i thought i heard a power pad and i'm dead i'm dead take me home country roads thanks for the dmca claim bud to a place i belong dude you owe me compensation that dmca claim you gotta get saved he sounded exactly like he lost me i haven't had the instruments going yeah i'm dead oh god everything went bad no gun everywhere i got locked with cinnamon i killed the watson oh that's a steer oh this is what capital city is all about baby this is what it's all about oh yeah struggles no guns and when i was coming to get you i wanted to keep the p20 just cuz i had a meg on it and i was going to swap it for a better gun but i had two thermites and there was a rampage in there oh nice yeah so spur of the momentous how did you got to go for it yeah it made a hundred percent what's up thank you chris i'll be there in a sec yeah i need a bit of energy i'm going to come with you guys i got a messy there's a team on the bridge too and a team inside okay a hundred purple on uh left he ran into i have no energy i have a shotgun no dude there's no way we got pushed by like everybody at the exact same time that was ridiculous oh she's mate she's gonna be cool oh my god that was insane wait is that you that was me on the rope oh good for a lifeline i love mate i love doing that it's not very often it happens but what stamps you on a thousand well i thought you'd be on a decent amount it's not much honestly i i spent more time running around it's another one of those situations where there wasn't a lot accomplished from my side but you know yeah i know what you mean because yeah a lot of my my game there was just to survive and i don't think that ignite angle no shot mate i fell off i did a lot of damage i i traded so much this is from the grave i should have punched her into lava after that have been completely play that was actually i know unintended well maybe intended inside your brain insult me that was fully intentional that was wild this guy had he had five rfs and five thermites and a ba and uh g7 scope with the worst skin i've ever seen bro that was actually ridiculous that was such a dope play for me to come back up like that i know you got that sort of like verticality you know no they're coming this way they're coming this way yeah i'll come in avoid jumping i feel a lot of stuff but it's not gonna do much i saw that was all my throwing stuff now i'm mad they're right are they actually um yeah well i don't know oh sorry i just pressed the big map i didn't realize it was that far away yeah uh yeah let's see they went all the way around good i'm just knows where these teams yeah see if my ping was correct only mate do you have a license for that gun oh you want to know you want to know what i i don't know how it works but you ever watched landmark and you look at the background of his of his streams yes he has a thousand guns it's actually crazy your pink was right on and there's a care package here the only thing about this is that when that third team arrives they're going to shoot us what's that's gold by the way i'm good i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm just disturbing the beast they're climbing on you i have to drop it then i'm gonna drop it yeah thank you oh i missed my first one it's not your fault mate there's a team behind me too kind of just hiding oh you got purple i got purple wingman and a pk and i'm playing rice hello there's a lot of teams in here come on oh there's a guy right here can you drop like through someone i'll dance i'm gonna phoenix okay if you want a phoenix there's a purple here but you're you're you're fine killed an enemy got it i uh i hit a pathfinder for a long time okay is he in history somewhere somewhere around us yeah oh it's on me come in new kill again for them well played and you've been getting hit wait somebody's on the road oh god if he touches it i'm going to hit him he's standing here i think for 90. they were fine here big big scrap they were yeah they're looting on this she's done yeah yeah that's just chap strafing hit the uh the rifle up though nice job charging shields recharging my shields slow healing the body's on the red beacon and so is it i gotta go in i've only got a pk wait where'd he go i have no clue i don't even know where the knock is a little bit i missed it there probably 130 on uh they spotted me i'm taking shots down enemy down range is facing to mark it i'm gonna chase her i'm gonna first this guy before he crawls off somewhere it's okay they can't hit me i'm stimming i'm a speedy little guy oh there's another this is the rest of lobby i'm falling back a little bit dranks i need to bat okay i'm killing the first two teams we were fighting or the first thing we're fighting is fighting another team okay yo flank these guys we kill these guys now and then we just have to worry about sniper team i just got sniped love is okay i'm down yes well played honestly dude i can't get over how good the teamwork is right now yeah yeah it just feels great i don't know just gelling there's no explanation it's just the matthew i'm crunching the numbers but like this is just getting out of hand at this point it's not even well played what did this guy have that was red was it your armor a vault armor or a volkey ah fault armor imagine hold on make big replicas spawn down here so it might be the rest of the lobby fighting over it you know trying to trying to craft a purple helmet dude i'm an idiot why didn't i loot cells uh i have this many don't worry about it i'm good i have bats take two thank you okay i mean i have uh i still have 14 mate so you just hang on to them oh okay i have wingman pk so i don't need a lot of teammates right on this fence come on oh god oh i need to drop yeah uh i'm just going to keep swimming i'm literally one so i'm just gonna teach it i'm gonna come with the right side yeah i'm fine i'm fine i'm on the bridge though they're walking up to the other side of the bridge right now one's on the bridge on top one's not fall we're running to a lot of the players but unfortunately we are just superior you know okay this guy zodia the forbidden he's doing it he managed it he did unfortunately it didn't matter beautiful my idol level one extended heavy and a blue shotgun bottle until just there the heavy isn't crafted that's why yeah it's hard to find i have so many just got a light meg nice do you still play that weirdo sensitivity not no no offense but it's weird things didn't say uh i've only changed it once um so i don't know which weirdo sensitivity you're talking about do you really the alc no they're here i swear they're here no i play i use alc's it's actually a little bit more weird i just say fly on that he was you had him one shot yeah yeah blue armor bless him i guess he was using the care packages bait that he's so sad yeah poor guy that was a fun game you are the apex champions that was a good one you you fried that game i wasn't even killing either i don't know how many you had you were i can't remember to be honest with you what's seven again look so close to 777 i'm telling you it's all i get so true i don't know why
