hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and a few days ago i did a video entitled i haven't played this legend since their big nerf and many of you guys in the comments understandably thought that i was going to be playing horizon that video i was playing octane but it did remind me that i actually haven't even tried a ryzen 8 since her big nerf a month and a half ago so let's go through that nerf her gravity lift is now 30 slower you can't go side to side as quick whilst on a lift you can't see it at the top of the lift for longer than two seconds the cooldown of her lift and ultimate were both increased again and these nerves were on top of a fair few other nerfs that came before it and now you rarely see horizons in game i think she was over nerfed she got the pathfinder treatment and i reckon that we'll see some adjustments soon that go the other way so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends to look it up and see that like chief keith started it chief key side what are legend chief keefey's chief keef the legend chief all right what are we uh doing this are we doing the same thing as the past three games uh yes and just a living in fragment yes bye please it's crazy what do you expect all right okay that would make sense though i'll land them in a good spot let me know if you need me i'm gonna come over regardless cracked yeah that's just meant they have a course again a lifeline in there yeah i'm pretty sure definitely killed one but i don't really have any levels we'll try tonight yeah efficiency oh he's so loud [Music] [Music] whole enemy squad has been forcibly expired my brain today is literally working slow motion so that is the octane that i told you about it's a good time you should go say hi oh my i hate this stupid glitch man had a guy telling you today that isn't a glitch you just like you went to the left it's like no that is the glitch it pushed me there this guy never lands fragment in his life man you're coming back all right i'll kill some people over this way mate there's a fuse's box and like middle broken that's what i like to hear oh he's gone now oh i mean he's still there in spirit all right okay i don't see anyone there's like a box here that's not what i meant to be boxing yeah let's get the loot skis oh no please please please yes you face you face your face okay nothing off it's a launcher stuff at me get the rest a little bit of damage i'll train someone i need to bat straight he's almost broken are you in a sec i'm cooner dude like what is this what is this audio octane the top just throw me to narnia i would like he just i tried to land up top he just threw me look at him in the corner chilling how is he still alive oh the octave i forgot that i was like right there the octane ran past him like three times oh my god do they pad they must they had to think they were in front one in front of me and then yeah i think they must have yeah that octane was standing on the bridge and he started shooting me like like just blending i might be tyrannosaurus rex if they don't move yes yeah don't even notice i told you that i was the guy you're not that guy trust me you're not that guy are you was broken but he probably showed the dirt where are these people they're all on me rich i'll walk up onto the roof man i don't know how they down i don't know how they got there man gone down 10 times i don't know how he got there is to not go down again this game i mean i saw my fault but i couldn't find him coming to the conclusion that my wingman is just not it uh mine was for a while but at the moment he's not you know what i mean yeah i think this is kind of how it is i think it's never 100 i don't think anyone's wingman is ever 100 no certainly not it's impossible improbable we're all inside i'm pretty stoppable unstoppable uncroppable is the rev team okay come on

much snow she's one like beyond one he's flanking me i'm yeah he's alright what the heck man they're on me kind of i spent most that game not being able to see i'll be honest i i'm gonna land i don't understand how that's possible though like 20 million people play this game like how's that possible you know skill based oh yeah that's true maybe he's running away from me you good it's reloading it
