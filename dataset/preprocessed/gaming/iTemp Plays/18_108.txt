hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i've decided that i need to try and find another main on this game if you don't know i have made pathfinder since like season two i think um but the problem with pathfinder is that he's just he's just huge he's just a big guy he's a big hunk of metal and i feel like i just get beamed all the time as pathfinder which is a shame because i love grappling all over the map i love his ultimate i love his voice lines it's mainly the grapple let's be honest but today i'm going to be playing a little bit of octane who is probably the closest legend to pathfinder in terms of mobility he's also got an ultimate that can help his entire team get across the map i'm going to give him a go i want to know as well who are you guys mainly in season 12 and has it changed recently so thank you for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends might craft a flatline this game do we have a crafter here we do first game of the day though and i've got to survive before i think about crafting bad dudes a lot of bad dudes around this area all the bad dudes hello bye hello again don't mind me just missing you're cracking we're good oh my god he don't ex gains more come on myself there's a blue here i'll ping it but my teammates already have boots we're fine uh anyone gonna use the heavy bullets okay yeah yeah you're just in here you're shooting me where did you come from ah no okay i mean that's mental that's crazy all right we just had one hot drop let's see the second hot drop he's gonna treat us see how we see if we can stay we're not gonna stay like this are we dead five dollars to anyone who can figure out what i just said there's no way i'll get four beans out of gun there's no way i'll get four beans without a gun say this hang on first i don't have a gun either oh i'm having a great time i landed on all stars i'm going to take his armor because it's actually pretty close to blue because he killed me already oh okay we can still do well mean teammate enemies right here you revive someone or enemy real close about time we got ourselves a fight guys behind a post sorry he said bandit here i know he was fine he was two separate teams man amigos let's go here you got to get out of there you're gonna have to get out of there stayed boom another one down um that race definitely should have um just shot the quarter trapping for another massive here charging on my shield charging up my shield do you have any energy yes it was the pathfinder with the ring clothes need help need help syrians here one sec healing up the heck was that oh charging up my shoes and they're not here to sell me you need to move it's not easy when you're playing with a pre-made squad something that you know is top tier caliber how can we push this it's impossible to push rings closing i like pushing limits as much as the next guy but we gotta go kryptos cracked crypt had a nice wingman on him as well i might have to take the i might stay the wingman this guy had no energy only did they have as many as i shield cells i think body shield optics here close range sergeant on my shields there we go nice a crew member will be coming by with our beverage cart drinks are not complimentary though where was that her passive went off way out there dancers get safe these guys have to come the same way as us calm down guys i have to switch off thank you though oh taking fire right look out that sucks just a random pathfinder it wasn't even the same team that was just a random solo it's not your fault i have one med getting a phoenix that should be fine i need to get away from these guys i'm gonna have to go up here i have heat shield yes i have to go up here and then slide down i have 10 kills i've taken every single kill i just need to make sure i don't lose track of my health timmy's been patient next ring's far i've got a bucket i've got one of five knights do i even use my phoenix i'm octane i get out of this uh i'll have a look that was someone lucky the guy came in the corner solo griefing us in the back with a charged up rampage unbelievable let's go here i'm gone i got this there we go i didn't mean to slide into the last time i was trying to cancel the slide repeater right here i'll drop some ammo as well on that leave a shotgun here i'm gonna take this shotgun bar and drop it on there as well so he sees it and then back in the game shotgun bolt here level two perfect it should be okay death box here as well this could be huge i don't need this as much as she does as soon as i'm octane it's go time amigos i land a shot reloading played that's huge from the teammates what do you think the guy dark i remember kill the guy here did he make it to this probably yes level three don't need these maybe a little bit hold up healing care package being delivered all right there was a fight i heard firing like doc's area i think it's over no this way let's go over here let's give it a go see if we can party someone beginning ring countdown just after acting third parties here i saw someone and i don't play this replicators on the way amigos enemy spotted way out there what do you think is over here i backed up i messed up which had to leave i think there's one other team i think they're already at docks so i think we just we just try and sneak around let these guys fight it out over here ultimate's ready oh that's huge yeah yeah yeah yeah alert five valkyrie on standby ready for burn burn is a go that's huge such a good ultimate let's go over here affirmative did we see anyone they must be over this way but there's a care package unloaded maybe maybe the other team decided to come over or something i don't know give it a little cheek pick could be a vault they've respawned because he said question mark before what we got smg here oh that's just massive or 99 here a gate like me what do you think is over here oh my god i need you jumped off i might be able to gatekeep here i don't know where these guys would have respawned didn't see anyone on uh valkyrie's passive see someone out there they were trying to cut us off i think i don't know reloading check out that care package is they're too far away for that charging them we could just get involved do you want to get involved where does this portal lead i don't even know where he goes don't bail out on me now we got another squad attacking us oh they killed this team maybe we could have got involved earlier going to get to high ground we need to go back now i've had to get up there i mean i'm talking to a valkyrie they went zooming they went zooming for the high ground actually pretty smart i was going to be one of those behind him though we're going to get off won but he's dead he's coming in huge crack this guy too i see you guys i see you they thought they had us they thought they had us well play mate gg they thought they had us in the 3d2 but they absolutely did not i called the octane rotation you are the apex champions crack the uh the wraith and the valkyrie finish the kill and it's just the digital threat in the vault look at that what a beautiful game against all odds a 2v3 nice that was so good wouldn't have won without valk results either by the way absolutely huge
