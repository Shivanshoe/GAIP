hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing mirage who i absolutely love but the interesting thing to me about mirage is how apex or respawn have to incrementally keep on buffing mirage's kits because he's unique in the fact that he's the only legend that he's based on deception and the problem with that is once you buff him he becomes exceptionally good until it's been a few weeks or a few months and everyone has got used to how mirage works and then everyone knows how to find the real mirage imagine season zero the first week of the game imagine if today's mirage his whole kit is ultimate which sends out loads of decoys and you control them uh you can control your decoy they've got footsteps they even tank like 45 damage or something imagine putting today's mirage in the first month of apex when it came out i reckon people would have been using him in professional tournaments but nowadays i mean he's a good legend of course and he's really fun but you don't really see him in competitive so respawn have to buff him and buff him and buff him and it's this weird cycle of they both him he becomes really good and then everyone gets to know his kids and it becomes average again but he's in a good spot and he's really fun to play hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm down at the back back supply beans i need my decoys oh my god no there's not going here okay this is the white coat come to me come to me come to me oh i'm already gone what do you mean you're already gone you didn't have to be you guys fault i have to run all the way at that never mind there's a team over here come back there was a gun there just take this this is awful it's so bad no i just hold you guys i've got a rampage you don't need anything oh okay you have multiple guns it makes sense yeah i'll try to tell you to come back we are inside i don't even look these beings i don't know how to as a rage queen kill i'm healing phoenix fast cracked we get teammates batting yeah i'll drop down with you are you gonna drop that now yeah i'm good recharging shields sending more decoys to pop finisher could it just pop to finish it to be honest i really should have i'm not with you foreign nice the triumvirate we gotta get teammate back in here i'm coming up i'm going up top okay i have zero bullets up hang on i'm heavy at night as well i barely got any i have heavy i have heavy let me just respawn him i guess he's got a charge of sentences they win uh they went right did they okay someone's naming left there's a paddle people need to use it i think they're in there you're right yeah pretty good i come back up easy uh that's quite defined mate landing on a rampage is so busted it's so powerful it barely goes through ammo you never need to reload so you want to flip everyone whilst everyone's firing three bullets at you with an re45 is very busted actually not busting at all i think it's perfectly balanced the way it is oh my god you're the same not the same no the same oh my god audio oh my god where's the audio they just came i mean i tried them all but 130 things what can you do oh be like that sometimes ah kind of cringe try it try it oh look at this little guy spotted a subject right here i thought we killed her we never killed him when did i take gold or something like that you better come this way hello did you start i've said this idea before i'll say it again when mirage is in the passenger seat and it uses his ability to send out another car send out a whole no you can't that's that's the worst part about the gravity gravity cannons already suck that's the worst part about them recharging shields apple teammate oh my god he's going to die recharging shields can i alter you got bamboo i can appreciate that oh no sorry no they're beneath me there's no way you were that bold oh he spawned 85 seconds to charge it up absolutely murder someone over there one of them's one shotgun belief but she's full health i'm dead yeah i might be dead dude where did i just i came over to i came up to you because i needed to heal i wasn't sure if you were going to die there or not thanks right now reloading recharging shields uh phoenix phoenix oh they're here faking them out with a decoy reloading whoa for the team for me one of the reasons he's good is that it's not often you land and don't get a good yeah there's that so there's a lot of loot everywhere and everybody's like spreads out for the most part yeah yeah yeah yeah let's play dude this place is great it's really fun it's the only poi i actually like on this map i think it's definitely the best one i kind of like checkpoint a little bit it's all right yeah checkpoint is kind of fun never works out but it's got a cool vibe a good vibe to it i know i like the vibe here level three we are all using energy and heavy seconds until the ring closes yourself what's your setup uh uh havoc i'm a car that is disgusting okay well how much damage you have uh 921 five yeah 903 34. eight kills come on well i didn't first only one so come on and i killed i killed a very sweaty watson and she superglued did anyone did anyone who you killed anyone that you kill super glue super glitter oh oh i got a different from me did anyone that you kill super glued or no super glitch answer me oh i just killed an absolute demon he just tap shaped on me that that's the guy that's the just like triple tap shaped in one fight and then left instantly where's he squadron he came from checkpoint right administering medical aid the rewards in that care package is not going to save you how many of you are bragging about doing 30 more damage than me and i got two revised also like five more kills so yeah but that doesn't count i was there we were shooting the same people there's no way i just went all the way around oh my god i think someone is up there i'm getting scammed not lying again oh that nade is actually oh that havoc just is unstoppable he should have won that fight too i was ahead of you and they went around me because they knew i was too good to take on 1v1 i went for the weaker people at the back you know they saw us as a pride of lions and they do what they would do in nature and they'd leave their heads and they'd go get the little club at the back they saw they saw me on there they saw me on the kill on the killer banner they knew it was what they were doing squadron here by the way they saw me there i think i'm trying to come on trying my best guys in the middle that hurts i can't go in there support the team is that yours i damn one there's no that was the last one i hate anyone that plays corsic i'm not lying i i'm i'm kind of a fan i'm not that guy was cool that guy that guy was cool zero exceptions to the world no exceptions recharging him play with him maybe he can actually have damaged me i damaged you many times today i think it's been once you're not counting the games it was about like 13 damage you're not counting the games like you see at the start of games you rage but you don't check the numbers like i do you need to start taking that yeah because there's no point we lose if you lose a game it doesn't matter it's out of the question it's out of the equation yeah but you need to blame someone for the loss who's to blame usually usually see you because i'm damaging you that's just not true you go down to way more than i should spend less time talking because way or more i've gone the opposite direction i apologize that's the issue i don't have bats and i have 11 bullets in my car okay well attention i full bats you know i love that that's kind of dumb that looks crazy good people are interested i don't know why people don't use it more often yeah i think i've made like 10 videos on that topic right there so again right after i might have to melt it again you know i mean it is kind of insane though even without the uh the turbocharger you just have to learn how to use it like learn how to pre-fire and it's disgusting when you do you get so many comments that are like how can you have it doesn't need to charge you up from your site well when you're sliding around the corner just feather the trigger a little bit just a little bit you know just a little bit of that but a little bit of wall hackage too you know throw that in there it helps if you're cheating it does i'm not going to deny that here we go where are you taking us i'm going this way faster and safer role good look she's following me okay i see you're still pushing forward damage game oh my god their head glitch is outrageous and their rhymes are contagious hello he's a different team but this thing's a mess you're fine either dj [ __ ] it stand on ladies and gentlemen might not be the team i don't know but they came from a weird angle do you still need bats i can drop something here i'm good i'm gonna go outside i'm glad we stayed on for one more game attention yeah standing by a little bit sarcastic there that's been a good one enjoyed it i'd rather be doing a scaffold right now but i agree you can be doing both you need to learn how to multitask i should that's actually a good idea in between games whatever you just hide in a bush i don't know was it a damn time just i tell you what we do i drive you a bank until we find someone and you tap out yeah or just use my second pc you know oh just bring that bad boy in here one for uh one for eft one for everyone for effects easy what no now you know me i go through my phases i only play games although i gotta watch you today don't play games you've sunken about it's sunken you've sunk it's about three quarters of your life into runescape oh you're actually dead i suck i suck i suck that's a tragedy mate i'm so bad i'm so bad oh my god do you have all dash i don't know if you've used it oh there's no way he shoots me from there that's just crazy i cannot believe he shot me from there should have revived me not the course if that guy sucks that guy sucks you are the apex champion oh i was gonna be so mad i was gonna be so mad i hit the octane for 145 i headshot i killed the watson and i cracked the fuse so i'm not sure what you would do mate to be honest i have been altered more times by fuse today than i ever have in my life i hate it when you're stood inside because you know if you've run through it's like 60 damage she kind of questioned me and i'll tell you what i told her i asked if she had her ultimate and she altered back i'm telling you that was uh clean comms for me igl
