hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some ranks as well which i haven't played much of this season i do love frank's been on world's edge though so now is the time to take it more seriously to start the grind to masters at the moment we are extremely close to breaking through to diamonds i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends embarrassment i'm let's go this way i'm landing bottom player no but i i am oh okay oh that's my bad i'm not stuck on shotgun here level one oh united top this is g7 i've alternated flatline no no ah wait i have two bats do you need one what i did i don't i didn't i didn't get that one did i yeah you did shield battery here you go here you go here you go oh not teammates i'm going to take it i hate it for you hey i have g7 uh devo i really care for this load up my orange is just the actual worst i don't care what anybody says my rng is the worst what kind of load is that no one has a worse irony than me g17 that's that's like the kind of loadout you'd ruined when this game came out contact with target that's for your device one's got blue can get out of there i made it out we can't fight that there uh go back to building big buildings i don't need that show back uh i still have one i'm good i have uh i have two well i do not have i have i have zero heavy there's 20 heavy below thank you 157 damage somewhere i broke one of them we could send this team honestly this team looks like they're in shambles how does that ole miss shields one i just shot you in the back of the head about 25 times i got your friend i i got all those kills i did 107 damage to them i am tanking everything right now yeah you are we're surviving myself up that's so tragic mate i need heavy ammo is that any heavy yeah level three oh it's 500 i'm good half the squads remain i've done nothing yeah i've tanked everything you're on jeez he's bad it is it always has been and like everyone thinks like it people just complain about their rng but i really feel like i have the worst rng ever i get so scuffed i mean you are being scammed this game wait do i have a bag like i have a level one back uh same shotgun in the game i don't know what those other teams are that might be them fighting over there yeah hey over here it's that monster pushing him uh we can't send too much because there's more teams coming from east [Music] i'm okay yeah i don't really have any angle i think i think they're in that look could be done if you've got a nade no i don't i dropped 40. did you get any of those kills nope how much damage i look like 800 i don't really do damage right okay yeah let's go this guy's got red supposed gaming did way more damage to him though whoa just right around the corner octane's broken i need to hail [Music] huge when you drop this red i don't need it i killed zero assists yeah i have eleven hundred damage and zero kills i have thirteen hundred and eight but i first of people just just boost these numbers so it's not as embarrassing so i don't know how much of it is actually organic damage you know i did a good amount of those guys oh dope top on construction did you say you had zero kills yeah i have zero i have seven assists i don't even talk that fine way i once got blue i'm gonna try and get an angle on the right oh okay okay this is a joke of the game actually a joke of the game you're having an absolute nightmare uh you're all by yourself by the way that's all running mate 45 seconds oh they're valkortin oh my god i should have recognized that noise earlier [Music] and they're also great [Applause] this is one there's no that down live i saw one of them gotta dropped up here turbo charger over there team it's the same valkyrie i'm going uh i'm going left i don't wanna overcommit my grapples and there's just three of them mate they're just running giving my shields yeah we're coming behind this team right here okay what another difference anymore i think these are the two teams fighting on this uh on the other side well these are the last two teams he was down it wasn't even mine i basically just have an alternate hair it's actually so annoying hey four cracked on an octane recharging top is it just one on the top uh there's a few of them over there now why are you moving what's going on there i'm here oh i mean it can't be because they didn't all die i think it is the valkyrie we just killed the angle this is because we first hit the valk yeah they're up there let's explore this way that's true oh no scopes in for three sorry mate no no worries yes that's so that is so tragic towards the end i was kind of trying to just go for the zero kills and then i thirsted a random dude and i got a kill even ruined that plan yeah so that didn't work out i can't even pop an emote one assist huge huge three or five three revives though revit yeah cause i'm taking everything
