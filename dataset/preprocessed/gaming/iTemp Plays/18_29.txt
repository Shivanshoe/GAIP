hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more eight pixel legends of course and we are actually using the r301 this is the first time i've used this gun in season 13. not because i don't like the weapon of course i love the r301 i don't think there's a single player on apex who doesn't look this good it is the bread and butter of apex players everywhere however when you're playing puppy games it can be very difficult to find time to craft especially if the p of either you land at doesn't have a crafter by the time you have a chance to craft in most of your games there will be 12 people there but in both these games i did go ahead and craft it i do miss this gun so much i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends well this sucks well louise he's so bad foreign hey watch my back pals there's a new kill leader right there reloading actually i'm going to go this for this go like this there we go did we kill the guy is this guy purple perhaps it appears though i need champions shotgun this in aveny no god and i forgot that i changed my pk skin to show off that my other pk skin was better and then i forgot to change it back so this is huge i'm gonna stick the most outrageous revive up here 45 seconds and the ring ain't far at all this is a bad choice broken enemies i'm going to stick it i've got a rampart shield so hopefully they won't come off a teammate can just land on one of the boxes why do they keep taking ropes by save recharging pals do it's coming back on your feet darling i crack that hooligan shield bend it down recharging my shields i stopped teammates i'm stuck [Music] i'm going to revive teammate that's obvious i was stuck i shouldn't have gone in there but i thought that's where the ramp up would have been in the name of suck on your feet i was stuck that wasn't my fault shield enemy downed reloading arcstar did anyone know he was there probably not because i had no idea oh man if i wasn't stuck i could have helped him that was ridiculous i was stuck on like they were just both there uh all right there we go i was to do wrong actually it's going to pop a bat spaghetti i've only got seven cells okay we need to thirty-one now to get valkyrie some loot i could really do that three times or two times but the one times isn't batting r301 it's not bad definitely do some work with it need to find some people to shoot in the back that's all that's that's step number one in the process down here i guess hopefully the valk plays safe because i've got a fin she's just going to go in there and die because i think she might be a bit frustrated but we needed to play a little bit safe seconds of darling time you should head here i have ulti and i have arc stars through that charging up i don't know if she knows there's a lot of move there charging banner can you grab the loot there's leaves uh so she's still lootless which is which is bad if you weren't aware maybe i should have started pinging like the armors and stuff i think but i just i just thought she knew that i downed someone and we were going to get the leaves but she probably got cut off i think uh is there a chance this guy goes around no we need to come off here what we science fault call a body grenade slum i think he's gonna go around maybe he will if he saw us he well we need to get back before this team comes around because we only saw one guy but there could have been more we see a good position in here i mean we've got alcohol we can we can chill up top here and then valve caught out after this so i need a bit of shotgun i keep forgetting hey that's a shotgun nice extend backpack here level two what we should do is defend up here until this zone comes in and then we valcult from this roof and then we find somewhere safe after okay okay we we didn't want to do the valcult strat we're just going to go down there okay that's fine well there's two teams to the east well there are two teams to the east did we just third that that's the last team so there's two teams here one team there wait that's not that's not correct there are four of the teams we can probably pick some people off here right surely oh my god i suck my singularity nice job teammate we're fine do we need to valcult i think we should can we val called from here please recharging my shields we should go from here oh my god the flyer is he's tanking to the rockets that poor flyer he's screaming out in pain i mean he slept there though what a demon reloading our surroundings it's the last guy i think it's literally the last guy in the lobby but just to be safe i'm popping a bat yeah he's over there somewhere if i were him i'd have came out here went to the right i'd have i just like went here or something bam that was correct all right 3100 damage not too shabby if you ask me one revive two respawns troubling hasn't been the best okay i'll take it there's one here too teammate if you want this one he's dead double rv that's not terrible i guess double r e purple and then we just third party this enemy over there yeah let's get involved oh huge wait did i i left the bad pk skin on when i was in the intro yesterday oh god this doesn't matter what skin you've got if you found a digi though let's steal my kill mate i'll just steal my kill like that where'd he go was that not my purple that was my purple darn it man i did that so much how is my purple no actually this is the course he got killed anyone loot him i am furious at myself all right i think we go here this way you can i really want to craft an r301 but there is no crafter here they're trying to shoot the flyer they're gonna go over to it i got a hooligan over here i've only got an re45 though so this particular range it might be tough it's like 50 48 or something i don't know shields recharging right here i'm coming continue to revive i need to heal wow i need to heal darling help path there's a team here the enemies rainbow oh my god man i need help so bad there you go amigo this pk he's absolutely carrying us i'm not gonna lie all right give me the good stuff here we go i need a three times or two times or one times any of the times is if you see any timesies please let me know not that though not at four times come on it's a lifeline pack don't go up there careful please be careful uh not really much we can do no no don't take it don't take it now we might be able to but there might be are they shooting you yes they are let me four times it with my keyboard i don't want to get stuck in the four times i've i don't have i can't change the variable scopes with my controller i've got it bound to like tap strafe button i'm hoping they get furthered i got a charge up center that's the problem if i hit them i do like eight now oh they're getting furtied this is a mistake probably i don't know no there's a fight there they're just not fighting what happened to that there we go thank you mate i thought i got bae for a second because like everyone decided to stop shooting each other as soon as i went up there what happened they've got two down the same team so we're pretty much in the same spot as we were before yeah that's just this team has been dominating the kill feeds they can come to us if we sit here they'll come to us they're thirsty for kills 100 welcome over told you yeah what's up nice guy i think they were thirsty here 117 this is just such a horrendous angle we can't really do much two teams left so if they no don't die grenade let's get our teammate this is bad i'm in a really bad spot we can't revive it's all on youtube i'm dead all right i want to show you this game because at the end i messed up in a variety of ways first of all i didn't put a heat shield down in my head i remember thinking i don't have any heat shields i don't know why i was thinking that but i must have thought i had a mobile respawn beacon i don't know messed up that way second of all you know when you're on a flight and they say always put your own oxygen mask on first and then help other people this is the reason if i didn't try and revive the revenant i probably would have won this gunfight if i just used a med kit i would have been absolutely fine i'll be honest i thought the pathfinder was reviving the revenant because i didn't hear them coming over to loot but yeah my fault i messed up in the pathfinder's defense they were like level 40 or something though they were brand new to the game and they should have been an easy victory for the squad but manmoth half man half moth choked he messed it up i hope you guys still enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in the next one bye
