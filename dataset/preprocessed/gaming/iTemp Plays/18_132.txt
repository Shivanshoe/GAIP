getting a crocodile crafting i've hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we're playing some more apex legends of course and jax and i are here doing the crafter only challenge if you don't know the flatline and the longbow were moved into the crafter i assumed to ease up some of the ground loot and therefore i often don't see the flatline or longbow for games at a time so i wanted to know if they were worth crafting or at least i want to know if the flatline was worth crafting and then jenks came along and said why don't we do a crafter only challenge now this doesn't mean that we have to craft our ammo and heal the balls from the crafter we can still loot people i just mean that we're going to be using the flatliner longbow exclusively now the game that i have for you i started off exceptionally bad so ignore the start but it gets better and i've got my highest damage so far this season so definitely worth sticking it out thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends we should get a flat line in the oven so we can handle the business okay get your head in the game dude out of the gutter yeah sorry sorry my my fault oh there's okay i was like kind of confused at where the crafting material was i picked up a probably by accident i'll be in disguise oh oh i i did this still backwards i'm crafting it's a step it up uh yeah see i'm the one that just doesn't have it together craft a flat line first so at least one of us has got a gun that is smart yes i should have been i

team here potentially maybe where did the guy go maybe not might be okay now well oh there is there is there is rich i'm looking at a guy he's in the middle building okay and he must have been yeah he's a sweaty little guy i'm surprised he didn't try to third party as when we were fighting the first year weird nice gotta hop up here it's gonna keep thinking that throughout the season i know dude so painful my video tomorrow people are gonna be like they don't even understand the struggle like they're gonna watch it and they're gonna see like us not finding the kinetic feeder and i said in the video i was like it took like five days but they don't understand it was like probably collectively like 25 30 hours yeah the struggle was unbelievable unbelievable what's your strengths like that wow are you on mouse and keyboard what was that i thought only mouse and keyboard players had movement like this oh while she's down low don't even touch the sides uh it's a legal movement i'm punching out you really want to play this game huh oh god jumping out here keep the change oh get out of my dream we were supposed to a little we're going to have a race dude oh punches shield opening fire on the enemy bailing here i thought they'd be this way because the energy default was kind of popping right wait two teams they get being paid no it's uh logo on the left three times yeah i'm chilling here i only got i got a one x on my longboard okay friends are coming on me i'm trying to help leaving a fracking yet without grenade oh i said both of the ones george where okay that come from i

12 bullets thank you that's perfect this is going to sound bold are you going to hop in the trident let's hop in i think we each hop on the track we got two here let's rush up i don't know which one to shoot we're gonna be all right they ran off where they're in here or something right they are they're inside the change what are they doing i'm gonna go in [Music] oh these guys are they think i'm the great sniper ever so they might not even be there oh yeah they're retreating i'll watch them leave 30 seconds remain okay here i go that's huge i have 14 left wait till you see me oh they're up here i'm going past them thanks for the ride friend i'm off ditching here i am rich 55 uh yes i know him 110 on his teammates maggie oh oh my god i have so many so many heavy bullets but it's such little sniper inside i mean we've got a crack here what's that noise make i heard a weird noise back there i'm a little concerned that there's a team back here okay i don't know what it i don't know what that was maybe it was just like the the rift thingy i don't see anybody could have been missiles right here right here right here he's on a battery reloading bogey he's right here on the battery corner should be fine left side oh let's go dude i knew i heard something oh my god unless unless i did it maybe they were maybe they were riding in this corner the whole time they might have been i left that too close i shouldn't have zoomed in as much grief it's a miracle i even survived that long that was insane oh you like baiting like that just moving help loads i i tried to beat them to your side so at least you could put in some yeah before you got here one minute that was kind of uh the goal still no sniper battery here yeah i have eight i've eight i have i have eight as well eight act here i go i do have my all right okay little further so we have two guns yeah we should actually like like actually actually unless no actually you know what we got a ton of bins here there's no way we don't find any and i'm down to go craft i 45. replicators actually yeah let's go do that are you even flying over that way they're just stopped oh yeah yeah ready ready bam oh yes now they're shook using grapple all right i'm gonna get some ammo in the oven meet soon make sure you press the right one wait if i drop my flat line can i get double on that is that how it works no you need two of them people keeps telling me that's what you're supposed to do try i can't i'm getting one more i'm getting one more uh stack of sniper okay let's see we're getting a lot of efficient use out of the crafting yeah we are it's a craft only challenge so all right rich come on five ready to scorch for burn oh yeah we kind of use the care package what's the point okay timmy two on the left what do you think do you think we should just land on there and stifle from the side yes nice remember we know where both teams are yep one minute before the ring closes we hey who invited the third oh the other two has an angle on me that's annoying no i just hit it for 110. yeah go get to running dude can you stop i'm trying to kill this other team 10 seconds the ring i am repairing i'm trying to hold an angle so this team can't keep sniping yeah like that if you need him i'm all right one sec i'm using my phoenix kit they grab the package right in front of us they're gonna try to get keep us actually they're gonna get pitched by the other team the other team's on the on the thing looking like oh i'm good where i'm at okay this guy dropped off right not here [Music] i almost killed the bunker she literally won he left the valkyrie the valkyrie's over here by herself she's up here got abandoned that was sick this was doing nothing at the start but i pulled it together that was that was fun dude that was a lot of fun definitely worth crafting them i'll be honest yeah definitely worth crafting ex-champions that was a fun game man that was a cool little twist it was a it was a cool way to make it unique yeah and we had a dude we had a pretty big game actually we popped off okay let's go i was following her three times
