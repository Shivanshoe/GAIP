hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have two of my fastest games that i have ever had on apex the second of which can't be too much longer than the world record for fastest ever olympus win that wasn't like a glitch lobby or anything both of these games were outrageously quick so what are your guys fastest wins on apex because 7 minutes and 43 seconds is my new record thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that that is so respectable i like this guy have hammers i'm coming in levels i don't think i don't know if it makes that much of a difference because we won't be able to find half the lobby anyway now it slows down for a little bit and we get the chance to find people you know like that's happened the other time and we still got oh here we go it reminds me of the south park meme where he's like [Music] yes [Music] from downtown pretty sure this guy was afk white mag little drone in here i need to speak of some shotgun a bass from that i'll take that you know what i was going to go back to double check if there were any in here you remember when you're like it's gonna slow down and we'll we'll have people to fight uh yeah what 15 people left 12 12 actual people nice [Laughter] i can't solve for this i think he's putting us into three sack lobbies we just die so quick because literally everyone full since i don't but i don't understand why though like i i whenever i play duos in trios this isn't the case yes same same the last few days it has been the case for me oh what was that was that you think that was teammate i think it was teammate i didn't get eds that there's got to be a team over here i guarantee it yeah recharging bro shot that would look so cool oh my god i just did over 100 thanks for playing uh i need some more shotgun like the mozam with hammers he's so fun i just did 122 damage to someone in one shot yeah it's awesome i think he was one shot maybe overlapping either one but he's still a lot of damage janks basically just loading up on grenades there's only there's only actually i'm going to grab i don't know look at the ring look at open your map and think there are like a cluster of three dots like in two separate places on this map yeah six people were looking for but like two actual teams they're close so it's basically like looking for two people this is stupid you need some back let me know this is all of our games dude every single crazy at the moment i supposed to get a crater if the game never gets to that stage it's all purple armors i hear a team already i was shooting the flyer nice i just used my pad so i can't get at the top i tried the raid a little bit yes hammers behind me revenant's one shot [Music] kid chose to reload at the wrong time oh no okay um okay oh uh thank you yes i have a point harry my recording is eight minutes long whoa i was honestly though at least we didn't struggle to find people that much oh my god look at that damage this fight is so good no one knows about it i thought where the tree the tree of giving the tree i'm giving yeah there's loot here oh and no one ever contested because they just don't know there's so much loot here i've got a long bone hammer actually i'm going to come back that's a lot of loot i've got an r9 as well rory not got a gun i should land at the tree given i've had excess probably should have we've got a fighter on the ropes ladies and gentlemen kicking off we're all kicking off in there they're reviving get him as effort [Laughter] i just leveled up my armor from literally just punching people in that's great it looks so funny you need a tub uh i'm using a vault cruising for a bruising in this corner who will challenge that law of energy i have i have three all right we're good the tree of giving i'm using flat 99 i'm not using a longbow when when we've been struggling okay i'm using that either oh here you go wow good things from both of us but you could say mom is still a little bit better yeah but how are your comms that's the real question overall all right let's go murder some people so far i haven't actually shot my gun i've only thrown hands but it's been successful somehow you have more damage than me i have 162 damage that's three kills apparently i think i was able to punch two people oh i love playing octane good times all right well we got all the loot we do now we just need the kills i assume they're gonna be down this way i've gone through the tunnel on my way i'll be there sooner or later these tunnels are some of course are so fun a big scrap near me mate humongous scrap someone's like this way someone's like here i saw someone's like yeah [Music] um i really can't spend my trigger at the same time that's fine because i kind of fried him over here nice try that again i'm gonna give that another shot just rewind it so we're not six kills wait i have wait there's 14 people left okay very productive day of gaming first ring just died and there are 12 of the people i'm going to sit up top someone will have to come this way yeah yeah to recharge i wonder if i could take this i'm gonna take it uh don't let him kill me please i'm trying my best to put some shots in for you 45 then 47 39 that's why oh my lord you're running oh my god right in front of me that was really good two squads left look at the ring this is just an absolute banger of the game it's wild i have 800 damage let's try and set that like a record like the fastest fastest game i need to find these people can't jump one of us is gonna finish with uh under a thousand and it's not gonna be me my pad's not working my scooter paddle oh you're a paddle come on man all right this last thing quick it's gonna be like a six minute game hundred and eighteen nice how long is this game what the heck just happened what is going on today you have to get i reckon that's like a seven minute thirty or something i don't know you are the apex champions oh what a guess seven minutes and 43 seconds that's the fastest game ever that's ridiculous
