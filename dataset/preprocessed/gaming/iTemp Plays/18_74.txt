hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing solo today with phil on of course so we still get teammates but i'm solo qi and i think the biggest mistake that my random teammates always make is with their positioning i'm not pointing this out to show how bad my team work i'm absolutely not perfect at all myself but i did have a third person perspective of what was happening now if third parties as bad as they are in this game the worst thing you can do is go into a gunfight knowing there is another team either to the side or behind you unless you can steamroll one of the teams and fight your way out it's almost always better to hold high ground or to rotate behind one of the other teams so they're the ones being shot from multiple angles it catches so many people out i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i don't know if this is a good idea that is fooling i'm surprised no one landed the door with us people are in the middle right yes they are they're not coming this way though wow you ain't good we're not showing to him i mean we have to be careful because they're like right here pretty sure oh come on when he wasn't my kill let's be honest the champion has proved [Music] points [Applause] honestly so weird reloading another squad teammate got the gold that's fine i don't mind because i've got six bats when you got bats i prefer to have purple i've said wait i have 700 damage i guess i did just sit up top third pointing people shoot him in the back of the head you know one minute heavy attachments that's what i need challenger ladies and gentlemen [Music] oh there's two teams position if you can anyone summon the courage to face this contender they're shooting at me oh why did my team do that it was so obvious there was some behind oh they're both left what what are you guys doing who these people i'm playing with i absolutely join normal scrap over this way i'm just going to try and third-party people that's all i can do when i got my mo's i'm at the ready actually decked out mozam what's the fight going on over here like someone padding yes it is no it's not it's a crypto drone i saw the guy on the right over here oh my god the game 32. any big team here i have to try and kill because look it's five and 11. so without me it's four and ten the average is like two and a half people per team and this is a team of three there aren't many team of threes i said there's no way this guy's coming for me out recharging shields took care of that one this guy's gonna try and get a revive off someone appear what are you doing friends jump drive activated 30 seconds to be somewhere else i might be griefing too many people on the same team i don't know what's going on the crypto drone the crypto still up which i had dual shell i guess i could pop my ultimate here but what are the odds here kind of low i think it came from that way i don't know it did don't drive out i'll start to go this way oh god i went the wrong way i should have just got safe first priority's healing enough really two squads left two squads left these last guys beautiful we have a replicator coming in guys it's looking behind me guys this guy's just checking behind him i've got like three squads coming here i wasn't expecting that which right john master was like afk or something i hate it when they they don't half but they also don't ping where they want to go like if they're waiting for at the end of the ship but it's not my play style but at least i know they've got a plan if they don't say if they don't think anything i'm like is this guy even here am i just sitting in the ship waiting for someone to say okay [Music] took care of that one good kill he's actually such a good start tossing thermite they're in here there's about 18 of them apparently [Music] on my door recharging my shield did i get the bat no darn it open up shop and shut them down i mean i've got a purple bag though so i'm happy bats three bats light mags perfect i didn't have a skin on his r9 pretty sure there was another team dusting jump drive yes get ready there's an enemy close by and where are they going nobody knows there are many of them multiple levels when he's here i don't know if he's waiting for me though okay see what's going it's going to pop a bat i don't want to pop a bat but with this here and i did good damage from one of them probably for the best let's get behind him go crazy and he's going to peek i don't know this place i'm never here i think get out of the box i hate this controller configuration recharging we're already inside the next ring setting up shock i need an extended leg lag i want bats i don't want a linebacker so bad guys the kind that's all mine i guess that's fine well kyoda got a key card here nice choice you've got good taste yeah i got a spitfire i never use this but i'm gonna give it a go we've got ash with two masters badges i don't know if she's the kill leader or what spider-man just gotta get in there before everyone's dead i was gonna go too far okay okay my mistake my mistake sorry sorry sorry i'm an idiot for even attempting to uh to come around the corner my fault here heat shields grenade one of the worst you'll ever see i need someone close left i think i mean i wasn't wrong good grace oh goodness me it's just crazy yeah we gotta try come back did we get banner yes we did got that red team i'm gonna if we ever respawn uh obtain get this lose all right i can't believe i'll stay live there were at least two times there where i feel like i should have died over here get up top and then they can't hold us from there who knew but the spitfire is kind of busty let's try and protect him up top we should be fine all right what do i need hold don't die don't on i don't really know i'm at this angle i might be able to catch one of them off guard here definitely a revenant somewhere too shield here level five evo shield here level five ash such a deadly combo to oh they've respawned i see an enemy the team respawned all the way southwest of my shields 45 seconds but we could just walk it enemies taking fire he's hiding he's just hiding charging on my shield guys are standing still think myself my own termite grenade hello well i didn't get the kill but it's fine activating jump drive very poor accuracy from you boy there we go we're already in the ring here replicator oh my god speed fire here speed fire here i could do dual spitfires and never have to reload ever again but i'd rather one of my teammates have this usually i'll leave the spitfire in the care package i don't pick it up i don't find it that satisfying to use but i'm playing solo here or at least i'm not pre-made not like i mean i got teammates but we're not fired up is what i'm trying to say they did respawn this way i have no idea which one they went they valve caught it watch out [Applause] lovely idea don't pan out recharging shields i'm thinking tossing an arc star and we've gone trapped there don't go in there 1v3 there's a guy on the right don't go in there oh my god they're about to get absolutely destroyed from that valve they didn't know the valve was like on the right hand side it's an absolutely wild i mean we can just leave that guy we don't have to send him back i stuck with this gun like i'm not gonna disrespect the spitfire again i'm actually really bad did he go somewhere else just hold this egg which i guess oh my gosh oh they got the mouth nice it was on yourself i think i heard of alcohol so i don't know if one of them valve will be oh nice there we go tremendous gg well played i was having fun kind of farming damage on these guys to be honest i still don't understand why they'd put themselves in a corner like they basically trapped themselves there why would they do such a thing they should have just taken center zone and what the heck is that emote never seen it before my entire life nice there we go
