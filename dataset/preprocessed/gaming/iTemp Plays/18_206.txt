hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing with janks and i found not one but two spitfires this game a gun that's been in the care package for quite a while now since the third of august so four months and remember when they put it into the care package they did buffet but not by much they increased the damage from 18 to 19 they increased the leg shot multiplier and gave it five more bullets but they also reduced the headshot multiplier by 12 and a half percent so it did more damage to the head when it was a regular floor weapon than it does in its current state as a care package weapon we are all doomed when this thing comes back as flawless thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends let me see one two three other teams coming here that's fine though i'm gonna land right here there's usually guns right on the ground should i land with

spot right here no oh i saw a nick marksman there yeah yeah that cave is guaranteed you're walking out with either three blues or three up to three purple oh god guaranteed it's absolutely insane this map is this map is kind of cool because i feel like there's a lot of there's a lot of spots that have guaranteed loot it's like it's like the the purple armor in the middle of barometer or the purple armor like if you go if we go like right here we're gonna probably rotate there anyways we rotate past our whole time you know the rope that goes up uh behind cascade falls yes yeah yeah right on my thing there's spider eggs underneath there's a bin underneath that can either be a blue or purple armor every time is it really i didn't know that that's such a secret place if you want a third party cascade there's six beans there threw up top three down low it's really good i didn't know about those guarantees though yeah it's pretty pretty sweet i tell you what mate if you land here you're guaranteed to get more to death by prowler that's also guaranteed yeah yes i didn't mean to do that dracon g7 spitfire here how'd you know may i have so many my uh r31 is pretty good if you want this i'm not gonna take it okay i'll rock it no please thanks i can't use my bullets on it thank you oh i'm running i'm running oh god you'll lift wait i'm almost ready hold on a second here hold on

you're so close to leveling up your armor boom oh yeah 100 it's less than 100 it's definitely worth it didn't take too long and you gained some stuff from me you know attachments and stuff yeah ha

window i'm just gonna stick them so sick that's perfect bless them they're crafting ammo that's so sad oh gold bag shotgun vault better two times optics yeah that's a few backside five now people always pass through this place though um horizon is purple on the left side uh blue valve bounce out the fight i hear like 150. he's backing up wait did they go oh devout did you horizon's on me i should probably bang me there nice job see he's got a devo where'd the valve go just left their team dude there's no shot if you ever do that to me we're never playing oh man that's crazy that's crazy there's no shot that fell i'm out i said when i said they're out the fight i didn't think they were gonna literally fly off to king's canyon mate i was looking around i'm like what is going on do they all just fly away no wonder they rage quit the horizon left right yeah i mean i would have left too 100 oh here we go they're trying to creep up oh no we should have stayed with the boys should we stay with the boys uh i have nine bats i am good i got four they call me the all nine of your bats oh yeah because i've got a spitfire and a pk so i've got two i've got one stack of ammo nine bats four med kits ten shields all that room could be made for for frank's steinar i mean i should i should i never think to pick them up i mean i do but i need to remind myself you know let me see if these guys have me so i can stick people through the window no throwables mr poopy butthole he's frying okay no throwables donnie damn a lot of people a lot of people just died yeah [Music] we didn't even have any gunshots so like i have no idea probably barometer gotta be right should we walk through the dog pen towards absolutely i gotta speed fire i'm not afraid to hit fire every single one of them you want a 10th battery oh yes please yes i got another even one stack so thank you i'm like staycation right now oh fragrance next to me let's go there's like three teams here rich okay i thought may's leaving i think okay can you make it to me i'll come back i'll come back i'll come back yeah yeah it was before i reload itself thank you these guys are all moving around nice job thank you there's still more in this yeah three of them i'm just going to armor herself off this guy trying to pop a bat right still behind us remember okay roger's one yeah him a little bit there the gun on the roof kill the mirage nice wait did they all just die there i i guess so that wraith is grabbing banners in the top okay yeah yeah he's looting his teammate oh mate i'll do it all the time nice one 1v1 it all fell apart here yeah it did it all it went down in the prowler dog park i feel like it always does holy because one team comes here has to spend eight minutes fighting the prowess that's so true where did my two times go do don't tell me where did my two times go where'd you put it is he still on the p you have to take it off what do you mean it was like it wasn't in the beat it wasn't in the compartments in it you had to take it off there didn't know that i'm so confused with what's what the process here what's going on oh my god i should i ran out of bullets on the other one kind of this has to be a solo right ah i don't know thank you in hindsight probably shouldn't just let that wraith grab the banners and robot yeah a couple more people would have been a bit more fun yeah it's all right though she was pretty i heard she was shooting you oh i found them oh nice on the way but i'm real far away oh what's your team i'm nowhere near mate i got the triple take they might just think it's you and i'm gonna pop out with the spitfire like that yeah dude that'll be good i'm gonna get the full they're really split oh my god wow kind of hard to get an angle on one like that she's crazy careful i don't want to get caught in this little place because if we go in there yeah i'm playing my back here i can't really get a shot on them cracked one that guy's really hurt yeah yeah do we rush now or what no we waited two hours way too long wait two months okay i'll crack that guy i'm going anywhere else why can't i hit that guy she went all the way left hey let me off i hit him for 120 right nice this is so ludicrous [Music] it used to be on the ground isn't that nice i know it was a it was a floor weapon that was a floor weapon yeah i played mate that had such a better position and it was missy mr spicy something was his name mr poopy butthole that's the one mate yep no it was infamous mr poopy butthole yeah right at the end no they're notorious i think they're going yeah on the police report anyways well that was a good game yeah wow you did a lot of damage mates a damn village that's a lot of damn blades that was a fun one i played
