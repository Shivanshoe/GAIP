thinking [Music] [Music] uh this one no this one two another scene hello hello that's kinda i feel kinda [Music] nice [Music] nice oh jinx [Music] [Music] this guy probably flew off oh my god has anybody ever done that i don't know [Music] i [Music] nice [Music] [Music] oh jax oh god [Music] oh that's a bad move amigo where would they be guys hello they must have heard of shooting the spiders too oh they're up here you hit him he was standing still i was kind of just trolling with him dude and that is why i don't pick up the crater because i can't land a shot and then i die and it ruins a good game you know how many games have been ruined by me attempting to use the kreber missing every shot getting rushed and dining many many games but i'll tell you what hasn't let me down recently playing watson i was watching some international scrims that the pro team's been doing you got teams from southeast asia and north america and europe probably australia as well joining in i think i've actually seen some teams playing watson and it made me want to play watson i uploaded a video with her a few days ago but it wasn't the focus but today it is i've actually been having a great time i've got a great game here for you as well i hope you enjoy thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm running trouble beans big triple bin angle here if anyone wants to binge with me i'm gonna be absolutely raging i didn't see any shadows i walked in p20 give me hammers give me hammers okay i'm on the way oh my god that wasn't my teammate of course he was in phase thank you round one another squad we're judging my shoes absolute shambles that's rocking amber one second just topping off my shields this way let's see enemies here there 20 people left being shut down are there 20 people left just topping off my shields oh my god good job standing like teammate i was playing a bit weird this fence kind of saved me from that break with the purple armor ring bunch of dead bodies here it's regent i'm happy though i've got a i've got a purple mag i'm sorry a gold mag and a purple bowl you call me you're much better off than that level three also i mean i'm gonna max out r9 max that pk pretty much apart from the hospital i'll fix here close range i mean i might as well take four who cares two times action let's stick with the pk oh man we survived yes i assume a lot of people were estates into the vehicle enemy compatibility taking damage i'm taking damage i am jumping out mercy he would have been in that we are fences hello i couldn't get over my own pylon yeah let him think he's gonna get it and then just kill him oh that wasn't my teammate's name i didn't mean to steal that nice workload it was horizon i feel like we would have heard her if she came like a little bit closer she must have gone this way i hiding underneath is she i have no idea where she went well she kind of has to go this way anyway i hear a big scrap i hear a human scrap care package over there yeah okay package with the fight was down here oh look it's us we're judging my shields the circuit is complete i want for about eight hundred that's what that fence is by the way i've absolutely no idea if they shoot that could be my teammates so i guess uh they're just gonna take that we need to go that way we are not alone look over here 11. that was the last one thank goodness oh my god i need to recharge my shields let's go there i have shield sphere i have shields less than 30 seconds rings nearby i assume she saw him she did beautiful no problem recharging my shield that's why he's just so good again get you out of those sticky situations was that two teams throwing us there i couldn't really work it out it still didn't angle so i assume it was oh tap strafing is so useful i'm not afraid to take this hill angle on them good news is a little bit of this is safe too so if we need to we can just come back down the hill just stretch and go around that way if it's too bad there used to be a balloon here we could have taken the balloon tower she's getting brave isn't she i've been down oh i should have sat my teammates nice oh my god if i just didn't kill that guy was that four damage oh my god if i just killed that guy i tried to do a flick shot with the pk if i just killed him my team wouldn't died i'm so bad at the pk though i'm so bad with the pk i know oh no i need to stop him shooting yeah this guy's pretty good so i'm just going to keep him at bay for a sec pretend i'm still there hopefully he doesn't see that i've left i didn't realize he's going to die that quick god just leaves okay if i start reviving there i just get rushed that's the thing like what does he want me to do the guy knows that you're down it's got my teammates redney which was actually my red i'm gonna pop cell so i keep some of the charge on this he got inside i get it he's going to get a bat off but i did a tiny bit of flesh damage i should have a little advantage here didn't even need you anyway teammate didn't need you anyway nice yeah kind of my fault he went down in the first place though and i guess like if i i could have started the revive on him he was out of like that guy's sideline but there's no way he lets me finish that revive there's not a chance you know i had to try and fight him off i had to put some damage down first i'm glad to push that out though 3000 damage three times the damage three times the kills you know
