hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today janks and i are testing the interaction between octane's buffed jump pad and the trident which is of course the vehicle on olympus now i never considered that it would make the trunk go higher like higher in the sky when you go across the jump pad but i'm almost certain that it does we flew through the air right into a huge scrap going on at solar array and i think this will be my new go-to tactic whenever we are playing octane on olympus so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh my god i messed up they beat me in there yeah i got him i got double scouts bro he's got an r9 i died i have to make it i'm coming to you in just a sec oh i'm good i'm good i'm good okay he messed up [Music] i shouldn't waste some more bullets on a dead body but he did try and punch me it's the most annoying thing i can't stand that looks like that's the worst [Music] level three oh what a tremendous fine janks thank you just for you my friend recharging shields oh they're up here okay i'm gonna shield cell on the way oh why they were running it was too bad and that kibby was running into a wall i guess he was lagging i don't know yeah i kind of have no idea he just kind of like stopped on the wall and i tried him and some on the floor by the box beautiful thank you all right let's head on out around actually i just got to see why is this so amusing do it again how are you so good at this i don't know i just i'm one with the drift right it's in tight space bam and then away you going you were the trident driver from here on out i'm like serious i don't know why this is so impressive to me but like it really is boy shots it's a little things dude that's all it is i wanted to hit that yo i'm gonna throw a pad down right here oh i messed it up hold on hold on hold on did i wait did i mess it up oh we'll go straight in i need to die jinx multiple teams random team down here they got purple what are they doing he could have shot me in the back in the middle there's a rev team in the middle okay well that was tremendous that might be the best thing i've ever been a part of fighting too what is going on let's go is he's on this door i think maybe yeah he's in the ring one up on you remember flash then saw that on the door again what is going on no they came out squats you can throw another heat shield down this one's black now i think nice oh my words that was great now that was fun that's what apex pledges yes it is exactly can i lose another baths oh man i have one i have one too that's okay we kill them and take theirs yes good news they use one i'm on the way i hit the horizon for 100 i'll stop me brother they're gonna be so upset with us i feel so bad for doing this that's not the way to go right there oh they're on the ramp oh no that guy's really hurt always down on the guy back crashing by the bear this guy's still looking at us there's two of them one on the right one on the left that decoy wait they pushed up they're running in here because oh one on the left what the heck oh my well this didn't go to plan at all and i'm stuck now i can't even take my gun out or anything mid-stem oh because you're steamed yeah uh actually the the team they were firing at is the solo of the first team he actually knocked one one of those or not i think he might be self-raising at least we get the kill ready now you ready for the biggest shoot you've ever seen i might die doing this this is a very very risky strategy and that's why pathfinder is always gonna be cool why pathfinder's always cool dude you just went flying when i walked out there was a storm shield on on his on his box so i don't know if it was oh really oh okay oh no he's right here he's right here let's go over here all right you ready you want a pad on them oh i've got the gold loots baby where'd you go come back i probably should have it to be honest i don't want to use it on you i just want to hold more stuff so you'll see it wait this team backed up they're not even pushing the team in here too let's explode this way take them down lock it up on your knot handstand i can't splash scan from either angle multiple blue tones on the roof is dead apparently [Music] that was sick i still had like two and a half seconds on it and it just instant finish it's great but with my graphs come back i wonder if that guy threw a nade he may have he'd turn around oh my god i've failed oh i'm so bad no no there's no horizon here i'm making a play i'm making a play i'm making a play right there with you there's another team here on this left side [Music] [Music] he's on white armor white armor bangalore the armor saw white inside the building [Music] go back by the way i guess i did need it i have a phoenix i've oh wait you gotta you don't even need it go back i'm an idiot am i talking late no one has energy uh i can drive you some energy um i might i'm gonna take the nine mates okay it's okay okay come on i'm so upset like i i've got such a good hearing when it comes to like you know real life hearing people yeah like i've got really good hearing i don't know but the fact that i didn't hear that bangalore on those yeah it's weird because she was so loud when she was on the ground before no medal then she just disappears from the game i heard firing this way okay i turned into triple tape man oh no oh yeah he's become what he's sworn back again is always bullying a ring flare opening rick flares yeah they're big flares no i got a naked wing man if uh you see wingman attachment i'll let you know i don't suppose there was uh oh no if we if we run past a crafter at any point i'll just stop oh yeah of course making contact with the enemy oh coming you're okay mate opening fire on the enemy they give you awesome in a 2v1 i think i might have heard someone inside the bunker with this all this promotion going off gibby's got no uh bubble okay six on gabe keeps cracked hundred friends butthole's also cracked i need some game thank you another team coming in on this bloodhound behind the bloodhound i have to try and pop a phoenix i might die the other team killed the bloodhound i got three seconds on this [Music] you're on revolt oh this guy named quick scope [Music] nice very nice good job good work i'll pop it back i know i heard that guy blasting and thought you'd be happy he did the crafting for me wonderful then i'm wiping that just in case you were interested i mean it's a good pain nonetheless yeah just let you know must go faster it's kind of fun it's really good it's like a jack of all trades yeah it says use it at range use it like a shotgun you can kind of use it everywhere it's awesome i'm glad they made it so like the precision choke is like automatic yeah it's not grounds you know it's kind of weird you know how they they did that with the precision choke right yeah get rid of it because they made it so it was like well the only gun in the game that uses it is target spot triple take right yeah but then they added but then they added quick draw yeah i don't know why you do that it's like quick draw is literally the same thing as the picho you just did it's the exact same thing it feels useless i remember the last time i used a quick draw uh first week to make video i didn't make a video on it you really you didn't no understandable i would have if he was new to the game like but i do i did other videos and i was late on it so six nine that's right twenty-one [Music] opening near us which team do we want to fight bridge the age old question i think we should go to these guys okay i mean oh wait i'm getting pushed they all have to come down yeah they all have to come down true but you know i'm impatient ow i'm coming to you let's go on the roof i'm gonna try and get this way and as far as these guys in the back or something okay just so we don't get third no no down the hill okay their angle's too good i could just walk up on him both teams both teams are running away one team just went on foot and this team's trying to rope away really bad he's really really weak and i don't have my ultimate just yet i'm pushing i jumped off it oh yeah that guy could see me too if he should be weak big save janks i saw it through i'll do another heat shield okay i'll go grab two more i was gonna take one of their armors i can use my last bat uh one's empty this one's full and they're bad they have lots of bags oh actually yeah good job i i do know the guy on the left could see me and as soon as i got there he finishes back i mean yeah oh right my time was a bit off that's all giving my shields behind that box i nice job janks bro that was a sick game again i was so that was fun oh good work mate dude that play that that i'm getting used to the storm shield yes yeah that was close that was literally a photo finish i think one more storm tick i died oh my god dude we both popped off because i have within 15 damage nice mate
