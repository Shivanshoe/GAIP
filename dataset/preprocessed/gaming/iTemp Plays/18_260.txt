hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some gibby the big gibber gibraltar of course the man who does it all i'm going to start playing gb if i find myself having a rough session on apex because he just has so many benefits in his kit not only to his own game but for the whole squadron as well and he's also amazing on olympus which we are playing today because of the amount of third parties on this map and he has great disengage and him for quick resets oh and you can also run away whilst being shot up without being slowed down the guy has about 12 passives so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends mate what do you tell me how much your master let's do this brothers oh i wasn't paying attention is that two people coming this way just to the boys i just smacked my head on this i'm now with you yeah you got another 99 and get a gun so i'm okay i'm okay i'm okay i hope it wishes me i'm getting pushed by this whole team now i'm coming to you come here the heck are they demo she's awake looks like we're in the next ring good nice job hp pretty sure there's another team here there who were they braced and away from so i mean there's a team that i don't know if that was the team that was like pushing me maybe they were just trying to run from fights too i don't know um if you see a fault let me know r301 here what they do i have a level three mag four one oh yes are you doing a vault thing you're doing a gippy thing i like the vault i've dropped a flat one by the way what's going on where was that i think it's like the drop down part down here yeah it's not here anymore it's this one do you need a bat i have two i have one oh no he was [Music] when i'm dropping you want me to jump off the map or something or i'm not opposed to that i want to do by accident who knows you see an extra two time i will take it oh i saw something over there i think it's a respawn shape was it in the patch notes that oh you see something oh there you go why it's actually invincib uh invisible now too apparently i didn't i hear a car come in my eyes in the sky wait my thing is stuck you impede inviting i love these things all right someone's in here let's go here if they're up top or inside or what what's up yeah nice nice job now the team might come down thanks mate sorry i tried to fall back i didn't realize i was so far away from the edge oh good we're good we're live we're alive i'm doing my best to throw though so far i knew he did it that's always next there's always next gunfight made don't don't these guys don't even push they're killing up there they know we have to pull this i just i made the call stick to the top i mean i'm i have my alt so we can um let's go to the rope and then let's take it let's take it uh caviar i can probably bubble on top of that too right that works i think uh actually this isn't i don't think that's gonna work ah they're gonna famous i'll just empty them from here just be ready i don't know if you've reached they've caught these cause trap a oh no that's unfortunate hold that one come one i got it i'll play safety i'm trying to place everybody else in my head i'm trying to go there's still gas up here he's one this one is one the arm is switched twice did okay did you hear shots like this way yeah just getting a little bit loose keys oh they're down live they're both flash that guy's flash too there's no way my ultimate doesn't hit one of those i'm down here in this building someone's still down here right yeah oh no the valkyrie the battery flipped up she's not talking she hasn't even oh yeah i'm not here oh i have to reload too i got it off the bat yeah hold on uh blood down to the left and then docker is up top they're reviving someone's reviving she's raising the pathfinder back here right here oh i hit loads this guy's gonna try and raise back here oh forgot about the valk oh he's speaking yeah she's still up there i'm gonna push uh i'm gonna just crack nice that was the last one another kills finder right right here i broke that one up i hit 45 flesh man i can't peak that easy at all we just go back left i think we do go back this way the octane will be by himself the bloodhound is far so we could just we just take the rope now okay yeah that's fine yeah they're fighting now might be the valkyrie right octane right here on the edge of this and then somebody in that small yep that small building a small room want to kill credit he literally just jumped up i'm gonna give you your crypto and your you've got the gold bag but it's absolutely the right place yeah it's it's it's it's working it's coming in handy and always oh we need to go this way we're gonna die there's a literal rope over your massive fat head you see that whoa how does he get that much velocity being uh behind you in fights is probably the smart thing to do but it is the worst experience ever because you are just it takes up my entire screen yeah yeah it does your kill leader right uh yes okay elf kills oh no i was i i don't want to say 11 and then be like way off so i just didn't know that he didn't know that i mean i was guessing it was an educated guess why are you on 10 but i'm killed or something uh no i'm on seven oh okay how many uh revives that at least ten uh yeah that's about that's about five thousand pounds right there yeah that's it oh come on guys what are we doing if he dies oh here i don't know how the pathfinder is ready i don't know what he's just done so i saw that he could have just looted our kills maybe he just stood still on the weird i could have yeah i think he's controller looting dude they're going around this side i'm just getting pm i'm nowhere near you to follow up but i guess if you want your damage yep yep i swallow damage i care nothing about tactical engagements yes nice do you hunger for that what did he go down he died in his own okay how do what's going on what's going on i'm tempted to leave i'm tempted to leave mate i'm tempted to leave he tell me this guy doesn't have bubble oh my god that doesn't feel good what's that those are usually the teams that survive to the end that's true they probably didn't find anyone yeah i guarantee they looted like a set of our kills over there by the fountain and then we were like we couldn't find it for ages that's the thing they're going to survive we actually had like a really fun mid game with a lot of action so yeah fighting like the that low ground of the phone was fun a good time okay i thought it was three revived that's not that bad ah that's really bad honestly that's so bad i mean next time i need to go back down twice give me the gold bag next time and you know
