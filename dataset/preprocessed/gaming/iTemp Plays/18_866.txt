hey we supposed to treat welcome back to another video today we are playing some modern warfare of course and I have a pretty special gameplay for you today or at least is special for me if you watch for the people a blurred modern warfare I'm sure you've seen a fair share of nukes I've even uploaded one of my Knicks although it doesn't doesn't really count I don't under our dunk County as a nuke because if you watch the video if well if you missed it you didn't miss much let's put it that way because all I did will see in a window with n m4 and claymores and I've got 30 kills somehow I didn't even get to pull the new king it was that bad because someone sang a tank on a hill man should get a nuke as well so that's always good so when I was recording these streaks what I tend to do is I play I always always record because I cannot stand the idea of something incredible happening and me not having any way to record it apart from like the ps4 record backbone but you can't trust that you know so the side of the street I wasn't really talking too much so that's why I'm doing this little intro over the start the streak and then a little bit into it I start to realize okay this could turn into something and then I start talking again so hopefully injury if you do be sure to leave like rating subscribe to join the art Empire and I'll see you now I'll see you now with the pump with a live calm nurse that's always fun count tiv2 ruin my day it wasn't yeah check your fire friend I mean you speak me too but you don't see me shooting you up one off my chopper gunner if I can get my streaks I'll be a happy man it's maybe a little bit of a better long-range option than the mp7 is surprisingly given a long-range nur like a medium to long range very not as good as an aka see lucky see nuts one of the old gunship name you literally just standing there friend fandom of literally about say nine taxon shot game Etha anymore and non-existent I was gonna say where are they sound the torrents and thief yes very nice going on here who is this man I team huh flip that spawn feature on grandma that's to scale with the case UAV it's 20 oh man to kill how did you get a fair how did you get up there I was up there for to half an hour as a 22 green streak well the good news is well I got good and bad news the bad news is I could have got nuked there if I was using an adventure IV well the good news is I'm not using advanced UV and I've got a gunship and a chopper gun is calling he says what are you getting us this is it listen if you just let me get my new give it a ring quick and painless the game would have been over but now you've got to respawn back into this ac-130 and that is your punishment for not letting me get my new I'm pretty sure there's a 20 to win streak I'm telling you find advanced UAV there or even specialist the teammates like French guys probably should that's what II wonder what the heck's going on even specially say if because you get high alert I would've known that song was a Natalie I could have reacted or something so I don't do super streak I'm happy be Flygon on your palace here is my favorite flag to play around on any of the grammar maps you see it's not over our 41 kills two captures and it's not over yet your boys got chocolate - well thirst was absolutely dominant hopefully this is more the same here so what's your name somewhere and someone going these delis I can't business yet that may have been the single worst chopper gunner performance I've ever had I don't think I've ever done anything worse night in my entire life I didn't get to use the Rockets or anything shot down may as well just call this in games pretty much done there's only 12 points left anyway as a shop as the chopper gunner you do not care if I die because the streaks over anyway all right this better be better than the first tropical I had it's already been got ourselves a kill we've already broken our record here from this Harbor can shoot down again this is the thing people don't even bother to shoot down the ice 1:30 back in mw2 that's why you use days 1:30 it was harder to shoot down it was like tiny and ascribes hard to see it was scarier than a chopper gunner son about guys 4/3 just no timid 1861 kill 6100 score and 5 captures and a 22 green streak these know game that see you nerds I'm not hopping back another absolute deathtrap specialist bonus guide oh my who's aiming at me you I must be at the top of top my team I throw in here now somehow let me beat on now guess they're not in here then it's the new gun isn't it the RAM seven [Applause] [Music] my team is gonna keep spawn on me but I'm trying to be like them I tried be a lone ranger here makes it so much easier to hear footsteps and stuff if you're the only team around it's tight this is I mean there's a lot of attention on this now I want to try and move if I can friend 17 I really want to get out of here someone above it's what spawn again go getting friends get their revenge kill I can see your dragon off why just risk it this is the worst part honestly that's the scariest thing about playing this math game between buildings and so could this Ram 70s I picked it up before and it was alright teammate you can okay this is good they're gonna think that that's me still and I'm going flat stop it stop it I'm in a horrendous position here so I'm as honest up and shoots it's 25 only three kills and this is cured this building this is their spawn they own a flight so some stragglers might spawn here [Music] no I got a plus 100 assist what does Aiden mean I thought it'd kill was purse hundred oh we did it thank God I've seen Isis Australia's once see in this this very building organic I'll tell you only sane it for two or three girls it's good enough Australia it's been the firm for me I'll tell you and we're still winning the game 140 points we got a saw trapped in great was he just one I'm trying to get a bit of a gun Street because my height this is my High Street now before they see was just 30 he got back in thanks French it's a long shot - OH team that did not look good Shaw arrestees he's definitely still aiming at the window I'd literally shot I don't even care I got myself a nuke 33 it's been than 30 mark that's my new longest win streak so nothing happened for the rest of this game I definitely had enough time to go for another one but notes are pretty difficult to get like 30 kills is an outrageous amount of gun kills I miss the mark days where you could do specialist there's 24 kills because you'd always get hardline for the 25 kill mark so days on modern warfare you've got one you've got to deal with the matchmaking and two you've got to deal with the 30 gun kills yes my favorite thing that came from this nuke is that I've got a message from someone on the other team and he had the inspirational message of camper nuke haha noob which he's I just thought was tremendous to be fair it's a tremendous message to receive what makes this message even funnier is that the guy himself was streaming and when I went to check the past broadcast of how he was playing and to find out if I killed him or not it turns out that the first thing he did when he joined the game was chopper a pilot pilot a chopper even one of a team / - I was born and then spent the entire game on a rooftop looking into a spawn with a sniper whilst losing so who is the camper nuke haha noob now friend it is not me that's for sure I'm dare you don't you say that to me yes thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one
