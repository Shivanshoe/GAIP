hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today so far and i are attempting a ludicrous challenge which started off with us seeing that there was a mozambique in the crafting beacon and at that moment we decided to craft four of them with hammer points if we could afford it and try to win again it is a crazy challenge i hope you enjoyed watching it and if you are new around here please be sure to subscribe as the i tempire is getting closer and closer to one million members so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends no i how close are you i i'm sad i crafted a mobile respawn beacon no i found a level two shotgun ball all right too bad i'm really sad how much did i just waste dude i just wasted so much how much how much was this i need to look at how much it was 35 on me i think something like that i just raced it i wasted 50. i wasted 50 on this and i don't even want it take it or i'll take it god i'll hold it i'm sad dude oh there's armor here what am i doing i've been running no armor at 14 shields so if you need those he has the same one right on me mate oh my god i did the opposite of what i said i was going to do what did you say i led him with my hammer point one cracked him and then switched the one without hammer points the complete opposite wasted time that was from me i mean i mean i missed anyway to be honest sir i mean we we are doing like a little challenge that involves crafting and even we're like no yeah what are you doing unless for a shotgun but even then like we're gonna find it oh no i can't even shoot at him oh god no of course they definitely well hopefully they've seen this and they just brush this yeah that's i'm gonna pretend i'm in a fight they are there broke one 36 oh my god how did i miss the first shot nice that's your friend friend no shotgun ammo unfortunately we're definitely two of them yeah i have no extra ammo i have there you go you um do you need a bat um obviously i have one thanks he's a low shield has to be low broken 72 uh 30 hp hey don't believe you've got both those kills no that's perfect it's it's such a struggle we both have to just go all in one of his eyes i know there's no time for that nuance it's like oh you got on week i'm just gonna i don't know we got four mozambs is he part of a group call the toilet man the toilet is they're in here oh no he's got an auto that's not fun i like how he sees you with the mozambique and then he runs off they're just chilling up top i can pop my ultimate dang yeah that might work where's the middle check on that that'll cover everything yeah yeah i think i can't really go outside but what's on the door one's right on the door have a night loving a knight on it basically i i have to pull out my problem yeah i have no ammo i have zero and one i think he's trying to pull him he's just running he's just faced away he's getting shot from the other side i have five bullets but they're the only ones in my guns yeah i have no shotgun at all that i don't got i don't know there's one right here one right here i'll crack those guys across the waist they won't push it's not working i'm gonna check this uh this box real quick i'm checking every there oh my god are you kidding me i have four rounds in one mozam brings close i have nothing to help you let's go any shotguns any shotguns dude nope not in here all right i'm switching oh dude this sucks no chuck this one up as well yeah we tried we'd have to revisit the challenge yeah next one i couldn't hear i didn't have a chance to hear the footsteps wait i'll go ahead and go back for you oh god almost just dropped i got it thank you energy i'm not even helping oh i'm trying to no come on yes if you lost that there was a very high chance of me losing as well i was one hp oh really i was just punching i had to punch him three times that was so difficult it's hard to find like enough ammo and just just anything we still have 16 kills it's such a short game 13 minutes all right let me get my double moments yeah let me get these other two little things 25 and then another 25 oh 75. it's 45 for a mozam and the hammer point okay oh no it's not the hamboy's 40. the shotgun bolt is it's gonna be a rough one this is gonna be so difficult me okay it's most important to get two guns at least you can fire two we're gonna have to go to another crafting thing there's one there's one at fragment we'll just turn up like no time to stay over there oh i really need that little crafting's out of them see i decided to craft a shotgun boat okay they're i i think they see i think they're going wait so can i use my hemlock or no are you i'm scared um no oh god hold on i need to craft mine then i have a i have a bubble just in case just to make it so they can't push it i mean i'm in it i've been shredded mate why does he shoot you and not me fine fine yep fact nice i'm not gonna lie i use my i i did use my hemlock efforts i thought i had my verdict the fact that he shot you and not me when i was in the replicator is kind of crazy a little confused tell you what plane gives kind of a good idea though because the bubble makes it so they they keep it close yeah oh yeah the 80s was kind of useful yeah um how much was the how much was the ball the ball is 25. i can craft you a bolt right now let me craft your ball uh i can craft one ball let me see let me see hold on i got one guy i want i've got one in the oven for you it's cooking up okay all right guys actually run into another team doing the exact same thing it'll be the greatest battle of all time i ate mozambique's one dream oh we need to figure out a way to do that where we can get like another duo in the same game as us and then we both last for the last two teams that's the most yeah just eight mozambique battle might we just have to get in there i think they just killed me literally right in their face i'm going down below yeah i think i don't i have some oh this dude you need a gold gold armor right here uh i'm good i'm good they're right honest i'm with you i'm with you i'm scared what am i doing with you they just gotta come over here thank you thank you there only they knew we just had mozambs they would be running over right now i don't know it's kind of scary i'm a little bit intimidated i think they heard oh they're off don't do this item for i hit him for 68 with two shots what you should be sexually insane i mean we can we have to like this is the only way we wouldn't be the team behind i'm loving my bubble i don't know why i've just done it they ran oh my god was that their smoke i saw smoke behind i thought they were getting rushed in the back are you kidding that was then they just inked and ran with the what dude i shot him twice with the mozambique and he turns around and just runs that's great he's on he's up top but
