hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are mixing it up today with some lifeline and i haven't really been interested in playing lifeline since her rework it was months ago now but she's actually so much fun to play because it is easy to be useful for your team and i know i say this a lot i've done it with mirage i've done it with caustic and pretty much every legend on the game but i am coming out of the mini lifeline mate and the next few gameplays on the channel will be with her as well because she's just too good in those 3v3 fights you give her a gold bag and as long as you stay alive you're going to win that 3v3 because it's more it's more like a 5v3 than anything with how often you can bring your teammates back so much fun to play i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends felt like they were like we we hurt them a lot charge rifle mozambique no good no armor from you boy i don't think it was here at least they're not close nice we get a little bit of loot then i'm lagging really bad too here's your

three though i saw that i like jumped and stuck jump and stuck the caustic through the window that was safe until we both made a cool window play did you see what i did no i didn't i did what you do oh my god i jumped uh i climbed the side of the wall so i could look through the window and i jumped off the wall i did a wall jump off the wall and i shot her through the window oh nice logo yes nice nice nice ready for my for a night stick looting once more the gas fellas i'm sorry are you okay cracks on race if i couldn't [ __ ] start the race if you just keep keep pushing i'm gonna keep crying yeah this is not that smart i'm there yeah thank you you want sex popping the shield cell i'm good yeah thank you drop back they drop back oh nice yeah you're good you're good we're gonna get pushed in the back for sure phoenix really low they're gonna heat up they're going to rez though i got one i'm just going to be standing for the next half now i'm afraid i should kill him nice job nice nice i just sprayed the devon did like 400 damage nice what are they fighting were they fighting where we were just out yeah but we landed when we get to like loot a little bit right at the start even for like a minute oh god if you can i'm lifelong remember so i kind of i'm so sorry it's good i thought they were down low same there is a team down low that's a new that's another team literally just grappled on this team's forehead dude he's broken no shield i'm really low man i hate the two times there they have yeah one feeling right here i'm gonna go out the door towards you [Music] hey those weren't the two teams fighting i'm very that was a completely different team to the two teams that were fighting deep north so there might still be another team sorry i meant to ping the evo oh my god my shield situation i have to drive my devo i have no energy yeah i have um 58 oh you're good you're good i'm gonna pick up this massive actually it's probably not gonna serve me well but i'm gonna do it there's a loot box right right down low here as well my god did you have a thousand shields i had so many i had so many and i've got three bats if you need any um i do have i have zero let me check this box though that team i wonder where that team was they must have rotated into labs or something did you guys hear anybody come out of that i couldn't really hear anything i don't think so i have no clue when i when i first when you first grappled into that one team i scanned and then there was a team low ground too so there was a full team low ground and then there was a team that you fought oh looking at ganks that's so confusing i'm still here with you just in case thank you that's that was so unfortunate dude i can't believe i hit the grab to go up there i'm like yeah i'm just gonna i have to scout with it three times and i'm like i'm just gonna sit above and just poke them from above nope actually it did not happen that was a huge clutch isn't this hitting that bloodhound's so good even though i couldn't do no i could literally do nothing i was just scanning that's oh the hands like unreal i could do nothing at all just healing slow healing and evo shield a full level ebola shield oh they're they're resting right on me i'm i gotta lose here fellas no you're good you're good again i'm gonna scan and see how much there are oh i downed him but he got in the portal ripped yeah they took the portal they're gonna they're gonna run i can see the pool still yeah they're over here this building oh i think he has a crate right about cracks on the right nice dude there's a lifeline he's in a rest i want to use my uncle i'm gonna try and thirst there's a creeper oh i'm so bad i will happily take it oh you are his shots right in the distance that way they're going to come back for that guy's banner guaranteed because they're like they're their names they're running towards uh artillery i am close no shield splash uh the other one's right at the zip line the other side he's trapped in there poor guy that's the worst place to go buddy i hear shots like uh west all right i have to loot bro y'all you could do all those other bodies i got very very minimal here what do you need what do you need do you guys have bats or med kids i have a limit um there's a med kick kick phoenix right here and i can drop you a few sh and there's two shield cells as well i got like i got snails like 9 you know million always got a few moments i think they're up top i think they're the diamondball dweebs i have all two i don't believe that they're at it again oh [Applause] big first name oh that wasn't an enemy i was just looking at him i apparently had a two-time sight on my mastiff that doesn't sound fun dear lord that almost went awful got a gold triple tech for you mate i know you're a big fan oh no that's literally the best gun in the game i can't see them i don't put them anywhere they means full are they fine they're over there they just opened a care package over there i thought i heard bullets i heard people fighting uh they were shooting at each other but like really long range i think they all had snipers they are on that care package though you hear that there's a care package coming down by the way this is definitely not the play i'm running a crater and a massive so it's like broken oh oh man we all just cranked the finisher for the culture that was awesome did we really all just do that not one person said a thing we all just picked the guy for it that's great dude i had okay i'm gonna be completely honest i thought that was the last team and that's the only reason i did that oh no diving board sweep strike again pete i dare you i have a craver and i'm not a bridge oh if you run that nice oh get up there people go go go oh you're taking all the damage oh i can't even get up there from that angle oh is very killable if you see him i downed one mirage is on me oh god right cracked that's another squad is he oh god i'm jumping off then there's no way they chase please nice right here where's the last one at you know you have to be around you somewhere oh come here buddy oh he's just walking oh bless him nice i was basically running double shotgun i was using the crater as a shotgun like that that was kind of sweet not gonna lie nice nice you are the apex champions good job fellas 47 let's go pretty nice
