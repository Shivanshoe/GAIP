hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing another staple of the apex legends meta a legend who will never go out of style bloodhound the scans are just way too powerful and if you can handle the field of view change and the speed boost their ultimate is a menace as well i have two great games for you here today i'm sure you will enjoy them both thank you for watching i'll see you only five and a half seconds me amigos what is this audio he's being dragged away i know what i'm called blue cracked i have to reload i'm detected got a shield back here kind of scaring me oh no please i only have a triple take you're good wow i hate people west oh well here waiting thinking she was one but she's really weak now but she might have 16. nice hopefully fish out some heavy definitely quicker god cracked nice i'm like dude this this alt is so bad oh my god killed that joker i wasn't just nobody speaking want jobs is two solos i have phoenix for you thank you thank you okay oh canceled wow yeah new team new team i think yeah careful kev kevin do we hide behind these shields for a sec yeah i have barely any heavy by the way 911 name it's like your catchphrase you stupidit it's gonna be your catchphrase how do we get our teammate back this way oh no this close one here repairing wait four squads left oh my god you have a mobile come on i'll get one of those there's four squads left look at it look at the look at the zone oh yeah it's such a good start emphasis episode's on the start 50 people died before the gas reached any part of the map you could walk on 50 people used to live here that's a ghost turn no i'm not okay with that no the start was fine the stop play card again the start was fine the star was okay i don't agree with that one no i think the most people wouldn't either no the start was fine but you have to try to know that you're about it you know [Laughter] how do you know you've bought it before you've tried it and that's i tried it i'm bad it's true that's true nothing i can do about it all of them are good but yeah that one wasn't good i agree i don't agree with that no let me know if you you need your pk back i have no ammo yeah i i have no heavy so i had to pick up his pk it's the biggest choke point ever apart from when this place where i am at the moment you have a big tower on it that was the worst there's literally a team landslide yes we could have rotated the safer way but i'm coming for a way what is going on yeah once when have we ever played the saber i want to win wait i don't know what's happening oh my god they've and the call stake possible today uh there's still another team coming in so they might be here soon yep i'm back i could see them reviving in this in the smoke because i'm blown down let's go baby nice well look behind us because i was getting bored and arrowed and i don't think it was by that team the ring isn't far there oh that way 140 on these jobs two of them are broken i got the fees i've just i'm stealing everything i'm seeing it all starting my life just stealing my life straight up yoinking baby let's go confirm what's going uh man oh hey thermite taking damage friends come on this is my kill this is my kill still nah man that's cheating ah yes i just looked at the loot and then picked up everything anyway so including many things i didn't need i don't know why i took a second to look for like why did i do that why did i even pretend to care just take it all through this you got purple that's your purple thank you i'm so bad no you know it's all right both of those guys weak nope very bad i know what you're trying to do but it's bad why what do you mean what we're trying to do how much damage do you do that you feel better you're trying to make me feel better but it's bad like it's really bad the guy looked nice oh nelly what i do not have enough mousepad space for this it's like that that's why that's my mate oh my god i i just tabbed out of the whole game okay that's one of the buttons on your keyboard yeah i don't know what i pressed this guy's standing on a wall i've never seen a strategy oh my god he's so good i cracked him i'm i'm enjoying looting on massive people yeah well he will stand on this wall and destroy you oh my god he is the best oh no he's crazy the guy's crazy did you see him sound on the wall i'm so mind blown this is your one chance to drop a 20 on my head you or you're only gonna have one opportunity so are you no i had that crypto game remember that that was my other opportunity nope is there any opportunity are you taking advantage of it yes or no i'm trying i'm popping off i've 18. damage actually high five lobby's dead i'm not going to go for 20 minutes i care about my 3k badge that's what i care about i don't care about it so i don't get him but if i did get one you know i'd care about yeah they'd be great you know oh my movement's just so bad my apex is like so difficult keyboard i swear the movement is so difficult it feels like i'm not running forwards when i hold the view i don't know how to explain it i feel so slow yeah it feels super clunky i feel like everybody's just moving at like a lightning fast speed i'm really bad at the grapple why am i using path that's actually really tough this guy's landed on the look where are these bad boys careful here oh my god are they on the top they're all on me it's literally like five people on me my dude the spot oh what the heck i thought he was there wait he respawned you oh wait he oh wait i did not know i hear someone's kind of close don't worry it's huge on our teammate thank you [Music] come here oh my god they're both just hiding in corners like what are they doing i i thought that was one i dropped down and they're all just in corners oh my gosh it's just hiding in different corners right there this has been such a weird game i feel like i said that loads but this definitely has yeah i mean me playing on my keyboard as i help oh yeah that's true i feel like that that's be fun one minute remains oh my god i mean i don't think you have time because you're gonna have to go all the way around that's a long run yeah you can run it in they're not aggressive i don't i don't i don't even know if it's a whole team yes two i had two members i'm not on the scan i'm gonna run through the tournament they're still over there idiots i'm gonna run over this favor respawn you guys but they just oh my god that's so so good they heard me call them idiots oh my god i think one might be an octane then get closer i'm just gonna pop him yeah i think he'll probably he's probably trying to chase faster there's no way i can respawn you here i mean you could use it as bait if you want to try right time yeah it's up to you though you might not have time if they get too close i can always play like playback you can all die should i go high ground or i could pop my horse and just respawn you there oh yeah that works too there's all you they they think i'm old oh i can't respond you here i guess i'm gonna have to right you have your shields no oh my god are they chasing are they close yes come on guys you won't evolve that's all oh you got this easy oh that's easy don't lose those you underestimate me you do not lose nice you're gonna trust me again just begin i've i i often lose those very often actually very often you're going to hit the respawn in the respawn right now noise
