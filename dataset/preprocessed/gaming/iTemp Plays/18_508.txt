hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going to be using the eva 8 shotgun and octane combination which is the combo of dreams the ev8 received a small fire rate buff in season 8 and i think it out damages the mastiff in a straight up 1v1 the mastiff is still better uh in those peak battles where they can peak behind a door or a piece of cover fire that one shot and peek back into cover with the either eight shotgun he's a powerhouse this season and you guys should definitely try it again i have found a lot of success with this weapon i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching please subscribe if you're new to the channel as i'm trying to reach 1 million subs in season 8 of apex and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends absolutely not i literally think there's somebody coming here which is the worst i do good we'll kill him he's gonna get he has he already
