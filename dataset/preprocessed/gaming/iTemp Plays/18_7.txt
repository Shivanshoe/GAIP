hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back in ranked which is a divisive topic in the community at the moment after all of the changes they made to it in season 13. now i think playing solo rant at the moment is just going to be too stressful for me because you can have so many kills but if you finish outside the top 10 squads you can still lose rp even in gold lobbies and with teammates making some questionable decisions i think it's a good thing that i'd only play with the pre-made squad now the best thing about ranked for me is the end games with teams all fighting for the best spot you need the best tactics you need to make a plan with your squad mates and that happens more often now that everyone is playing for placement now kills obviously should be rewarded and they've done that because you can get as much rp as you want if you get a load of kills as well but placement also matters massively in a br game what do you guys think about the change this splits i would love to know so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends we got three dudes that have played a combined four hours of apex in the last two weeks do you have two long ones yeah but i usually use uh the long thumbstick on the left anyway i don't know why what i don't know why oh this is weird yeah i'm a beautiful listen what is the purpose for that i think it was just i did it once and i forgot to change it and then it just sort of stuck okay okay if that's a lot is that allowed guys or what are we gonna really kill me well i mean i'm particularly a little bit over it not a lot though just a little bit well you are not getting this pk wait wait who rich where are you i don't know where even i nearly i nearly grappled to the middle of the map thinking we're not going to get any kills in this game the second he gets res and he gets up he just starts doing nonsense yeah this is on the ground i'm a genius you're making all the plays oh this is going to go terrible but there's no one left there's no one left [Music] oh they're all up i hit two shots don't die i'm done valkyrie is moving up she's the right side yeah oh i'm dead it's broken broken the race is cracked asher's nearly cracked i just won i just literally won dude i hit it for 81 flash she made it inside i think i should go i'm gonna go to the other side for 81 flash she's got to be in here i've seen about he's on me what do you mean valkyrie's on you i thought we got two yeah she's she's down she's down but like the bodies on me you know oh yeah so she probably dropped and she's uh probably trying to raise her but she's somewhere in here i don't know where all right well i'm gonna heal up if we know where the banners are we can just sit on them i'm just up here killed an enemy we've got a care pack landing right literally wasn't masters back then okay so you're you don't even know what you're talking about why you're not in this conversation this conversation is directed towards jinx i watched masters back then that's true i guess you can't have it you can't have any right on me there's no way she got that i don't think um they're gonna try them they're gonna try and pick her up only one respawn and it's a valk honestly i think she got a there's a zoomy yeah that's them they drive away yeah they drove away ah i farmed uh 90 damage on him i'm crafting what do you guys think of my maggie skin and be honest i don't want no line that is horrendous goodbye what did you just say that he's real bad okay what do you think of my maggie skin i mean that might be the worst thing i've ever seen in my life well i hate both of you so much that is really bad you're supposed to gas your boys oh that's bad nice your real boys are real with you [Music] i was debating about griefing it i threw my i threw my attack on it trying to get damage on them but then i didn't shoot it i shot the player and said i should have griefed the lobe well now they just got better loot for us when we kill him shut up cannot be what cannot be worth it on this gun there's no way ah they're not take them off i know janks disagrees i love me the shatters there's no way they're so bad good yeah i don't know they're just sitting on this roof like where we were before yeah they're two on the right side i mean let me let me try and walk up soon i'm gonna put some damaging for you i need jaw shell it doesn't exist i don't think i'm gonna be able to get an angle from here they're following me recharging i can't really get an angle from here on the left too they're split yeah they're split one's low ground i think yeah one dropped i can rub zip top so far horizon shield isn't huge i'm climbing up jinx did they drop oh there's one right here another team that team are fine they're shooting them in the back perfect they're in the bubble right right can we finish that it's just i saw a guy in this window at one point i might say this online instead of the pk jenks if you need a shotgun volt pk i'm good thank you [Music] yeah you good yeah 90 on valkyrie yeah this team is uh they're walking behind us they're going to try and do the same exactly yeah okay he's here grabs you cannon [Applause] right on the other side of this building they can walk up or take the rope they have an octane i think 85 on the valk just just here what about me you're on the opposite side no i'm here i'll start yelling at you then i'm sorry no you made the right choice is this is this cover like is that cover on the ground or is it in the air not really there's a there's a lot of spots underneath that we can't that we can't uh if we can't play this is hard because we don't have a gibby i think we try to play yeah we can play the stairs we might the stairs might be safe right there i think we go now yeah i'm done i'm going now i am taking fire i got shot so i did slid let's be angry yeah i think there's a soul over here somewhere there's no i think there's still a still team under that's going to come behind us yeah there's a bathroom top oh yeah yeah we need to we need to play we need  on the bash she's got a purple milk thing i'm going to draw i need a med is there a med down there there will be yeah yeah good work i got to be done nice work i'm switching to an all three give me a sec i'm gonna go down and grab some extra shields don't go no we're not down but like down here okay oh about that electric shield big mirage over there oh they can't climb back up all year round i like that yeah my shields are recharged that's what i like about you rich you just take the initiation there's no one yeah i don't know where they are where they are i don't know we got the best ones on though we just try not to take damage and they're gonna have to walk into us okay i don't know if this is what the team is they must be like right underneath us or something she's scraper all right under there i'm dropping i'm dropping a left now i just said sorry i sort of left you for dustin that was unlucky yeah that's actually crazy that we lost that kind of it's that's kind of embarrassing we got two teams fishing okay i'm leading right here okay so i think one team oh my gosh they're here dude what just happened she's one hp back here okay i i don't even understand how i died there she ran away yeah yeah i wanna pull take this one there's a there's one outside thank you i don't know what just happened eyes are open though all right i'm gonna go look

backpack here level two nice so when octave didn't die there though i think could be another option i think you killed the octave no did you not kill it that was a bloodhound idea was it who's this guy oh there's another movie unless the bloodhound maybe killed nothing is this an octane no that's another one i don't know they respawned north that's probably him i broke yeah i said it because they're probably gonna hop in the car starting to get closer there's another respawn look renee is he's in this room cracks cracks cracks practically they're split they're in different buildings yeah here goes here goes in here back on the roof yeah one's on the roof it's it's the balcony is so i don't know if that's i think you can on the outside but i don't think that i think the buck fall away no i think so they're flying away they're all leaving they're all leaving oh there's another respawn where they're going i don't have any bats i have one we can go back and craft i don't see anybody oh i do they're up top they go down i don't know i i don't see him i'm pretty sure they went right they had to have gone right yeah you just went left yeah they had to have gone down oh god yeah i see i destroyed the level that helps anyone there's a purple swap on me hard any cracks nice good job new team right oh no no that was them let's do that yeah yeah yeah nice replicator incoming friends
