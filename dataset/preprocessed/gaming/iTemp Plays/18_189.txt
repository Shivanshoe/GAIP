hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i am playing a legend who i'm pretty sure everyone is playing this season i made a video about them kind of yesterday but i wasn't playing them they were my teammates it is of course valkyrie and i'll be playing a lot of ranked recently this one isn't ranked it's public games we've got a load of kills a lot of damage we're just running full sprint of people uh but it makes sense that people are using valkyrie a lot in rank you can rotate get some good rp but in public games i didn't expect to see this many valkyries but they are always flying about the place you see so many falcons every single game that you play but i actually i like it i i really enjoy playing valkyrie thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos chicken burger that i've got in the fridge for later oh okay how do you warm up your food no microwave i'd eat that cold it's fine oh that's the crazy thing i've ever heard why would i i'm not going to heat up a bun ah warm nothing up on the stove or some of the oven you know you want me to put a chicken burger on the stove you want to boil the chicken burger i don't know i don't know what this dish consists of i don't know i i i don't know the the dynamics of it i can't i don't know how to wipe it up for you one part chicken to two parts beans okay throw it on the stove then i don't know no that's horrendous is eating that cold cold food is awesome plays a 16th century peasant doing a great job what i've done is i've let him get the kill so then okay so then i'll get his blue armor true you could have just killed him yourself and leveled it out but what guns yeah we're going to do i have a carnival oh my god i'm an absolute demon thank you i deserve this fat kill sir and you're you're lucky on the man you didn't tell me about the sniper stocks need help oh wait wait wait wait pumping the numbers pumping the numbers pumping the numbers huge no no i could have thirsted them while they're all come on no race get out the way i'm trying to first i'm trying to first put hounds do you like the way brace get out the way don't kill the race use one i'm trying to first extra kill oh no i got it anyway yes what happens when good neighbors become good friends man like i need to know please what happens when good neighbors become good friends yes what happens is it's a riddle yes what is what's the context like i don't understand what is this coming from i'll just it's the age-old question and no one knows are you seeing this are you doing like a word for word like a song type deal and you're just going to like recite lyrics because i hate that that is triggering but it's the only lyrics i know okay well then that's fine what time is that it's the neighbour's theme team theme song it's like i think it's i think it's australia they're good friends that's what happened god i hate this i don't even know what this conversation is but i hate it i think it's like a i think it's australian i think it's an australian soap i still have zero clue what you're talking about you know what soaps are not like like not that you wash your body with no no not like that soap operas yeah okay yeah novellas oh yeah i love novellas have you ever seen like the mexican ones no they sound oh they are amazing they sound brutal nothing in my turban yeah yeah just shoot me in the back don't worry everyone else is just there's a guy behind me are you guys are fighting well i'm getting shot so you got low bro find any chance i just did i just pop a bat for that i think i just popped the bat for that oh yeah i have zero bats somebody's going to be triggered i'm out of energy ammo it's done stunning so let's get you maybe he did he must have yeah good job mate good job playing that with the team yeah yeah that was a good team oh yeah they are i see their bodies really cool i don't know their bodies are really far these are the guys that uh that we were like that down from that time oh there's no way i have no energy okay ready to score do you have stream remote i don't know yeah i do okay it makes the feel like a bunch of tryhards yeah which they are which it is yeah it usually is extended but then we get one video out of like six hours of recording and we get like one bot lobby or like one bot like team at the end and then we're in bot lobbies you know what i'm saying oh that's like all we play i think it's like even if you if you kill a masters player you don't really get to see how good they are because it doesn't make a difference like you know what i mean i'm a masters player i've got a masters badge on i suck nine percent of my gunfights look that mirage in the start killed me i feel like ranked doesn't really matter as much in in apex as they would in like other games like maybe valerie yeah but they're not like a bite if they're if they got massive they're like a complete but i've tried five thousand you know yeah i think pred is the only one where you can kind of say like they're decent at the game or like a season seven masses badge if you see that for example i'm like a valk or something no that's probably the worst if you say that then you're like whoa actually getting masters in that season was really bad was it uh what did you what was your favorite a lot of that um i did it the right way i wasn't playing rank remember machine spot is there's no way they jump down there when there's a team fight maybe it's just one guy fighting spiders i mean you're literally going to go down and i'm not going to save you okay i'll tell you i'm not going to help you [Laughter] before i did that wait i heard a port yeah so you guys no it was that poor i think ah yeah it was taken therefore kind of thing yeah yeah you know what i'm trying to say you played me long enough yeah i know what you're trying to say you guys are maniacs for jumping down no cabbage i mean i'm horrible i thought you were going to land on your grenade i'll be honest i didn't punch you like knowing that you want to land on your grenade then i was like oh god he's going to land on that die i'm going to die as well and everyone's gonna start crying i threw it at the perfect trajectory to where it bounced eight feet in front of me and when i dropped i was like four feet down there you know what i'm saying so like i was just out of the radius it was good teamwork uh it's an angelic device you could say that if you want i won't because you did nothing um i did a lot actually wings out through a lot of punches uh i have a five kills with 800 damage i have four kills and 800 damage i stopped stealing and and you first hit those two people when i was fighting trying to help teammate get better you were thirsting both of them get better at the game i don't know what to tell you all right i'm the worst i need i'm gonna give up i'm gonna give up chill oh my god i thought he was maybe guys well actually i think you just died to the brim oh no i wasn't in the team come over here oh no you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're about great oh my god i'm gonna come with you i don't have my tactic under my leg recharging shields that is there one guy left somewhere yeah on that team yeah where did that go i think it was a rampart it was a rampart oh no the rampart uh went down what happened oh god he'll cheat he shield those as well i shouldn't say that sounds weird why i'm not gonna repeat it i don't even get like what it could have sounded like this sounds like something else no i'm trying to figure it out i didn't sound like it but you could it rhymes it rhymes with it i have um hold on you say you say i have 360 rounds okay off um how many heat shields i said oh god oh they're crafting oh lord i'll lord their crafting afk yes get him oh wait he's not fk so it's a crypto fall crashing and burning over here yeah i didn't want any of those oh oh my god i'm actually glad i didn't get any embarrassment you have more than nine kills i'm sure you'll have eleven exactly you're fine it's enough thousand damage line kills an inoculator so they're kind of fragile any energy to the boys got no time to check honestly on the squadron and i suck with the oh whoa whoa whoa big big bro big bro don't come here this later i'm a genius you see that you see that you see that that's good it's awful not the name my game your game all right all right it was uh nice yeah i didn't even see your nade or hear it so like i was standing from the door and the door just disappeared i was like okay that's destroyed oh there's no way whoa i stopped i stopped shooting at the end so i otherwise i would have damaged you that's just how that works well you've got 600 damage on two people that have blue armor or sorry purple armor what a fried you would have okay for a ride
