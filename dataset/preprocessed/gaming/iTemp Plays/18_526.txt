hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we're going to be looking at the new horizon lore easter eggs that we've been getting on olympus because today we got the fourth and final message i'm going to go through the first three messages just so you have the whole story so as a brief catch up here horizon moved to a research station with her son on olympus to work on a solution for an energy crisis for her home she discovered an element called branthium with her apprentice dr reed but he could only find it on the edge of a black hole so they departed to retrieve some horizon got betrayed by dr reed and her space shutter was sent into the black hole itself she did manage to escape but because of the theory of general relativity and how speed and time interact she was 87 years too late now she's working on a way to go back in time to see her son again and these are the messages that she receives on the way mom hi it's me you miss me they told me you were dead but we were together remember i said i love you and you said i love you and dr reed said you died but you didn't die everyone says it was a dream here i go but i know it's real you came back like you said hi son and if i have to i'll rewrite the bloody laws of the universe to do it you can do it mom i know it it's true already inside the ring the phaser the face runner oh go i'm not gonna take it i'm not gonna take it i got him at 60 frames you can't solve the eternal mysteries of the universe well well well dr summers look fancy that it's me well it's you to be precise just a wee change in timing oh you did it you brilliant lassie i can't tell you how but you did it or you will do it you'll make it home say here see him hi so don't you dare give up girl not ever see mom i told you you'd do it i not you dead son so the final one was like a message from the future or from the past depending on how you look at it so at least we know that she managed to achieve her dream of going back and meeting her son but she hasn't achieved it yet if that makes sense she still needs to achieve it but she's already achieved it think about it hope you enjoyed the back story thank you for watching and i'll see you all with some gameplay in five and a half seconds my friends apex on xbox you have to pay a hundred and twenty dollars a year yeah wow dude that's uh moz if i've ever seen one it's a big scam i have a full team on me i have a vault but i haven't already right here right in front of me i think they backed up all right i have another gun it's not a p20 oh they're across the light that's a nade that isn't it hey you got g7 re45 now i'm happy there's a team over here and market too i'm gonna push this guy first oh one in four story oh two that's just i messed it up with my massive part with my punch reloading enemy down someone pushed me okay how do i get finished oh i need a three this is that thermite right looks like it's just um thank god recharging shields and only i was reviving you at the time too but the thermite ticked again yeah that was unfortunate look at you back i'm invisible when i do this oh yes 316. how do i know that i'm nothing but it happened within a dream stuff oh my god left i'm so sick and tired of dying it's the worst it's a fight equalizer that's what it is you can be on yeah you can be dominating and then it's just like 120 to your channel that's exactly what happened i just got this dude to like 30 hp 40 hp and i tried to punch him the punch no rigged and then he just chewed uh yeah some sweet gear for us not a fun gun um ah no it's fun to use like how the uh i i i honestly don't really have a good time using it but i just i understand how strong it is it's a very strong weapon i'll guess we'll go that way oh yeah y'all i i yeah yeah oh oh okay package oh that's a lifeline one uh there's one right here two landings one landing gonna take a while though i wish you could shoot him down like a fortnight yeah i mean he's right here it's probably just gonna be purple though right yeah get a shot i mean honestly it's not gonna be anything good why have i done this to myself now i'm just gonna be so oh my god it's a prowler oh oh okay see look at you never had a primer reloading yeah that one wait that wasn't you finding the hammer points i i deserve i deserve to leave me by the trash are you kidding me this is like a what is this which one is it oh i've just shot every single decoy [Music] oh no it was it wasn't as big of a hit as i thought it was this isn't yourself is it did you do it no come on i wanted to kill the kill where's the guy south raising he sounded really heartbroken right there ah man i'll literally shot every single mirage decoy let's go here g7 oh my god okay dubs i'm just i'm just it's actually unbelievable how thanks inconsistent of a player i am i think i'm white why not i would love to show you my gameplay of this game i did i did hear the hammer point fight gunner for a long time so that went on way too long that was that little five second fight was more stressful than that whole earlier segment that we had no no it was not i promise you if i could show you what happened i think this place needs a little more me giving my to recharge [Applause] i'm not really with you i don't know how the pathfinder's one that's all you she's really low where she went i'll shoot down here i've got the uh button okay somewhere oh you're just cranking today i uh i was cranking what's my shield back um i don't know where that wraith went yeah it's pretty hanging around trying to get move banners okay they call me the three back so i got three bats would you like one oh that's not that's not really a good name i don't agree with that well exactly that's why i'm trying to change it this isn't what rings yeah i i would like i can help you with that i have zero okay here you go um uh are you closer yeah yeah yeah you'll see at the bottom of the mountain yeah yeah yeah yeah she's going to respawn them here on the edge of his own and won't get two free kills that's exactly what's gonna happen i'm uh i'm down for that i'm using double tap on a g7 terrible terrible choice once again using the gold one yeah i just took the water off never worked i tried it last time i used the g7 i don't know too much recall on the first kick oh sounds fine what's going on here oh race oh i fell off i'm dead she's facing she's terrified someone else is fine the heck what the heck is going on here the nerf they did to the g7 was genius i'll just say there's a right behind me probably the one from earlier okay i'm i'm down low in between two teams i'll actually find yeah i'm kind of a mess right now what did she try and do oh dude i feel for you was it the price to play oh guys she literally went let's see one two three four five feet five feet but the bracelet lasted like a good five seconds oh that's so bad but that's not on the list of puffs for season eight um it should be definitely should be should be number one it should be it's so bad it's gotta be the word it's the worst tactical in the game is there another tactical that's as bad as that there's no way there's no way this race was level three she wasn't playing like a level three but she did arcstar herself so i'm not so sure which one the uh one of the bottom of the rope she was throwing nades at me then she ran into her own architect and then she tried to pull away it was just a beast i guarantee you she's probably smurfing because i saw the way she did a 180 and it's definitely no it wasn't controller so yeah she's just trying no griffin just doesn't work it's like does it spar me bob lobby that's why i've never understood the whole concept of people saying like you're on a smurf it literally doesn't work it's gonna work for one game with with the way we play it's gonna work for one game and we're instantly back into our lobbies yeah like are we gonna make a new account for every game we play makes no sense oh the two to four times he's just you're ripping a phone book in half i can't do that you can't do that i mean i that's why i said you sounded like you were not trying right yeah just make sense i mean i believe i mean think of me i mean i mean come on now i mean come on now you need to bump the damaged numbers up if you're trying to keep up with my mirage okay i am perfectly fine with that because that was the worst performance i have ever given in apex legends history by three damage is that what you were saying to me i didn't mean it i didn't read it like that but but when you put it that way
