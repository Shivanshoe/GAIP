hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in this game it felt like i was three stacking i wasn't because i don't three stack on this game mainly because if you do play with two good players and it's really difficult to get any kills for yourself because they're probably playing pathfinder octane you're probably playing lifeline like i am in this game and you've still got to get over 112 damage but this is what it must feel like in this game because both my teammates were certified maniacs they had the certification and everything it was a really fun game though really aggressive gameplay what's he saying he's probably saying this might be the greatest lifeline i've ever seen i mean look at that skin he must be the world's best thanks mate you just said this guy's gonna drop for 20 minutes yeah maybe who knows let me in please oh god that was close par either the two guns i love to use i should quit name oh what a find there's a lifeline off drop oh my god oh my word what kind of kind of room is this everyone chill i've got some of the best you've ever seen yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah on the way reloading yeah just him bam i need light rains now sorry my bad my fault my fault that's not fair he uh he blocked it on purpose so i couldn't get the kill i saw that he didn't want me to get the kill hey goldberg goal 30 30 off drop as a lifeline too that's sensational i'm so flabbergasted by this loot uh i need some of these i might need teammates i'll be honest i was lying at the start i don't understand them i have no idea what they're saying i know i know my acting was convinced no i understand but i actually have no clue what they were saying at all so might need to meet them thank you amigo gracias as they say uh audio sorry teammates oh big scrap first stand over there i want to say big scrap i mean pathfinder versus cargobot no i didn't even jump off you guys are too quick i'm coming out there yeah stay focused before yes he's trying to get it back up to my team i'm coming i've got back i'm coming didn't i just kill them all i'm white reloading i don't think these guys understand english and i don't understand uh the language they are speaking he's commonly known as a language barrier in the trade and he's not good for team communication i'll talk to these i'll take some throwables i will go like this i have a lot of ammo i mean i've got five shield cells but i've got gold armor so maybe just a little bit more just a few more maybe just a few just a few ah five's fine for now all right where do we go team these guys are maniacs i'm gonna follow them at least gotta have listen i can be worth that time here we go not leaving you alone i don't know if i can even make it to you guys give me a second recharge just keeping my shoes can actually beat up your team i can use a syringe if i need to i think it's more important to regroup my team here definitely the team though okay guys a genius are you the god of heat for like 800. i am perfect him there we go i think the mirage decoys blocking it oh my god that hurts that hurts bad that's three let's get my shield back my teammates are absolute maniacs by the way absolute psychopaths good grace uh what do i need does anyone know not that much not those maybe an extra stack of shield cells and some throwables maybe my phone i mean i've got one make it most wants to carry a second one uh should be good maybe too many heavy rains but i'm not going to drop them because i've got nothing else to replace them with nice teammates these guys probably have 8 000 damage each but the good news is i finally managed to get a lifeline revive on them i just wasn't close enough to the two times i was gonna run safe this has been a fun game because there's you know bad fights elsewhere other than just cap i know i said maybe even the previous video but whenever you get fights elsewhere on this map just feels fresh because it doesn't happen very often come and get your birthday present 240 heavy rounds with a 30 30. slight overkill on my behalf here we go though this can be huge what you got for me gonna be gonna be one of those soup sandwiches we always have oh i'm sick of those soup sandwiches spitfire here i'm an idiot i went straight past where am i where am i going here's my teammates by the way that's me in the middle looking just so sad look at these guys look at me watches you may not have known but you can do this ready did you know you could do that what kind of late game care package is a turbo charger med kit what kind of care package is that that's all it is huge scam i don't need to go over this way but i'm trying to find people i should actually stick close to my teammates sorry they're going to find somebody for me another four minutes ahead of me so i'm not going to get any damage fire reloading hey don't take my damage it i've like this is meant to be this is what it's like to like run around as a three stack i have no bats this must be what it's like to run around as a threesome any bats going any bats going oh my god i have no bats i'm going to die that should be extra damage right there i'm gonna risk it ow no please nice i didn't get my hundred first damage for the finish it's because i knew i had no batteries what the heck was that game i'm playing with two algs professionals let me get to use my passive revive i used it once i use it one time let me hear what they're saying hold on audio big win gg gg you understood me huge games
