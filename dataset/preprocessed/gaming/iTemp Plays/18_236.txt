hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and seriously the triple take is the best weapon in season 11. not only does it suit the new map perfectly but i don't think it's been nerfed at all since being removed from the care package it has no mention in the season 11 patch notes that i can see about any changes to the gun itself so it's a care package weapon that you can find on the ground and it's so good thank you so much for the support on the season 11 videos make sure you are subscribing to the channel so you do not miss any future ones thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh this is this is the place this is the place i'm landing on the other side i'm going to actually meet you everyone that ever said you have a strike pack is true yeah i got it i got it i got it now i got a sink to my ping bun just for those moments yup that's a lot of info yes i got a triple takeover triple take i've got two of them six triple tape i want one i want [Music] 27 shots in a mag what the triple take oh god go pro oh no oh yeah what are the gold guns uh the new gun is one of them and then i'm not gonna do this okay thank you i've got some good info for you did you paint oh yes um oh it's energy why is it not because it's a marksman leader ah okay you can take the title from them wait no a lot of you crazy oh it's kind of crazy yeah yeah yeah yeah it is there's this is the hot spot it's the hot spot i don't know why nobody lands here look at all this lead the best place to get all of your longbow needs the rotations are so rough without a balloon uh i'm just like i'm just going to go out on a limb here and say triple take seems kind of busted i'm 18 and i have no i have nothing on it yeah i assume it takes three per shot though they just respond right on me true which often already still freeze homie it's crash i'm nowhere i'm nowhere to be found wait what's this [Music] any i don't hear it no i didn't hear him reloading oh i can climb he took your portal i think oh is there is there not audio cues when somebody takes a portal maybe but maybe we're not used to them i need to i need to listen to what that sounds like i'll drop you to phoenix but i mean you can just hold on to that you'd be corsic combination new season ashley's out but no nope give me caustic let's run it give me gold stake i need some attachment to triple deck i it's i hate this iron sight you got nothing gotten done two on my door oh nice you're a genius amigo he went down the stairs i think yeah there's another team here be careful on the other building 105 headshot she's uh she's like one then you hit her oh he's up there nice job to the beer i missed what have i just done there i think for 123 by the way so pretty weak nice job give me a second if you land ahead atlantic three headshots this game for like 100 205's 123. that's not that's not right is it that's crazy yeah it's pretty busted they ran this way move this way wait does it show on the radar i don't see anything it's because it's too far away open your map right it's gone now but it's on my pink what is it what is it show like like one of these things on the map oh okay i'll go go go you know any of the questions for the playtester i tested all these that is literally the first question you've actually been able to answer me it's crazy um gold guns rotation wise we're looking at the new one then i don't know what else and that's it i hear them in here but mom's a mirage i didn't want to shoot down range of recharge i don't know this map i don't know what i'm pushing what's going on oh they're both on me one's cracked both weak huge the entire squad falls every time like i take a corner i just i don't know where i'm where i'm gonna go and while you're looking we're all ready and the shields are depleted that is crazy it's so hard to predict yeah it is loads of corridors and all sorts we see we only bumped into those guys because of my passive oh is that is that what we were following was your passive well yeah because i knew they were in here i'd ping them in here because they were the ones that killed the other team in there i think i think these are these guys that respawned don't know i think so close so many bats by the way i have a total of four can i have two plates i have zero bats oh why why do you have zero um i didn't get the load quick enough makes me go i can trade it back oh god he's got a g7 he's really low this way uh when they're far away no and they're not close yes like medium range yes nice big info big info i'm gonna do the opposite okay look at that we have we have come oh yeah that's bad i can't be bothered can you be bothered yeah you can i don't know you're going to trigger you're going to trigger chat i've already come loaded oh yeah behind us you cracked him nice shoot the spiders exciting three times what a pitiful squad that is such a good tactic as ash though if you can like all behind someone like high ground behind someone you are laughing yeah the repositioning you can do that is really nice oh position reveal oh no oh nelly okay so that's that's kind of crazy too because if we're if we're running around killing a lot of people uh there's more chances of us being spotted it was a different team i think they went for this guy's banner wait did this guy use all the g7 ammo or is there just come with no it comes with like 80 spares honestly i don't know why it's such a little amount of ammo reserves serious yeah it's kind of bad but it's a good gun but the ammo is is yeah it's harsh i think it's gonna be gone instantly yeah it may not even be worth picking up uh well at least i get ranked let's keep your attachments people then by the time you're out of ammo people have got good guns you know okay we've run in like six circles yeah i'm scared these guys get out of this area there you go told you that in front of us all right in front of me it's cargo is weak it's gonna get that package practice oh big i think she must have come up this way i don't know replicator incoming i cracked her though she couldn't have gone too far but included too late ah then respawn again let's keep finding oh so close uh you okay yeah oh there's a bunch of i gotta shoot i gotta kill spiders i got to i've got a spitfire mate what does that sound like they're in the cave aren't they it sounds like they're up here i've been playing a lot of pb pve i got to do this you have spitfire g7 scope okay okay okay okay okay off the chimney where are they in the cave at the cave i'm stuck in here i am in here are they in the cave with you where are they have a zero clue you're the one that was eating the ledge yeah down this way oh my god under five so many of them in here this gun is so stupid i've had chopped back 12 people this game for 100 each yeah but how many spiders have you killed honestly a load too many almost they just revived i think fly back i got i got i got stuck on a tree trunk nice job why do the gold bags look different are the gold boxes look different do they so just me like a different tent i don't know oh come on look guys that was a different team to this guy i think that's a giant almost cap no that's not that's not a cap that's a pretty pretty big cat in progress oh she could like maneuver more in the air though you can't really move they're on absolute death trap if someone's either side just get sprayed like that valkyrie you know she could just fly off if you want to yeah you should be able to maneuver a little double jump throw a little double jump in there on me i um in here maybe i don't know here nice slower than i remember maybe that was one of the nerfs from the care package are the last two things of firing i have a spitfire and a g7 that's kind of cringe i'm cringing we're literally youtubers everything we do is grinch that's true enough yes that's a good point yep do you wanna third okay package weapon part of the wife i've got crave a triple take oh my lord shut down i think it looks cool when it's like flying it's crazy it's like uh where are they where are you now oh champions that's fun ain't farming farming ultra that's what they call me barman sure
