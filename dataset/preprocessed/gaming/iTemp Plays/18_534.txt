hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have some games for you that are more focused on the struggle whether the struggle is your teammate crashing twice in the same game and you have to punch them to safety as they reconnect or if it's just getting third partied and having to respawn each other just to regain your footing in the game i have two games for you today and i'm certain that you will enjoy both of them or i will give you your money back that is the item player guarantee right there if you do enjoy them please be sure to sub to the channel as we are getting to one million subs sometime within the next decade i hope so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my yeah friends manifest it nice little 20. okay well we're dead i mean hopefully no one landed by me come and there are people kind of close okay i'm almost there three two one something

purple it's not like full but wait you're like i've got bag i've got bag uh nice we can go res yeah didn't didn't know the team rock up i i could have sworn i heard something i guess we just run i thought i heard a portal cool beans friends the maneuvers these maneuvers are unstoppable these rhymes are improbable oh no [Applause] very nice nice i love how this oh my god um him too but like the sentinel's just not good it's a shame he's neat i don't know i love dogs no one can't wait to make a video on it i crashed for the second time this game okay fun awesome i'm gonna punch you towards the safe zone just in case i mean it's not going to take two minutes but i'm gonna do it anyway i got you i'll be back i mean i'm looking up right now i'll be back in like a minute probably i'm getting close to the cabin please he doesn't know that you're not he said no he's punching you in with me come on come on up team we got this get him over there team effortlessly i'm loading up 30 seconds you're gonna be no idea where you crashed you're gonna be so confused maybe we're actually half step we're actually harvesting our names you're stuck come on i'll mess because you may just because you're back five four three two one i'm back nice every time you crash i think you've come back without without a problem yeah we don't need you okay but spitfire to me oh my god i'm dead i got a caustic nice cheese fried cheese fries right lifeline this way wait one's resin i like pushing limits as much scanning the area money to raise oh my god [Music] oh they did not deserve that oh they do not deserve that i don't even know what like any of my pines are i don't even know my sensitivity is if you haven't changed them cues your ability four is heal that's already too much but wiggling real quick i'm so far away from my care package i'm dead yeah i would have never done that on my keyboard she would have coming in with that blue oh my god i'm seeing everything yeah headshots only it wasn't a few body shots in there a lot of headshots there recharging my shields well that was fun i was love third party like that i love when they watch me loot and they see me standing still like a noob like these guys ain't biting me with this aim assist there's a mouses oh is this yours oh i'm taking my blue back 56 damage i need they're scrapping that solder if you want to take the the little balloon over there we're probably going to scream at me because i just swapped blues like four times but whatever maybe just trying to make it harder on myself yeah exactly drone there nice nice nice let me stall and stuff fast they're going to work well does he stay there or does it go down to the ground no i just stayed there they huge scrap huge in here i didn't just waste time by loving a nade in here thinking i was going to do something i would have killed more i'm afraid ah yeah you probably would have that was your first mistake that was good teamwork there yeah i know i was thinking what was i thinking did you take a bruiser by the way um no back then i can't find it rip in the chat i'm just trying to trigger as many people as possible today i'm going to get this blue armor to like 50 damage and i'm going to swap to another boot that's like full right so bad because they've read 750 damage it's kind of a lot oh yeah people and i do that a lot dude i know that triggers people so much okay i hear teams northeast here i think that's that uh what is that i don't know what that place is called gardens oh okay where are they where are they they're going towards you or me i they're not coming towards me and i think they're going to wait away from me not towards you okay they go north oh team on me i don't know this might be them i guess i'm flanking one i got laser though i got a pop of phoenix absolutely fine i'm not with you i got this guy he's got a red field though do you need help i'm going back i'm okay yeah oh you're good right yeah i'm fine don't worry okay i'm gonna go through this guy yeah i should escape he's just crawling away they both tried to rush me but they did not know my sneak tactic i am killed i just heard oh look at the team again 106 on this right oh my god whoa here yes i hate a battle [Music] oh yeah another one you mean is it the bloodhound that you damned originally oh i died here 100 yeah getting they're getting they're getting their party okay down to one of the third party them honestly i'm still present oh okay you sell freezing i'm just gonna drop back dude oh round two beginning countdown replicator being delivered got a replicator coming down sorry donkey stuff did they take you extended oh god oh press triangle i left for a second did you kill that i want you no i killed just some random guy and i'm getting flowed by another team i can honestly just take this row a team came across this rock there's no way they're not going for this specifically what are you doing down here for this guy's paying or something [Music] i'm just trying to take the rope everyone chilled apple pepper purple pepper powder only one minute to go [Applause] taking fire so you instead of chasing this massive third party if these guys gonna brush you man oh my god oh you're actually just better they should be sick to their stomach i was on the two times that shouldn't have been that ugly i'm gonna fly here bring it back because this box is here you can get it looks like i'm inside we'll probably just i mean landing on gold too would be nice for a little gold yeah sorry gold spawns whatever i five med kits i think i'm a bit overkill oh man we've been nice come back of this entry a gold right here too nice they spawn with a good amount of ammo it's like 60 plus that there's a level two bag back there i'm gonna drop you like two med kits on this first one and sometimes some shield for you i don't know i have only one back i just can't there's a flat line there um i have heavy uh energy checking down nice if they're coming no are you in this this is an easy win i have four cells did you get some i think i dropped two right um i i have one i think there's just one obviously just one you go back i need one but i might practice that yeah okay i'm good i mean i have gold so i'll be trying don't know if i'm crafting that how much is it is it 20 uh 25 i think oh come on oh it's 20. nice here's somebody on me [Music] right on my body uh where'd you kill the bloodhound uh britain was like on this oh he was trying to he's trying to defend him he's running like they're both together just just down here last team is that that race squad the wraith lifeline and they killed you know you know where they were so they're probably going to come for like that angle let's explore this way all right you're right i mean yeah there's like 10 crawlers 10 cravers usually what they have it's a different team and he's a rapper from the boys oh my god nice nice never staying alive i'm surprised i killed that right hand team like my that's why i don't i can't use those variables man my aim would have been far cleaner i wouldn't but i'm still annoyed at it you know yeah the variables are rough you are the apex you expect one sensitivity you get [Music] another you revived me as well
