thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right away cities attempt number two solo games and at least we start off with a vault this time what are you doing friend attention i don't know cheers the next ring is nice actually took my old blue he put it to my old blue that was already already depleted i'm not going to ever win this guy it's an octane for me too just a little bit if you turn around and fire a little bit they they can hesitate pushing just in the open then i think i heard one of my left as well this is three people and that's a fourth one i have no energy bullets all i've got is this is this mastic which is pretty good when there are multiple people and i can't work with the doors rings like inside a building it's actually pretty tricky can you climb this i don't even know if you can't climb these sounds like he's trying okay i got this because no one else does i need these teams to start fighting i have to go it'd be nice the third part of this i mean not really third party i was the original party i i was one of the ogs in this gunfight but i've got nothing i need i need some i need some time to loot if these guys are scrapping uh it gives me at least a second to try and get some some stuff light rains are probably far easier to find than energy range that's for certain flatline light's still probably the most common ammo i'm overtyped right is that is that true dracon a lot of rams easy to find than than heavy heavy's got a load of different guns flatline spitfire hemlock winged but there are more heavy guns than there are i mean thirty-third repeat yeah i'm going back to the flatline i've got so many bullets there all right that scrap's over which is which is sad but we can just run back over there and try and hopefully maybe kill someone sometimes you gotta just delay and try and manufacture a gunfight like a third party to your advantage here we go that's actually still scratching they're on timeout and now we're getting fourth parted by someone in a car oh my god four headshots it's probably the car team hello french it just you he spotted me hello did you see how great i made in your hand don't hey don't as if come on are you listening i'm not going to fall for that he's got he's got plenty he's got multiple nades he's tried one of each there frag grenade is that's gold piercer as well what's that ice cream called where it's like strawberry vanilla chuck oh my gosh i felt man that was your teammate that explains why he was just one guy okay he's tempted to take the wingman but i'm not gonna take that idiot absolutely beamed these guys are on the respawn beacon i mean i have anvil so i can take this fight at a decent range and get some decent damage on them hello why'd you start look looking at me in teabagging and there's someone up top to be honest you should this is why landing on ps5 is actually so difficult to do those guys got beans but unfortunately there was always going to be someone sat on top of the fountain and they're still firing me and i have no shields house left and i've only got one battery and i maybe should have used it but now i'm not going to use it because i've used two shield cells perfect recharging shield despite fighting a little bit again i'm manufacturing an old a situation where i can be the third party someone's in here that was a rev ultimate as well attention delivering replicator they're dropping there's an octane on the left is that three teams i don't know if they're all fighting inside i can just stand in the doorway and shoot in hopefully relatively safely recharging shields stomach kill i don't think anyone's actually here it's always good to arm a switch when you're looting like that because if someone rocks up uh at least you're protected you know you're not sitting on broken red or broken gold whatever you have recharging shield all right that's i mean this is this is working through this strategy manufacturer a situation where i can be the third party when you're solo you've just got to play smart when i'm playing with like so far i've just got to run in there because if i don't run in there i get no kills because he will kill them all you know i'm actually pretty looted i don't need this i feel bad marvin only one minute until the ring closes you're gonna be armless um armless and harmless but i've got i've got no need for god loot i've got a pretty good setup here all right top five i'm the kill leader i was about to say i've got no assist but that's fairly obvious considering i'm solo these guys just gonna run to that gunfight perhaps 30 seconds that's half a minute let's be careful oh that's his team i assume there's a team on the left here too there's a team on my left i don't want to get rocked up on when i'm trying to pop a bat i mean they're in a separate gunfight i might be able to just try and first this i may made a bit of a mistake here there we go is that even the same guy i don't know if that's the same person i don't i know one of them's a lifeline so oh there's a team here there's a team in the states too whoever won that gunfight in the states is one of the teams and this is the other team this is all the people this guy's gonna be raised but hopefully he's just trying to heal or something there we go trying to cover phoenix i feel for you we've all been there she's gonna lifeline raise again but what can i do okay are they beneath these lifelines went off too how do i lose that gunfight the stupid spitfire man literally just never have to stop firing with that gun i can't believe she's letting me live here i mean she was fairly weak i am still alive giving my shields absolutely when the footsteps started coming over if you're wondering why my reactions are so slow now the team ran off down low but they would have heard this firing i don't know how i lose that gun fight and then just completely demolished with the second time even even a gunfight that you win 90 of the time when you get 10 kills in one game you're gonna lose one of those gunfights like statistically you know give me a second chance though and i i will i will beam you you know that's just the way it goes no idea what this last team is not actually meg okay bangalore i'm never gonna down one from this range but if i just try and eat into their shield batteries or whatever their resources can't hurt i mean if this is a crater and i get a peek we're laughing old bag does that mean there's no gun oh come on i see you they're rotating i can't take an angle just a big field no cover what's pushing up one's closer than this guy giving my shields oh they're into ultimates the blue times glowing from his eyeballs and the bangalores love the airstrike at me so okay can't slide you can't slide because you're shooting me i just gotta wait out of uh the that's definitely the better side i don't know how i'm supposed to push over there by myself across a big field when these guys aren't really leaving each other's side this one becomes tricky this is why the crab would be outrageous but what can i do with a gold bag that i've already got all right i don't think they realized that i rotated back so this is my way across free of charge there's no way they know that i've come this way and i get myself some free high ground here too there we go i have two arm switches if i need them i don't have arc stars if they don't realize i'm here did they see me yes they saw me this guy's looking straight at me recharging shields these guys are plainly smart they are just not leaving each other side 45 seconds out how do i need to end up over there oh my god oh my god the guy's 50 health the guy's 50 i'm getting my buck shot by someone like if i if my grapple doesn't if i don't hit my head off the roof like i didn't want to just land next to them i would have jumped off if i wanted to land there i'd hit my head off the roof because my grapple angle was weird i wanted to land a little bit further away and shoot them while they were gonna be stuck how did i have three and a half thousand damage oh man that's such a free win
