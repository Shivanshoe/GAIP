hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing season nine and we are using the bow check bow i have three games for you today two are in the regular battle royale mode and one of them is in the new 3v3 arena mode now when i spoke about the bojack bow beforehand i mentioned how it's a weapon that you will need to put some time in you'll need to get some practice in to get used to the mechanics i can feel myself getting better with this weapon the more i use it you'll see in the games that i have for you that i'm firing from really far away and landing like 112 damage headshots it's one of the most satisfying things in the entire game i also had a chance to try the new scattershot hop up for it which at close range turns into more of a shotgun than anything i'd have killed a wraith off red armor with that harp up if i didn't run out of arrows halfway through anyway thank you for watching make sure you're subscribed to the channel for more season 9 just check this and then i'll gameplay over do a quick loop oh one landed low ground right in front that's on luke this is xfr ip20 [Music] i think the other one uh just dips i got scanned pk he's just like there i see him he's pushed back i just hold him and one's further back sniper at the back one's pushing right pushing close on your right really low on me nice broken button oh they really patched down it's cracked i played very nice oh really really uh patched like your airborne shooting ability yeah they did they needed to to be honest it was a bit over the top they're just vulnerable now she's well she's good gotta find the key card the kick card is on like one of the um dead soldiers in the ship somewhere so just look around for a little key card i'm a dead like little zombie soldier person oh there's a lot of loot in there right yeah it's like the vault from uh what's edge yeah where do you know he's i don't know

go oh that's my hello vault then what else do i want i can get a zip line i can buy more grappling hurts i just buy two shield bats i guess where's the uh where's the care package um it was on the far right okay it tells you where it comes into at the start i guess in a way it's quite nice that everyone has the same credits because it means that like it's more of a comeback mechanic yeah because each round is like everyone's still eager yeah it's like yeah you've got a chance you can save you can save tokens to the next round too these guys are low ground again it's paying for them there are two of them around me there are supply bins as well that have like there's a supply bin in the middle that has loads of shields in it i'm going to uh two in this building all right give me a second go times seventeen tracked path yes i yeah buy out buy out boys guys surely that's value goal oh you can buy a gold bag that's crazy wait i wait you get ammo right yeah you get yeah up wait a minute i would go high ground but these guys are chilling low ground so yeah they're not really running the it's shrouds we needed it we needed our warm-up game we need to run crackheads first game i don't know where they are scan i'm scanned from up top i think they're up here one up top oh you charge up the bow this makes sense yes yeah yeah yeah but you weren't charging it up wait i want to talk about how i'm talking about it well a little bit aggressive these guys uh race is cracked lobby that's cute he took an arrow to the knee oh what are these guys doing okay i know so i really was good for one thing i now have to use the bones i can't believe you were firing at those guys that hammond without charging that off not close here there are people in the main building thing it's not looted oh no someone is here the ring's closing in one i'm vibing one's got purple in there oh my god you guys um ah i'm going i'm kind of far almost noise mind in my business looting my friend one more there's a purple switch in one of these fake i'm just i'm making got it that's going to be up top you jump down oh no that was cracked on you yeah just one more [Music] this guy has no idea where he's being shot from that's hilarious give his cracks 81 give me i didn't get any audio on this cracked again flashlight cracks my phone's literally won if he's pushed up a little bit but he's in his football one four one the pathfinder very much appreciated they were definitely over this way somewhere there two people at least three people three people do you want to play inside like go over here i'm taking shots we gotta use our bows all right ow these guys are oh oh 17. one's only got one two three one 23. yeah hit 100. i cannot hit that one dude i can't tell if my arrows are going above get out of the way he did something to me wait this is what i need i don't know it went right oh that triple thing is going to really hurt until that triple take 70 on the one at the back they're just running are they i think so under the scan uh yeah one second yeah they are their main thing is valk in the air in the back hit 7b i broke path oh marvin get out the way mate what's the vibe are we trying to go in or what i'm happy to just keep bowing them i think yeah i think this is the last one yeah there's the last one someone's that back oh we they have to come out of there we can just like all right down the line 102 oh it's so weird like everyone using bows because there's no noise though yeah it's this fight is violent especially in an intense like 1v1 at the end yeah it's so quiet actually how is that guy playing valkyrie i don't know i was just thinking that we aren't allowed to death why are you allowed amazing all right i did a bit more damage that time
