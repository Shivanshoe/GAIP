mate this everyone has their limit in terms of talent i don't believe that i don't i fully believe that i think genetic potential definitely plays its role but i feel like everybody can uh improve everyone can improve but there's a limit there's a limit on how much you i could never be faker you know ever oh yeah i mean i i agree with that but you know we're talking like bottom of the barrel you know like the like the the literally like point one zero five kd players okay everyone can hold the one kd everyone has that much talent to get better 100 most people just don't know how to improve they don't know where to improve yeah and they don't try effectively i think most people just mindlessly play the game and think that that's gonna make them improve just just like mindlessly playing and sometimes it does but you're not gonna you're not gonna learn like advanced mechanics and like proper game sense and awareness from just mindlessly playing oh that guy's weak yeah i fully agree but i feel like i've reached i mean if i played loads i'd get better obviously but i'm very close to my talent cap you're you're really old like you're real that's the problem really old you are you are very very old like yes it's it's kind of crazy how old you are so yeah i'm getting caught i'm getting old too though you know literally like one of the boys careful he's one nice job this guy hasn't landed a shot i don't know if he's shooting you but he's doing something oh this is another team hello hello let's give you our classic right here i'm kind of weak hello hello teammates rising me huge off the backboard off the backboard off the backboard i'm getting bowed i mean i cannot help you there you go burnham but they're weak though i down one of them and one of them was weak yes

shotgun bolt still this one then crafter you should have crafted one it's purple nope should have crafted it oh do you think i am crafter someone who wants a purple shop involved is this guy gonna take this rope that's what we can get inside oh god oh no yeah they're inside oh they're they're trying to revive but i think let's find them i'm gonna crawl inside i saw they're building for a little while surprisingly what a maniac man what a guy yeah i don't know how that worked i need to play something i wouldn't have done that because there's one back there anyone up top oh yeah that's one i'll come to you country corner psycho i don't know how these erasers are working come on let me revive you okay that was crazy i really have the worst luck today it's insane yeah you guys are all fighting in the middle of this and then they all like i'm not even playing three of them look at me three of them look at me and just spray me oh it happened to me because i died okay you know when you get a comment being like oh you could revive teammate and i'm just like no i couldn't have i actually think i could have now it's this guy commenting that and he's the demon and he yeah he's right all along why armor ain't coming in the building he knows the deal i'm taking this road is my arm on you i'm not on you no shotgun bolts in existence you gotta hit that craft then my friend no never gonna happen i'm manifesting it i'm gonna find in somebody's box in here later no one is crafting that apart from you i can promise you that it's not true people love crafting yeah but they don't use shotguns why wouldn't they the people who use shopkins don't like that don't craft casing points do those have any correlation shotguns are aggressive they want to use a charge rifle with like a r301 with the eight times on it oh the eva's uh are they eva's a bar weapon no but they don't know that they definitely it's been broken for like four seasons like eight seasons yeah it's been broken for like eight seasons but nobody listened to me for like six yes and then all of a sudden it's the best gun in the game and oh my god where has this been it's been the same for like six seasons that's not the title for you oh it actually no they nerfed it recently right they nerfed the fire rate a little bit but it didn't do anything like it it's still it's all good that's what i'm saying that's not the title for you no one listen to me about this gun same thing literally flatline and evo yeah i've been using since like season four and nobody listened to me facts i used to statements i'll do
