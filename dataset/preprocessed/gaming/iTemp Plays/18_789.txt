it was a guy's eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and again that I've got for you today I'm going to be using the gold and Mozambique once again and I got three points for you today okay the first one I didn't realize that the gold Mozambique you didn't have the hammer points point number two I used to have a an incredible amount again today I promise you I'm not going to pick up the hover unless I have to for a while so don't worry about that a3 I've got the gold proud of late in the game so I didn't get to use it as much as I'd hoped either over the game that I've got for you is still incredibly fun we cleared out nearly half the lobby and I was I wasn't blaming people I know these are just random people so yeah hopefully you enjoy if you do be sure to leave a like rating and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends it's all cities me amigos there appears to be he's very good I don't need the roof this is an absolute tragedy this is a scrapped Oct tragedy I'm going this way friends I've got nothing littering oh never mind I've got the best food on the game immediately from spawn here we go and the second-best gun on the game the old triple take someone's about to get triple took earth unless I find a bed good obviously right so there she needs weapon there's only there's literally about four sides in here I don't know why I'm tempted just to rush this team their life lines looking interested my team I said good looking at their stats and stuff so I trust them to help me out here a French so come for the pinch maneuver belt nice nice no scoped him most close in with the Sentinel that I I've pointed eight that's half my kill I reckon that's an assist right there since I was on loan from me if wants it back I could have aspirin you know we go oh we found it the Mozambique legendary Mozambique I'm not sure how this is gonna be I remember it I mean we've had this gun before admittedly not with nine shots and it's not too bad but the only thing is you sorta need to knock their arm off first and then you can go in with the Mozambique sorcerer this works out here I mean the nine shot is gonna make it a lot more powerful on machine I'm down for a scrap I've haven't done anything so far this game often points out the Sentinel of course I mean that's why you use the habit okay I'm gonna tear you down chalice 133 damage - juice - 3 6 did I see that right the lifeline just do a 360 offers tremendous I give that a tremendous out of 10 here we go Oh we'll go I'll give that tremendous I have 10 - no are the lifelines closer she's gonna pick better all right scraps sec for some reason seems pre dead which is strange because recently capsule has been the up there we go kick off a specialized white headed the team here in scanty top separate team I messed up I messed up are they looking and they kill leaders are now two times Hedgehog Breezer best site on the havoc like foe receiver for you boy I heard of scrapping the distance - hey it's got all true Portsmouth as well all right let's go still 38 people left which is good is it an ongoing scrap he's a concluded scrap what kind we talking about here there we go someone's Bangalore often as well I need to Chinese the Mozambique but I need to I need to knock shield off first why me I see a close level-one evo she'll try this is risky sleep on the level one Evo shields hey back it up back it up later look I'll drop you in extended my mag level three I'm not asking for any jammer I just want them to know okay there we go found so anyway I just wanted to know that I'm also in need they they shouldn't expect me to be dropping in some anytime soon put hand over here and also I didn't realize they were as the Mozambique stacked up forty eight shop and range as well shop and Emma don't please I'm gonna leave behind some purple you go I'm having so much fun minutes have a hotel you way too much fun with this gun it's honestly a bit mental I'm good at ease it's a little bit unfair I would say I agree it's the jump Tower let's find some next bit I'll look plainly a good place I'm going you with such confidence here I know that if I mess up these guys are right behind me it's beautiful I'm not used to it I need to get high enough so that can jump off from these much your battery and have you finished before I land perfect be in trouble okay I thought we were losing the gunfight apparently not is that celebratory Mozambique firing I've so many littles unreal alright this is the most minefield what's I think I've ever had and that's then that same soon for me insane I don't need to knock their shields off first he's got nine shots the first six will probably take the shield's off and then the next three or the hammer pointin I hate doing this cuz it drops all your stuff on the floor and then they rob you stuff but it is good that the Lifeline has that she can obviously he looked in the middle of a fight really easy just loving it oh yeah so near these this way to come for the old flank I think all right this is my moment it's best to go on no shield to defend unified damage and I was burning to death poor guy a hundred and five damage I was gonna say in German but I don't know how to say numbers above 100 I can you forgot nights that's gonna switch for whatever gun we had and of course care to have a look at my look at this she takes him I can't drive too many things I say what I love he lures and I've got nothing else to pick up free I've got no ammo Mozambique stocked up on 48 shotgun bullets or shells in a good log place mix in white mag I might need one soon I'll have to drop this havoc I think probably for the best let's be honest / - rims Oh Oh perfect you know what I reckon the product it might be my favorite golf gun that's ever been on the team I'm gonna need some some of the heavy ammeter energies for the lifeline who's been asking for it I'm sure you could if you could trade maybe for some heavy rains and these guys had some yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure there's gum that's better than the gold Prowler that they brought out this like a legendary one there's never been a gold on tonight has that weirdly enough I don't think that has just lovely more I'm gonna spray to people Thanks this may be a bit of a better combo for me to try and make use of the Mozambique Lobby too no I'm not I'm not I messed up truly one of the most embarrassing moments of my life I'm coming T yeah Oh up in fire I'm I'm messing about I'm coming kind of I'm pretty sure to use a pleura she did it's on the mini-map my tell me all the way there but it's definitely quicker than running or I'm here there's been respawn so that means they're Sheila's let me shut it back this movie might be a different team from the car game ring Greeks born here where am I oh god see can't see nice that was so weird that was so strange I know that I I know that ID is right there but I let you I thought was aiming at the floor and I got so confused I think I ended up aiming at the sky in the gunfire the smoke was still confusing me thankfully my teammates managed to carry that gun fight because I did absolutely nothing we good yeah three squads left that's one of those bodies so you're looking I don't have to have it still I switch it over to select fire and the back of your head would have been falling I think it's not time if I don't tell me I've been closed up on a back here for damage my defense unfortunately he's got teammates promise gonna use these Mozambique Phyllis I missed who has a beaker what is this going what is if I knew is that good already use it beforehand I even need to knock her shields off you are the apex champions that was an incredibly fun game how many kills we get 27 kills in his squad we've melted we've melted half the people on the on the map four kills from life on but she still did 1200 damage you have the revive on mais well I 11 kills I did eight less damage then back to Slayer who did one it got one more kill because that eight damage I would assume and I saw we I tell you what I love those games where you can trust your teammate you can just grapple into people's faces and if you know you know your if you mess up you can hire four line your teammates to you know carry you to victory beautiful game thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
