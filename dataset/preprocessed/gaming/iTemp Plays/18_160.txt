hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i finally achieved another 4k badge and this time it's on a legend who i've got so close to getting it so many times before i've had a 3983 damage game on horizon before i've had another game that was over 3900 damage but today we just about made four thousand i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i can't get comfortable i don't know why my optimal gaming position is just not this is not working i do want to use the sensor i really don't oh my [Music] been god the guy wasn't dying why do i hit shots there at that range someone tell me the guy was not taking any damage that wasn't my fault i had a phoenix i have no cells might be able to get teammate cells he's left but he might be used to us yet ah yes please let's shift our orbits that way we've got a bad guy close there's loads of heavy ammo here and it's two teams oh why thank you sounds fun he's still fighting he's got a lot of health though and it's got pad to get us up top if we need to i'm on the way this guy again no more numpties oh okay there we go i have a thousand damage i forgot about that blue tang team i thought another team would like i did think it was kind of strange how quickly they they came from that way because nice enemy i'll play teammate honestly he's very tempted there just to burst for damage there's a crafter here though i think we just have to craft 170 oh my word 170 oh good grace that's a lot of damage i don't know oh my god where did the two times go ah hold on crafting watch out darling there's a gonna craft one bat i think i can go like this i think i can drop this and then go at this bam where did my extended man go it was on there tremendous wait just 60. sometime if you drop your gun you get oh okay well they were lying to me [Music] oh there's a chain here i'll do all right timmett you need to heal up me amigo  the old shield cells shield sail here uh you need to shield the you need to show the careful please be careful us oh my god thank you i did not expect them to come up i was reloading that's huge nice are these the guys that huffed in the whip well i thought it was a different team that's why i got so scared there for a second oh my team is to save me i did not expect him to rush up like that i don't know why well because we have the high ground and the rope is very loud that's why okay live i'm charging up nice teammate huge we've got these guys on the ropes oh god another team oh my god delicious another ah if i threw that because i missed an entire r9 mag on that pathfinder i'd have been oh god huh i need to um him get me out of there okay we're still alive we're still alive we're still alive okay i left my right arm back there i had to arm switch my accuracy scheme it's been good sometimes and then i'll make an entirely challenging example on that pathfinder does anyone know what happened there because i'm kind of confused so be soon i'm dead to go back i'm down to third party there's shooting people over here on the way [Music] should be okay this car has come in handy shields recharging was so weak two more squads we know where they are we know where they are one of them's gonna have red because they've robbed it i have one batterino i've got ten crafting mats which is annoying because there's a care package dropping from the orbit there's a replicator up this way absolutely zero way for us to get crafting maps at this particular juncture uh death box there is it's always here what's the deal with this death box it's always here isn't it a weird one this whole time evil shield here i can't believe we're not dying to prolong this i'm gonna be honest with you oh my god we need to get out of here we need to leave we need to go i'll say we go this way this way you can replicate incoming what if we had a third team right here this would be easy sometimes you can get over confidence situations we've played a little bit safer than i usually would and i feel like it saved us on a few occasions the car dude is proud you know that's why we need the tridents back but i'm in the middle of the map not just on the look at that just on the outskirts we need them right put them right in the middle here as a prize i want to land in the trident at the start of the game oh god do not throw my grenade i think he's trying to bring me a thermite grenade i don't know i can drop three honestly thermite grenade here i'm gonna drop mine pick a piece and then say thanks to keep team morale high the rings are neighbor pals and we've got about a minute to find her i reckon we should head here yes i would have taken the lift but it's so loud so gosh darn loud 45 seconds and the ring ain't far at all i'm really hoping they didn't come up this way is this safe the front parties i'm kind of glad it's not safe because i hate it when people sit up here and tonight i don't even like sitting up in myself i'm only doing it so they can't do it there's a good chance they are here that we're good okay now we need to do some reconnaissance where are these bad boys huh at least his team has blue check out that care package charges right the benefit to this situation for us is that i'm hoping that they're the ones that are going to get third-party there's no way to us we've got our baxter zone we're all the way up here the other team that's alive can surely hear this you want to get involved when it's just two of the teams there's no way these guys don't get third-party if it was me down there i'd be showing the back half an hour ago it's what i'm saying it's all i'm saying they moved into their resources like they are with me guy's struggling i mean they have to get third party they have to yes they are they are perfect all right there we go now uh now it's just i assume these are the team's a team of three now we team up with these guys i'm still gonna shoot them but i don't want to kill him still trying to annoy him still trying to annoy him [Music] yeah i'm running kind of low on it on nope i'm down to crap no cabbage i'm gonna catch yourself i remember charging this up replicator here we have time got to do some crafting dears this is 180 heavy crafted right now yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we get it we get it i'm trying to be crafting over here i can't get my stuff though the shield's recharging all right this is good kind of actually we're in a terrible spot i've just realized we're actually in a real bad spot i know it's you i'll get shot by two people at once terrible idea come on come on [Music] hmm [Applause] dude the team is not getting involved oh my god my teammates it's fine back fancy a stroll this way brings near darlings can we get on the roof not really there are no good spots left oh my god this is bad uh we can't get shot with the team though we're safe in this corner we're just chilling this corner we're just turning this corner for a sec oh my god what is this game kidnappers she came to collect the shield of her fancies i mean spare seen this one it's in this corner it's in this corner oh my god what are we gonna do i have one back two cells you need the cells oh no oh my god no no give my 4k give my 4k i've got my i got my 4k i did not meet i slid down the hill i slid it was a terrible slid no don't shoot me there's no way they come this way they're just gonna sit inside no no no no no leave me alone it won't chill just he left i didn't get to say gg nice try i didn't even get to say gg nice try are you kidding me god kill him kill him go on live why would you get the banner maybe she wants the armistice yeah get him mess him up don't let him win this ah ah that was a nice little slide massive shot to be fair i mean listen i'm so happy with that game i didn't think we were going to survive that long i got my 4k badge i
