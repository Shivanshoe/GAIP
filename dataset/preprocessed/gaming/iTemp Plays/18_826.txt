what you say yeah she repeated it I'll sure that means my friend I that is the reason I usually have my voice chat muted i unmuted sometimes from ranked Oh scrap Stasi teased my friends by the way if I append it in the London servers I usually get that question but I think it just put you in with European place and most people are come across don't actually speak English so I can't understand them I'm afraid that communication is actually detrimental it's actually better to have someone muted I would assume if you can't discern them because then at least you can hear more for game sound you know if you can't sound what they're saying surely having the muted I mean to faith you might be able to I've got this for guys find in all the our names gracias amigo I assume your Spanish here I think give me speaking Spanish I have no clue oh but yeah that's what that's what I usually do are you to leave people people muted but we're here in ranks and the reason I'm plane routes is because I want to try and get masters at the moment I'm currently in planning to which isn't the greatest rank of all time and this Frank season is a lot shorter than our previous Frank seasons because it's been too and there's a soft reset in the middle as well so I am gonna have to start grinding my friends that's what I'm trying to say here might be something good this way scrap so it's always so quiet in ranked mode no one no one comes here no one cares for some reason I've been watching a lot of streams and they're playing they're grinding ranked mode and there's more a reason for the top end players to in this season because only the top 500 players can actually make it to apex predator I've been watching like Co bean dal toosh nice week snipe down you know the controller players that play on PC and he's me and platinum to me your grind aside way too late single-fire hemlock destroy my life once more I thought he's footsteps with a pitter-patter averred scrap in the distance it turns out it was actually the pitter-patter of his loss feet on the floor I like the idea teammate sinking by him like man's their half man half single fire hemlock I literally wanted to do well answer to do was tickle him so you went back in cover you're getting rushed by the sniper guy to our side behalf guy of course okay well I bet again this ceased when you kill these guys literally three shield batteries that they've taken from me here got some replacement shield batteries well one shield battery I've got one kill no assists there actually I should get us that assists for taking the most amount of damage I was the tank if this is a MOBA if it is overwatch I've got none friend that's good at sucking communicate that if these deserve I tried living Reinhardt you know if there's league of legends I diving I don't mean Sion Oh tank Malphite are the one kill from that I probably did the most minute damage to outrageous he's alright though it's a long game plenty time to get some assistant kills on the board I'm just happy we actually got a scratch into capital city all right I want to get the best higher ground in scraps missing because we've made a lot of noise and people would have heard that from like train yard and if they're all taking through this is the place you want to be you don't want to let them get the high ground I know I fouled get under the zip line I don't know how I always fail those Ultimates I jumped too early I think any one fence I think too much Jasper I'll bet you it's rotating it would have been coal I need to learn how to ward run properly and I need to learn how to grapple as well apparently two things on my to-do list there are two scraps that one sounds closer Trainyard is always popping off less this isn't train yard this is sorting factory there's a trend goes through okay that's all got confused there's a care package right there that's a lifeline one I think the scraps clothes than we thought we are the scrap here we go Hey that a shield batteries using it was indeed it's for health again I know you're going you go an inside and you're gonna go up top I'll tell you what I'm not gonna let you pay French damn teammate Subin you mean there you go so that's a good thing in branch mode I can let you just let my teammate okay why was that door then I can let you to send my teammate get the girl because then fine it all the windows here careful friends thank you you read my mind thank you how many see the pores have I had to use the same I've used like for shield batteries and gosh knows how many healable actual like healthy levels my tears are just loosen up they're not taking damage though don't take that it's not it's night and worthy by the doors closed if I see in this corner don't don't open that teammate anything toxic no that's just my way of communicating he's not gonna do did we get closer alt cuz he's taking damage to I'll only heard one sniper hey what you got bait the shot he's cocky enough come back no there's another one okay multiple people multiple snipers it's a sniper heat squads I'll tell you what they're barely missing I say we just run I say we get get out of these are the best players I've ever played against don't tell my head off mother will rub my head thank you very much all right I just add a Phoenix kick and another for shield cells to the healable collection yeah let's just get involved in this crap and said that's my team is he maybe bosses my teammates at all footsteps anglers found the jump in didn't give a cue later doesn't matter doesn't matter some of the two assists wrote a what I think that text me to a total of five now there you go five I've got maximum points from kills and assists does anyone have purple shields anyone on this game there we go test be careful of the caustic traps let's just disappear does that mean that he's still alive because we did killer caustic maybe no maybe in a different poor thing where's the sniper hit squad they've got to come this way got a son still for too long because I've got a one time sage cog on my flat line and these guys have got aim buffs on their sense not snipers I think of the same thing I'm not even sure I want to challenge these guys as long as I don't start this on the way up we should be okay should we go it's gonna be from wife that must be terrified to distract their minds yes - day the flight is sold good in those situations that wasn't even the same team now we're gonna lunge they gotta try and get a better position on us here don't challenge am especially knowing that your ultimate how'd you not see me fly above your head it's purple arm now if I need to switch okay then chase me see ya that was the world's greatest outplay and you've stolen the kill and I got one syringe I was in that gibraltars head and someone has stolen it I'll just Phoenix kid then doesn't even have any syringes to tell me back to fall and adiphene added another finished kit so they may appeal for South use this game I am the meat shield in this in this situation a public some atomic health enough such a beautiful play - I'm phone aggressive no I'm standing this one for me yeah we are we survived waste it's good to try and save your ultimate the Pathfinder ultimate to get your entire team to the high ground rather than making it a little bit easier to cross sucker Canyon like this that's not worth it I don't know have only got five kills in this game I feel like I've peppered everyone up that we've come across most because I've had to spend half a game in the animation of Venus and one sad devotion that looks like a devotion is behind foolish and a melts one's face off of these I'm pretty sure I'm someone 100% win rates when I have a devotion oops please let me climb this this is horrendous there we go oh he's gonna fix myself deserve a golden up down rice ball back there [Applause] doesn't go God box okay he's got teammates somewhere then I can't like to pick up all the right stuff behind that then came short friend I've been misled once more these good fights are not and stupid idea this isn't what the devotion school app I need like a fair short to medium gunfight some waste time I don't even think he won't be destroyed in one bullet anymore they buffed it it's a tanky laughing now crypto drone at burn feats to the injury list here for me this game melted rights robot foot on the doctor's note these guys have ring yeah I know that if I set that whole team and they got BOTS and fences let's see what's in there he might need a distraction alright please don't rush me there we go this is the first talk on down the entire game somehow nice job teammates I'm that's I still feel like that was the right play my team I was in there under needed to do it - at least distract them I need to do at least a little bit of damage otherwise they were just gonna rush my teammate unfortunately for me I got to be want and one of them had nel start I needed going for this devotion is not worked out for you boy no I'm anyway oh I didn't get a decent good fight with the devotion I didn't get I didn't get a good fight that was good for this weapon which is a shame because in the right circumstances this is the best gun on the game I was like um often I guess a comedy saucy I'm more than that this should be more than enough bullets you're looking even though under he frightened the stupid idea anyway I think he's not weak don't mind me teammates Oh God we've done my mate I'm literally just using the 84 thing of all this game I think this might be to sell a players there I think it's a pathfinder this way and I think that a single fire hemlock user obviously a crypto oops I could have more than one person on each team already the Pathfinder go gonna be around somewhere there we go victories my friends you are the champion good grief that was a bit of a weird game I wish there was a staff that came up at the end he axed that told you how much damage you actually took in a game can someone nut no that's just that's too boring I was gonna ask someone to go through the game and see how much damage I healed up I think I used to Phoenix kits probably five or six shield batteries maybe twelve shield cells and God knows how many Gila balls in terms of syringes and medic it's unbelievable I still even though I spent half the game healing nearly dropped three thousand damage but a guy killed four though somehow it doesn't matter I'm pretty sure we all got maximum points there there's no way the race didn't have three seats in there we were always together we were always team shooting people I was actually really good teamwork and another ranked victory we are ranking up my friend in fact in a second here is gonna tell us just how many points we got hundred eighty nine not too bad thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one
