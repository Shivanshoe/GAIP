hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are saying goodbye to olympus i spent most of the season planning when i played apex around avoiding olympus because i feel like it runs so far in public games sometimes the length of the games are fine but there are often like 10 people left within the first three minutes weirdly enough though when i did play olympus towards the end of the season i often got my best games of the session on it so i'm actually pretty sad it won't be in the map rotation for at least the start of season 11 coming out tomorrow also my gpu code is 30 off at the moment this is the perfect time to get yourself a huge discount on your favorite flavors or if you haven't had the pleasure of

fighting oh you killed somebody because already yeah on my way i have one bat that's it five cells six syringes hey one on the side i think that was yeah i cracked another one sorry that's fine i must confess there's a level three extended energy in there though oh god this can't be a winning gun fight broke one of them i'm nice there's gonna take a high ground i'm gonna go around they're gonna try and take a high ground yeah defense is i have no ammo oh god i ain't got a flame egg on this oh my god what did i just double-time which you can't see god say already that's almost like 12 times does anyone know what my armor is recharging shields see if you're a real gamer you would have just kept your armor no i needed to switch you never swap i got ganked on my cat why is there an energy mag just hiding under this table oh i tried to get i tried to hide that from the enemies well i'm not gonna take that one i'll just make purple on this he got red that's crazy 301 getting nerfed i don't know i don't think so are you getting nerfed we're sitting down let's move i can't see i think i'm gonna i gotta look in the shot because i'm curious about that nothing's actually cool scan yeah it's good i think it's like the only one that i've seen that i actually like oh clean man clean you know this is this is what happens when you when you have the two times there's clean lines smooth the smooth transitions look at this no driving off the map no stress whatsoever yeah they're not coming over here yeah but someone might playing with fences very true crack them through the double door yeah but i think it was just one need one i'll speak on the other side i think i just i've destroyed a generator oh i can't push through that so yeah thankfully we had a caustic yep just trolls on through oh someone's doing my things things my fences i think wait i need a med keto you want to make keto i have 20 cells six bats is that enough oh no i think some more if you see him okay more come coming up right that's not yours oh my god i i they're focused on me they're focusing oh all today i've had so many kills and not that much damage like all of today i think i've been the opposite today i think i've had a lot of kills but a lot of damage yeah yeah yeah and i don't know if those two things are related in any way i don't know if we can oh they are they are i'm not i'm not sure before i'm not sure you can prove that though that's what i'm saying there is a lot of video evidence there's a lot it's concrete it's kind of crazy how much there is wait i'm actually the best watson listen to this i'm putting it behind these little posts oh that's clean okay that's clean what are we doing from behind the post they can't stream that easy oh okay okay okay okay okay i like it attention why didn't let me place this one i don't understand i was because i'm cool man that makes sense fidel cloudstro that's one of the that's oh my god that's painful how do you feel about what is uh what is the what kind of emotions do you feel when you hear that pain struggle suffering suffering is that an emotion it's got to be right yeah no it's more of a state of being isn't it suffering well see that's how bad the name is it puts you in a just the worst possible state of mind he i mean thinking that thing is one i mean it's whatever but then deciding you know what that's a classy i'm gonna make my name then he's he's something that's what he you think that was his bad brothers and he said the other day he's like oh that's a classic that's a classic way to the way it's the boys that's what he thought i bet you they had a they had a laugh at that too why am i rushing over to a replicator this morning answers on a postcard i'll be honest i thought that was a care package and they just like opened it really quickly so i was running over here that's not nice man fully loaded it's been then fidel was it hype to strike christ that is something else that's a good name i like it i like just looking at the names broccoli gage trying to gauge what a person is all about her name what'd you think about mine if you saw mine in the feed i tempertron yeah what did you think about it when he was in your death recap what i still see everything uh when in battlefield when i killed you multiple times on the flame no in apex when you tried to rush me and i just absolutely destroyed you send you back to the lobby uh yeah i do remember that i also remember killing you like 14 times in the game that you have about eight thousand hours oh was just running so i've one i wanted to kill you so bad you were trying harder than you've ever tried in your life to kill me it just wasn't working i wish the people could see that it was so funny okay just to give a little bit of context of what we were talking about here and this is the most random thing that i've ever put into the middle of an apex video but we were talking about a time that we played battlefield 1 like three months ago against each other i was on one team so if i was in the other team i've played a lot of battlefield 1 so far was really new and he got the flame trooper elite unit and if you've not played battlefield 1 before it is almost impossible to kill this guy in a 1v1 close quarters fight he has so much health and your best best is to try and melee him if you can get close enough anyway i'm going to let you watch this little snippet of that game and it was me just spending about 15 minutes trying my absolute hardest to kill so far if you're not interested to skip ahead because the end of the apex game is really good so worth watching oh i'm behind enemy lines what flag are you near i'm everywhere and nowhere rich man i keep telling you where i am but you will not say where you are if i don't see you this entire game i'm gonna be furious it's been a while you know oh no i'm going into a corner i'm going in wait do my does my health not regen i think it'll come back really slow but you have to wait ages that's why you need someone with you what are these ned's what are these these knees these ned's what are the necessary their flame mates where is the flame trooper i just want one kill i'll just ask my team where you are i'm they're never gonna know i'm invisible [Music] good i turned and somebody scouted or like pinged you so i saw your name and i just i just chased you i ran through the whole open field to get to you oh man all worth it all worth it don't often kill you with an entire clip of this i don't think you can unless you hit like all headshots that doesn't even matter mate no no no no running you're literally the only two kills i've got there's something wrong with mix you know i'm coming back and you i know you're coming back i'm gonna be in the same spot i'm not gonna move i don't know why i do this though i like this i like this it's all kicking off a day it's kicking off everywhere it's all kicking off over here i don't even know where i'm at right now did you move i'm with the squadron where are the squadrons are you seeing the hallways i'm trying to get back to you but i'm not even with like my actual team i'm just kind of running around so you're not in that same place no but i'm in the area are you at trying to get back over there like there are actually so many troopers there are there's so many it's great i don't i can't even get across like this is insane there's so much going on yeah don't even risk it our teammate is just going crazy he's like honestly like tom cruise going into the laser trip-wise the moment the whole gang's here now we're coming for you mate we're coming for you oh god not like this did you jump out the window you're talking about you were just i heard the flames mate don't know what you're talking about where did you go what i've literally spent my entire game trying to draw you back into here because i had dining myself i had dynamite setup and you know what i said it's all kicking off at d i was at the end of the hallway with dynamite on the door and i was hoping you're going to go over there and like look at the window i'm just going to blow you up oh my god i've been acting this whole time you're having such a good game get away from me i just did a lot of damage to you yeah i got help oh you got healed i got a big bag like three of them up here like a dead squad man i did so much damage um yeah i'm so mad that i didn't record that that was just like one of the greatest moments of my life if i could have sent you my angle too so you can see me like i mean oh it's kicking off a d i'm lying down with dynamite in my hand i've got the detonator in my hand dynamite all over the room i did not care you know just holding down like this whole section just with the flamethrower it's just not moving man that's funny that'd be an attempt that's the that's when i finally like learned to just record everything oh it doesn't even matter what i'm doing just literally record it 100 yeah because i was really sad when we didn't have that i had these two good times oh yeah you have it but not from my angle my angle was the best it definitely was there's four squads left this isn't one team there's literally four squads what is happening no one's done a long last time what's that someone's here that might have even been reveled there's a team in there there's literally a team in there they're in the building they're they're in the building that's what ping-pong no no they're in it okay do you think lulu 2008 do you think they were born in 2008 i hope not otherwise that sounds crazy but it's it's definitely yeah that's possible now 13. it's crazy to think that somebody blew gamer bluegamer oh i'm in the air that was their first one fight hundred percent yeah you can tell like how eager they are yeah they get like yeah they're like stressed out yeah you get like on on the edge of your seat because you haven't fought anybody for like eight minutes oh god okay at that range it's not that good which is kind of weird oh these guys have read so they are the skype gamers or what pitch on the back behind you yeah we're in the middle we're in the middle of everything literally everything i'm trying to get ta i don't know anymore smokes i'm okay teammate my struggle got to try the guy frame down one this one's close i think it's really in a bad spot a rebel thing that's huge i'm gonna fall back it's just the caustic over here right there see it made it to us that's great okay here yeah they cause he called me back enough is this not our barrel i even shot it i wanted i triggered it on purpose nice i tricked it on purpose and and went to sydney and took 50 damage uh send that to the devs tom i can't tell james we absolutely destroyed those shouts at our teammate mate he got rushed by those those guys again i know that's such a good scheme yeah he held it down he i don't know how he didn't die when he had to like rotate out of there wow look at that look at that
