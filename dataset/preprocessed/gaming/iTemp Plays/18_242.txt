hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the patch notes for season 11 came out yesterday and i was reading what people were saying about them seeing what the opinions were like and i actually saw some people disappointed that caustic didn't get a buff and i could not figure out if they were meaning or not caustic is a tank the guy's an absolute unit and he can lock down an entire building by himself i think he's in a great place though i'm not entirely sure how useful he would be on the new map storm points because it's similar to olympus with large outside areas where caustic just doesn't shine what do you guys think about this because i'm pretty sure caustic is fine how he is thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that's just not true do you know what that's so raven amber once accidentally called it that's so raisin and i've never let her
