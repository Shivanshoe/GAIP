hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing sia in some platinum rank i'm gold but so far it's plat and we are trying to get some rp together to climb the ranks and it has been confirmed that sea is indeed getting a nerf in an upcoming patch on apex as i predicted the very first time that i played it i do quite like respawn's approach to new weapons and legends in the last few seasons release them strong so they're fun and the meta changes to keep things fresh then after a few weeks when everyone's had their fun make the appropriate adjustments to them so the game isn't completely busted there's nothing more disappointing than waiting for a cool update only for it to be completely useless now for the nerf itself i predict that his skin will go down to six seconds from eight seconds and his ultimate cooldown will be increased a good amount as well oftentimes respawn don't over nerf and see will definitely be a strong legend even after these changes that's just my prediction i hope you guys enjoyed today's ranked gameplay please forgive the slightly scuffed start though i was just warming up but we did get there in the end so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that's like honestly that isn't that easy no it's not just because this is the this is where everybody like realizes they have potential to rank up and then they start getting like super sweaty i'm getting punched in the face there's a armor down here i'm just gonna hug it is that purple can you get over here yep oh wait wait that wasn't you come up behind me that wasn't you the revenant is one shot you are mean all right good price good rice good price they are pushing fire on the enemy i'm gonna try and go back to the boxes they all got purples now i'm going straight back here i'm frying them i forgot this is ranked i'm going to be honest uh i'll give you on your head oh yeah oh my god i actually i i might be the dumbest person ever do you running oh no running from me i'll just stay inside one's down nice to kill one team they're up here i'm gonna i'm

they're just crafting enemy view over there don't worry oh my god who had all this heavy there's a ton of heavy in that building if you need it uh i'm at you i'm actually good how much i got like 200. it's like another 150 in this and i picked like 150 i think he had like 400. she's just dropped it off ain't hobby senses his though i'll watch over here let me shoot he's pretty pointless i don't even see anybody oh yeah this is there's already a team big building 25 seconds and the ring closes my friends come on voting that helps anyone the stream here there's a team there then we have to play low ground under them okay do they go inside they're in the ch i can't they're not actually on my heart but yeah they run off they run off okay wait can you heartbeat this this building right behind me oh no we've met in it yeah that's absolutely fine you've been in there absolutely fine uh yeah we could just say if they moved we can just hold this they did i think they pushed like this way maybe like mid section i have it here guys yeah this is all safe they just cool off so fast i'm saving my oil i'm saying well yeah i think it has up to one has blue in there he has to come out there right here okay just saying oh they got in there already went in it's fine uh is there a team in this building right here uh not that i can see on heartbeat over there there's one out in the distance over there a little bit we still got armor yeah him twice can i come up i'm gonna check this building i'm gonna move a little bit can you can you see this building uh non-hobbit nothing on heartbreak uh we just play right here on the outside they all this way they're crafting but i think it's further back yeah it's in the it's in the big building over here he's right he's right on this door underneath wait till these teams start fighting they're gonna they're probably gonna fight before we do or this thing's gonna have to push us i don't think they are they're low armor he's not even hanging in this guy the other team uh that's up top yeah cause they're the most powerful like team run this door down that is i'll follow you come right here i'm gonna open my up oh my game who's ready careful i'm gonna go see it i think for 90. we're good right now we're good right now we call it this we're fine that's good that's so weird i'm gonna he's holding this door [Music] already low grain there i think it's a solo it's just a solo array then i think no rate this is right here i don't know if she got the revive on there someone's this way someone's right here there's one shot she's facing up i think that's the rate soon right on my door i don't want to break the story i'm ready to kick it for you i don't want to break it okay oh right here his teammate's right there i volts we're still above i vote for this last zone that's a good uh silence he might slide there's still a solo i think a solo ray from them okay i'm gonna go this way then i can't go this way i can't get to you hold on i'm gonna shoot this i'm gonna do this yeah oh i can't shoot it i forgot that i thought i thought you could i have to i have to syringe here that's just a ring chill i'm dead if i'm in this in the zone yeah we're gonna have to just hate you he's gonna be able to look down you're just gonna have to look up and shoot him yep he's only going to hold it for like a second he's trying to beat down he's trying to be done one's uh low shield shooting hold this angle they're gonna have to they're gonna have to drop at this point i'm just saying 170. i don't know i don't know what don't drop you don't have to drop that's gonna go they misspelled it yeah uh why not add zee this way um i if this guy gets a gun and he turns i'm dead well try to throw a nade at me if i find a gun to be it at me we gotta get him back for that mate i'm not happy about that no i'm trying to get to the solid building behind the roof [Music] okay alive me nice there should be one more on their team picked up our friends banner we can bring them back that's the last guy who survived i don't know what's going on there mate what a mess well nice clutch thank you i think i got shot by two of those guys and then one of them i have three people in my death regard but i don't think they're from the same team i uh i was so i was really wanted to stick the rest but that i didn't see the nade in case but i could hear it and yeah they're just running after us anyway good job back there thanks mate no problem my thanks on melee so just you know if i start punching you that's me being grateful is it

trees still oh yeah i have a flat line and a 9.99 over there i don't know if you want to swap i have vault prior i have no attachments for it so um they're they're already closed already closer very close can you get out of there yes get on this side zone is probably going to close over there too and we can hold this side over here um he wants to go top needs okay i mean yeah i guess that works i'm pretty useless a beer but i've got kb so yeah i knew zone is gonna close over there oh i wanted to take that spot over there too yeah i think we'll be we're gonna have to i think we're gonna have to fight this team right here below us okay fight them we can send it i've also bombed almost 50 on alt are they still there and do you see no no no they move they move right this way nothing a
