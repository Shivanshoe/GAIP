hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video and welcome to season 13 of apex legends of course today we are playing with the new guy the new legend the new hero in apex it is of course newcastle and i know it's a bit of a meme every season no matter who it is i'm always like oh rampart he's so good in apex or you know ah she's so good that was pretty good to be honest but newcastle meeman aside is incredibly good like he's such a scary 1v1 legend if you've run into him yet and he's got like his little bodyguard shield walking in front of him he controls the entire engagement it is so difficult to get the shield out of there he's fortified so he takes 15 reduced damage he's got a great passive to revive teammates and his ultimate is really good for getting out of sticky situations but also it's great of retaking high ground and i'm playing aggressive as well i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five
