hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i bought all of the anniversary event packs because once you have all of them you get your hands on 150 album shards which is enough to purchase an heirloom from the shop now on my pc account i have the octane and gibraltar heirloom so i had the choice of all of the others to add to my pc collection and i have heard rumors of a decent pathfinder buff in the next update so i went ahead and i invested in the little robot man's boxing gloves let me know which one you guys would have chosen in the comments section and please sub if you're new to the channel as i'm trying to reach 1 million subs in season 8 of apex we are only two and a half thousand subs away which is outrageous so thanks for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i am currently buying the boxing gloves okay oh they're looking snazzy oh purchase i am inhaling food yes look at me go all right i'm good i feel like people die quicker in this mode than the like regular one i don't know why that because the looks i think everybody just full sends with like mozambique's early game because they're able to yeah back here [Music] nice i don't think she even moved oh god i just literally picked a master for half a second and just doesn't masturbate what was it i have i have one oh well there's i think i think in this box oh nice wherever the wreath was okay i have two bats if you need one two that's fourteen cents um i have two i have twenty cells oh my god okay they're old they're going crazy people coming out of the phase okay a massive r9 so that's one oh no that's one shooting all of these i do not need that many shield cells you said beat me so i picked up 28 shield cells and i still got 24 i have to drop in four of them i have to drop the mask if i can't with this gun i just don't like it i don't care how good it is i don't like it it's one of these weird uh light rains there we go actually don't need that many i have twenty four zeros okay i have 20. so we've got 44 combined that might be enough to take us through this game uh don't really think so but i mean we can give it a shot i got 24 bullets in my bowl yay ah puffy cell phone pretty sure i had my armor like inches within bread and i just swapped and now i'm at 600. oh journey back the usual um i have two do you mind if i absolutely left that place i'm begging absolutely please okay thank you i do appreciate that problem my packet loss is starting to kick in anyway so you might as well do the majority of the work i'll try my best oh this is what i'm gonna go that definitely could use that see now we're even um i don't know if that's equivalent but i'll take it friends there is an extended energy magazine here all right i should have died there like when i was when i was challenging him at first right before he came in like 100 i should have died there but i think i only survived for the result well they they should have died too but this was just mirages everywhere i know so i don't know if i don't have a knight neither do i oh my god nice wow dude i literally called it out and you just decided to set it off and now i'm here slightly off yeah i apologize for that okay i'm dead what the heck is that he just took me from down there like there's something i got one nice i'm scared now too why are you kidding me i gotta get inside or something there's no if i die i'm going to start screaming i have no big heels oh no i do have that bat i just bamboozled 45 i'm trying to keep the cool coffee i don't know where he's i where you were on the left side uh low ground he's gonna climb up okay someone's shielding yeah he's under you somewhere back in i'm losing my mind coming back for you yeah yeah yeah all the plays you're just an absolute the whole time you know right nice dude kind of farm there hey good job we balanced that really well i need some energy if you if you see any i'll let you know i need some throw balls there we go ark star shield back phoenix there's no energy that i can see the lifeline would have raised but she fell too far down and that team might be i fall off the rock i saw that i was so confused what is happening all right i'm good i know oh yeah level four very nice not too shabby we're both i think we're both kind of fine how many kills uh nine kills 1800 damage all right all right i feel like you've got more damage less girls fewer pills all right all right i reckon you've got let me guess you've got 20 200 damage and seven kills no kind of kind of off yeah have you have 28 you have 2700 damage and six kills hmm you got the damage right but you're going the other way with the kills you have one kill man you have eight kills nine kills if your life depended on it you'd be dead by now i killed horrendous i have i have a nine i have the same exact cause in my defense i have another nine so once i hit someone they're probably gonna die because i have to be really close then you know i can't farm yeah no no no so whichever one of those you want to believe good comments come in hey yeah i don't even know what you're saying at the time i just say yeah let's farm damage how about that or you're just gonna and you're gonna die i'm not oh he's hardly gay i'm not gonna die yeah you are up i got respect and now i'm slow down here they have a turret so i'm not going to change that because i'm not a lunatic we can actually kill him we can actually kill him yeah we're the ones are going to get the hopefully same against their party i think yes or no um i mean i don't i think it's just one yeah this one okay huge huge huge we have to farm damage on the last squad so i'm going to 4k okay okay i got it i gotta i gotta prove my my point that people change their playstyle the damage because i really want a 4k right now and i'm at 3 500. let's just farm absolutely farm come on oh god up in the back for you yeah i i haven't had this angle i'm keeping that we oh my god i don't think this is going to be the team to farm damage on why not stand here and farm them they're kind of psycho is this dudes or cheers this is trio is that him left wait i want to get on the turret i want to go there um oh no oh my god it's destroyed what's your damage um i'm 38.56 i'll call you back i'm 38 86 i'm almost there oh thank you thank you for helping me that was good that was great i even got the air my new heirloom i managed to punch him in the face for the final kill so we all got we wanted yeah yeah strain is cranium awesome i did like the most insane ninja kick i jumped in the air and i kicked and i flew like 12 feet out of because i see if okay so if i wouldn't have known that i was that close to 4k i wouldn't have done that i wouldn't have asked you to like slow down so i can get the 4k so this is that's just like that just proves everybody's gonna people are gonna play different when they're that close to their they're like a nice little game you know it's true it's definitely true
