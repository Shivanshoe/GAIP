hey what's up guys twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are starting our Rank 2 Brian it's well it's not gonna be much of a grind because I'm not going all the way to apex predator if you do not know for season four ranks has been split into two separate splits the first bit will be played on at this map which is balls edge and the second split will be plays on in Kings Canyon which is going to be really interesting for each of the splits is six weeks long the top 500 players on each platform are going to be in apex predator rank so I'm not going out to get there because I do not grind enough I don't really play ranked with anybody in particular and it's going to be full of people that are playing so much more than I do with a full team so possible however we can definitely still get to masters masters this season if you're wondering is the same as apex predator in the preview seasons and then it's splitting some of the top 500 is then that apex predator a little bit confusing it's okay and because this is a new ranked season we got resets it's like a soft reset if you're in apex predator in the previous season now you will be I think it splat - I was I was placed in I got demoted from plat two to plus three because I played some ranked and I died with no kills unfortunately but I got a great game here for you today and I hope you enjoy so thank you for watching and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends planets have stories my friends myth me amigos that this is a modern-day tragedy good news is no one ever lands here for some reason honestly when I when I first saw this revealed in the season 4 trailer I thought planet Harvester it was gonna be absolutely poppin off then you land here and there's no one that ever lands here I am the worst player on this game good grief if you do land here this is the best placement holidays I made cute please don't oh boy needs it I blow myself a lava actually no that's not what happened that's embarrassing I was in a scrap that the start I was punching someone was having a boxing match that's what happened and he ran off he was to intimidate a mighty Richard has got purple shields I mean it's good for the team so I'm not gonna complain but if I landed up top that would've been me purple shields and I wouldn't burn my little robot feet I'm Martha either can anyone tell me why no one lens here honestly these place is so good for loot if you landed top especially I'll enter their captain of his last game with a game before I had purple shields I had like a level three Senate mag on a g7 scale with a good sized honey like there's nothing more that I could have wanted from this are the game but no one lands here it's confusing you guys we've lured this you know we may be ready for a scrap if people are already kicking off in this way capital city I'm gonna get involved I don't mind playing that a little bit aggressive here because good Wraith that was a - that was a - three out of ten as the least satisfying crap of all time potentially it's a bet now put it in for the award but yeah I'm in platinum because you get the soft reset and start of each or a ranked season and I managed to get to predator last season and then I lost a few games I haven't had the best of starts to these Frankel season it's okay because plans have you leave it alone well it would be a lie easier than either the months I've been planning in apex predator stats from last season pretty much so that's like I do I don't mind the placed on another one of those spots that you often think is going to be looted but he remains untouched for some reason I don t Matt let me lick this classify a supply bin and I'll be guessing the hacking freak involves you good-looking L star my teammates over there as well it's not interested here's the hill they want I didn't want them to finish the kill because now they've got purple fields here we go this man Thank You Lottie now some beneath us has purple shells and one of you the ones have blue shield so nice is taking something legendary as long as they don't come behind me you should be okay that works did you hear is he weak that's a sword trade that you take another your teammates come in and round the corner alright well that worked out well somehow I was gonna have respawn my teammate you silly because I don't I don't something's come over and fill all the loops how's that people are scratching already is it good idea to respawn they may be too destructive with each other to even realize what's going on here my team it looks like he's thought you know we're gonna need to protect him here alright that's not good that means it's like a full team please no Oh God risk it yet if it's got a what's in there we've just gotta Watson no no she was there no no one's seen a wall game OMG pop say that's for straighten cough down one of them and I got the other one one shot won't even tell my teen I said there they it's alright though does my not too much I already have four kills I need it like a one more killer one deceased and we already max out are you good no that doesn't sound so nervous using this gosh darn good team at you can have to be careful though because that full team the right path either Watson combination dunk done you can arm switch but you gotta come straight back you plainly fire friend brief time I don't just check let's go this way he can just climb this I don't know drop my office anyway because they could just rush us then something please don't say you're staying there we know it's a fourteen we know there's three people he's challenging he's gone no health I don't know what I can do about that hey who's the man with the ten-time sight if I can down one of them it's not gonna happen I might even get pinched here this is the wrong way we knew it's a four-team I tried to get in tobacco it was too busy loser unfortunately and I don't think I can change for too long because this other team is firing at me and they may come in for the third party it's just an absolute death trap wait such a good position there if you climbed up with me that would have even at a time for one she'll tell I reckon did he do that that's the second time at Pathfinder second time a path line has been slayed by a race but her shields cracked not even close wasn't even wasn't even concerned what one more tick of the therm lights and your boys room agreed my little feet were burning again right this is good though this is great news because now I can bring my wife back and she can just clear some of these boxes we've got Lutz close to the respawn beacon I'm gonna take too much sure this way you have to try and defend your teammates when you've respawn in there because it's such a especially in rant when you get rewarded more for a kill you know literally translates into into more points so people people become even more kill thirsty look thirsty kill hungry I think I'll let you just said a bit of it but still or does it distracted but tonight you came in for the free kill then you've got rewarded by the g-seven scamp doom long lives over here my friend loads of stuff I don't even need my ammo always been an island on as well I might have enough actual ammunition to run a g7 on outside it's it's kind of like in those two teens must have just gone further away I guess or rice bottle we take all the ammo big eater that's fine I'll just use the g7 then it doesn't need us as many bullets as the as the online tonight obviously I mean 270 still quite a lot we should be fine might be something good this way it's not the Watson we've just killed I'd reckon the someone camping up there all right that triple taking the distance sounds enticing but we will have far better positioning on this third PI over this way because we get a humungous cliff site here for me Cliff Richard this way please one shot I was trying to steal the gosh-darn kill that's what you get you gave me the kill I wouldn't show you how to let you run off into the sunset that's not true that's all it's all not name just like if he doesn't have a shield battery I win this gonna find by default if he's got a shield battery this is a 50/50 still showing up like a Murphy boy line of the boys chill tech man half man half double take of course only 30 seconds left on the clock the rings close I have so many levels it's not even finished by 18 seconds on the storm so scrapping the distance we're not actually that close the safe zone at the end of the game I like to give myself a little bit long but because especially in ranks it tends to be a lot of people gatekeeping the storm which is what Nitra darkest tone plays a team Candida bear it's a separate Watson campaign I've got very very good healing numbers here six your batteries 12 a shield cells six syringes and three minutes and now I use two things gets to methyl this isn't good I was gonna try and playing incognito here French answer to try house good I had to change to make sure they won't push in you gotta offers some resistance otherwise they just think it's like a solo and a brochure there and that's the last thing that we need we don't want them to push us because this team is camped up top here my transfer party the good news is they're not pushing either find com2 in here basic damage popping there we go I think we should rotate if this team up top rotates before so it's called a Rima groomed you know okay keep the storm if we can poke them just when the storms coming in they'll have to choose between healing to push us or dine in a song while they're dropping down they don't even want to use busy planes take that hopefully that time I change anymore we need to be careful this team I'm pretty choice a team of three Timmy careful that one is he plane a few exceptions to the protec I started by I seen as their I move that team up top if they wrote it rotated early I think that we would have just been caught in a storm like a kale credit be dies in the storm I'm not gonna stay on top because if you remember that team of at least two people and now then lended of toppers what it sounds like I don't think I'm safe oh it's all gonna kick off we should wait until it does we don't want to be the ones kicking it off we're gonna be the ones joining in he's not the worst thing in the world there we go nice job teammate two teams left official where high ground now as well we need to try and defend this high ground there we go last year teams over this way you actually have an idea on shields friend what happened [Music] am I not the killing with 13 kills [Music] [Music] was that glitch was I seriously not the kill leader with 13 kills in a ranked team how does that happen how close to 4,000 damage - because I dropped a lot 3600 if I finished about 4 more kills I've ticked over to 4,000 damage not a problem they already got the badge of course but it's always nice when you reach that nearly a twenty-minute ranked game my friend who's won revived - respawns I don't know what I could have done about the revenant I don't think I could have got him there was a team of three I was been Shaunda back it would have taken so long to kill a team of three the other team probably would've came over and throw parties I don't think I could have got him we should have just saw up top but anyway that my friends is a beautiful ranked game right there we are well on our way to diamond and after diamonds will be getting two masters there's not a chance we're getting the top 500 it's far too much of a growing here we got back up to plat two are demoted from plant two down to plat three we're back where we started thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed that and I'll see you all the next one [Music]
