every cigars each which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course from patch notes for tomorrow's update have draft players actually going to be a pretty big update we had a big octane buff what can only be described as a rework to life line at this point a weird half nerf path buff to Wraith but at the same time it's mainly nerf and fortunately we also have a nerf to the havoc just to name a few changes so let's start off with octane here the big thing is that you can now double jump with his ultimate ability whilst we now easily change direction with the second job this is huge freeze mobility and to not get beamed while seeing me there from his ultimate which was a bit of an issue even whilst playing octane his tactical steam is now 10% faster and he removes movement impairing effects some of these off the top of my head would be the Ark star or what some fences it's things like that this will make octane so much fun to play of enjoy planning this season anyway so you can expect a lot more octane gameplay coming soon on the channel including today actually I'll play demon ranked solo flies fast hill passive has been removed this is one of the main reasons a lot of people even played a lifeline to begin with it was always a solid choice because she plays her drone down you get a shield battery off at the same time really quickly and be ready to fight in like four seconds this will I'm sure annoy a loss of life line means but she's been more refocused into her supportive role she's probably where she was intended to be to begin with her passive is now reviving teammates automatically with her drone we saw this in the gameplay trailer we had a few days ago and her drone called Annie's now 45 seconds instead of 60 and the loot from the Ultimates also been buffed as well so on to Wraith now and her Facebook which is her ability now takes one and a quarter seconds to enable that's up from a 0.4 and in that time she's also slowed by 20% this is a massive nerf to race get out of jail free card that made her so slippery in gunfights however whilst in the phase walk if you can survive that long to even get there she's now 30% faster she can see enemy players whilst in the void it lasts four seconds from the previous three the cooldown has been reduced to 25 seconds visibility which was 35 seconds beforehand and her ultimate also gone nerf with it's been reduced by 25% if I were a lifeline or a race main I would be incredibly disappointed with these changes however it is nice to see some of the first on the other legends recently we've had the Pathfinder life line wraith meta for a long time now so maybe needs time to mix things up with a good barrage and octane you know now on to the big weapon change here in the hubba that has been nerfed of finally he now has a greatly increased horizontal recoil and has a reduced magazine size of 28 down from 32 it's much needed it is difficult to know how well o perform though without actually trying get out in game because they said they nerfed the recalled beforehand and I Rudy couldn't tell the difference whatsoever in other news the Sentinel also got another booth and now has a reduce of reach chamber time of 1.6 seconds that's down from 1.75 and the energized duration is now 120 instead of 90 seconds it's a fun gun I'm excited to try and use it more they want other quality of life and slight adjustments to legends and weapons I'll leave a link to the full patch notes in the description if you're interested in all the news so the gameplay that I have for you today is my first game in platinum for this season and it went incredibly well let's say so thank you for watching I do appreciate our Sewall in five and a half seconds my friends I'd be sati this isn't actually even let me use my words here a terrible plan because my teammates are going down low I couldn't see anyone land in there as well with them and I go up top here we can execute a pinch maneuver on the poor people that would have gone to rake laps leave some genies tactic and this is a decent or low dose well here we go triple take Arthur a wine with a purple extend light Mac jobs are good and blue shields I'm ready to go on race lap so I think let's go this is such a weird part of a map honestly no no no the protec iron sights are elite alright could run into three people here maybe there's even two teams that don't even know the other ones here but in fact that'd be way better things have been looted I'm just seeing 23 parenting why is that one one bully to add the three that it's fired I'm being bamboozled I'm not sure this is even worth it money he got through that may actually been the race laps part this isn't worth it just make up my team unveil my god that's right no oh my word I can't get over the wall in time why jump I won't give me enough verticality I'm afraid where on earth is the entrance where am i what is these plates teammates I'm sorry I don't know I'm doing here we got our family I found me I'm coming good grief I've never been so lost in my life just stay alive I'm coming five minutes too late I'm absolutely song to you short here I think that I think I have to come down he's a bit before stick oh it was the caustic oh my word that is a good job that Korsak trap didn't trigger I would be what is commonly known as scream aggrieved I would very much appreciate the purpose shields I'll only to a teammate if you don't loot a teammate that the freemen cities and beat alright nice uh okay we're safe kind of we're not safe but it's close enough he's gonna get a hot respawn besides the map is pretty quiet what I saw from the drop sheet I could come in useful there's an honor to well I've got a job take oh here we go perfect no fancies this tipper grabs free charge come over pick it up alright the last time I used a triple take you guys were absolutely fuming with me because I case missing its knife ammunition whilst pink and I needed sniper ammunition the reason I kept missing it is because I am not used to looking for that in in boxes I look for my ammo and jammer there was a scrap in the business by the way and someone did get a respawn I look for light heavy and energy and that's really it I am not used to looking for sniper ammo I just wasn't I wasn't even looking for it but this time I don't like a chain okay this time I will actually try to see if there's anything get a sniper ammo before pinking it twelve times in the same game that I needed all right please say the Scrappy's there we go someone's kicking off with a P 2020 hopefully that's the guy that's been respawned otherwise these teams struggle even more than I thought they were right and hello friend what's going on sixty half what's happen there Dennis another costing always that one down yeah he's popping about okay thought who's gonna peek he's toying with me I don't appreciate it well no lifeline package is that there's a person down here never go I'm not looting my stuff but they've got a havoc oh my god okay missing kids there we go no idea where you came from you're literally invisible afraid a lot of edibles good job I rushed over because life alone would've been out there he looked by the time I got there got the shield battery off now always snipe rammer she had a few bit saliva I had a few comments in my last video use the triple tank as well I've gained half thermite might have been so good to me today now saying you missed loads of scopes for the chore tape I'm sorry but the triple sec has the greatest iron sights of any gun on any game whatsoever teammates gimme a sec there's a lull in here there's a lot of people that sadly lost their lives in this particular tiny room oh okay there you go primer alright my teammates were fighting us mom they were fighting someone they were shooting at someone run over my triple take you know what I don't mind the one time station wagon it's the only accessible scope in the triple sec it's just as clean and I really can't be bothered to take it off I'll go that way our teammates wants to meet up I think but these ill advisable a low ground yes I know I know you designed it Watson I don't like this low ground there while you do your pre shapes there's no wonderful health the arm sweet chocolate bag as well just for the revive my team makes I got some good news and some bad news the good news is there is a massive scrap in the distance absolutely kicking off beyond belief over this way bad news these I believe there's some diving board leaves I think that I think that maybe six dweebs fighting over diving board that's what's going on here that they're fighting for diving board ownership when you guys are just Lanham it's all kicking off in fact it's all quite name I think one of the team of two waves may have my things victorious victorious victorious makes no sense I'm not going there solo mighty nice run away how does wait God not in know another costing I love I love fighting caustics in diving board this is busy this is all makes this multiplayer game of the year right here like that encountered we're going in you okay okay you're my canary so to speak oh nice that Kamath they care for the scrap awesome expecting that I thought though just gonna I thought for one I thought they were two and second of all I thought that it's gonna barricade themselves into that tiny room try and beta sin maybe try and cook the door off with a trap whilst I was in and then I'll see or something I thought I thought that man but apparently not all right well we got gold shields we'll be all right I think at the eve of shields which is a bit of a shame you know what sorry tool take Parker carries sniper and not switch it out for the craver to make any sense Rhys was left every squad as a full team of three I'll star spotted say no more ALS get me involved should've kept my ulti my team is on diving board oh good grief [Music] Richard I think anyone that I fire has had more than a hundred fifty health I parked my lifeline okay that was a mess apparently pretty sure my aim is why I hit those two shots and I miss that more on the damn guy now revives allowed the right as well [Music] the race for the we man this guy's trying to sell price I appreciate the teamwork that's gonna kick these pies enough purple shirts don't even want to risk this when they're more like blue boxes okay I think I've messed up here I've definitely could have got my purple shields I if there's one thing that I hate is dying in a storm you know I can make these Blue Shield's work oh look a bit easy now back at it just stop it jump down down on I'll spare you you're not going to you're gonna stay up there we need the Leviathans back and they need to just step on both diving boards I'm telling I'm stickety I haven't already made that clear oh my words got Blue Shield's Jill what's going on here hello this isn't good recharge those shields Watson I'm least hey this guy's gonna know that no one's off full shields on this game literally not one person only price is dismal Oh Sheila please Anita what and we got Messimer oh that that wasn't sufficient there we go didn't get to find my celebratory crazy shot either I take what whenever I see a Kramer I think to myself this is going to be a risk I'm either gonna be the world's best sniper here or I'm going to miss every single shot and not only embarrass myself but also throw the game for my teammates in this instance we were somewhere in between Oh Kate the first two shots were sublime that could be up the quick scope we have a head Shan the caustic and then as soon as I missed the shot on the damn player it all went downhill however I did hit two more shots which were key they will kick I didn't even get a single kill of that last squad I do hate to crazy shots on them and a bunch of our 301 shots and I got no kills it doesn't matter 13 kills my first a victory here in at the Platinum rank as well thank you guys so much for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
