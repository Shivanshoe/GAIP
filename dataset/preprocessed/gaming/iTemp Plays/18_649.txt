all right team we're going in our first game here of call of duty black ops cold war that's the one i know the name of this game oh okay okay my slide is on the wrong button so that's gonna mess me up guaranteed slides on a circle slide looks nice is that guy up top i'm gonna have to change this hold on get a bit of tactical on the go can't see a gosh darn thing friends someone seems to have thrown some smoke does anyone know where the flags are i don't really know what i'm looking at here i'm getting a little bit nervous a little bit scared oh they're fine over this way okay oh my god i see people i see a lot of people somewhere in this way too i see him trying to snipe me nice knife my leg friend i'm on a three kill streak so i guess this map is bigger than i was expecting jumping is definitely weird but they did say that they were going to nerf like uh some of the jumping aspects of this game i guess they spawned behind us oh it's what it said it was domination no wonder i don't know whether the flags are that they don't even exist i have three limbs one objective it's sorted by objective first which is nice but also unlucky because i've done one objective i'm not used to these these frames i'm not used to like i can hear someone at least the frames and i'm not used to the uh kill the view either so oh my god you can't abs whilst getting upset i'm trying to you are so incredibly loud that may have been the loneliest steps i've ever heard is pretty low let's make a move this is pretty nice spy plane my first score streak on this on this game how did you know i was here i'm actually fuming i can't see i was gonna say if i killed you out of laws i've got ghosts there's someone else around this corner someone's got a chopper so man all right i'm done this company's in my game apparently and they're definitely up here okay is that shotgun that you had too that's embarrassing now play my friend am i going to get my next streak any time soon like am i literally just going to get one uav and match because i can't cycle them that quick or what i'm used to dying and then getting like uavs constantly because i just get like a three kill streak tonight and then i'm off the game what's sniping like my time sensitivity i'm going to change that way too low way too low and i'm dead because there's someone up top and it's jimmy samuel savile all stunning grenade action i'm using the stone now apparently is this an smg i've got one of these i'm gonna wait to use my spy plane and then i'll guess i'll use that there we go one of these popping some artillery just one guy on and i've killed someone an absolutely outrageous artillery performance no idea where to expect these enemies though is that what's going on is this the reverse artillery tactic i wanted to kill him under the bus that is not a good fight that i should be winning there's no animation involved come on friend i mean this come on i know i've got a suppressor on but it can't be that quiet come on i'm actually annoyed i got that kill you should be ready for me helicopter is ready to deploy my chopper someone else got a chopper about 15 minutes ago but i've got my name so that's nice which is confusing because he must have gone on a big street because i've got the most eliminations so i don't know where my chopper was oh god wonder attack team i'm absolutely under attack anymore the artillery doesn't last long i can't see anything on this map i need to i need to play a map that's a little bit it's a little bit lighter than this i can't see where you are outlaws where on earth are you i think we've won tremendous performance 29 eliminations coming out of rich only the 16 objectives is this me oh my god it's me i don't show this i just walk up the stairs oh god no i look like a complete noob i just didn't want him to hear me that's all hold on oh please don't i see ya thanks for playing how did i finish second i need a written report on my desk and here here is the written report 29 eliminations 11 deaths 2.64 not too shabby on a map that i cannot see anything on and that's my first game all right i'm coming out and saying it i'm pretty sure this creep class is the best class on the game that is going to be my title um is it the only class that i've tried yes but it did seem pretty good and that's all the evidence that i need for my clickbait title now we're in angola goodness knows why we are in angola at the moment uh we are out here collecting dog tags i should have known sorry jimmy you took your head off friend lost some grenade action we'll hop up there are a lot of people over here oh good grief need some teammate assistance yeah yeah i get it i think sniper on this could be very successful probably not for me though because i'm devastated you must have seen my best class out because there's no way a different weapon could kill me that fast you must have already seen the video i just don't know where people are going to be i don't know like i don't like is that somewhere i can expect to see someone no but that one is no he was on the radar i reacted at half a second too too late i'm afraid and jimmy savile came behind me which he's not oh you're going to be dead from the first one i'm yeah i'm not going to i'm going to switch i'm going to switch and move on the aim assist is absolutely one of the strongest things i've ever come across [Applause] this aim assist has been on the protein shakes guaranteed i mean maybe because i've been playing apex on pc the ncs on that game on pc is actually kind of low people don't realize because of the like the good frames and all that good stuff take his head off who's next oh god there's jimmy he's moving up good i'm on the hunt i'm on the flank which way do you go oh god bunch of people bunch of people oh you've just been embarrassed no i was reloading jimmy you ultimately you're getting an artillery strike and i'm putting one here too so you guys are congregated and i'm not happy about it so there we go three kills i'm also the self-proclaimed greatest artillery striker on the game so far i think that is an accurate review my artillery placement you just mean tonight i don't know who it was but i'll get you attacked don't worry i found the best egg glitch come down this way oh you went to the left you know you know there's some people may call this camping i call it i call it just been absolutely dominant i never use this once last game what's it do again oh i can i can see them on the radar if i make noise i'll just click that so you don't see that all right no more camping enemy spy plane inbound i mean it's my plane i have ghost so i can release you just chill here and i'm fine you thought you had just thought you were safe he's fine playing huh i wasn't candid i wasn't camping it was a tactical bro a tactical horizontal maneuver is what i would call it but definitely not camping don't be scared but it's also like a nice little place to flank a little bit you know if they're not looking down this way no sniper load don't know if ghost to play or if it's like dead silence then shoot down spy planes perhaps if you're trying to stay extra stealthy i'm just trying to stay alive at the moment more than anything so normally everyone's looking this way because i don't think my teammates have goes on and i ran towards them which is never my ancestor on the guy that was behind is he shooting my body or is he just got the worst reactions ever i can't tell with these people i really can't tell if they're toxic or just really bad oh god this is him you know what jimmy artillery what i'm gonna go to the middle of the map to use that i need to remember let's use my like field upgrades more what's my plan apparently don't know what i've done for that but i'll pull it in why not there you go so you know what's going on here i get all these i want to win the game i should have an abs for that a little bit slow i thought my ideas was a little bit quicker than that he wasn't i was just like i shouldn't have challenged that i'm a lunatic i'll tell you what i'll do it again well i've got friendly artillery and i'm dropping it on there for heads as if arm would save you from an artillery strike i mean it's just it's just unrealistic should be challenging don't care hostile rtxd gonna die to a little i'll see card once more it's behind i'd see for it i tried to see for it chill calm dame oh wait that's the guy that she won by the last game just making sure yeah he has a shotgun doesn't he i heard it i heard him popping off he's got his past 12 on this map absolute psychopath i want nothing to do with him if you're using a smash 12 on this i mean good luck to you are we winning okay we're winning by nine that's 11. that's graduate by the way you're taking this jimmy i i have like over double yourself like this is a dangerous game stream but it's a dangerous game statistically i'll be able to shoot your body twice as much as you can do mine that's just the statistics behind this i can't shoot you body you're too far away i'm too interested in getting more kills get out of here jimmy this is a fun game i don't know if it's the game or like the oh god who's aiming to me it's this lad let's have a 1v1 i i literally pressed shoot by the way i pressed shoot on his forehead and nothing happened i don't know if it's the game itself or the lack of skill based and i'm not saying there's no skill based on this game i'm just saying that this is these are my first two games so it wouldn't have kicked interest yet everyone was leaking level one so the game just happened there's no clue i mean a dominant performance 44 eliminations 14 objective pills who we got here is the play from it's jimmy uh no he's having a [ __ ] feet on us it's embarrassing oh he's got his fifth kill you got five kills there jimmy and only 14 of the kills in the game what's going on that was fun though i'm having a 3.38 the scoreboard doesn't show my kills for some reason let me back out of this i mean my first two games here of black ops cold war and it was a great time
