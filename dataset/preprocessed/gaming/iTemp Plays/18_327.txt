allstar got another big buff this season and the spitfire was also buffed and placed into the care package so who's good with lmgs rampa obviously today i am testing out the new rampage lmg in the hands of rampa who gets 15 bigger lmg mag sizes and a 25 quicker reload with them as well now of course i don't play rampant that often so my shield placement is pretty shocking but i am getting better so thanks for watching i do appreciate it be sure to subscribe to the channel for more apex season 10 content and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends your timer out early

play life you fine 16 seconds i can party got him yeah that is all you unfortunately grab that banner coming back kha'zix team is still alive 10 seconds they're very passive it doesn't surprise me yeah all these cash apps all down here i'm just waiting on my buddy since you're back i don't know if they're dead or not um do you have any head on the low bro there's two levels actually there's another one up here i hear more though [Music] and i'm not easily impressed lots of stuff happening yeah wait they don't know if we don't move right no or you can crouch you can crash walk 12 no one's crashed shout out to your boy for going down instantly that's like man it's the worst when you go down right this time there's just such a massive scrap going on hello i have returned welcome back i'm in the zone i'm dead all right i've got a rampage and i've got some thermites take that and i'll take one of these i'm good this man just feels himself ah that was a lot of nades oh i didn't top off oh my god i'm behind oh they're both on that corner they're all together hold on two of them are up top oh excuse me yeah he kind of is huh i can't escape he never stops let's grab another team though oh my god no i wasted i suck i'm sure you do million subs small hands more canal bigger ear canals tinier canals are bigger pretty small very small big dreams big dreams big big dreams i see a purple i see a purple no it's not a purple it's a helmet it's like a backpack i'm getting punched you're literally watching me get punched i don't know why you all might wait i'm getting punched this guy needs to be executed i'm going to do it now nevermind there's a lot of people down here [Music] i'm coming i'm chilling i'm not i'm gonna i don't want to do that wait i'll just destroy this team nice give me a second i need to lose all right still looking for the rampage it's going to be very sad to drop it because i've got a turbo vevo i mean turbo havoc oh i will take that off here if you find a rampage with a good amount of bullets it's all yours forgot i was wrong um rampage is not here yes it is it's actually easy oh wait oh it is your name i'm talking about ah don't say that i literally just got you that you're welcome well if i listen to you i wouldn't even have it that's not true any thermites let me know if you uh i mean there's six in there but i can't take it i got one already did you hear the scrap to be fair this one sounds closer and better we have to be the most off better wait they're literally right here are they oh well we're already over here wow what's going on i know they were here i haven't heard them in ages they are trying to kill me oh my god what's inside yeah it's almost broken oh we challenged that's another thing i just start to hate controller looting it's bad it's just like a boxing thing more boxes yeah the worst relationship with boxes i just took a med kit from there when i had two already that's the vibe that is by far the worst thing i've ever seen there's a lot of stuff in here what is going on uh took a level three heavy i need anything which you see that was pretty oh thermite uh you know why i yeah i know why gotta hit fire more richard gotta get on that alc over clock tap strafing settings oh i'm gonna probably in two or three days i'm gonna um do that all that stuff so in three days you're going to do it two and another two or three days yeah i'm gonna tap yeah i just want content to begin with and then i'll start tap strafing oh yeah that's true i forgot you're going all out there's someone over there let me know are they close enough for me to pop a thermite uh yes oh yeah right in front i'll bring them over here they're just shooting me yeah reloading thank you that's not not in there that's unfortunate i'll try and make a fragment i'll put a frag in there so it happens straight out never know oh my god your bullets you know capturing all those blades it's hard to control it see with other people like when someone taps drive slave boys but it's me i'm just lock on i know exactly what's going to happen know uh it's because there's no images on teammates and it's it's my aim is so pure and good you know yes yeah yeah you learned that from steady right uh my days as a steady gamer i had to overcome a lot of adversity yes did you know how frustrating this game was we're not like i remember me i just i'll be playing it during what i'd say all the time i'd lose a good fight like this game feels so bad like it just feels awful you hated it like you just hated the like the gun play in this game so much i'd play card and i'd be able to shoot and i played something what is this like why does he feel like this i don't know why we never just came to the conclusion that you're just on the worst settings imaginable i mean like we talked about it but i didn't know like i i never really thought about it i was just like i don't know maybe it's just weird yeah because like exactly because no one plays eddie you haven't heard good or bad things about you because no one even plays on me well i mean back then too not many people played linear so i was just kind of like i don't know like everybody's kind of being different everybody's trying to do something different so i was like i'm on linear he's unsteady everybody else is on classic we're good i'm a veteran fps gamer you know i've been around you would think that i know what i'm doing first thing you did open up apex day one nothing else just go to settings steady all right steady uh ads 10 regular 80 regular sense one these are the cleanest ends to be fair the description for steady sounds kind of cool it's like fast movement with steady aim or something like that yeah it sounds great it sounds cool when i first read that i was just like wait do i need to be unsteady if you play steady we'd never have talked because you wouldn't have been good at this game and you would have quit oh 100 i i'm way too competitive with myself i would have already just moved on i feel like i can hear someone ride with me i thought i heard a revenant climbing but do you have any thermites thank you i gotta throw my free by the way oh thanks man okay good guys so far i should have got call back i still need you somewhere in here i need to find it oh it's in his it's on his body six you're gonna go down where's the frame someone had a red uh it is on my it's a full-time job i need all resources at my disposal every morning right that was the one team it's about to run in there um any thermites there's one on the ground all right i have i have one that's two that should be enough for one team right thank you i should be do you hear my title uh yes you thought the rampage was good before what do you think that's pretty good this summer one man one rampage that's like that and then you know it's really strong and half the people i haven't even played the game yet package is coming in all this guy's just out so you're just like already is so far ahead you're like four chapters ahead and oh yeah and i can't keep up they were holding us on high ground but now they have retreated um would you like more thermites yes please and i'm pretty sure that's the first shirt i've placed all game um can you give me a hand i'm stuck down here uh there is a total of four for can you really knock it up oh my god that is honestly isn't that real you know you can just climb this little wall no i tried no it's impossible it's no no when i did that when i did that yeah they shot me oh see this is a solo no i don't think so well they've respawned so oh he's got a flat line be careful nothing's rare i'm charging i'm charging i'm charging up oh what the heck's happening i i made him run away i'll gun up the rope wait how does that wait i'm actually gonna get hit by this there's nowhere i can hide ah oh no you're dead i just take like three of them they're gonna push 100 how does she know i'm there what
