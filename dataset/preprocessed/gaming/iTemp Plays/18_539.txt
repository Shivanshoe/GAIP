hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are testing out janxy's controller settings here on apex the problem is and i didn't realize this beforehand but um but janks is kind of oh jank's janks is a maniac is what i'm trying to say he plays on seven seats which is just so fast it's way too fast it doesn't sound too bad but the increments on the sensitivities on apex are just so high the difference between a six sensitivity and a seven is astronomical it's like double the speed look at this clip okay when i ads and rotate it's the same speed as me not ads it makes no sense to me i have no clue how he plays on these settings and he's still such an amazing player but i hope you enjoyed this game that i got thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i had a wonderful time dude start the game first game on we crash oh yeah oh i know what i'm going to do i'm going to

there's a guy up here an octane up here need to recharge me hello little octane guy where'd you go oh heavy ammo he's on me i'm mixed obviously i'm just watching the ring though obviously i should go without saying i'll just tell you when i hit them thank you where is this little weasel oh he's healing off somewhere yeah i mean oh god half the squad i heard him pop and sells unless you pop sounds did you get pop songs no i heard someone pop a cell too this is the sneakiest little octane i've ever seen him oh he's down here oh my lord oh the other team they left they left the other thing you're looking at the epitome of strength and brutality does anyone have the backbone to face this comment oh we got one let's yes go i did it enemy taking that team is coming up right here this is you this is you this is you ready for this hold on he's down there there it is my word i am good at this game it doesn't matter what sensitivity he plays on he's got it under control i feel like i spin the exact same when i ads or not ads like it's the same it's the same though there's no difference it basically is yeah like i'm hit firing everyone it's awesome isn't it um yeah do some wall jumps dude it's fun i mean yeah that's that is fun hold on hold on ready for this one okay where's that okay yeah we'll put that we'll put the the wall jump on the back burner for now this way right yeah it might be this i know the octane was instead good we're inside they're already scrapping someone hey oh my god gun it's the headlock it's the hem loss oh you died yeah i died when did you die i know i got three kills and then i got shot in the back by ding colbert i think you really died i'm sorry it's all in the spins it's it's the it's the bedazzle that you put on your kills yeah make it look really good yeah the bedazzle it's yeah that's exactly you know what i feel it may you like the lingo yes uh germany oh no i have about that i dropped the phoenix kit here and i've got three batteries i'll drop a battery in there too um batteries in there oh thank you i do have a bat so if you need that back let me know no i still got two i'm good thank you okay we have to cheat it's got time oh what a fight rich this is fun this this is uh this is a battle sent them all back to lumbridge dude it's got gold over here let's go this way you want to go uh check it out yeah let me see what he had another gold skill you can run two of them i'm actually impressed that you're using a scout to be honest um it's got a 2-4 on it oh a lot of it a lot of energy i need that little turbo i hear a car oh this right here what do you think is over here well maybe make some noise oh actually we should get back into the arena let's fight the arena again yep damn let's keep collecting boxes bodies on bodies on bodies if we fight where the boxes are we just got infinite arm switches well lots of them are definitely empty i was i was kind of flip-flopping through how are you doing oh we could just buy them all up you know start making some noise for him we could i'm gonna have to drop one of these phoenix's i feel bad because you gave me one but i i have two that's basically what just happened here we were gonna leave to the east we were going to the east there yeah and then five teams pulled up behind us nice spots hold on hold on hold on if they hit the rope if they hit i mean i was bouncing up and down so oh it's a wraith and i ads on it oh they see me they see me 3672 i miss every shot by the way you're never my fans i'm gonna hold up oh that's another team how'd they find us here we go lifeline practice oh come on come on do they know there's people closer they're going to see them right oh and there's a team behind that now it's three teams here all right see the hands nearly cracked over there i'm not ready to be honest i don't want to use the hem at this range it's just not i know it's that thing dropping it's uh careful yeah someone is eventually going to try and flank because i reckon it's his team they push up into the building they spotted me i'm taking shots recharging here take two so you have full stacks thank you i'm not going to beat these guys we lose these we lose these fights bombing damage i'm gonna try not to get hit though i think they're they're right here down on the gibby oh sorry i'm down on the kozak's kind of a waste of time because he's just gonna get bubble raised wow oh here we go yeah they went in the ring they're hey look at this game knowledge i knew it i hit the race of 72. 51 head shot she's really weak oh she faced to the left she in the book she's right in front of me she exploded me she exploded me i have self reason to pop it i thought you did i'll cover this he's still sending me i'm gonna try to get this off i'm scared you should have time nice job well played dude my hero one spot closer yeah i know you can finish uh yeah definitely or did they not come over oh no they're here like down like what's the race guy to this team she right back they're just up this way red armor on one is there one here yes behind like the law yeah you'll take this pair with me uh yes which way you're going to the box ran away [Music] wrong angle mate my close range is so bad nice almost cracked out of the air i need to just use escape my close range is so bad where did they back up to you i don't see them on the boxes right man these guys are they got lasers on them they're beaming me any cracks rising there again all right i'm locking up we have separate angles and she has not yes finisher [Music] dude you actually did really good you were frying everybody only with the scout like if you see my close range vault oh my god really it's tough it's so difficult i can't believe i killed that wraith that got like the high ground and stuff like she was pretty good but oh gj good job you can't you can't teach this you can't teach it and even 2k
