hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going to be playing some bangalore now back in the og apex days bangalore was my first mate i got to 2 000 kills with her before i got above 200 with any other legend and the reason i started playing bangalore to begin with was because shroud used to play her a lot and i just copied him but i realized fairly quickly just how versatile she's sometimes the best advantages to have with characters on any game are the ones that don't require any player input for example bangalore's passive gives her a speed buff when she's spotted which makes it easier to get to cover or just to outmaneuver your enemies and now this is amazing especially for me as a new player back then it didn't require reaction time or any input from me i was just speedy she used to be speedier too i'm fairly certain that at one point they nerfed how fast her passive makes you but she's still so well balanced in my opinion she'd definitely get more playtime but every bloodhand buff is unfortunately an indirect bangalore nerf i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah yeah we haven't gone to the fight night in a while oh we have a good point there's care packages near finite so we clear up here everyone over there maybe yeah i've got double [Music] just no armor i dropped the there's another 9 in that build my things did you get it yeah i got it yeah yep one splash yeah i felt bad didn't find any armor i mean like doing like four damage per kill right now that's the dream get that firing yep yep there's a shield down there let's relocate here i can just show you eyes of them all right oh yeah i didn't have a bag i don't know why i didn't go to that one here we go i think i chopped up level one oh it's all good miles away don't worry i got you covered with some smoke so you guys are faster he's running uh this way he's running uh the middle part harvester whatever that's called harvester turbine memphis this is oh god that was close that was close i should never bag i am just i really should have grabbed a bag uh yes oh thank you over here see if we can just punch someone in the face i mean yes usually oh big scan hey huge how do i get up there quick stop killing each other please stop wraith 4793 wow okay that's actually pretty crazy angler is broken half the squads are left there's another team though i think i have my shield up you got time you got time to pop about if you need to get my shields of recharge i tell you if she's pushing she popped it back to you she's just chilling behind that have you got a name i don't i should drop and send no back should have arm i think i just took the one from you are you good she started throwing hands mate should have hopped in the boxing ring wrong place to do that i didn't say i meant it broken hearts they're looking at my banners especially and they're thinking what the heck this guy draws to the wonders look at his banner he's got two sniper kills and two finishers oh right here oh that's over there oh how do we get there uh in this side i think devo sucks i need to drop it close range oh you just you lose so many you just lose i feel i don't like losing your mobility either yeah old father give me something this way here right i mean i technically wall jumped but it was the weakest wardrobe you've ever seen did he i think he was trying to leave he might have been getting my shield i have so many shields do you need some shields mate um i'm good on shields i don't have any bats actually uh i have four sorry are you covered i'll drop you some near this um jump tap shield battery here i feel like this is a low i'm gonna jump this way let's reposition here oh you're just getting nothing from the jump tower because you just have to fall down i don't know how to explain it yeah the jump towers are kind of weird on this map they're blocked by so much yeah it was blocked that's the word yeah see i got you with the words thank you i'm giving him the chimney i need light ammo i need light ammo yeah i feel like they would have had some but i wasn't looking for light ammo at the time it's only now that i've realized that i need it taking a moment it's fine like stop target over he no i stopped should be on the other side over there i see the car i think shall see to the back comes the back come to the back are they taking a moment he got like 30 seconds salute oh my god you're the best i picked it up for a second you guys are crazy oh look whoa where did they get how did they get there i ran in a circle with them i didn't see him i thought he was still this way what's this place here run around around the rock yeah right in circles together very nice ring's nearby one minute till close i think goes so far it does it's kind of crazy i think if they designed it today it would be like 10 minutes max i know what happened i don't know i was i was just thinking about when they took out bunny hopping like why i never used to do it i could never even bother to learn those mechanics because back then you didn't need them really no you didn't but that's why i dropped 20 bombs every day that's why i dropped my 11 bombs i mean but you also were dropping like 200 000 views the dust wake of it i know i i when i was playing with um ragtag i called it i said i'm gonna hit some with this fire into the sky hit someone you didn't down on the right you hit him i actually directed no i didn't doubt him i'll just say if he shall ten shield i got it but it was still good just an impressive what you need to do is every time you like lazy somebody you uh you know how when you when you laser someone you get into like one hp it's that last bullet just isn't enough uh just shoot there's just shoot your smoke at him i'll try it i'm gonna try and get a kill with it i'm gonna get the last kill i watch him do that all the time oh really yeah he does that so much he'll like laser somebody and they'll have like maybe like 10 health left five health left and then he'll just shoot his smoke i've seen him do it a lot too so it seems pretty effective actually 10 them for you oh nice nice okay that was a bad part of me but i had to commit to it did you get caught in the gibbon um yeah i mean i was pushing at such a bad angle but i just i had to commit i kept mixing with her i was trying to hit the lifeline first because i knew if i'd done the giveaway should just get a free res that was kind of close lifeline i don't think there's a lifetime there was a i think it was a lobby that's what i went wrong that's where i went wrong from that far it looked like a lifeline yeah the characters do look different they're okay by the way enemy inside that's a that's a connoisseur i'm looking at are they actually up here yes or did you just see this this side no i swear i heard them see a sign ridge i heard a sign i need light range i should have picked someone from them there you go they just found that way i need light rains i don't know why i picked that up i already had gold guns what'd you pick up does anybody i just i just swapped my my guns that weren't gold but they had gold attachments because they were actually gold it was a hen like that it was gold but where are they all they're right here he's cracked beyond belief in himself had a massive death slide just no no uh down the path over here but where's his teammate oh he's back up he had a ratio oh is it just him it's in the face nice very nice i can't wall jump i can't i can't i'm dead starting of it no i literally found like four of them max champion furious well this video is not going on youtube i'll just cut to this part oh wow you're farming i was kind of beaming i was beaming and scheming at the same time bangalore's fun
