Harris of Gaza to reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course today I've got another Gold Rush chose the gameplay for you and I'm going to be using the g7 Scout despite the success of my Craver usage yesterday I've decided to stick with a g7 and again that I've glad to show you so if yesterday's update came a few different changes to a few different legends a few different guns for example Gibraltar got buffed for some reason fortunately I played the game with a Gibraltar who revived me about 73 times so I was able to see how quick he revives in the shield I'm showing you on the screen he's now life like he's got a ginormous shield that covers him from all angles boss he's reviving and he revives quicker in that shield as well he's got fast hills for all of his team in that shield it's got the world's greatest ATS shield one of the best Ultimates on the game and it takes 15 percent reduced incoming damage which is extremely confusing because I didn't think he needed a book and I don't think many people did either oops I've got a few buffs Wraith got a little bit of a knife and they also removed the energy max they said this was going to make more sense in season 4 but these proves that they can still make changes to guns to remove the magazines and then to increase the magazine size however in my opinion they probably should have nerfed the g7 at the same time just just reduce the damage numbers it wasn't that much of a problem before season 3 I thought was pretty good before season 3 as well they could literally revert this gun back to how it was in seasons 0 1 & 2 and it would still be a viable gun that you can pick up and use but you will not be dominated by a full team of DoubleTap g7 Scouts you know I think they will make a few changes to these weapon in season 4 or at least I hope they do what they do is they change the meta on purpose that make some guns way better than they should be last season it's the alternator with disrupter ohms now you don't really see anyone use the alternator and it does give the game a little bit of variety from season to season but within the seasons themself individually you just get a lot bit stale because you get g7 double time and all over this gun and I'm g7 people back anyway enough chitter-chatter let me know what you guys think about that in the comment section down below I'll let you enjoy the rest of the game thanks watching I'll see your five and a half seconds my friends okay my friends Mirage Mirage it is on marriage voyage marriage voyage is the culture people would say of course loose another team here I assume there's going more than just that wanted the team though this place is usually the hot drop why now if he's my gun parodies well guys can find any weapons which are they didn't like this supply bin no give me that back g7 easy subpoena on this game-mode levena the same never Scott as well not looking good team I get in there I don't think he has any armor mess him up there you go sometimes go put but faith in the old teammate you know I didn't want to run over to me and revive when I knew that guy I'm 37 I hit him he didn't have any [ __ ] with her with a mastiff right trying to get in there and Messi's life up and that's exactly what happened you got to make sure not to spam pink team Ashok because then they need to listen it's too distracting need to get your point across and then and then stop this people the spam thing in that was relatively successful four kills I'll take that else isn't it too bad on this [ __ ] that's two really full teams pretty much thank you friend level three sheltered kind of difficult to fall in this mode I don't know if the volute distribution is different I've got somebody syringes get out of here I'm gonna try and pick up more throwables if I can I'm gonna stack the light ammunition for my g7 as people scrap in a train yard with a loot distribution on this game I saw weird I'll in the game with three cause of my inventory full of shield batteries and syringes I know you're saying that's every single video it's not it's kind of if I can help if I can I'll have 17 your batteries you know if I can but this mode is the only mode where you can have that if you wanted to if you picked up all the ones that you saw and these guys really close or what fun here oh it's got a dream machine it's got a gold type machine fully upgraded doom machine not my name escape that's the thing with this game mode I'm not kind of scope you've got friend and you do not want us to get too close is he like to stumped best on the game but I'm not a fan of the scope mm I don't really want to rush that way I don't know pinch myself get on anything he look to you put their friend I look if I bring that I don't know you call it it's not Kevin I just call it a chug points I don't even know what to call that I'll get tried rifled in the back and then I'll run in their half shield or whatever and I'll just get that line into something me sick teammate doesn't do machine there anyway on our plates I'm sick of them don't worry about 29 I've got a crab come from sleep Zig what I'm saying so you carry throw balls on his mode the asymmetry inventory space if you rockin a gun from a care package no need to carry I'm jammer annoyingly I she was jumped over but some idiot is throwing a smoke grenade stop that's stopping hey what do you that he's creepy what was that listen I've got to excuse he's there first of all I got a me see some of the guy that's domed not no idea why that's the thing name I mean for a little while a second of all because he was using a crabber I should probably give this to the Pathfinder right just because you've got a better ability than I do this smokin it's good but you can stack it you get two of them I mean the the grapples way better I mean I was tempted to tell my back on the g-seven then I probably kept the crab if you had some ammo but you know what I'm glad I've got these three seven instead if I hear anyone else with a dweeb machine or a Kramer or even a Tribble take okay I'm getting in their faces because they cannot compete at medium range upon that race we've landed the crab shot of destiny if they literally had a flatline secondary or just screwed there but instead what they did was run toward me for no reason you could you see my friends so I thought no I agree I feel like I got away with something there the race I keep thinking about it and she and she was listen I missed so many shots because that's a scrap because she was reloading the crab all very chambering whatever it's called I done on an on Wednesday so she her strikes were too quick they were weighted quick I wasn't I wasn't ready for it those my excuses and that's what I'm seeking to oh that's me he's got a g7 as well let's treat him Russian acid mistake I'm trying to play Rudy aggressive but that's just stupid there's a fine line my friends the whole squad no quarter tip is out she says I don't know thank you I feel like whenever I ask you guys what it means when angle or say something like her voice lines it ends up being extremely obvious like once I asked what 3 0 Mints and it Leitrim at 30 so I'm not going to ask you I figure Eight's no quarter given no I still know what it means I agree I don't know where we're going but I agree up there yes let's do it using his shield cells I assume he's got Sultanate all right the g7 I've decided is mental I would if I was to write this when I have 10 I'd give it a mental out of 10 that is how good this weapon is you have to awesome a friend I've been okay could behold that - heard that ring ain't far half of one I want to shoot but it's not worthy because my teammates using a triple tank he sounds like I know what can this gaping French shooting as this someone else our missile player so he's so low I can't compete there I'd said if someone I'd like a long-range gun I'll get in their face nice good shot cheese fingers unless that's a head shot which is very unlikely even if it hits me it's not going to kill me Oh son self to longest they've both got cravers so take a few shots make them back up that my spoke in my defense I couldn't see anything when I was throwing that the Sun was in my eyes and that sounds like an excuse but rewind it couldn't see it gosh I think there's what happens and you fight someone that has a craving that they just want to keep backing it up they want to take shots from 200 meters minimum I can't compete at 200 meters I can't climb a map copy the mighty my choosing a Tribble tape by the way one of the worst cold goons I just can't stand the sight on it scratch on that way too I assume they tried to push the team that was going a respawning how did you get on top of this building by the way not sure these gonna work I'll give it give it a go it's giving me a concussion that's how I run away even further good our team does not want a scrap supply sipping ulti all I want to do is get involved in one of these fights that's all I want okay fair enough one squad left Handan do you miss whenever as well to get there before the revive comes off day three they come back through you can compete get a mastiff and I'm not sure what his secondary was right shoe mr. Kramer and if you keep them at that range just like saw a medium range a scrubber grood you have to be careful though I mean I know I've got crane but in that game I lost very tempted to take a brother Dean because the g7 is too good I mean they they nerfed what was it that whilst they done they buffed Gibraltar which makes no sense I mean I probably talked about this an injury probably heard me talk buddy buff Gibraltar mating life line 2.0 they got rid of the extended energy max which is a bit confusing they said that was like a season 4 thing reduce the number just reduce the damage on the g7 that's what it needs just like take it down to a 4 shot kill if they have no shields at the moment does 133 damage so 2/3 shock he'll it's too good it's way too good anyway thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
