hey what's up guys twitch welcome back to another video today we are going to be actually reacting to my first ever good game of apex legends this was uploaded on the 18th of february 2019 so exactly two weeks after apex came out and i saw in the intro i was level 28 and you can see here i played one game i got 21 kills i got nearly 4 000 damage and this game here put me number one in the entire world for kills per game on pathfinder as 21 kills per game if you can divide 21x1 you could have figured that out now some of you may not know this about me but i am actually very talented at reacting to stuff people come to me all the time they'll say rich what do you think what do you think about this and i'll say oh so that's that's actually pretty good it's decent uh and they will really appreciate that feedback so i thought i'd take my talents to reacting to my old content so this would be a bit of a treat really all right let's skip ahead to the gameplay starting shall we where did we land we landed at the diving board of course we did area right ahead of me oh it was the hot drop too i was a psycho maniac because it means i'm going over here look at the little pictures why does pathfinder look why do these guys look so different i don't remember when they changed that what have you got for me g7 g7 scout off the bat i remember the loadout that i had this game was a g7 and a parallel and i remember that because every day since every time i had a g7 and a prowler i would say this was the loadout that i got my first 20 kill game with um and i never let anyone forget it here we go gold prowler tremendous i've got a sniper stock and a six times on my scout um which does seem a bit excessive this is me trying to millimeter scan people if you guys ever played cod there was an mms site which stood for millimeter scanner and you could see people through walls um and you would you basically hide behind stuff and scan people through the walls like that that's definitely what i was trying to do even though the game had been out for two weeks which is actually kind of a long time i hadn't played that much i was slowly level 28 i didn't really have any idea what was going on now he's got a mozam you got to be careful here oh god he had the shotgun pistol he did as you can see the mozart is still alive yeah they were getting shot outside he had a shotgun two level one i'm surprised i managed to kill him with a fully kitty prowlers both my teammates are dead something's never changed i've got a shield battery on the floor but i'm not going to pick it up could have done with that is this place all glass now why does this place look so like light i feel like through these windows well you can't are these windows like this now when did they change that maybe they didn't maybe it's just the lighting on king's canyon that made all like that foggy red they put that everywhere for some reason all right well at least i took the six times off the g7 i was scared that i was gonna be running around trying to hit people from half a kilometer away with this gun when the bullets travel so incredibly slowly that was uh that was an r3 or one wasn't that wasn't even the scouts and you've taken it i was saying enough what's he shooting i mean he was probably he was probably trying to test what kind of weapon it was if you look in the kill feed there's a lot of um i mean there's a most eminent eave right there but i've seen a lot of r301s and i've seen a decent amount of wingmans and pks this was the meta back when this game came out the wingman was unbelievable i never used it um i'm pretty sure for a long time i thought the wingman when i watched with the people was actually the mozambique which is why i was kind of scared when that guy had the shotgun pistol as i called it i thought that was the overpowered weapon for a long time um i was i just didn't play that much i can drop a few of them look at the stacks 80 and 80 stack of heavy ammo i don't remember being 80 syringes in the same stack flank is this still an area of the map i feel like this is all changed oh no it's not is it i think it's kicking a little bit but i've only got a basic stabilizer the whole squad's gone they were both things to kill and knowingly i wasn't there four seconds beforehand might be able to get myself two kills there i mean there are 28 people left and i've got three kills i've got to start racking up the kill soon if i'm gonna end this game on 21 which i apparently do i'm not sure i actually believe myself so far if i played like this nowadays i think i'd get maybe one kill at the start of the game then and then some apex predator would come along thank you just send you straight back to the lobby it's crazy how different the game was only only two years ago i honestly thought i was really weak i like how my gibby's walking around with no armor and uh al ghaziah here hasn't put on any health heals no syringes no med kits so he's running straight in there look at him go that's not good oh my god this guy's just caught my thermite see my problem here was that i am using my power light in fully auto this is a robot that's standing still we started spanish fairly early i can't remember when we started the spanish lessons but apparently it was uh more than two years ago i absolutely knew it my team i got a revive you know we can push this you can finish that kill if you like maybe you want to did this damage count back then i feel like it it changed there was a time when it just changed first damage started counting towards your total damage absolutely struggling to get my teammates to heal up here nikita picked up some shield though triple take was an energy weapon i'm gonna drop it closer to him i don't think he knows that he needs this half the battle on the apex back then was to try and look after your teammates i mean it's to be honest it's still kind of true today but at least most people know how to heal up and how to shoot their guns but back then you would have to drop things right in front of people for them to actually want to use it i don't know if algazee would even heal up this entire game shield's gone there's two of them go go frag grenade i'm pretty sure i've played on steady back then shooting's decent considering i'm playing on steady absolute disaster no one moves no one heals even a lifeline that could fast heal not interested would rather stand still like a like a statue like a decorative gargoyle oh here we go i forgot about the grapples here we go let's see what this grapples like whoa calm down this is number one pathfinder in the world right here these are the kind of grapples that you can expect i'm scared that because my teammates smoked off this way my teammates keep using their ultimates for absolutely for no reason they'll just throw down an airstrike honestly anything for you to take some healer balls and i'll be happy and he's dead okay that's the wing man my teammates got a pk and he's fine with the wingman this is the most seasoned zero i know gunfire ever seen grappling let's see these grapples i don't know if there's two there or not i don't know if he went over there to revive his teammate no please let me use the thing is like the shooting isn't bad because obviously i've played a lot of fps games before on controller this wasn't my first one i've been playing card since like 1973. so the shooting isn't bad it's just the movement and it's the whole inventory management it's the fact that my fav makes it like i'm playing through binoculars um and it's nice to watch because everyone's clueless me included oh this is going to be a big grapple angle let's see this grapple of time both my teammates got finished annoyingly but there's a rescale respawn respawn beacon nearby someone finished my kill from a separate team okay at least i still get killed credit for that seeing these fights of bridges is kind of making me sad honestly i miss bridges this is my favorite place to drop for for a good while i didn't have any armor there's no one right here though no if any of these people had armor i'd have dropped a a 4k this game as well which wasn't a problem because i got it soon afterwards it would have been nice at least this guy's level four oh this is just tremendous i was playing a playstation 4. my jaw shocks low someone's going up the balloon didn't see him this was my favorite building to drop in because you had ultimate high ground on the people that landed down low if you could get yourself two guns and a bit of armor this gun i can't i cannot believe this gun i mean they buffed it from this point too absolutely melts it does melt it would melt more if you left it in burst mode what are you doing what are you doing hey stop that i get too angry it's almost like he wants me to finish the kill he's just having a lot more but you were teasing me my teammates getting fired out here oh my god i can see thrown haymakers lifeline with a pk so you get for bullying my teammate did more if unlikely find a lifeline with a pk to score 10 okay back in the day hopefully with the fast hills lifelong is a really good solo legend oh my god i didn't make it movement on fleek ankles cracked movement let's see are you going to take the stairs you're going to grapple up top 15 second call down on the grapple by the way and i'm taking the stairs all the ramps yeah i'm never going to get my teammates for not hearing look at the health i'm running around on here there's no way i don't have syringes i had about 34 syringes earlier on still got those two uh ultimate accelerants in my back pocket for a rainy day i haven't used one ultimate yes people are gonna get pushed from the storm i have 12 kills when did that when did that happen when did i get 12 kills oh my god we're being flanked watch out one's down and this guy's always just been so good if he didn't have his revive back then of course that's somewhat this is a this is an audacious point push why didn't you grapple why did you not grapple never played path before my entire life didn't know what he was capable of didn't play tightly before two so i wasn't used to it the whole squad's absolutely destroyed from one giveaway oh here we go here's the grapple i don't i don't feel like i needed to go this far away just terrifying my team is just dying because of me my teammates needed ultimate did so much damage my word yeah could you walk straight through you idiot i might be able to revive you did so much damage i don't think he's too far away he died that's fine though because i've got to recover the guy's tags anyway my poor teammates like they don't know how to heal oh here we go there's still one safe beautiful god that that to me was a great grapple back then that was like wow i have 14 kills i like how this area the map is the exact same it's still an absolute death trap for your teammates as well it hasn't changed the entire time i'm just sliding down the mountain i've got my healey's on hold on here we go huge grapple big distance 15 second cooldown and that includes that that's from when it connects as well so by the time you finish your grapple it's like a 10 second call down all right these are my teammates third live this game your boy has been reviving respawning everything here we got first ultimate big distance to be fair z-blind time no it's not no no it's not it didn't work for some reason was that a bug back then but it would just like not work i don't remember that they must have fixed that one all right back then the one item that you wanted more than anything was a gold bag gold bag was ridiculously opie and then of course they made that fast tail passive onto the gold armor just a broken mechanic i'm actually sort of glad they changed that because you could pop a shield back in like two seconds two and a half seconds and you'll be back to full shield just ludicrous when you think about it are they dead in the storm no i think they're okay right here we got some high ground a tremendous use of the grapple hook you're okay you're fine uh for some reason my teammate has stopped dead in the storm they are both on their last legs in terms of health either i have a few med kits i could drop them but i don't blame my past self for not dropping it because i don't think they've healed the entire game really this part of the map is the exact same as what i love these buildings on king's canyon because there's nothing better than jumping up top on them and firing through like the little gaps in the wood my favorite thing to do that's a decent grapple oh my word i'm cracked out of my mind over this way watch out teammates i've already maneuvers of the century no we don't need to scrap them my team i got sniped from the left i think there's like two teams there i remember this i remember the engine this game really well my bangalore turned into just the biggest psychomaniac you've ever seen and he just he just ran in 1v3 he'll do that soon guys an absolute psychopath is there someone just chilling behind me here we go free high ground i'm stuck i didn't know how to disconnect the uh the old grapple there was a bit of a problem i'm literally not helping my teammates whatsoever i can't help teammates you probably could to be honest you could probably you could easily look over um being a bit selfish here all right he's weak awkward angle that's what i'd blame that bad shooting on all good angle man imagine if you could go back and play this game brand new i always think that about battery imagine going back playing fortnight day one and cranking 90 in front of someone they'd just be their mind would be completely blown if you cranked a 19 in front of a day one player please don't shoot me please don't shoot me you'd be the biggest name on twitch if you could go back to day one he's got a devo that's scary there you go tactical genius two weeks in level 28 but i've got the tactic still i guarantee i didn't realize that he affected your grapple core then as well i didn't i didn't realize that for the longest time i thought it was just ultimate my teammate is just chilling on about 43 health in a building and i've done nothing to try and help him i've just killed this team one by one for some reason they just came in like a oh my god the crater and it's gold not red there are so many body crates for you to loot i have 17 kills oh huge grapple could have climbed that to be honest but still big big value i'm gonna try and buy some time for my teammates are they still dead that team you make sure it's this is when my teammate turns into a few maniacs psychopath there's manager the bongos are coming in you know oh look at him go please don't he's got 40 health he doesn't care i pinged over there go on get involved at least my teammate will be there look at him go god he's gonna die hopped his ultimate i think backwards but you can't blame him he's level six he doesn't know what's going on this team somehow has let him leave my bangalore teammate i don't know what he's up to these days i'm trying to send him a message on playstation see if he wants to play again we'll reunite my shields are gone now we'll drop another 20 bomb i can hear a wraith and she managed her first kill oh she could have armor switched no under the devo oh my god we actually did a teammate i don't know if i revive my teammate don't worry i can hear him that's my twenty-one nikita shilling my db teammate is still watching he's in awe he can't believe what he's seen i mean after all this is the number one pathfinder in the world's performance so uh you can't blame me another lifeline probably the most common legend back then there you go 21 kills 21 kills couldn't believe it could not believe it did i deserve them i actually did it probably not no one had i think about four people that i shot that entire that entire time had shields there's the god squad al gazia what would have happened if he didn't rush over the rope you know what would have happened if he didn't go over there 127 damage didn't matter the grapples were on fleek the inventory management was somehow even better not as bad as i was expecting but there you go 470 000 views somehow uh and it's all thanks to my two teammates what a pair of legends we'll get we'll get the squad back together i'll send them a message and we'll drop another 21 between us i think that's the plan thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in the next one bye
