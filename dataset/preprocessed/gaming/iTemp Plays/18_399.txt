on the respawn are not good i don't know if they're still there okay feel better here all right that one in the crafter he's really hurt they're probably gonna rest my eyes [Music] was the one that pushed you actually know what happened there i just get some light rains and stuff now hold on helen do you think one minute the ring isn't far that other team didn't even push no they didn't wait here guys nice okay charging on my shield cause they push it the worst time when we weren't finished back man i gotta get the chalk going i'm whiffing like that oh my god one raises one and give us [Applause] reloading all right there we go i think i'm still missing i'm missing a knock over there i knocked one on my way in and i don't think i got kill credit for it he's just down in there it's all over there i mean they're gonna have to move oh double backfire bro first i do the pad to hit the gib and then yeah okay one down one behind us but there's seven squads left in a kind of small circle which is fun g75 so slightly i he's one i 150 pounds on me red 150 pounds i knocked one bottom floor 150 pounds but he's only got 50. this time i was above me too sorry janks this is a different team this is a different team what i need to i need to switch to the g7 i've got no ammo oh let's go dude nice job that was my fault bro i never should have went down there i need to i need to look quick just rip my box i had i got the i don't know he's talking but i have voice chat muted he is talking he says he is he wants uh he wants to respawn he said okay thanks wait he dropped 50.

okay they're on it target spotted maybe you really wanted you could pull at the other one that's where i thought you were gonna go oh sorry it's on top of the hill yeah to your left but i don't know if it's necessary because they're just going to fight each other oh yeah sorry that's what you mean i mean so stuck upon might be something good this way there's one in the crafter too i could craft a mobile and just spawn you at a safer place but thanks ages respawn beacon here and see other teams are fighting each other there could be there could be a team up here or maybe a rat or something yeah possibly even if you see anyone recharging shield i don't know oh there's a box right there i know i have med kits i can tell you if you're getting low no i'm i'm coming in it hurts isn't it yeah i can't believe that cause it was on a separate teammate i i don't know heard that there's gonna be a heel guy for you guys they're like on our roof now yeah they're on it i got nades i can just throw
