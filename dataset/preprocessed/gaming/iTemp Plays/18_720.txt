I was the guy to twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today I have two of revenant games for you here and the reason I am playing revenant is because he received a book today that are completely overlooked in my patch overview video yesterday so this is from the patch notes themselves revenants the tactical now consoles path - grapple mid-air and rate child of time on her phase ability it will now also prevent mirages cloak revive mirages decoy control and lifeline to combat revive as well these aren't bad changes for revenant but this is the big one this is the reason we are playing him again today the range has been removed on his death totem ultimately she used to make plain revenant a little bit tricky as you place your ultimate down and bearest range to a reasonably small area this is no more now if you're going to try revenant again try and pair him with some ability champions like octane who can jump at you two places or pathfinder who can take it to another dimension with the ultimate no longer do you have to worry of going out of range of his ultimate I was actually enjoying plain revenant Lee season anyway so these are some beautiful changes for me to pick him back up as I said there are two games in today's video so do not click off after the first game is completed it's a beautiful second game on the ways ball definitely enjoy if you do be sure to leave like right and I'll see you all in five and our seconds my friends oh wait there's two the team landed right here with us one of them stopped if they just boosted me upper berth summit no arm shields I'm punching him good okay go to people over there I got a scratch on this one no Sheldon one of them and one don't let me change come on chalk that oh my god the car my buddies hit you there something but I don't know how I don't know I don't accuse ivory don't want to use shields on level one another might be another one laying around here somewhere this makes me so sad also was that is that everyone oh yeah yeah there's a little bit of a so some of these good oh yeah they're right here they're looking at my aunty one Sam was like oh these it's fine honest to people finding it isn't it guys otherwise pretty weak on blue yes nice job man I've got purple man so this is it's got one more if there's still one more oh yeah cuz that first team exactly wasn't really neat thing about box well yeah didn't get kill kriti so why does she call off to pinkish you can take don't walk around me through the core thing I don't like that suppress someone so there's two there's two I got I got a hill this week maybe even on one shot nice job drive-by do you have any medicates by the way oh okay so one's getting raced at not like school time nice it's gonna be yeah thanks honestly that's really good that will hop on this will take the high ground they'll never be able to stop us where abouts are them time and point my eagle vision here we'll see it was definitely this one right cuz I mean it's been you next to you all day all Chili's stop wait open noises you must have been do that goes all you because I've got Eva -
