[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wrong neighborhood amigo [Music] hopefully i don't fall into the lava now [Music] [Applause] sorry about that [Music] [Music] hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and as you can already tell we are playing watson today now boston is a character that i have underestimated for too long and now that i've seen a fair few watson montages i realized that you can actually make some incredible plays with her fences and on top of that a really good ultimate and she's actually a ton of fun to play i played yesterday for about an hour and a half two hours only watson i had a great time so i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends at least i'm in this door first we are not alone look over here okay we've got armor up top if for whatever reason i get shot at okay this gun is so this is like this is such a stupid gun how is this a real gun on this game i mean i guess they were just sitting there i don't actually know what they were doing sorry friends what have you got for me you had the most surrender start and i am so i can't believe those guys bless him like why did they i don't stand like i started blasting and then the fuse is like you know what the secret strategy here is i will stand still like that's that's the problem with fuse that's what happens when i play fuse i spend way too much time trying to line up the perfect knuckle cluster it does eight damage because they move out the way and then they just blast me so what's the point if anyone knows please let me know in a comment who's born around is that my team now give him the chimney that sounds like such a flex oh sorry sorry that's my heirloom right there yeah sorry about that i'll try and keep that off your screen you know hello i mean i respect it and i'm filming i'm really sorry for you because that sucks is that i was or no please god that explodes so fast full stream's a friendly one come on thank you i'm not sure what i'm supposed to do my fences here in the wide open on the train tracks not really the spot for fences like a train would go straight through the fence you know i mean if there was a fence there but then the train game defense would be destroyed it would stand no chance what the heck's going on where is everyone everyone just keeps running oh my god thank you or what there's a team up top oh my god a day squatting the heck is going on we couldn't find anyone for 35 minutes and now everyone is here we can get our teammate back we we can make a comeback here that's here had um i read armor over there too but i wasn't really able to to loot him unfortunately over there anyone passes through here i can't enemies i'm in trouble he thinks i'm firing now passively regening until the enclosure this is a mess please what the heck is going on [Music] i defeated an adversary anyone got any heavy i mean i can't go that way oh my god i need shields what the heck is this game gj guys that was like a ranked game man i know it was like a shield battery here lgs star it was it was fun though gg this is a good day i'm feeling good there are people over this way i'm gonna pop that in a second romanian yes i'm here amigo on let me help you we're still alive we're still breathing nice i appreciate your assistance you're not actually fine on stuff there are people fighting this way administering medical aid somewhere i'm going to this way that seems like carnage ignite angle oh my god they are all way up top hello friends shots oh my god i'm reported hundred percent shut down who else is around i mean this is why you have to land cap oh wait i didn't get the r9 not from this box i thought i got through the box i mean you have to land cap i mean look 20 people left we've got a bit of a fight now we have to go back this way because this is where the other people will be 30 seconds remain we've got two very defensive legends in watson and caustic so if we get into any sort of predicament i thought stop it wait i've only got four cells deployed sorry mate we are on the same nice i mean i felt really bad for that guy come around the corner oh please can i grab the attachment that's what i wanted trying to call it with an eve right so i knew i'd won that gunfight i just knew it was game over for this man bless him i have six cells now that's clean looking clean you guys need a bat shield battery here thank you no problem well i've just realized if i put that in the video just that little part it makes it look like i'm only putting it in to show that i'm helping my teammate and i'm just a really good guy but now that i've added this little um this little bit of extra talking dialogue now it looks like i'm putting it for entertainment purposes so uh it's allowed there we go perfect my ultimate is ready huge it's not the time oh my god that wasn't even you see that jolt to the left that wasn't even me okay and they run off okay well the flat line was clean but then i'll pull that the r9 that's not good busy planting senses second squad i mean this is so difficult man uh what did they how did they bat behind a building and die like i'd understand where they were standing to die behind the building it's impossible i can't win i see an either right i'll take it uh i put a fence down in a gunfight then i don't know if anyone noticed i didn't really mean to i mean i did but like i didn't like i was thinking about it but then my brain took over and did it without me consenting it wasn't actually me it wasn't my conscience does that make sense because it should do because it makes a lot of sense trust me are we going here purple that's humongous i'll be taking this thank you found an evil shield here level two why am i dropping things one at a time using gravel i should actually take the havoc so much more bullets for it look at this so many bullets i'm never gonna run out here two okay let's go i need a bag but apart from that looking good right here look over here i am we need to rush this guy i don't know if you can or sorry sir not enemy shield is broken so yeah i think i just took out the whole squad i'll see ya thanks for playing i mean she really messed that up let's be honest i don't know if they like can't they fall from that is there a fence there is it like blocking them otherwise like why wouldn't they fall no stop reloading i need to get to the um if i get to this guy he had a pk yeah we need to rush rush the horizon like if i oh my god purple dropping and connect feeder if i i could easily talk to my teammates i could have told them that we needed to get that team you just need to commit to one team you know i'm inside the ring feels good hello going back to this road doesn't pick things up again why am i thinking let's go here let's try to cancel that thing and is that's good news position not bad for an electrical engineer come on hail i actually love these like fence plates you can make as watson like i never really considered this then you watch a good watson and you realize that you can 1v3 in buildings like that just because of the control defenses give you and also the um like people don't expect you to be able to like connect the nodes through the door and they stand there and they buff the stun duration i swear it's like three seconds now if you go through a fence and it's like it does a decent amount of damage but it's mainly about the stun because you just open the door then you start blasting because it destroys the door when the fence goes through so you don't even need to open the door anymore you just stop blasting it's tremendous verizon just like three shot that guy with a long bow uh it's gonna be really tough for me to fight somewhere with no buildings like i need to fight fragment or skyhook to be honest with you but whatever i'm gonna go in and die i'm not gonna win this game especially this super controller look at it look at it stupid thing ryzen's just killed someone else all right i'm coming in horizon i'm gonna third party you're gonna turn around you're gonna three tap me with a wingman you're gonna do three headshots for 300 damage you just stand under the guy you've just got another guy who am i playing against here focus the horizon get the horizon out of here don't let arm switch oh my god i feel bad i feel very bad but i had to kill it did you have a gun or was that like another armor you had a vault oh okay maybe i should have went volt pk um no flat one's pretty good i've been loving the vault uh the pika recently though i feel so bad for that horizon she just killed about 24 people down there wait there are two squads left that means this gunfight's probably over no it's the last two teams um i mean if i get good time in here i can actually win stop please this is the worst time to be jolteon all over the place controller who's this bad boy what are you up to is that one from each team or i what an adversary we're one step closer to winning i think both teams are actually making shambles like everyone have shot [Music] but what can you do in the open yeah i mean all these guys are in shambles i'm pretty sure i've killed all the good teams and this is this team here but i think there's three of them left vigilant this is going to be very tough oh this is gonna be impossible don't shoot me on this yeah come get me come get me just talking about my shield yeah i'm cracked ah ow please no don't come on no please don't come across the rope the worst thing you could do right now would be to come across the rope please no done any heavy going let's get ahead of them i mean they're not good but i just i can definitely kill them i just need them to be separate or fight them in a building of some description [Applause] if i can get ahead of them somehow they're gonna have to go through the tunnel which means i can gatekeeping like here a little bit please control please not like this stop it i need to get there please it's like i'm performing cpr on you maybe i can do some magic in here i don't know is income i mean listen hey this isn't a bottle of bit i swear no did you see the start of this game it was such a struggle that wasn't a butt lobby i mean i literally i could have let him heal up and i could have got a 4k game so i just wanted to put this in the actual video so if someone says this is a bot lobby i have some counter arguments first of all this always happens if you are aggressive you get into fights with the other better and aggressive players of the lobby in the early and the mid game and you are very often left with the blue shield gamers at the end who have avoided every single gunfight they are bound to be worst players also the horizon i killed was an apex pred as you can see if she had killed me i'd have robbed my eyes it's skill based but i got lucky and shot her in the back and in the feed was this guy who was actually a previous teammate of mine it was an heirloom spinning wraith now the last team were pretty bad bless them but up until that point the lobby was pretty normal so i hope you guys enjoyed it thank you for watching i'll see you on the next one
