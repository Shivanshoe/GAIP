hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course we are here playing sia on ward's edge and i think sia is actually opie in capital because he's ultimate because as much verticalness as it does horizontalness you know the radius is 360 degrees all the way around in a giant sphere so if you're fighting in construction the multi-story building in capital you're covering the entire thing and a little bit of outside if you put it on the middle floor and i know i made a seer video like two weeks ago but listen apex hasn't released anything new since like 1997. it's it's pretty tough but i'm still enjoying playing and i hope you're enjoying the video so thank you for watching i really do appreciate and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos okay good luck amigos oh my word idiot get absolutely murdered are you jumping out of there okay that probably means i shouldn't jump in there i do not have a weapon amigos no guns for me on the way fake it oh get it like an absolute maniac off the top rope there you see that need light ammo oh i've gone too far i can drop you firm because i don't have a light gun apart from p2020 okay nice so i wanted my purple back i only switched like that to uh heavy it's your bat nice choice nice team i know i'm a switch to uh to revive so we didn't get shot but it's okay i'll make this i'll make this one purple hopefully he wants this he wants all this light okay okay voy and camino me amigo i see someone over there yeah yeah definitely right half the squads are gone good frank out i'm trying to save my ultimate but it's devices on our story do you want to have the moment of an absolute maniac or demon or what you see that i've never done that before my entire life there's something about not reloading your gold mag gun and then reloading your back pocket that just makes me feel like a the world's best player i don't know what it is live i was about white armor just saying i wasn't lying let's go this way it's pretty slowly here oh i saw a lucky let me try that best dj this guy wants a flatline and a pk um deal if you ping me uh what do i want what what the heck was that are you having a giggle is this some kind of sick is this some kind of sick joke oh no i'm going to do something what was that though i told it was a ginormous scam my words don't know what's going on but i'm firing i gotcha nice more cargo action no turbo charger okay there are a few people here than i thought which is such a good thing because it might mean that people just don't die instantly here know we're here but one i wasn't drunk master and two i have to land here i'm kind of contractually obligated to land here i'm afraid all right i'm interested what these guys got he got wing wingman mastiff turbo he's just he's cheating on his own setup here uh big revive i cannot believe what i'm watching from this race that is an absolute diabolical turn of events does anyone need this extended hippie that's your wingman level two yes no yes but no where's my two times let's explode this way on the way oh three times might be worth taking contact with enemy my yeah is ready and waiting i i am so bad oh my god i'm not surprised you peek that just that just the guy left was the revenue is he climbing the site oops i didn't mean to use the ceo thing by the way if you couldn't tell if my big oops wasn't an indication of my regret uh do you guys need these i've got a gold so i how long uh i got some more that's no problem nice team of it hey someone whoa these boxes all right let me take a second what do i need here get a light little light rain slice you guys can take that if you want there we go should be good better better shotgun block perhaps blue and then one of these what do you guys get purple shield logo hasn't even used it i don't know why i've taken an interest now into uh i need shotgun funny choice yeah i think i dropped him yeah yeah there we go perfect right on the way kind of doing my best [Music] waiting to use her slot for the care package from her ultimate you know we can't leave it there if you don't take it i've got to take it you take it nice i can't just leave a spitfire there because then someone will use it against us uh what market yeah i think so i reckon they'd have been here oh it's in the crafter nice it's give me something to do come on take so long bam all right this was a lifeline package right how fast my thing going pretty far bangalore emptying my heart uh right here less work i love gold shield sometimes like i do think red is better because at the end of the game you have loads of uh uploads of bats and stuff but gold is so good for those quick like i would have been able to pop her back there and i had the confidence to uh the confidence to pop a little a little shields out of the door whilst the guy's looking at me oh look at that sensational i need there you go one more shotgun shell i got a good team here a really good team a respawn no i think it was the replicators uh this is the most horrendous rotation when you have to go through the tunnel i mean we could go all the way around you know this way even this is a bit of a choke point but the tunnel's horrendous i can't be able to go around though this bread badge is that a season two pred badge there we go it's got the silver badge right next to it showing off now one of the things i love about running oh what everyone sorry joe that's not good one of the things i love running uh about running like a mastiff or even like a wingman is the fact that that's me is the fact that you only need like one stack of ammo you can i mean i've got another one back there's no way i haven't seen a better bag than this this is nice wardrobe is this just some of my classic looting or what i need a backpack ray's got level one as well so if i'm missing stuff she's missing stuff wow wow let's calm it down guys i should get angry at the supply beam what the heck's going on we're gonna die i've gotta i've got a feeling that we're not gonna we're not gonna win this game just by the i don't know why i think we're gonna get overconfident here i think we're gonna wait that's the other team yeah yeah yeah yeah here we go we've got to be careful we don't get roped up on though nice job to me first damage oh here we go oh they're mad please don't do that to me careful i'm banging careful oh my god lunatics lunatics wait that hit me too i don't know whether the team is i mean the arkansas said other team so oh oh the one tap wingman nice uh see ya gg amigos i'm dodging what the heck happened to me nice feels good to get a win i played for about five hours yesterday and barely got a win it was such a struggle but today tell me two games the duality of apex right there listen didn't get 2000 damage but i did get those four revives which is it's quite a few you know if we apply 500 damage per revive that was nearly a 4k game and that's how it works gg
