hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back on the mate pathfinder who as it turns out is actually really good on the new map because of the lack of jump towers uh this means that rotational abilities like pathfinder's ultimate become so helpful for the team and some movement legends aren't actually quite as good on this map compared towards edge i would put horizon in that category because of the lack of verticality when you compare it to capital city for example but pathfinder is still amazing it's so good so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends where's like the where's the good place to land on this map i actually don't know where's cascade falls that's right beneath us i see a lot of people always dying over there when i'm playing ash um this guy's broken away i don't even know where i'm going mate so where's he off to he's going more to the left i think he i think he's going i'm going this way okay we're going this way i was trying to figure it out all under these beats this is first game on so if your boys hot trash that is the reason why i would like uh you to forgive me for my poor accuracy that you're about to win this i would assume good news is she will take car and he said car 98 that would be completely different from a different era ah there's three people here what's going on nice job teammate watching it's pretty good it's got like a 4k stuff on uh horizon so oh okay i'll see you down now we can move them i said to buy time there for my teammates come around when did you get purple these are different themes oh my word look at me go i need that purple sniper stock it'll let me quick scope quicker with the triple take which is actually a viable strategy with this gun recharging all right so there's a team on the right that had like uh i cracked one of them or came close what the heck was that a single shot hemlock he just turned the corner destroyed me you guys can have shields over here giving my shields a recharge i know you gotta show around this corner nice to go through the i thermite it's a beast too which is good the rings all right i heard shots this way too teammate over there do this there's shields what happened to the other team there's a team that was coming from the left too which is why i got so confused here we go was it always this good did someone throw something at us no my back was full well obviously making good use of the back that's fine all right well i've got white armor now i mean i could go around there was purple over this way from all the previous people we've killed uh i got some kind of i mean you just shot all your heavy repairing i'm hoping you beamed him oh she did she down one okay i'll stop complaining i got my timer i'm going in oh it's huge that's humongous uh all right i've got a bat that's more heavy in here i'm gonna take light because i can just use the light ammo where was the purple drop does anyone know where did he go does anyone where did i i checked that one was it this one i think it was this one yeah cause i came around here look at that i'll use small hills i came around uh and we had to well i was panicking you know i could have just ran away oh my god it's never ending this is like a this is like a game of nazi zombies on card this is a crazy glitch i reckon she's gone weak it's nice having a good team at knocking on ryan because i could pop the back there knowing that my teammate was probably gonna win that gun fight you know i cracked the octane got them somewhat weak i think they steamed as well so they were at most like 80 health and i knew my team i would do the job but this is honest yeah it has been like a game of zombies on card just a success a successive wave of enemies coming through do we stay in here and just keep fighting people or what i reckon i i mean the storm is going to push us the zone is going to push us eight we might as well leave oh ow i was going to say look at this the fresh air the nice outdoors when i get welcomed by a weed machine where's yeah contact with target the enemies oh my god you're the best that's too good there's nothing i can do giving my shields a recharge i'm good how many do i have i have two i'm good wait i have no cells though recharging shoes though i'm not scared of him we need to turn around get closer and mess them up that's the plan this is a three-step plan step one is to collect the shield cells step two is to run up the hill afterwards giving my shields nice job you just gotta play to advantage our advantage there was when they've got a bone arrow i want to see what society had of three times i was like being on triple take if we just had to get closer i know i knew we could take him time it's an absolute demon i need to farm some more damage i've only got 1400 good amount of people left though do i need anything pretty no don't think so anyway nothing how can you not enjoy playing pathfinder i just don't understand how this guy isn't everyone's mean is there anything more fun than just absolutely launching yourself across the map don't answer that because i mean i know the answer is the answer is no so i don't even don't even try and argue otherwise oh big script come on opening fire on the enemy she's gonna throw a cue at me so i don't want to get too close hello i'm looking my took out an man the squad my team is an absolute demon this is great first game this is what you need at every first game of the day it should pair you with a good player just to just to ease you into the day you know this one's closer i think recharging my shield fire on the enemy he's gonna try and head glitch that i knew he wasn't gonna try and heal now he's gonna heal because he knows i'm peeking it okay that's gonna i'm gonna duck out of the way look at the map the next my aim is bad but it does not matter who cares when you've got a teammate like this recharging shield i should probably go back and get some cells rudy cannot be bothered i've got four bats it'll last me i mean i have to be damned somewhat horrendous if i uh if i have to use cells here with red armor i heard someone firing this way i don't know how to get it was either side this man i reckon it was there let's explore it this way if i had to guess oh they're fighting each other can i get through this cave the map makes it look like i can i absolutely cannot no one's gone down yet that's good news come on i hear fully auto smgs and either right no i was one day from each team we need to get involved it's a trade revised guys come on we're on the way this is where i i turn up and then they all four people decided to shoot me instead no you fiend i saw you kill well i didn't because he's already dead i need to sign this why didn't i pick up that one times i was gonna slide around the corner and no scope i mean listen it wasn't my fault he's one it's pretty popular that now i have full faith in my teammate i shouldn't have died i was trying to slide around the corner and no scope him like it just wasn't listen okay okay i really wanted the kill and also i just i can't use oh where am i going to crawl to here it's horrendous oh my god no we're going to lose oh god thank you oh good job sorry i nearly i nearly threw i was trying no scope it wasn't my fault how did he even kill him at the end i don't know how all right nice we got a 4k between us we've got a 4k i'm not sure i can call the video of that though uh i feel like that would be a little bit too cl uh clickbait but thank goodness our teammate clutched up
