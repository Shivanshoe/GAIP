hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends and when was the last time you saw me using the eva 8 shotgun apart from yesterday's video i have dismissed this gun over and over for the past two and a half years but since the massive and peacekeeper nerfs i think the e48 shotgun is probably the best shotgun in the entire game and i don't even think it's close this gun is so good if you are good with hipfire also just as a four warning gear i am temporarily almost fully deaf in my left ear at the moment i have abnormally small ear canals according to my doctor so if i ever get any sinus problems or swellings i just can't hear anything my righty is fine but my left ear at the moment is completely out of action for probably a few days so if you see me flustered in game or if i'm looking completely the wrong way to where the footsteps are coming from you know why anyway thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends you're just talking okay well there's ten thousand people here i might write noise craft okay oh yeah i was trying so hard to punch this caustic and my aim is just kept walking onto the guy that was down beating him um i have no ammo no energy and no shotgun there's two there's there's people me there's uh sorry just loot here i'm dead come here come here i don't have a boat i'm in desperate need me either i need a shotgun i have a great one oh please wait he jumped outside he fell off the map i was casually sliding but there's a hole in the floor oh yeah i haven't seen any are they in the crafter no i thought too there you go what do you know what do you know right there that's insane that's unreal i think so yeah yeah and a car's driving up top too to your left oh okay [Music] oh yeah not there yet go inside had no shields i'll come back to you it's an awful angle i'm down here there's a two there's a team up top okay there's a team just randomly inside recharging shield oh what's going on still no shotgun bots with this level one all right i'm down to brush this guy another [Music] i'm a little bit i have no big deals at all i have a med kit oh these are all thank you it's possible you know which way he's gonna come back he's uh right on the other side of this wall oh my god i'm sorry oh where are you landing um like middle this way there's no way this guy's just got a purple there's a rice's crack but she doesn't have a gun which might just be burning okay i only have a longbow i have an l star and a mastiff were there people on you over there uh there was a race but she faced away can i have a gun i'm gonna push over there okay which way oh wherever you are i can't really hear where people are to be honest i just hear gunshots uh there's some over here we just rose another team behind me someone above me healing it's a wraith taken down i'm actually the worst with the master i cannot use this gun i can't i really can't i'm so bad about that oh i have a drone um would you happen to have any heavy uh i think i'll drop some in here should go inside if not the guys will be fired you got something i got some uh i might say if you want to go proximity or something before keep winning 10 seconds i'd like to keep using it but i don't want to use longbow either either seems horrendous no that doesn't seem like the play i need a job what am i doing i still have a mastiff with no ball be fun you're gonna have to keep i'm gonna follow you the whole time oh you can't hear anything can you forget it are they just inside there yeah thank you oh i should've got the bolts what am i doing i'm gonna i'm gonna yank it i'm getting the other one i'm gonna drop you guys right now i dropped it i dropped it off shotgun level three did you get it out of there yeah i've got both ones where's the trap um i was i was healing i was kind of just sitting there in disappointment because i missed a lot of easy shots all right all right i'll be i don't want to shoot anymore time i have my back too so i couldn't tell if you were fine or not who knows these days that's what i think did you kill one of that how did you get that girl oh okay all right what you said you ready oh call yeah yeah nice oh on me reloading reps left beyond one shot behind this not really beyond one shot people are just obsessed with the uh with the uh with the massive and the pk for some reason because you can pick them is that you yeah sorry sorry that's me looking like right now um looking pretty good i could use that nice uh what in terms of kills and damage that's i think i missed apart my arm with the sunscreen so i think i've got a little like a tiny bit of sunburn but apart from that oh here oh that's not good um the rings close ah i didn't jump mate i'm i'm literally the worst player he's probably healing already he's cold how do i not have a gold bag i couldn't get my last shotgun shot looks like you don't let me die here are you okay he's getting close uh i gotta go back for you nice he's gonna kill me right i was hoping he stayed there for the next 30 seconds and it just dropped on him i'm in desperate need yes dude that's the fat guy on me i'm sick of it recharging the other one's almost broken and then one of them's like 70 hp even though i don't have a shotgun okay i can't i missed missed the graph oh huge portal come on recharging shields yeah i mean i should have there i just no one's got any shotgun do they have any shotgun ammo this is pointless there um i don't know you're more mobile if i go down there it's gonna take me an hour to get back up so i mean i only have three assists i'm kind of just spectating i'm a spectator though yeah participating in all of them whoa whoa whoa that's going to go any shocking for me i'm actually going to craft something i can't craft i can't craft an egg oh shotgun i mean they're just really massive building hold on all messed up oh what's going on now i'm trying to find i'm just showing up here i'm like i'm like a mountain goat he's by far the newbies never played one right i'm going down i'm trying so hard no it's my last shot good shot i've already tried but him for 52. i took the last one i'm sorry now you go that was like okay i need to watch that back but i'm pretty sure i look like a 0.6 kd player not like you not like that because the whole game my brain is trying to figure out where people are because i'm trying to i can't hear anything it's so difficult what the heck if i was actually playing properly that was an easy 20 kill game
