first mate you are obsessed with no i it's a terrible passive rich you are so fascinated by it and it's by far the best it's by far the best passive it is name one the worst legend in the game and she has a better passive oh that's a she has a really good passive yeah and she's still the worst legend of the game how does how does that make you feel yeah uh i know gold helmets good on blue hinge but i'm not really going to scan off call then because i keep forgetting do you want it on you it might save your life no no no no no you need the enemies recharging i recharged you're safe i don't know

came this way pretty sure they survived that they only just popped that lower ultimate okay i saw like the lines go but i wasn't sure what it was i must use the phoenix kids i think they cut that way i think they went that way yeah they're getting fired out mate i've got my mobile respawn do i just pop it back here yeah i guess there's one right there but this one's a little bit safer that's fine i'm not going to use it otherwise i guess this is a pretty bad hole though i mean there's nothing over here jesus dragon controller player 100 right i mean it has to be yeah yeah yeah absolutely here see it's nearly cracked that with you you guys good do you need me no i'm good there's loads of light here for him i'm gonna craft some too it's back here yep hold on i'm still crafting by the way

diving on him was it so stressful mate thank you he's ranked that big trapping yeah we're coming up right behind the scene they're down low wait right here oh if his teammates just kind of send it can we get high ground or i don't know if we want to send that way i don't want to team slippy by the way they've bought taken back up so what's right there they were up here i saw him yeah they're stopped here on the other side there's all three of them i'm being shot from the left i'm fine though i swapped the bat i got sniped i got sniped hold on on the other side of this song i'm gonna scan yeah me too there was a team sniper from the left by the way they're getting shot so there's one down low two up top i look yeah they tipped off the beacon a little bit oh um this is kind of rough we're gonna have to move from here yeah we might have to go back yeah we don't have to fight this jail i guess yeah he's revolving back there yes how is he not getting shot i don't know i'm trying to try and get an angle i'll grab her back yeah yeah he's sat in his ultimate i hit to make the two people jump down so it might be that i have scanning four all right well we can take this so we can take higher and above them yeah all three i need watson to fence that off watson please come up here no watson please just come over here oh she's going to go down rich 130 on one nice mate okay can
