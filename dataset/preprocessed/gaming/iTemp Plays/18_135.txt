again i can't use that i've got a charge rifle well if both y'all are going to leave it i'm going to pick it up and i'll drop the triple take yeah you're low ammo well let's just free up some spots for more throwables down the road you know oh true true yeah i heard that oh gold heavy mag stay less wings just play they're just leaving grenades on the floor it's just baffling to me firing they might have like 20. i'm taking shots one shot i mean that like literally one is white sorry i'm gonna take this row but you probably can you probably can broken enemies crack the right the other guy taking three i'm gonna i'm gonna start pouring a portal nice [Music] unless that's shooting behind us yeah i'm here to phoenix here any bats you guys have yeah i think i can drop two i don't even loot this guy grab graphics he's got three do you reckon anyone in the history of ranked has ever used charge rifle re45 as a combination i don't think they have oh hold on hold on uh i don't think so say cancel a valk cue it's impossible fox three sending the payload full team dead there's one salon by the rope with knocks nice right cracks right right one crack i had 36 flush on red other guy in practice as well 90. get over there they're struggling headshot octane as well it's like everybody tried to third party in the same fight i've done like no damage i was freaked out i have my kp i got five yeah did you guys hear like one phantom wingman shot just now to the right maybe no they'll have to come this way anyway i'm kind of hanging i'm just hanging out by the rope all i'm saying is i'm getting nasty at super gladden are you yes you have been like i think i felt like four so far this game how many boxes that's just what i'm saying right like everybody died here it's like two teams were fighting and everybody just came to oh uh where we fought the first team on the crafter wait for him to hit the crafter he's so hurt off his full flesh three launching missiles wings [Music] a little bit i have to small hill i've only got one bat oh you're muted ratchet i don't know you know oh yeah my father's sorry i'm good you're good the trigger guy on the left pattern i'm coming it there's a guy on the left so let's get you a duo i'm going to cover for you cover the charger yeah you got nervous oh he's going to help him up that's nice i'll never mind enemy taken out reloading all right somebody bats that's my fault how many i have zero healing up she'll be right i got i got ten here thank you i got five i'll jump into one i'm usually never that guy but like i'm talking a lot to chad so i was like this is the ultimate combo yeah not to worse but you'd be talking myself race is going to come back and grab banners yeah she is let's go for a second we'll just go and let also here for a sec oh i hear a charge my flow this way now people have young to my ranked com my ranked strategy i mean it was a good try there's a wraith over here with a charge rifle so probably her it has to be right the ring's close and it's a good thing only have 30 seconds left i mean what are the odds of another refuses yeah this doesn't this is not fitting i think i heard you actually it could be yeah oh no there's a guy right here 130 75 on top he's getting charged actually yeah i just dropped my mother load on him that's right i'm gonna hit a bat on the wall just watch for me yeah i hit 130 on the race but she's low all right i'm getting aggressive on it then safe to touch down we're already in the next round nice nice we're going to show the back too okay recharging shields where was the last one i don't know has to be that blood term right because the the team went close i'm in here blood i missed a lot of shots i suck come on come on i use one thank you you
