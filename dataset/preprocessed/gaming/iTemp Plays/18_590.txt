hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some more crypto uh i mean historically he and watson are the two characters that i just don't play like ever they don't really suit my playstyle too much but then i saw this crypto skin in the shop called hallowed spirit which was so outrageous i just had to give crypto another try and this isn't a sponsored video by the way sort of sounded it there for a second the skin is part of a bundle that costs over 30 pounds which is a bit outrageous but you get some cool stuff in there so i couldn't help myself the only problem is i may be the worst crypto in the entire world my brain cannot process the buttons i have zero muscle memory related to kryptos kit but we get the job done my friends it's another double whammy video here so i hope you enjoy the two games thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends they
