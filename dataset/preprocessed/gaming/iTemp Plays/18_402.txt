hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i wanted to talk about the pick rates of the legends in apex specifically valkyrie since season nine's released valkyrie's pick rate has actually been falling which is quite surprising to me at the moment in all unwrecked games she's seventh in pick rate behind even bangalore somehow i suppose the pig rate would peak on the first day as everyone wants to try them at least once but i thought that with valkyrie as players got used to her kit and saw how useful it is on both olympus and what's edge which are the two maps that were playing at the moment though her pick rate would fall a little bit after the first initial peak but then stay steady at least she's good in both unranked and ranked in masses and pred lobbies she's actually fifth most picked which is great but in regular games her pick rate is falling pretty quickly we're not in the realm of buffs being needed yet though we've still got legends like fuse and rampart to worry about who are massively struggling i think she's well balanced and fun as well but i thought she'd be higher especially in the season of her release lifeline on the other hand look at this graph i think this is a product of complete overreaction when you heard lifeline is getting her red shield removed you just think that she's going to be useless but so many people underestimated how much of a difference of removing low profile made to her overall power especially being in a mobile legend she also received books across the board on her ultimate and drone ability as well it appears though lifelong mains quit in season 9 to play valkyrie and then realise just how good lifeline actually is and then quickly went back to her in in their thousands i thought this was interesting now i wanted to hear your guys opinion on valkyrie how good do you think she is does she need nerfs does she need buffs i've got two games for you today the first one playing path but the second one i am of course playing valkyrie so thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends they say death
