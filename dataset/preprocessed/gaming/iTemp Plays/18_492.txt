hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some rank t with so far that is right i have convinced him to play a ranked with me i think that goals and plat lobbies in ranked are just so fun and it's not because they're easier than pubs i think public games recently have been fairly easy but it's because they just last so long so far and i legitimately had a seven minute win on olympus earlier today seven minutes i think that's a world record you can't get content in seven minutes you've only just leveled up your armor i think i'll end up showing you guys that game but i'll put another game after it to equal it out otherwise i would feel like i just shortchanged you guys but yeah ranked is fun just because the fights are so long people play more defensive as they're trying to rank up so you can get more gunfights in obviously once you reach diamond three it's a little bit different that's when you have to start worrying about your own play style if you want to rank up any more to masters but yeah hopefully you enjoyed this video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends it's a place and we are going uh we are well on the way and there is no one oh no wait one team unless that's a decoy i think that's the d now that's decoy was it your defense oh no no i saw another one that went into the mountainside so then i only just saw that one i was thinking white two devotions okay what what exactly would you like me to do with this game they have someone stay on your toes ladies can i pick up the shield cells huh if you find a mastiff please um i have one i'll drop it for you uh as soon as we can find them i haven't either selfies all right that was

your life i'll just appear another team on me you're in the middle of two teams he's getting shot by someone else crack down though game that's all i've been doing taking so much damage is that
