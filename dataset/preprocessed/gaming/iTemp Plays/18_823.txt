hey was a closet switch welcome back tuna the video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and I really don't know what I'm going to title this video because one my teammates were incredibly good and we absolutely steamrolled the lobby that you're about to watch we exterminated half of the lobby between us and we did it whilst I was using a triple take and I became a triple tech man but I'm not sure which one it's gonna be and I know I'm gonna get a comment or two saying which are youtubers always get teammates the apex predator arms took with Billy Bob 12 who's literally level 12 I'm not sure I had a teammate over the level 80 up until this game it happens my friends anyway thank you for watching I hope you enjoy the video if you're new around here be sure to subscribe and I'll see you all in five and 1/2 seconds my friends Mirage of voyage it is me amigos and this is one of my favorites lands I have not landed are usually land which is inside this window by far the best place to land if you come in here to Mirage for your heart actually I don't think they won't say it it sounds incredibly quiet for these places I'm not gonna repeat the name cuz I've studied 12 times ready by tonight some are Milus which is in good I thought the blue team is actually pretty good you can even let's start the party in and shoot the Luke Jones a small board that's actually I'm not sure these these good news or bad news me finding a trouble tape with the precision choke it means that I now have to become trouble to Mon I'm not allowed to drop this gun that's the unwritten rule in the channel if I find actual tape with a precision trope a decider game I'm not actually allowed to drop it here we go chop to happen it is only at night he's some public okay sorry print I've tell my name on there I'm gonna happen I see literally thought that our team is on my team for a second I'm not entirely sure why we don't even have an octane on this team we've got a race in our lifeline I'm confused right we're not that close to you you can't even see let me see what's going on all right well that's the only but I think about landing on this shape is that people will end nearby and use the jump towers to land later having it again I think is the engine happens every time but they'll learn late and now often have like decent armor and then that means they can land up top and get high ground on you and to shoot down you which is exactly what just happened to us all right like a natural place to go afterwards is of course to the vaults if I forgot completely to mention that one of the reasons is my favorite place to go now is because it's the only place you can get a vodka which means that you'll be uncontested if you win mirage for arts you can just head on down to the vault key room boot lot of loot loot vaults I literally said boot lot and you can get yourself some some gold on it isn't far no I'm going to be something very controversial way I'm gonna get home even the comments please I don't want things gears I don't like them get him and at the infantry girlfriendless was messing about wasting time we could get way better loot in the vault if we are you don't have to get there 1:37 it's the best shot on the game triple tape man strikes one more there we go another one Dame I'm gonna help now from the 5-meter he's met that was my kill I'm no scope to me the trouble tank I can play says my cure I'm gonna punch want this one now take it take a lot of boxing gloves everything that you didn't do anything unfortunate went him further into it you stole man is he somebody Eva ball he must have thought it was his kill unless he was revived and then he needed him or something but even so I used my head tried unlucky you're dead you're out the game I'm afraid that's been for this man I think what happened was either he got revived and then he needed him even so I still ask my kill come on I did I did the day work then do we found alarming there too or he just thought he who's his kill either way misunderstanding hope he's not still mad at me hopefully he provides me if I go down I thought that happened before people get mad at you they you know they stand over your knock down and body waiting for you to timeout so they can still believe back and they don't even revive you it's happening before they'll happen again I'm sure you're running away from the birthday prison friend I guess we've I guess it's mainly footrace can get your papal army here I'm sure hopefully at least there you go buddy shield here level three that's what my lifeline is it for me of course all right well no one's a train yard interestingly enough another reason that I like Mirage bi so much you say it's got good rotations out there up to the volute vaults and then up to train yards and they're not today I'm afraid my girlfriend I knew there was a care package that I saw here we go that I was looking for earlier on unless this one's just learned it or something teammates that's the reason I'm still okay there's gonna be a massive in here I'm gonna mass t triple take people in fact I'm not sure it even take you I don't even have to make the choice it was a gold bank looking back to the lifeline it's not it's going to drop all the stuff I have my inventory pipe drop my back first listen okay I've talked about this before in my humble opinion I think a pathfinder has far more of a chance of surviving a gunfight than a lifeline if things go bad I'm grappling the heck out of there what Carl I find ooh there's nothing to the distance is all lifeline can do so I reckon there's more of a chance that I survive the gunfight and I'm the one that's the white turns out hopefully please didn't get us killed my humble opinion of course is that of gold helmet rank you want to explore this way oh she come DePalma to climb up this thing I appreciate that I want to get trouble to the path I've already noscope someone oh my god my teammates also triple take man there's two triple team man men I literally thought you gave up [ __ ] side standing still as an enemy grenade incredible scenes my friend seen that situation it was very tempting for me to deshield up and on the outskirts but when they're focusing your teammate like that it doesn't matter how much health you have the lifeline is getting three big ones I might as well just try and help a little bit with the at the o99 and if they started focusing me at least I can grapple to safety sometimes you just gotta find helpful friends you know another care package is a third one of the game here I'll get Bob French in the Nate's know I have so many utilise good great these guys have been absolutely [ __ ] the right these right on him I think I'm pretty sure they both have no field I don't if you noticed the both using tweet machines as well denim there dude machine men about half men and a half big machine busy nice job you might call him another war say this is incredible well absolutely a running through these I have seven kills kill leader stabilize that I mean I have so many available as it's unbelievable news this you know sort of show a long way so I suffer through a few throw balls in there too rather than just shields as much as I love to carry around 32 shield cells sometimes it's good to have a few thermite Zanetti you know I get it watches very close swear I saw something it's not like you don't my teammates getting involved are you using a longbow now I happened to the trouble tape sorry stocks is in the way of the mic someone my voice may sound more fault Richard I'm nice to me even with a cane the way I can't believe triple tape man is turned into lumber man how can you betray the triple tape like this sixty-eight damage nice you have to sit back and he'll move on down the hill that's not good [Music] it may look like I stole my kill trace are you gonna remember I still do plates 70 damage to the lifeline and I hit the first guy the crypto twice for the trouble take as well so I reckon one killer that is a spec IRA now it's pretty fair it is the fourth care package two of them have been the lifeline packages oh I'm not taking that I'm having too much fun over here I'm having way too much fun is chill down man please do not home to me in the comments for this decision the crate is all or nothing if you mess with the triple take doesn't matter if they get close doesn't matter you know scopin it's a it's a jack of all trades weapon nice lifelines not one imagine the scenes now emcees three windows I look at that gold back my teammates challenge and I better help him there we go let me find some purple I'm rockin I can revive you I'm sorry for nothing us then it was just the pitter-patter of the shots in the distance all right other God black woman mattered anyway she's using a Phoenix kick oh yeah absolutely I'm running through this knob yo this is beautiful teammates all this laser here is that right yes I love too much with it here what how do you think it's fair parties this way Mardis risky as far behind me anyway please people with the precision trunk oops I need you Lima we kill the rice still four squads left so I assume not I reckon there's one person left in that squad life I took the same idea as me get the heck and freek involved Oh 140 damage you are completely to me is the best way to open up a closure I'm gonna get there enjoy my pop your friends there you go three assists right there mr. bertocchi so good at entering the gun fight though a hundred and forty damage that I think it was the Mirage up top and because I'm Pathfinder then I can get to the fight so so quickly before they've even had a chance to heal up and yes I'm going for the 24th care package for the world-record attempt here to open up every single care package I'm gonna do this since I'll find gold shields run round for now of the storm so if it's not in here oh come on that's outrageous and contagious this is the lifeline one so it's not going to have gold shield in it but I'm still over the world record attempt stabilizer here helmet here three I've lost count of how many care packages have opened it's possibly six but I think it's fine I'll use the shield battery of course I did taken more heavy rains making contact with enemy ten seconds the ring is fairly close nice job took all the shelves off here for like a hundred and twelve there was something okay punching a door so there's a potential scrap underneath me you could see me I think it's big to be trying to get a little something alright one spot left we are I know I've said it three times name absolute destroying this lambic I've never seen anything like it contact force I couldn't just walk through the portal nature will take them let me at least see this crap I'm going in with the board best shotgun Oh God is gone my right teeth cheerless that is the be most dominant performance I've had with a random squad since the nineties that's a random squad unbelievable I don't think we were properly chat I mean we came so close to death in that long the whole house near the end there 28 squad kills 12 kills fee boy 6 out of Rights 10 from lifeline how much damage is that entails for 4605 what 6300 damage each pretty little bit more 6.4 perhaps I don't believe or seen speak at half lobby with the triple take I've never seen if you like it that was fun this is what it's like to have good teammates unbelievable scenes thank you for watching I do appreciate it I really hope you enjoyed that one as much as I did and I'll see you on the next one [Music]
