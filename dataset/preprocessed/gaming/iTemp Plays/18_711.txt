hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are three stacking in pubs it is the cardinal scene here on apex but hear me out first of all we couldn't play ranked because i'm too low of rank i'm silver two and these guys aren't silver two and secondly i play versus three-man teams all the time in public matches because they have a hard time filling the lobbies of pure three stacks so what ends up happening is they put duals in alongside the teams of three but then the team of two is in a 2v3 so then they have a random solo guy fill up that third slot so no matter how big your your party is whether it's one two or three players you'll come up against stacks of three anyway so the team today is janks who has been on the channel here so many times and this game coming good was actually my first one ever with so far he's a great guy he's a great player i'll leave his channel link in the description as well he's got some good games in this session that we had and i'm sure you'll see them there on his channel and i won't upload those games because i didn't do so hard so if you're interested go and drop us up it's the same as jenks but i'm sure we already have soon as we play together so much here on the channel so yes thanks for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my all of you in the friends mirror they have a hundred thousand kills fine yeah they have a hundred thousand kills combined oh no i wasn't looking is that what that was they have a hundred thousand dude that one guy has more kills friends than me and rich together and then some he has more kills as kill leader on one character than i have since the game came out on every single character involved so he loved to hear it that was absolutely ridiculous dude you know how crazy it is that's this is our job yeah this is our job and that guy has more kills than both of us combined can't even keep up with these guys he loves the game he loves it fair enough and now they're dead nope oh my god they died they already died we have the one and only so far on our team we're safe oh do not put all that pressure on cause i will choke i promise you it's already dude i'll see some twiglets man there's no one really like the other day no and i'm gonna go all the way through and go kill these guys can we get em down on route oh that doesn't sound good oh actually it doesn't sound good okay it was good it was fantastic you guys want to see something yes wait did they touch this oh yeah this is gross oh they patched it is it oh is it is it really they patched it like a giant spot you used to be able to climb up there and get into the roof oh my god it was so bad your whole body would be inside the building i hear them okay i'm lying he's a phony i found them they're on the the right over here they're on the the farther building no one sees any sort of site for escape 136 on the guy on you so far oh is it going behind me crash the mastiff is so slow without a shotgun bolt i'm just looking at him oh it's terrible oh do you want to know what sucks massive shots i walked past so many purple ones i think i walked past three purple chakras i'm sorry it's not your fault don't think everything i probably walk past just as much but i don't use shotguns so like my eyes don't register when i walk by one yeah i used to be like that yeah i used to think that yeah like um i will stabilize this as well all the time yeah like your eyes don't see it or your brain doesn't your brain doesn't like pick it up just filters it out yeah it's like when i was playing with the sniper in my video i was complaining because no one used to snipe ammo and i apparently i'll walk past like three boxes with you because i just don't even look at the sniper hammer i look for light and heavy sniper got a shotgun bolt for you now pinged it oh oh wait i don't have this sniper stock here level three they look kind of man there's a treasure back here my treasure pack let's go race for 100. get them out of here but they regret that oh my word listen i'm doing it the best of both worlds the nine and the prowler the wombo combo of the century in combination yeah it's one of my favorite loadouts it just sucks end game when there's defensive players selfies like skeletons so fast that's yeah that's such a good loadout i think it'll be really nice with mirage too because even if they're playing like really defensively like that like at range i'll just crank them with a quick bamboozle and i'll weasel my way out in there brain dance the old ring dance are they really fighting all the way over here i thought this was closer i'm not sure if they're just running away at the same time or i think they're all oh they're uh yeah what is this place called what is this uh oh the storm's coming in but how weird do you feel just popping down a portal like that and it's significantly shorter 25 it's not baby oh the wrong baby portal big scan they can take oh my god i think there is another team here there must be someone else to start nights unless that was him no no it's totally worth it though totally worth it absolutely always worth it yeah totally is the champion squad still alive because i want to kill i just saw the banner and he had zero kills so maybe he's just chilling i didn't even see their names to be honest no i don't know their names oh team flying into your left rich oh okay yeah yeah you're right let's see i gotta pop a mata real his teammates behind him so scary i'm not going to lie i literally ran behind you jenks and just hid behind you and i was like i'm going to take all the damage oh blue time body shield that guy had a blue no this guy had no bag oh this guy secured zero bags bagless gamer i have a gold r99 and a gold prowler oh my what like actually it's kind of ridiculous i'll let the if the champ squad is still alive we're gonna need it all right that's true yeah true are one of you guys kill leader uh yes me i wonder what they're doing how are they not getting any kills i'm kind of confused because 16 people with round one closing isn't actually that bad it's bad but given recent trends not that bad i mean i watch your i watch your most recent video talking about the the whole respawn decoy or what will respawn beacon thing and i'm like it makes sense yeah it just clicks i realized that's why they were doing it i get ptsd every time i walk through this alley okay i'm the least athletic gamer of all time i'm up yeah i saw it but i wasn't going to say anything i was struggling on those rocks stop playing warzone again yeah i deal with it all the time so i was just not gonna acknowledge it big scan he stands up all right okay i don't know what that path is doing but oh i'm coming to help so far she's low low but no shield i got the little bus last one back here right behind that wall i just i poked down my rock to spectate and then straight but it nearly killed me [Laughter] i was having a little look it was the last guy i heard people fighting on our right though i think we go to the right rather than pushing that one solo i think they were shooting at that guy on the on the zip and i think he was running away i heard a gibraltar all right unless that was a gibraltar and he threw us all to them maybe okay come on fellas this got to be there we got to run into the champ squad at some point here eventually there's a blue stop in that building back there oh wait what okay this is too same yeah and there's a team on the right there's a yeah there's a gibby over here uh yeah i don't know if we push this because if we push one of these we're gonna end up getting dirty by the other side that ain't that angle is really bad oh my he's got a single fire nothing mate your favorite thing is absolutely cracked clothes cracked up top i'm on a phoenix recharging my shields yeah this team is just waiting a third party sorry yeah yeah i don't think we do they're already coming down they're already coming down all right he might kill me he might kill me oh my god i got it off oh bingo done nice shots dude if he's cracked again nice i'm subbing in guys it's on top of that roof though yeah this team is playing super passive when i was cracked on the roof none of them i got um i can drop some heels down here if you guys need something down here cells i have one battery yeah i can drop one i can drop one i'm gonna back up and probably play towards zone just because they have to move in towards the point yeah yeah i'll just head over here i just farmed a lot of damage on them though the old sky i think half was into a gibby arm shield but yeah i'm running double smg like if i had a little bit of rain i'd be able to help a bit more but yeah running the nine prowler right there like you said at the beginning that's uh that's where it makes a difference yeah definitely i feel like they probably don't have much shield after all of that there's no way they're going to the right they don't want to fight us oh somebody just tried to throw me oh what is this he's over there he's oh he's on top of that uh there's no way he hug there's no way that's the same guy that just threw a grenade up here i think it was bro from there he's landed up here i mean our stars uh don't explode till they land yeah you're right what's shieldless what are you doing he's teabagging and he's shieldless i think he was oh no okay he was pulling a shield battery on he was just teasing i wonder what they're doing i'm gonna try a thing this team these teams didn't even fight either they just split one went that way one team oh so that's the whole server so there's two over there and then there's one up here i think that other team is over here right change of plans we got we got the wingman now so i have some range i have to follow these guys because they're tea bagging up there so i have to try oh right here on my way behind that as well i'm running sort of low on light but i can't escape something you want to push them with me yeah [Applause] the same thing that was up top nice i missed all my shots thank you oh another team just took where we were at honey uh that's gotta be that dude still teabagging i think they know oh yeah unless he just hates me i i i don't trust them yeah there's too many sweaty king in this lobby i'm farming damage make myself look better in the game wait is that team so top i'll stay oh he's so wiggly he's so wiggly he just want me to kill him he doesn't want me to kill him reloading he's got a gold knock down just so you know he definitely wants to fight he definitely wants to box this i mean we could keep him for the end of it yeah yeah later down here i don't know no heavier mode do you guys have anything um no i'm afraid not i also dropped like a ton right here right in the middle and that's how you get the job done i'm making another lines with this pathfinder to make sure it doesn't shoot us okay listen don't shoot me okay he's good we can trust him we've we've made an alliance that's gotta be the champion then right because he hasn't died yet yeah i think so this team is gonna be interesting i'm just gonna go jump on their head that wasn't him that's not the champion this is someone else scanning the area yeah i think they're i think they're part of the same team i think so yeah i think one of them jumped that guy's not friendly though so he could definitely take him out you win those he fell off oh there's an octane oh there's no chasing him oh he messed up his pass but he's going back for it oh he's in he's insane this is the champions i don't trust him he was shooting us the whole time platform drama all right what y'all want to do with them gonna twack this guy yeah dude i'm so tired one is one hell okay yeah oh wait i just [ __ ] him i just stopped the down one correct rings all right who's doing it don't volunteer i'm too nervous i'll go mana i'll do it i'll go mono with mono with them let's see i lost my last one so i don't want to lose another one i got the statue hey strands turn around that's not fair i wasn't aware that we were scrapping no he just threw a right hand at me it was a cheap shot i keep you alive don't worry oh this is going to be a sick battle in the water oh it's right here we're on the bridge dude it's on the bridge oh get outta here get on the middle of the bridge get on the middle of the bridge over here no no no no no stop stop he doesn't know he doesn't know he doesn't know he doesn't know he'll be over here oh dude this is sick don't don't put the pressure on me because i will lose so please win let's get a little scan for you always found the results oh oh oh did you just hold whoa oh the chief moves he look he knows went we pulled out all the stops we pulled out all the stops on that fistfight 100 yeah i think i also found that 600 damage off him too you are the apex champions i don't i wonder what happened to the champs yeah i don't remember ever finding them dude you guys tried oh dude when did that happen that that was an interesting pup for being a pub game that was pretty interesting yeah we need to get the 10 10 10. i don't have that because i never really played with three people yeah i i don't i don't either so honestly i'm down that's close
