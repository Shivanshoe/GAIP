hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are running the longbow alternator setup you see it in the algs all the time and i decided to try it out for myself because all the pros are using these yesterday i asked you guys what guns you would like to see me use seeing as i've used the same five or six weapons since the 90s and most people were asking for snipers now i am not too great with snipers on controller because i've always found the higher magnification scopes to be really weird on apex legends there is something in the settings that make it just different to call of duty which is the game that i most experienced on with the controller as an fps it's the same reason you'll see me rocker one time is on a skate i have more success with a one times then i do it three times even if they're 300 meters away it's the game it's not me i have two warnings for you for today's video the first of which is that for some reason my aim was actually tragic for the first part i'm really not sure why i think it may be because i am bad and the second warning is that we had a really energetic teammate he was a great guy but he was swearing a little bit and i did my best to get his swearing but a few may have slipped through i've had tweets from parents watching my videos with their young children so i just wanted to put a disclaimer out there because of that other than that i hope you enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you in 59 seconds yeah yeah i run our stuff i think this lifeline's thrown at you scientists again punch everyone punch them how are you guys getting into all our games let's go swearing that's what i made up top yes yeah this guy like up top in the middle i'm trying to protect you my friends come in fly fly thank you i have lumbar skull pace that they're gonna full send him this is gonna be a dying simulator i feel it hi there it's uh me from the future uh i i did warn you i said i said it's gonna be tragic for a little while and i wasn't lying and the proof is in the pudding as they say but trust me it does get slight just just slightly better just a little bit give me an e right and i'll distract everyone with my terrible shooting you know i'll take the alternator same step as last game but it empties first wow that was a now that was a ball run run run that's not primer he's moving there's no cypher oh there was this gun's correct the spitfire is so broken i was using one too but so it doesn't really count but shield battery here uh you kind of have yeah that's five 58 from here with no sign my longbow nice not bad you have a zip he said you have a zip i'm just like the middleman here someone's foxtailing us yes oh yeah we're right in the middle of all them uh yes not ideal that's the life have i not found a decent scope on i think i've passed two times earlier and i'm playing right now oh my god when i tell you i'm cracked so pumps i seen that stuff who you punching i'm watching the arrows i'm mad going around big winning big point i'm running in circles he's inside nice any signs for a longbow exciting times i don't see any reloading it's a mess i'll go back here for our teammates somewhere light ammo here extended light magazine here okay level two backpack here level four i got the back you're right oh there's a guy oh she has to go back already all right i'm on the way don't go up there 29.45 is oh my god they were all on you they they i died i hate this thing so much he's the worst they'll talk um i don't know jump off this game is pure carnage it feels like my monitor is like repairing get yourself situated after this game i don't like it's right guys uh you're pushing along by the way it's right but it's all right it's right but it's wrong i guess we gotta go there rings next door make sense let's move this way this way it's repositioned are you still chasing the horizon i have no idea she went flounder danger close rings she gonna pick one hello he loves it i mean if anyone deserves it it's a horizon with a spitfire oh yeah i wouldn't even be mad if a full team punched me out because i'm abusing the spitfire right now i think you would be curious can you do an impression of maggie i want to hear it of who maggie maggie yes your care package coming your way um no what's the other one i like the other one more champions the the other one oh ice mate that was really that was not that's not it but you know she's going to make that impression he's so noisy on twitch hi smite what's this going on here danger all kinds of crazy scenarios going on oh they're just holding door they are holding doors the two of them on my door is he holding the door he's probably so confused as to what's happening we've just we've just become so good at punching people i actually love it so much it's so much fun especially with the bangalore and then i'll complain about how it's the most broken thing in the game i mean i'm gonna abuse it until they nerf him i gotta nerf it i think i'm helping out the community that's the mobile response right there's no there's nobody oh on me oh no i hit a nasty grapple off the scene coming back right face back we just we both got terrified oh it's just you and another solo yeah we just ran away from each other she has blue by the way they're shooting at the drop ship so she said i assume she went right i think she went right now i hear left but it's just her oh okay this is a full team over here oh my god i never have to reload it's crazy nice oh what a shot that was that's a range double kill trying to first i missed every shot that's all ruined the first clip to be honest three level four bags a level 12 bag together yeah yeah let me get that what would a level 12 bank do if you died you just respawn battles oh yeah should be if you get off these bags [ __ ] it can i get a good thing now this let me finish let me finish the thumbnail biggest one that's beautiful lighting could be a bit better oh nice i like it i think that's something you had like your like the aura of your shield regening too that's cool pretty good where's your amigo amigo i don't know but he's getting punched out oh yeah is that a lifeline pad no nice all these packages are unopened so they're not over here oh there we go crazy biggie i started off and then i'm going to go down we've all got gold bags we're fine where did he go he might be hiding inside he's laughing she joined them oh my god we like juggled her i you punched her in the air i hit her in the air and then the the lifeline finished her off oh my god that guy was great his energy was amazing oh man more performance from the squadron four revives i was all on you right yeah i was like boy i think i went david you know i'm a team player yeah yeah
