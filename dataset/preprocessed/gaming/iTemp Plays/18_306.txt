hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing a legend who got buffed in season 10 but i completely forgot usually when we get patch notes i try to make a video about pretty much every change because it's interesting to try the legends and weapons when they've been adjusted to see how they are but fuse is a legend who i don't really get too much success from playing it's just kind of difficult to aim grenades views as they go so fast i'd rather throw nades in a general direction and pray than have the precision of fuse's passage but that's just me i have three games here for you today and i actually think i did a relatively good job overall of using his newly ish buffed knuckle cluster he was actually pretty good so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos thank you so they somehow figure out how to make the quality lower yes and low i think they're up top me i had a quick look outside oh i'm just going to jump all the way up top oh i just did it i'm at the top stimming in this i mean this why would i do such a thing oh my god i get it i was hitting all my shots and then i missed all of them do you know why it's because he started punching are you like yeah are you doing a fuse thing what's going on yes i'm 140 damage low-key kind of popping off yeah yeah i had a good video idea are you still are you still being sarcastic are you serious no no it's actually like people love it when they don't know who what the legend is so i'll be like i completely forgot this guy got buffed okay [Music] yeah i'll be there sooner or later it this way kimchi juice have you ever heard kimchi i have i never have reloads it's nice they're full sending uh yeah you're still alone i'm honest like another 15 seconds okay i'm flying in reporting she's tanking it on here again with it i think it's really in it yeah wait this guy left the game my teammate or the other guy oh the course okay dude like i've seen people leave a game when it's like 1v3 this dude legit just left it his teammate was alive i don't know how much he oh people here i don't know how much he actually hit me with the charge rifle it wasn't much no he you're 100 water i can't use the scope what am i doing mirage they're both at this rock right on me in front of me i'm kicking that guy by the backs got the back slit cracked what is that all i really don't know sometimes they get desperate get them really weak really weak nice nice that's nice what is that challenge you've got a lunatic this guy's really weak too what's he doing what's that okay i get in there amigo i already suck with you let's be honest let's not be around the bush here oh my god he's i suck at like his ultimate and i suck with like launching grenades but like his q ability like his actual ability i really like uh the tactical yeah he's tactical yeah it's really good now i really like these good players because good players love to just like jiggle beacon hold cover and you can force them out with that it's great it's just area denial you know i'm looking for i mean his old is he uh his ultimate it's not you i mean it's all just kind of weird what i don't understand is that when i get hit by the all it's like that jeff thing when i get hit by his old it tracks me for the next 20 seconds and i nearly go down when someone hits my odds i hear for five and they run out and they're fine like what what's the what's going on there it's very deceiving oh our teammate dc oh i have no more sniper bullets rich no come on come on oh there's more at the right time she put a heat shot then she still died maybe she left i'm skipping man yes ralph i am do you want to watch them in each other's corners no you want to watch them fight how did i miss i suck on my way wait there's no way oh my god team i've just spent ages i just did 300 damage the same bangalore and this guy just robs the hemlock i wanted it so bad i wanted so bad he might need to be good i don't know imagine why in a hemlock i have a 33 i'm using a man how's your game been going what's been going on over here oh i ran in a circle a little bit i hated it for 131 um when he was 140 and then the kill got taken oh yeah huge huge solid there that's the vibe mate someone's up top it's really weird cryptos one i need some light rains too oh he missed the fat he missed the bed oh no i just went the wrong way he's fast amount of light ah he ducked he ducked the carrier do you want the other side of the icarus i was wrong big big ship i'm surprised you should walk through here with 30 on the clock let's move like did you not walk through there and get flashbacks oh where oh you do oh yeah oh yeah you wanna you wanna go over there again 418. zero first though actually one first oh i suck i am really low i'm just trying to use my knuckle cluster mate i'll be honest with you i could not be weaker nice that was the last one right is only going to get harder by the day i mean it's still 100 possible but it's gonna get harder yeah oh no oh goodness me it's an absolute modern day tragedy oh oh yeah firing me i didn't kill him really nice i'll take my three assists that's good enough for me who's kill leader hello it's me i'm gonna kill you uh nine he really yeah oh okay i didn't i thought i don't know that many kills nice i have three i deserved every single one of them playing with you when you're octane sucks uh-huh i'm not like i'm knocked in anymore i'm going to come inside take that i mean to be to be fair when any of us play octane it sucks it doesn't matter who it is even when you play octane like it sucks like i hate it too it's so difficult no dude if i take my two time come on it's a crypto right oh he's got boys here he's boys he's going i'm dead all three of my streaming i didn't remember these boys are around clean game on my head no i think that's them i hate you okay i actually hate jewish oh i i'm helping i'll kill one of them it's not it's not your fault but i hate you no that's them i'd be able to do a sky name with three people live live oh she's actually actually driving over here oh no she's gonna die downrange save her oh i killed the race but they're just going to get a raise and i couldn't name you because that was kind of crazy oh okay unless this whole team lands here amen i'll go up top do you stay here i have two guns so let me know if you need anything i got through one rampage up top fancy i got sniped in the head mate one person standing here i'm ticking hopping about this is kind of a mess what is happening everybody's so passive right yeah there's like a holding building that team jumped off left side i'm just playing this slow to be honest this team's over he's like in dire straits but i can't i've got no range for him yeah we still got this other team so be careful i'll come back to you this way they're in here with a lifeline [Applause] they're all huddled at the top of the stairs i fire a knuckle cluster and i'm doing no damage with it i'm so confused yeah and this other team is pushing back down one incoming thanks yep sounds about right how did my knuckle cause to get stuck there i literally followed you inside the room man but this guy's literally just snuck in the back of the head the entire time this team of the snipers is like he's seriously annoying [Applause] and that's why shields [Music] what is this what is this space look at this that's actually ridiculous that's unreal i can't even move oh god mate my i i did about i must be the worst views in the world honestly they're rushing us from down low i currently stairs i tried to fire it there it gets stuck on this window i don't know how how does that i don't know uh someone here is a mobile respawn hold on yeah just do your thing i mean i don't know how much loot is there because everyone was struggling yeah but you've got your selection of death boxes i've never seen a building like that especially here of all places like right here level two i need that that big scrapping i might have a peek probably just died energy magazine here a dragon all the vibes on that ah dude dude this is a you game but just i am not with you just know that yeah i know you've got luke 12 yes it's taking a while that's something good be over there on my way that that guy's probably got loot i should probably lose [Music] uh someone else is like someone just revived in here so i'm a little bit scared i scanned your belly i don't think anything oh really they must have run let's off reloading recharging shields nap time's over i'm stressed mate oh you're stressed i'm stressed i'm stressed you're stressed we're all stressed i'm stressed great ah god sorry what's wrong with you watson fence mate oh you know one of the worst feelings i just realized this is a pretty bad feeling well there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff that happens in this game that just feels awful right yeah i'm getting punched out like you know stuff like that um getting stuck by an arc star and then uh knowing you're under the health of where you're going to go down so like you're you're just like you're you're walking around just it's so meaningless like you're going to die like what's the point you're just looking for a nice place to just fall over yeah i was just trying my hardest not to bring it to you guys die on my own see that's why we're separate that's that's what differentiates us i'd really try and find you you would have if i'm stuck raw stuff that's my philosophy everything is a team you know yeah i just wanted to suffer on my own in silence and that's also where we're separate if i'm so free and i'm letting everyone know what's going wrong i can't i can't stop myself from complaining oh that was a mess right there i feel like i just got out of a war and i've got 1600 damage coming in how's that possible i mean how much of your time did you dedicate to throwing nades and then getting no damage from those nades fully enough i don't think i've thrown a single mate i've only used my knuckle crosstail okay i like it i mean it's like it's so hard to use this fuse it's just that's the cable player throw i feel like even then 90 of the stuff you throw isn't gonna do any damage it's just it's really annoying though and i think that's kind of the point is it just it's like a nuisance i i did get it i would like to see a tracker per game of how much damage i did because uh i was definitely being annoyed with it in those buildings yeah makes people make weird decisions i feel like yeah 100 that's why i went and took that piece of cover and you said what are you doing you know it was my  that was out there it was your own knucklehead so you just defeated yourself yeah it happens right we've all been there you wanna see my super jump first time you wanna see this uh-huh you gotta do it first try though have you ever seen a few super jump just for fun  how long no i was holding i was holding square i was good that doesn't count i was holding it no no no no i was still holding it hey look at that oh god oh god please blazer oh my god actually just annihilated oh my god he needed one shot but i'm pretty sure oh it's a fuse if he's refused oh here we go here we go where is he at i'm gonna show you this guy's name oh the blue gamers they're blue gamers oh my god i was trying to i was trying to use the key i was trying to use the key epic source he's having the best time of his life over here yeah it's hard when teammates you know they're they're demons and they just want to kill you can't you can't blame the man for shooting the last guy though you know i can't complain about that or the apex champions all right nice job that was a good game all right i'm gonna go and die at 53 because of high blood pressure i don't know you and that's that's in like two years for me so get here way past that nice job okay
