hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back on world's edge and i have missed it that isn't to say that i don't enjoy olympus i think that they are both great maps but i do appreciate the variety both maps are now in the rotation and today's video was a little solo expedition and it was almost one continuous fight at scraptor city i'm sure you guys are going to love the gameplay if you're new to the channel please hit subscribe as we are getting close to one million subs here and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends my friends me amigos we are back on world edge we are having a tremendous time we are not having victory this time anymore because there appears to be no weapons on this map and someone is beating me there that's such a shame teammates i'm literally weaponless give me a second if broken has been loosed okay it has it great this is one of the best buildings for loot in the entire game too look at this spitfire r301 a chance to put my tier 110 at a battle pass skin on there i'll throw teammates i'm sorry that's a bad thing because there was a level two extended i'm taking it straight back i'm taking this straight back as well so i do not have too many light rains and if i have to switch to a heavy weapon in future i'll be glad i've kept these uh 100 any scraps going solid nice i'm helping i'm doing what i can so much recently thank you for noticing i've got a load of shield here had the life i was going to ping them here you go bangalore i know you sort of struggle at the moment so is that lifeline the person that i saw at the bottom of this rope no one's seen around in here are they i think we're good my teammates for steps or did someone come back for the banners honestly i think is my teammates footsteps oh friend trying to casually revive your teammates aren't we oh imagine if you got sent into the lava oh my god who do i help that may have actually been the same squad i don't remember any voice lines playing that said uh third party i mean i know for a fact that bangalore would have said something to us could have prepared should have prepared an entire speech about third party so i think we're safe uh timo i have one of these probably the most effects you'll ever get from the phoenix you haven't seen the pink that's okay i'll keep this right just rolling about the floor newborn baby like that what's he doing alright huge scrap this is what we like to see it's grafton city this is where this is where the the name comes from there's a lot of people here oh god i'll catch you apparently oh no i've missed my chance i think it's in there already i'm already going help i'm looking through the window like a weirdo all right well i found it kind of the lifeline of the vanguard is coexisting in here and the bangle was hiding fire in the hole oops i missed i no give me a sec all my words i spend half this game scanned through a wall by about four different bloodhounds honestly like 10 health 32 spare shots need your stuff and again someone's going to revive and i've been scanned so this is three three people we are awesome i haven't first to my teammate yet i think we can see what we can do at least we have enough ammo now making contact oh my god i was jumping i'm back should head to the vehicle oh my word give me your armor 43 seconds on the banner how close is the bangalore's banner uh i'm going to need some light ammunition teammates i can respawn you there are two two and a half minutes let me get some light ammo there's enough time for us to come back here and loot i think there we go perfect i'm gonna bother trying to lose anything else i've left red armor somewhere it's not worth it i only need 76 more damage to turn this into red and if i respawn my teammates sooner rather than later they get a whole lot of loot whereas if i start messing about trying to perfect my loadout then they're going to be running in the fields with the p2020 and broken white arm in some way you know okay that's not bad with a lifeline on the team i'm gonna have to pick it up there kind of a waste of time for her to come over this way it's actually is there a team there are there people there let's go over here oh she's just saying let's get over here no there are definitely people here i missed i missed i keep missing and they've got multiple people just keep running team let's get to the loop this is perfect this could not have gone any better they've been distracted long enough for us to hoover up some loot and i don't have damage loot myself first things first before i forget gold bag delivery service don't worry it won't slow you down has it gone back behind you yeah look here you go back back here i mean i could type it but my keyboard is there we go perfect my keyboard is all the way on the desk and my hands are on my controller it's a lot of effort maybe there's a lot of effort just give me some light rains please people and then i'll be good 120 sounds like a lot until you realize you're using the r400 combo and then you realize hold on a second whatsoever these guys finish their fight i saw someone and i don't think they're selling cookies a decoy hey thank you so much yeah don't don't listen i need two damage to get red armor oh look oh my word there's a guy oh just a guy this is another team it's another team too oh look i'm scanned again for the 15th time this game oh oh this is probably worth the extra time it took mike am i right let's go i think we're absolutely fine to loot here uh i'm gonna just wanna charging on my shoes actually i'll use the phoenix i'm saying when you've only got two bats it's probably worth saving them make sure you collect this have you seen it they've seen yeah absolutely fine uh we heard the two of the squads fighting probably train yards does it sound like it so just take a second to get some loot here this has been one of the craziest games and this this is why they call it scraps you see my throat i don't want to stay here and lose i don't want to come over the crest of this hill with the storm moving behind us these guys might hurt us fighting and they might be trying to gatekeep so the earlier the better oh my word well we're alive bit of breathing room here there is a respawn at the train yard although i'll be honest no no i saw a mobile respawn beacon at some point this game i have no idea where it is dropping i'm not waiting for it oh bk what do you think oh it's a bloodhound oh i'm scanned once more great i love bloodhounds okay well i need through that oh nice there are two of you and you are both triple taking me i love it well the good news is within one of them do we know where he is he could be crawling off to staff revive that would be a complete disaster i'm appreciating these smoke maker that's the bangalore ultimate they might be using this to try and revive the octane here is i thought they were going to try and revive the octane they didn't at least it's 2v2 no it's not i was holding square i guess i thought there's anyone in there giving my shield yeah one's at the back oh my one god you are the apex champions i i don't how much damage you reckon that was because that felt like a lot of damage i i felt like i was fighting the entire game 3148 damage two respawns one revived 15 kills back on world's edge i said thanks for the carry i'll be already left i'm gonna say like i feel like we played well as a team you know i feel like we stayed together they were patient enough to wait around if they didn't wait around for me to uh to retrieve their banners and respawn and we don't win that game that was a combined effort that was so much fun i look i love what's edge
