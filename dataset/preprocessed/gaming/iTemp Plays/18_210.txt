hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be using the wingman a gun that i never used for the first 18 months of apex legends life then when i committed myself to getting good with it i overused it and many people in my comments asked me to mix up the weapons that i was using in my videos and since then i've barely used it again now i want to pick it back up the wingman is so good it has massive skill expression it's an all or nothing kind of gun and it's really really easy to look terrible with it and i should know because i often do if you're using an r301 chances are you can land at least a few bullets if you spray an entire mag with the wingman i often miss the entire mag and die a horrible death it's great in fact that happens this video it's going to take me some more time to practice with this gun but until then i'll be having a great time hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends you to understand context oh you can't i can no one can i can i'm not with you by the way i'm at this other py okay going though wow oh you're taking the the the gravity lifting oh sorry i'm okay good night he's pretty much dead mate can't blame if you're trying to come back and save me though i often need it yeah i almost left you but i was like you're gonna see me die and then i'm gonna start crying and you know it's not pretty on the way people love i know this be a while yeah they do don't they i don't know why i got a big uh i've got a big pad is this what are these solar panels they're the sl it's the slipperiest substance i don't know why there's like two teams here oh sorry carl oh come on carl's already dead carl's already dead and i'm still getting destroyed i'm coming back up what okay oh my god this is too thirsty for your teammate literally just died in front of you and you're trying to thirst thank you all good that's the wrong side of the shield amigo oh my god no please please are you okay yes just a bite on my door but i should be okay a wingman i mean yeah i don't have a wingman did you get him yeah he's dead nice i don't know if you see any energy please huge thank you did you tap straight to do that oh yeah so broken just because you can't do it i can can i have i will do it i will i refuse to cheat yeah that's what i was right i'm an honorable gentleman oh definitely wasn't because he had the muscle memory of an 80 year old man yep i'm straight oh cracked on it's just such a lie that's going to take you back maybe this is horrendous how am i getting okay nice your game beamed i'm what do you mean you i'm literally it was me to begin with it was me to begin with i got hit once it's only one headshot and he's still coming are you okay are you that girl eyes off is that nice [Music] yeah i'll jump in the other side the gravity because we might as well take it right yeah yeah i would make it yeah i'll leave you that one there i had two i will have one each it's a follow item time so we're not going to find anyone don't worry if you want to find someone i'd if i would go that way i see i'd go the complete opposite where would you go wherever you say i will go that's what i mean like because i'm going this way maybe just go somewhere else i mean that's the plan this might be a good strat faster faster okay right here this is why we always listen to something yeah we never actually we listen to you we do the opposite of whatever you do no i agree were they up i don't know i just saw that is that was that him yep yep hello i killed an enemy what do you guys understand he was looking at the stars oh yeah what was his team his teammate was doing the same wait do you leave might don't no this is box right here this is box no you've been scammed mate he's won hopefully he's live and i'd like to know what they were up to yeah i don't know what they're doing i saw them and then they disappeared and they're like man he was standing here right here one of them the fuse is here looking up the stars i like i looked at him multiple times but he just blended in with the background so well i didn't think it was a real person maybe they thought we were above them and they were waiting okay so where do you where do you want to go uh this is me i'd go through this tunnel over here would you really i'll be checking out checkpoint yeah okay what about you i actually think that's a good strat oh we're doing the opposite all right let's go this way one of the gravity cannon look at this look at this oh my god i am just a genius they're hopping off on may easy don't want to take this that's fine no i want my sandwich i think they were shooting at somebody or getting shot ah i suck wait i'm dead i just got the worst light on my life i am so bad this dude does not miss he doesn't miss the lifeline literally does not miss she doesn't miss it's actually a 2k badge no yup yup that's nice oh my god i had a respond beacon on my body i don't know i thought they were just going to rush me in a close though yeah he's got a minute though why don't ryden i'll distract i mean this is the last two teams just watch over the live line one took the grab to canon that's the lifeline ah you know cracked up top just slide down the mountain maybe it's right here i'm here with you don't worry anyone 430 so 10 seconds the ring is fairly close one's up top to take ashes one nice job i cannot believe that time i died now to selfres i don't even know if i want it on the internet then i tried to shoot the other one and i think i hit one shot out of maybe a fifth and a half it was a tragedy oh mate don't take it don't take it have you got a heat shield nope officer on there oh my god did we get out of here though how do we have to zoom around the side we have to see ah do you have a pad not yet not yet i need your card yeah this is the worst uh yeah we should be fine we need your bread yeah all right it's on 79. how long does that take a2 a3 all right so where would i put this hold on let's zoom in i mean if you could tap strafe it wouldn't matter but you can't open it there when we zoom around i don't want to hit my head off that hold on straight i tap strafe careful oh man i thought we weren't punching anyone too fair that was a key she deserved it off being is better than you or what you are the apex champions oh god i like you too can't believe i'm about i'm actually gonna upload me you're not gonna fight i can't believe it why would you do that to yourself because i have to i've respawned you twice mate get it yeah get it together oh it's literally my life with you
