hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and one of the most requested quality of life updates is coming to apex legends which is a damage counter not knowing how close you are to your desired damage badge is the worst but these days are coming to an end in season eight jason mccord who is an apex developer confirmed this on twitter uh saying that it was intended for the next patch but missed the cutoff but it should be coming in season eight which isn't too far away now another thing that's gained some love here is octane's jump pad which will give you more options on your trajectory this is taken from the apex legend subreddit and this is a post from a developer called daniel quain summarized daniel talks about how they intend to make octane's pad act differently depending on how you are moving when you interact with the pad if you use slide three your trajectory is a lower angle but has the potential to make you travel further horizontally but if you just sprint onto the pad normally you have that regular higher super jump mechanic this would be great for octane because depending on whether you're trying to escape or you're trying to scale a building you need your pad for different scenarios and giving the player more control is always a good thing in my opinion so these are some sneak peeks that some future updates will be getting here on apex legends you may have missed them since they were hidden away in the reddit comments and twitter replies so today i have two games for you with octane of course and i hope you enjoy them if you're new around here be sure to subscribe to the channel and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends introducing your champion time to
