hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex and legends of course now in apex there are specific places that spawn specific types of loot you have the sniper mountain on world's edge on olympus there were the triple bins near the waterfall in the middle of the map that spawned gold items almost all of the time that location has since moved to docks but the best place to get yourself legendary guns is almost certainly caustic water treatment on king's canyon and in this game i was walking away with a golden re45 equipped to the hammer points at the start of the game and also a golden legendary triple take and it's just busted when you get these guns at the start of the game you'll have such an advantage over everyone else in the lobby it's amazing i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you so much for watching as always and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends um okay one team landing on the front door

and this guy's your favorite content creator krypto crazy crazy crazy you didn't even know what that's ridiculous jordan here swing really embarrassing yeah i did give you a video the other day had two games in there accidentally played the entire first game without my gibby arm shield no cap i mean accidentally or yes actually no you you turned it off yeah i turned off by accident i didn't know because i pressed down on the d-pad to say thanks to the homies a lot you know when they dropped me some light rain so maybe i was ads at the time i don't know understandable i saw someone over here hey tell me i've got low ammo but i 100 yeah it's me market meat market which means they're coming to us i don't have a bat so i should really do this uh i'll be with you shortly i've got two batteries this place janks that'd be sensational i saw a team flying too thank you thank you the team is flying like over the mountain to the east but i swear i heard people in here they're pretty yeah i hear them all back they're in the tunnel okay that's a mirage i saw one run into the tunnel i have alt you want to run away though sorry i'm editing this does anyone know what i just said join me in the shadows oh he bribed me right this crap nice i know the team on me okay so you can see me though 150 on that played [Music] got it on that blue took out the champ i got my own purple all

shoes okay here you go wait i need light there'll be some here i've got loads oh i just patted into a team bro it's good i mean i didn't realize it until i got here i mean what was he doing just waiting what was that oh i can't blame him you gotta be cautious when you're running around solo oh my god another team i did a decent amount of damage considering the circumstances that was beautiful just so we're both on the same page i did nothing that was the eye temperature i'll make the hammers [Music] uh i have four thank you i'm good this guy's got me covered i appreciate the thought though yeah quickscope to one for 19 and then just pull out the re45 you know it's all you need in your life the cars are incredible i mean the the there was like a calmness to the panic in your voice when you're like i did everything that i could considering the circumstances it's a little asteroid yeah it was like uh i died but i went out in a blaze of glory yeah i'll try my best okay yeah it was like a little footnote to the end of the calm to give some context is this real are we lying i'm swimming i mean maybe she wants to go into the water because she wants to swim it's always a possibility that we cannot dismiss no i mean swimming no no i thought he was lying this guy is skipping i have ulti okay what the heck what am i looking at brother nice nice good side roll his face putting get out [Music] not like this you're the one that got back i severely underestimated the that race internet connection i mean if she wasn't like that would she have had the confidence to come across the road and there's no way she knew she was lagging like that 100 so when somebody's lagging that bad i wonder what the game looks like on their screen yeah because like granted we weren't hitting shots but she didn't hit anything either yeah she's probably struggling as well there's nothing for anyone yeah care package out there now what do you do this thing goes like three times where you zoom in and then quickly zoom in and out whilst holding the right stick and it like sort of snaps every time and then like you get comments like ain't sixteen your aimbot was going crazy did i do it i do it on purpose yeah i'll do it i'm serious i'll do that in videos or like games where i know it's gonna be a video i'll do something like that on purpose just to get extrapolated get the engagement up from the from the dweebs i learned that dude i'm gonna be honest i learned it from shop that's what trout used to do like it's unsymphony and tiffany symphony yeah yeah yeah he went on like this press run of accusations like blew him up big time 100 dude that's what you do i mean the two choices i'll have really good aim or just pretend to snap through a wall so i have to snap through the wall yeah i mean but you you listen the real the real accusations come when you put them back you mix them together oh yeah yeah yeah do some good aim and then you snap to a wall right at the very end we're in the middle of it step one is really difficult in that though i'm so stuck uh yeah go on yeah please hey you're about to see something magical me thank you can i have your energy well that's why you always drop the crater for item patron given the circumstances i will headshot the last guy okay oh just no scope teammate and you just pulled it out of nowhere you've been faking this whole time you're cheating i thought i didn't know he was there that was so sick i've never felt more alive he never felt more dead dude it happened so fast he just died
