hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing watson a legend that respawn have seemingly forgotten about her pick rate is really low her kit isn't the most fun to use ever and her ultimate doesn't even work half of the time however there are a few rumors of a watson heirloom coming out sometime soon i'm not sure how soon that might be uh but watson might end up getting the ramp at treatment and that is getting big buffs to your kit when your heirloom comes out now i'm sure the watson mains cannot wait for that update because i will be very surprised if we don't see some substantial changes to her kit when her heirloom is released so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i have a are they all might they all landed on me second squad is hitting me i missed the swap don't worry man i'm gonna put some fancies down yeah yeah yeah

blue you have white how does it make you feel uh it's about the sum of my entire day yeah but you got 15 percent about the sum of my entire life i should give you the purple because it's not like an extra 15 i already have like blue basically i don't want to fight too many bullets i don't have that many this team's running in 126 on one of them nice reloading nice i don't know what's happening mate is that ours or theirs uh both i think you're just calm that you're putting up a fence i need to let you know where the fences are so you don't get spooked out i know you like you see fences you start scraping oh yes that is what i'm known for they're kind of spooky and it's halloween you know i don't need to get too spooked out because the event's already pretty spooky here yeah that plain blue lobby screen is really small yeah i mean always speaks are they getting a revive up top i mean i have one gun i have no energy i mean i'm chilling and i'm behind you i defeated an adversary i am popping some cells i'll be with you momentarily oh i am a tracker i am a god a tear tracker that people are actually going to think i have wall hacks i just know he was going that way i just knew it's just game awareness just top tier awareness uh they call this place they call it the uh the library oh no no we did this already no that wasn't in a video that wasn't in the video just like if you can be like no no this is the video if you can be like why do they call it that that'd be great you have tried doing this joke already multiple times no come on come on i'll just say again just act natural you ready mate they call this place the library this is all going in the video i hope you understand on it [Laughter] they're both weak okay that one's broken too that's another team just flash you open this door for me please thank you that completes the try um by the way that was actually so bm uh it was deserved i don't know i don't think she deserved that no she did she did just because she was already huh there's a racing stream building and i this is one thing i hate it's people that try on this game okay if you're not like slouched in your chair a half watching a netflix show if you're if you're a sweaty triad i don't want to know this way we are not alone look over just the here reefy where's the wrist look i can hear an octane yeah this is an oxygen in front of me ah yeah oxygen in it this one oh my god i'm so bad where's this uh there's a solar ray somewhere what's this oh yeah where did they go what's what's uh what's better more traps or more fences traps so we can use them to uh bm i didn't even realize what was happening like i threw my trophies and i turned away and then i was hearing somebody got hit by the fences i was like what is happening and turn around and she's just being slaughtered no messing this is rough imagine pushing this and you just get electrocuted this is what we need to do to win okay did you do that no i didn't you can watch the video back i'd never do that in the library i'd never disrespect the library of that oh i don't know i don't know i don't like this call out the library can reference this one this one i mean i didn't even tell you why it was the library no you you definitely told me no i don't think i have you've definitely told me on multiple occasions i don't no i'm not no i'm not sure i did you could tell me though that's okay it's because uh they called the library because it's got loads of stores because it's like a tall building oh man that's funny don't leave please don't leave i already left mentally oh you left mentally ages ago before we even loaded the game up you checked out i wasn't i wasn't even here mentally when we loaded up i was off the scene you're playing hunt showdown you're the monitor like between gunfights you're auto branding and then that sounds so much better than what i'm doing right now i'm literally bossing on runescape under the monitor don't worry about it uh this place isn't even looted why are we here i don't know i'm following you ah no oh that cracker that's why that's why i see i i was coming over here i was leading the pack at first that she was dark star delivered got here too she got the crazy segways i've ever seen no car there's a guy here i think they've got to charge up thingy flesh lifeline's cracked over here second team second team i can't revive you there oh no you're trying to shoot me through the glass okay that's a big need they're just going to need it no i have to use it for that bank oh i can pop one i can pop one let's show the shoulder popping popping popping two seconds two one i can't see oh i can see them all don't you worry about that there's more another team i'll get back in um i'm back in here healing okay i went the wrong way i can't get in there from this direction because then you know the vibes now we're fine we're fine we're even getting shot from i actually don't know i can't see should i go i'm gonna go respawn in the zone i've got a minute one minute could take us a while to get there this is what it takes to win i like how our respawn ship is both visible and very loud and everyone else's respawn ship is invisible and silent is it just loud to us i don't get it i don't know maybe a lot to everybody i think it's only loud when you start like when it comes in okay that's good yeah when invisible they're pretty aggressive i'm trying to help teammates one i'm dropping i'm dropping up drop and dropping i had to drop on literally one phone drop if you need me cracked they're calling mike tyson nothing clever about that one he just likes to punch people what is this audio i think it's really beneath us dude this audio is unreal this is the raven before this is so mean i'll put a little cross there look rest in peace let me drink my coffee in peace can you not you are the apex yeah baby look at that you pull out the corsica we win straight away literally first game with cossack after losing for like an hour now crazy with that skin too oh a shoe they call me the boeing because i i've got 737 that's one of the planes right that's way too specific i always drop seven kills three six seven knocks what's specific about that oh my god are you sick of those keeping the spirits high
