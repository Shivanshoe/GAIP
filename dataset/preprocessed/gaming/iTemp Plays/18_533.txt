going this way okay the scene i'm gonna fire teammate he went this way even though there were people right here questionable assuming a good spot i have zero shields uh hold on i have nine you got it um i'm understood yeah i should have gone that way speaking with i knew he's i knew i should have done this questionable you're just such a good teammate rich it's crazy i mean that's what comes with the territory being just the greatest guy ever killed an enemy i wish i was there to shoot people i really wish i was involved wow look at you look at you um i'm getting the loot i didn't even i didn't even kill that guy anyways i just thirsted him all right yeah i'm i'm guaran i'm turning the phillips definitely i need light rains i need light ammo i need energy i'll let you know i don't

oh man that's the third wraith with that skin i've killed this game have a rifle here oh gold havoc oh there's a bird over this way going crazy i have to drop my volts i have nothing oh i'm picking up a 301 wow whose box is going to be i don't know who this is harry gagy broken him back names they have nades that's still my decoy they're foreign you're um shot by plant pot i guess so reloading subject 142 nice 1717. she's just speaking about legendary rate from that other team she's probably going to get the res on the other other ones right yeah i'm going to loot up a little bit i'll be there later she fails in here oh my god that is just the most terrifying gun on my way she got bamboozled he just has the greatest perch ever ride one inside job oh my word that was fun one squad left oh it's fine oh nice all right who knows gotta reno we could still be on mirage if we wanted to we could have sat there yeah but then that wouldn't happen and that was fun that was a good time i had a great time i want to stack like decoys like at the end of the game i don't know how many decoys are bamboozled with you know yeah they need they need more stats at the end of the games just in general anymore starts because they shot every one of my decoys in that ultimate just now they just they destroyed them i mean bamboozling people the entire game i like how uh he says uh every all right all right on me oh which one are you blue don't die i'm coming um how many names this team have braced that a gg absolutely i set the world record for same skins downed in the same game four right four races and not one of them had any hair that's a very specific record but i do think you hold it in england apex champions for season seven with mirage with that skin yes oh all right i think our teammate deserved to kill uh yeah i feel bad i think that's not fair that's not fair at all
