hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some ranked for the first time here on pc so uh as you may know i made it to apex predator rank in season two by myself completely 100 solo queued up there with random teammates and it was a little challenge that i set for myself uh i don't know that i've started a few ranked grinds in previous seasons but i lost interest fairly early on um but in pc i'm feeling better on pc is what i'm trying to say i feel like i'm starting to warm up to the platform a little bit better and there is definitely more of a reason to play ranked on pc as that is where the more competitive players are i know that i am not the best player in the world by a long shot there are definitely so many better players than me on ps4 alone however there aren't too many to make getting masters or predator uh that much of a challenge especially if i'm playing with two really good players even on pc it's going to be a massive challenge once you hit diamonds you're actually going to start playing against real professional players and it could get really interesting because of that i doubt that i'll actually make it to masters but it seems like a load of fun to see how far we can actually get so today it starts we're playing a bit of rank tea with jenks and i hope you enjoy if you do be sure to like creating subscribe to join the item by and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends you didn't come out you're so good thank you thank you our team's landing right on you guys really you've i'm here with you i committed wait that's that's oh that's you what happened to one shot another gun i'm going to land down though there's nobody here there's a guy on the balcony on me i've got nothing my friend blue armor and uh charge i'm gonna commit to getting a gun i have no more bullets i'm out of there i have to run same thing i'm leaving my knock someone's like on the roof i i am hitting them with my resin yeah they're just going to get that red i just have to leave they probably don't have too many heavier balls so it's all okay i would have i would have had it i would have had more than enough crafting mats last game yeah if i if if i didn't die oh that's that was a good point you just came back fresh i'm coming over obviously trying to help you and me now i mean i i don't know why he went over there but you know i sort of respect himself i've got time for it he just clipped oh i guess i want to try to get one hit then i could pop a phoenix for my okay there's fresh armor down i mean i dropped blue here anyway okay drops energy for you you need light stuff oh actually i got a wingman massive okay and i have my emp too i popped my all nice charge do we uh do these guys scrapping i guess yeah we can they're going crazy behind us oh is that the way the fight is oh uh i'm going to see what's going on at four sorry yeah putting an eye in the sky does it give you down low they're nadines yeah i don't think they're fighting they're running i have my ultimate top these guys are fine behind us how about we just come out this way yeah signaling they were fighting they standing still i think you need a syringe i actually have one i was not paying attention i should have been i did i should have been honest if queen syringe it's only he's the saddest on his game all right emp going out nice nice two squads four story nice i don't know this combo we got going on it's pretty it's pretty it's pretty lethal yeah it's pretty nasty someone's down over here too spotted properly it's gonna need it someone already ran off this way there's a team up that's like um it sounds like around right here first floor first floor okay got that k2 just revived everything right now good job let's go that was clean that's ready that was nice they might have gone either way though no no they're still here they're still fine down that way to the right oh they're not they're still safe down here we can really bully him there's three people to stop there i'm doing i'm doing it oh no what's that one's inside somewhere the other one with the devo is far away right here i'm looking at this bloodhound with the devo i hope you're okay have we tried we're fine no we didn't trade that was the other guy she's really weak here jim's then there's two teams is he really yeah it's another team there's a she's pre-aiming the door with a laser i would not come in here yeah that's a that's got to be another team because we knocked one outside you knocked one in there and then yeah i think i've got a few no regs it might have not been a trade i think i just got the other kill credit i think she's still weak in there she hasn't healed she's just on a turret terrified she's got sheila i know she's literally premium the door as well but i got to a spot where you can just avoid it still there you go i want to see if i can get one here oh my word i'm not leaving you alone i died it i mean she's going to get life on her own i don't know how that person i hit him for 250. i usually try to land up top but there is never anything there so i'm going to land we do have uh we do have a team okay oh give me the gun yes okay okay in the middle i'm oh the hemlock's unreal the ham looks crazy i like it i definitely put fabric for loud no way i love no shots i hear him okay he's up you top everything you scratched one burst oh she's not cracked unless the army switched he armor stopped yeah i don't want to heal my armor i'm so close to leveling it up oh yeah it's annoying there got it a scam for you yeah oh my word i love it you do jump out on me oh i'm going i don't think you can oh god it's going to rest it's a lifeline too she definitely got the best 100 yeah um heavy heavy energy i'm gonna go loot these back bills i have a heavy energy for you are you using it i got pretty yeah yeah but i got a decent amount of ammo because i wasn't the one you know what hang on to it for now the all this back stuff is unloaded i'm just going to run through it real quick everybody that i've talked to that has brought up the flatline thinks that they buffed it right they they changed the recoil on it so when you use it this game tell me what you think okay well i did just miss everything but i don't really know because i never really used the flatline like ever really but everybody that has ever brought it up to me this season has been like yo did they pop it it's one of those ways it's like you get into a good fight with someone near that post and if you just hit fire you you're going to kill them in one place exactly yeah that's how i use the fly line to use it as like an smg rather than an ar yeah exactly you if it's a crater oh my god you could probably like one tap some people at the moment yeah one time to kill oh this is gonna be crazy it's not gonna be it's gonna be purple armor i'm gonna come over to get my purple armor because you already got some you're right i need some reverse psychology on the game whoa my emote's sick yeah kraber i got it yeah yeah a bit of purple on it i teammates levin and he's up look nice psychomaniac i uh i don't know how i've managed to pull this off but i don't have oh there we go i got some chill cells now and a battery there i've been moving so much i know oh this way there we go this might need this rock please find the other way they're running the other way should i go into sickle mode um yeah do it oh [Applause] nice shots dude this teammate's portaling him out i just walked right into a neighbor the vault is so stupid this gun is stupid what a crazy gun this is oh my word my shots finally be better today good good to hear are you frying i assume people might be coming the same sort of way i think doesn't even want the second gold armor has come across he's like absolutely not so why would i want that bite uh so many grenades on me one's cracked it's nice really hurt bro uh okay see them from across the way they're really far 58 bridge i'll say that reloading nice job i'm watching over here this is going to start in like right now safe where you are this bang's friends just ran off i'm just watching the storm this guy where did everyone go they're in the storm look at the rope there's a rope i hope you're good i'm watching i'm walking back my vision is clear he died in the ring okay nice got you uh do we just want to jump down or something oh we can't jump down i think we can fry this team in the tunnel bro yeah yeah yeah i'm coming up with i mean we should on the back but we can we can definitely push this team red rampart i'll crack the guy behind i have no big heel okay okay okay the guy the guy jumped down as well here going for it i don't know if you can push that no not now let's back up and go around the storm's in one minute i got exploded bro i'm body blocking i'm good i'm good i'm good i got it yeah we got crazy that's i am not going that way this guy might come with this rope soon yeah let's back up his back up right now i'm almost done my bat on my make it okay i'm a little bit i'm just digging in oh it's a team exploded the mirage exploded them that's i got seven cells one bat i have eleven cells i'll have a nine after this last last theme it's the tunnel team it's all the same oh they're on me i'm gonna hold them off so you guys can get up here yeah are they just stand low i fried uh the rampart red rampart's one red first one remember this one in front of me you want to talk about anticlimactic i had that rampart one shot she jumped off the cliff for safety and she landed in the line and died yeah it feels good killing the team that was camping inside with the turret and shields there oh man i was so ready to fry them too because they didn't have it set up originally i was like oh this is perfect but then yeah the team in the back just made that impossible just cracking every time i pulled out the two times flatline for like further ranges like i just had to stop and heal the voltage just way better than the flatline in every way it is yeah i could have just run double vault i had so much energy as well nice dude that was a good one that was real good play a few more just for the road
