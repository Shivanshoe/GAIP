hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we actually found some legendary weapons and i don't know about you guys but i very rarely see these in season 10 and i don't know why you'd see them almost every game in previous seasons but this is the one and only legendary charge rifle i found in season 10. another thing worth known here and i definitely mention it a few times in the game you're about to watch but it's that the legendary sniper scope on apex which also comes on the legendary charge rifle doesn't have any aim cyst whatsoever and it's a little bit weird you can see me try and make it work this game i sort of get used to it i get some big boy shots but it's really tough to stay on target with a thumbstick with no aim assist at longer ranges where your targets are really small it's still fun though so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my god friends person on the side of the map wait i've got a gold charge rifle this is a leak i feel a bit bad i just scanned i've got a gold armor gold knocked down and a gold charge rifle guys the wire gold like this is the first gold no no i had those two gold guns before i am down to there was there were people um like east uh where they not holly drug place i will follow you looking for sniper ammo i've got this shot around the charge rifle with no amc so i'm gonna give this a go oh good luck with that zip line here 97 damn one of them in there oh you yeah you you meant when you said you were no one here no i literally had nothing that's two down okay i'm an idiot i think it's two teams i'm pretty sure these two we got jump from the top wait i know i'm taking so many bats if you

off two two below is the one in the crafter there is [Music] so weird trying to use this new images and i keep talking about it but it takes such a delicate touch yeah it's so hard to use that successfully i could just make some people when i do but i can't bother to keep switching i need sniper i'm not with you holding that i'm not bored though this was on me think about me one of them i'm really weak yeah i'm retraining i'm just retraining [Music] oh no that sucks i'm trying to pour teammate up hello where's my ulti the controller's broken i think he got finished but i don't know if he

have gold charge rifle gold flat line but i've got one shot in my charge rifle oh that's tragic uh there's a red bean right here okay i can sell phrases oh no you're good okay nice i thought the path like zoom zoom i didn't know he was there poor guy i was just like in the world i was i would have been there with him when he died the first time but i've got a gold charge rifle so i was just sat on a rooftop i think it wasn't his fault and if a trio lands over here they just have all the purples uh we're in joe's but yes i know you i know you're going for i'm down mate hello i'm down here yeah

that path is kicking off inside let me know if you need me i'm gonna go this way no please don't i love drowning and it's time i'm driving i'm a superior driver it's a iphone package right in the middle oh yeah you ready i'm literally gonna full send it the roof he's literally watching was that one or two team 18 twice okay it was two shot then forgot that was an lmg this never has to jump stop in position oh my god i've got flatline oh okay i'm down to drop i i have already dropped so low this guy's running i'm going to [Music] no is this two teams yeah there's a horizon behind that's why i had to push that with you [Music] there's no i had to pull out the plot line for that let go i'm committed to this oh the wrong gun out they're both on me i broke one i'm not there hop in the back nice uh your t-shirt nice all those clothes sliding it's gonna hurt yeah is it is it going away we need to pop it keep popping them um it is fine 65. i've got the next one here i'm gonna get going mate all right i'll be right there lobof footsteps sound like enemy footsteps from a distance yeah they take they have like a weird very distinctive sound they were here but well they were at this angle anyway but this is unnatural there's some gold in the middle i bet we'll find something a care pack over there the left is looted it might be over there i hear them yeah in front of me reloading okay that was just bad aim on my part wasn't the good i hate the players damage he's just cycling through all the rarest guns in the game keep throwing your old style maybe i'll find another one 190. oh that's crazy swearing oh yeah he's on me i think yeah i'm gonna try and push this guy to g7 what's gonna heal this guy's just in the storm down no i'm nice c20 is better than the vault confirmed we've done the testing it was very scientific nice i was not expecting them to be like their whole game plan because the guy the crater was sat back champions i don't know if that was a play it wasn't the play that might work in war zone that doesn't work over here though nah on these parts mate you gotta win your ones i played well played p20 kind of slapping almost dropped three i have to drop a 4k with a b20 it has to happen it just has to
