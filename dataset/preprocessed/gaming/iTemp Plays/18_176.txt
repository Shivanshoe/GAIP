hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we're playing some more apex legends of course and this game that i have for you today is some of the most damage that i've done in quite some time and i don't know why for the last sort of week perhaps i feel like i've been playing really well on apex which is strange because the week before that i felt like i was playing some of the worst apex i've ever played but the gun that i'm using today and it's a gun that i've used in a recent video as well is the hemlock it's become one of my favorite weapons it's had a massive resurgence it's this and the r3l1 with a 2-4 on it i don't know why but i love the r301 with a 2-4 right now it's great but hopefully you enjoyed today's video thank you so much for watching i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh i am here kind of oh my landings have been glitching out so bad recently let's not land up top okay another p20 mozam starts the amount of times i'll land on these these two guns haven't seen a car all day to be honest i'm so happy about that the here we go this is the dream i'm in love with the hemlock at the moment it's so good you already bamboozled go out and bamboozle them got a bad guy all of a sudden i'm really bad with the hemlock again i'm using everything with a hemlock right now so wherever he went i have nothing i'll probably have light rains i am missing everything another bogey yeah yeah i hear you i could have just better to be honest with you uh i should have switched my car into lightroom mode but i didn't realize i was that long heavy you've got to be careful you are soldered i mean i'll take it a bit undeserved i do not need that many heavy rains all right there's got to be more people here or there there have to be more people here sure is unloaded the bridge is unloaded i'm really confused thank you i don't even know which side of the map we came from where did we land we'll end that way i think we came from that way then yeah i could use that there's one right here right here at times i press change weapon the games i know you didn't press that it's astonishing it's all the time it's all the time i'm telling you wait what was in the care package i didn't even look it's like a ship and a purple bag but what's the other thing oh is it the gold armor i think it must be that's a decent find not bad for the squad all right give him the boosted load up and then we're in a pretty decent spot i don't know how we found i'll be where there are 23 people left i played a game earlier we died in streaming building and there were less than 10 people you know when it goes like question mark it was question mark three squads left question mark uh within the the zone hadn't even started coming in yet that's how crazy it was and now we've got 23 people left in this lobby maybe because i've lost so many games in a row the game has decided to give me a lobby that isn't just full of three stacks i don't know got one here hey i hear some shooting oh six people just died no please something going on for quite a while to be honest i think they may have all just died though nope still got me taking him out with a decoy making contact here he cracked me we have bumped into a few people here i don't know how anyone else appear gonna use the phoenix kid i said thanks with an exclamation mark oh nice team here uh i mean i've got some good attachments on my own but they run out i don't know what i'm saying i'm trying to say i've only got a good mag on it that's it where did the gimme go again i love how quick it comes back we need to go soon but we do have a valkyrie tool shouldn't it have old spouts you got bamboozled yet good job team should air pressure oh god let's check out over there come to the right come to the right here we go [Music] oh that's tremendous thank you thank you thank you [Music] level three i've got 108 oh these guys had loads we could just get ahead of these these let's go guys way this this way safe this is the way we should be challenging from the wraith has white armor on you nice team this has been a really fun game a really fun game and i'll tell you why it's because our fights have been spread out we had a huge scrap uh when we spawned in a capital i think you can't remember where we spawned it must have been capital right yeah it was it was capitalism it was like broken area and then we had a humongous scrap a harvester just had a nice fight here the fights have been spread out and that's why it's been so fun it's not just being everyone dies a cat kind of thing and what's edge is so good when you get fights around the map it's so good i'm a little concerned the uh the last team might be this ttv bangalore with a 20 bomb 4k and probably 800 000 kills let's see see him could be him could be dead don't know there's a clueless bogey out there is one of them left president i didn't know i was climbing up there what the heck was that target's right in front of me bam goes the boozled good scan he's self-reviving he's self-reviving that guy just i smell victory i needed to down that guy so bad that's so bad for me that is so bad for me to make another one i just played the safe nice job team stay live long enough there i am playing this like a complete noob just so you know i hate this two times at close range i hate it nice good job good job huge the bank oh sorry the bloodhound played that so perfectly he like he stayed alive so long i mean he didn't get downed he had two money at one point i need to get my 4ks mirage that felt like a lobby that the game gives you when you've been losing for like an hour and a half straight which is pretty much what has happened to me i don't care about getting the 4k i i don't feel like i deserved it especially with how i played the end i should have just put the hemlock in burst fire again still i'm happy with that game really fun gg is all around
