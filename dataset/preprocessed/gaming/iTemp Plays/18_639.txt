hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course so the new split started today we are halfway through season six and a new unlimited time mode dropped today as well called live die live we have seen it before but it has been a while and if you don't remember what happens uh basically you can respawn back into the game if you have a teammate that's alive when the ring closes and that's at every stage of the ring closure as well it's a little underwhelming at the start of the game because it takes six minutes to first see this but towards the end of the game you do see it more and more often and people are just flying back left right and center i do like this mode a lot and it mixes up the game it also makes for some great revenge opportunities to go and kill the guy that thirsted you a few minutes beforehand also i posted my second warzone video on my other channel earlier today that's two days in a row so if you are interested there is a link in the description for that it was all about the new season 6 update on call of duty with the new assault rifle all that good stuff there's a link in the description anyway so yeah thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'll give it a go yeah i've been wanting to try to one of those games too i just haven't i don't know i just haven't gotten to it requires such a big amount of people some of them too yeah but then eight boys among us like eight people yeah i think it's like it's i think it's like six to eight ten or something or eight to ten i don't know something like that i mean the discord call is just i'm just gonna work i just think i would just stay quiet and then people would think i was the guy you know well i think um i think i'm not 100 sure but i think in that uh that project winner there might be proximity chat too so like if you're not close to someone you can't hear them oh okay so like if you're far away from them you can't hear them and then once you get closer you know how it kind of fades in a little bit that'd be useful yeah that'd be nice i think that's how that game is i don't know if that's how manos is there i think people use discord chats and then they just mute when they die or like yeah extended heavy mag here what am i doing i'm just on autopilot i'm gonna i'm gonna graph up top and see what i can do okay uh one second floor this dude just two tapped me i actually just got too tough we're here nice teammate oh yeah i really wanted to die just so i could see the oh the damage he's destroyed i mean i didn't have a white armor but still i left blue um i think the champion fell i mean this teammate is running circle nice dude nice clutch both of you guys i love the nade it was beautiful i cracked him and then i went down and also where he went i followed him and there's people here there someone here all right i'm about to go picking up oh we were standing next to each other you just leave no he just you know when they stand still because they know they're gonna get first you could just sense the defeat yeah i thought should i leave big scrap over here big actually it's not it could be bigger honestly it could be bigger i'm getting so weirded out now am i getting baited maybe is this up top oh no i don't want to use shields it takes so long to get baited i think so but they are firing each other so i don't know why he's looking at me no they're definitely fighting out i'm going over here i'll go on the roof go above you all right you just hop down here top down it's nearly cracked that guy oh he's won on the train just put 100 rounds into the teammate yeah let's see again let's do this let me down they're on the train track i'm screwing my group mate our teammates won i think our teammate's gonna die i think we both are giving my shields a recharge i'm just gonna void back four minutes on the respawn though oh i'm coming to you yeah fine now i'm trying friend up in a bat i think there are two teams here because they they just fit versus someone it wasn't that teammate are you really pushing that you're a psychopath this guy's a psycho i respected but at the same time that's their dead person um i'm going to get you ah come here yes dude i'm gonna scream i'm gonna scream uh i think it was jenks i was playing through the day and i traced this wait i have five backs if you knew me i was chasing this guy down for ages a massive circle jenks was just all right you guys deal with that i'll lose because he needed loot and the guy circles all the way back to janks and he hits him once and gets the kill and i was just so devastated who's i have never i and it was awkward the devil i could not every now try to like spin free fire and it takes like 10 seconds to shoot um all this oh that was here you scared me i have so many shields i need energy but i'm sure some of these guys have some this guy's got more bats our teammate i feel bad oh wait i have the streamer mode still on so i can't see anybody's name don't worry which one is our teammate this isn't him either we're good we're good i think i i think i looted him feels bad we'll go kill a bunch of people and then he could just take their loot yeah jenny i'm sorry i think i've already asked do you need your bats i have six uh i have zero would love some thank you it's all good where's the fire drifting on the left yeah i think it was here beneath this right beneath us hey whisper split one broken a pathfinder i just got bopped by a prowler i'm sorry how do you use the flat line i just had so much sideways recoil i just couldn't hit this guy how do you use it it's crazy it's it's just it's a struggle sometimes i can't believe that um he's i'm literally 1v1 in his teammate and he thirsts no one knows where the girl goes who can say i swear if you like i need to see a video of you just spoken word a whole song well and just do it to somebody it just doesn't know don't do it to me though because i would please i'll fall for it 100. i'm dropping this flat line wait where's my bag did he take my bag uh people over here on me i need energy ammo i see him during the second final turbo i'm i'm the worst i'm the worst gamer of all time i don't know if that's true where did he go all right always people i'm definitely he's the first gamer ever you just top down with white armor like the most ambitious of all time by this guy he left he's just he can't believe that play didn't work out is that though oh there are two people up top yeah yeah he's facing back he's going back in the port there are two people top okay he's not going through the portal they need to push down eventually but yeah one drop down actually he didn't let me help him if i have my off i'm not into the squad i am i'm not there over there this dude has the craziest glitch ever oh they're teammates i thought they were fighting each other there's a pathfinder down low i might be dead he's down here on the left oh there's two little on me i don't know where this guy came from i think he sell fresh are you kidding me bangalore i don't know if they can say probably not this won't hurt hold on oh let's go dude the phoenix v no i don't i was lying i got one i go and i'm chilling thank you though my kill self raised she had oh she must win in the vault she had gold armor gold bag seconds rings and a gold self device is she really yeah it's another gold bag oh you've got one yeah i go and i'm chilling there's two more bats here i mean i'm good what i'm doing i should probably try and get throw balls yeah i don't have any i'm just stacking up on heels i don't know what's going to happen i don't know i don't find it i can't see any though uh do you need any i got a ton of heels no i've got loads of heels i just don't see any like okay one ark couple right there thank you oh on me i went last name oh he's high ground no he has a weird little high ground did he just want something oh okay yes all right we're trying to finish this kill maybe the triple takes so outrageously good i can't even hear such a crazy angle i have a knight i just love native him no way that nade doesn't hear please pretty go get him don't mess with me oh my god my aim is like honestly so sketchy so sketch dude it's the struggle of switching constantly i mean warzone pc apex pc pairs for apex i mean there's like the different the different scenes so bad it's so bad oh nice how do we always have the same kills i don't and like i've got like i don't get it i mean i have been using the prowler to be fair so little prowler's a little broken no i mean like you've always got way more damage you should have way more kills
