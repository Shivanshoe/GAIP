hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have two games for you today the first of which is a drawers game and the second is in trios of the random teammate sometimes it is fun to run trios with a random teammate because every now and then you get a diamond in the roof and our octane was an absolute hero he was always near us he helped save so far when he crashed the teamwork was impeccable i wish it was always like this and i see a lot of disrespect on octane mains they've got a bad rep and i'd like to contest that because this guy i don't know if he wasn't octane main but he was playing octane was a hero and you'll see what i mean so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends so don't come to me i have a hammer people in the middle here somewhere right on me i'm just vibing crack okay is broken he fired like two people there so doing pretty good what do you would you usually not like oh give me that uh yes i thought you'd be proud of me yeah i am i am proud of you you're firing on the way right here it is the wave right now classic it's uh it's pretty strong classic unless unless you're they're right up in your face and it's kind of hard to track but like just hit firing from like five ten feet that close range fight it's it's so strong on classic pretty good just kind of you have delicate soft delicate soft touch you know yeah yeah you got to be super delicious like that too otherwise it doesn't work yes that's why i talk like this all the time i have no shields i have two bats and no cells i have two bats eight cells so you go all right i just need a couple cells thank you oh wow are they taking that that way yep [Music] so it's so difficult on controlling just ease i'm just having a little watch you had front row seats over three times in my hands uh i have full bats you need one i have two i'm chilling i have so many heavy rains way too many for hemlock um there's care packages landing out of states i've decided when you play octane i'm playing pathfinder because at least then i can sort of keep up i was tempted to play lifeline but i knew that was going to be a mistake i'd still be in a way 300 hemlock rounds that's a hemlock he's running maybe horizon wow like that call out could have gotten me killed rudy could have you didn't expect the emp one's got purple they're in this building back uh low shield shield like 40 shields i did 96 damage in flesh and then his back went off like he wasn't 97 here like the last few bullets hit his shield it was so close i hate when that happens any energy for the boys someone's uh spectating me he must be just absolutely flabbergasted by these moves he'll wall jump feel bull jump no i'm always scared and they spectate me because on all messengers no do you have to do afterwards you just have to stand still then look back at the ball like it was the worst fault that's what i do i just unload a clip into the wall yeah yeah can you hear that scrap sounds like uh what they called um what if so i don't know i mean it's a good effort but it's not that i think they call it the red no that's what that big blue ball is there's a john here it's like a phase runner i think what are these guys all right i'm gonna dive right in give me with the master give me with a mess oh my god she's so neat i'm so far away i have a sentinel nice let's find someone down low okay i'm just not very good i'm on the roof i haven't seen anyone yet i saw someone go pass on a rope and that was it i'm coming the rope i think his first floor i hear someone come up the rope i'm watching i'm watching i'll come back there i'll revise he's flush oh no there's more i absolutely do not i'm sorry once we come there it's really weak too exceptionally weak one's dead inside cracked i've never tried so hard in my entire life no bomb mastiff my god thank you pretty sure i missed everything but i was potentially annoying them you know any sights any sights any signs yes the hollow all that matters recharging my shield oh my god we got seven kills we gotta secure it you have set you have seven kills pretty close i have seven kills you have seven kills i have seven kills well so like like six but then you got another one kinda yeah like if you had six you just add one and then i have i have that's crazy that's a lot of kills kind of crazy right uh who are you playing all right uh okay never mind i have a gold helmet but uh how do you yeah i mean unless you're trying to smoke every night when i eventually get destroyed don't worry i hear it i don't know about you but he shot his way enemies well then should i then i should be carrying her in no because you can when you get my banner you can pick it up that's true and it doesn't affect your inventory management for when you want to carry like 23 syringes you know oh that's a good point i agree i had zero shotgun shells that weren't in my gun and i had 11 spare light ammo and i was looting i didn't pick any of them and everyone was just absolutely furious and rightly so yeah you're it's hilarious how mad your community goes no but i mean that one there's the right view yeah that one's i i mean yeah you deserve it that's close they're close i don't know i think 35. all right i'm popping my last shield so we got a no here take those thank you thank you not as many as i wanted you to have but i'm burning the door pass down nice oh my god he's getting a lifelong race oh you're so much better let's go this is the last one nice where you at where you at mastiff is that's him sam wait where are you at hold on well i have a gray bolt but that's not that's not okay it's not ideal oh there's a great ball in here huh yeah i i just dropped one so yeah i'm off i'm not going i'm not i'm not gonna throw uh i have a um hold on i have a bat you need it i need to recharge my shoes um i have one okay i have um as well you know that's where you know oh you're gonna give me your only bat i was gonna yeah i think you got seven kills you had one more than six shields that's correct that is the correct statement once okay you're off the scene but this place is just covered in bullet holes oh my god absolutely about 99 of them are mine and me missing all my massive shots because i just couldn't time it yeah a car somebody has this yeah whenever somebody has like a good strafe and you have a mastiff with just not a good ball it's so hard to time i fully agree do you have any syringes by the way i know you're the same i have four and there's another one right here oh i was scared i've run away from the lifeline when you've got two other teammates saying he's just the worst because you know what's about to happen oh yeah he's sticking right with us yeah right with us i'd love to see it oh that sounds like um that sounds like uh like here maybe sorry i can't speak i'm just too excited about this horrendous try and get up this rope right there where is he he's like he was down here somewhere maybe behind this rock broken oh my god punch him the other way i am actually the best my strategies are unmatched have you ever seen anything like it before i really haven't that was impressive level three his teammates just left him come on come on i mean can you blame him reloading i swear absolutely fine they're on this um oh god wait what are you doing all the way over there if there was another team foreign they were like safe and that's how you get the job done is he in his butthole he was wow i just crashed i just crashed oh quick get back you got sass manager oh yeah i'm i'm trying i don't think you'll be able to protect me i think so i think so they're not coming they're scrapping someone else i'm already i'm opening up apex again i'm at the loading screen we're safe mate me and octane are here oh you guys are the best i'm i'm i haven't clicked the continue thing yet okay i clicked continue now we're loading i just opened up again just in case yeah 100 you should you don't crash anywhere near me though what is that oh god please i'm almost there yes one's outside we're okay we're fine almost there we're fine octane sunny so our octane is actually the best teammate yeah nice they're north they're north they're on this hill oh he really is they're just they're just looking at us now they've seen us through the window 10 seconds the ring's closed of course they can't contact he's retreated we might want to get out of here before they can get up top yeah come with you no leave him alone i'm down below with him near the squad of the squad into the squad need to oh my god i'm just taking my time yes need to recharge your shields there's bloodhounds one good job man nice that would just gatekeeping oh let's go dude oh my god if it wasn't for you guys protecting me oh my god that's what this arcane too dude he's the best yeah he's sticking right with us he's always there like our best team honestly we've ever had oh they re they raised the team oh yeah they drop below then one enemy down there's of course behind this rock contact with hostile i mean red is dropping in the middle but is it even worth it um is this where they are i mean right get up yeah i think one's on the other side of this rock right in front of me yeah they are they are did they jump down yeah they're jumping down round four oh my god i've never seen anyone jump that far uh let's push the team there's a team like over here i want to find this other team hey is this both teams well the octane went to mid i cracked like a pathway there recharging as long as we protect our sight i don't think they can get back up yeah i'm just really confused as to where these teams are they're they are they going for red i think that might be i think that's why they went over there yeah oh no i should we should probably go there i mean we can push that one it's gonna bat dude crack the he's popping his shield he's gonna get it all back i'll come with you yeah that's fine he's not gonna know him right here what am i aiming at who am i aiming at very nice oh we had a gold one so he could see me through the smell he was doing that oh they're here oh my god octane this is this it maybe finish up pop the finisher get them out of here oh my god [Music] it's not letting me start oh show me apex champion solid uni there solid what a squad oh my god like apex oh my god let's go dude if it was like that could have been the worst experience but you guys saved it nice thank you oh my god you'd love to see it
