game was non-stop action i'm sure you guys will love it be sure to subscribe to the channel if you are new here to not miss any future videos thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends um if you find a neutral air drop let me loot it please i'm trying to stack those numbers up a what a neutral air drop a neutral air drop yeah care package what does that even mean care package oh okay neutral air drop like a like a lifeline one yeah uh okay i've never even been on the side of the map oh okay don't even don't even act surprised i've been i've been here a lot right there i've been here i'm the only one i'm the only one that's having a real experience here in this entire life everyone's played already it's just your first minute they're all here points like am i going to like the worst place am i going i like them i don't know of this map um that would be the best place so no i don't think so oh this place doesn't even have a name oh no i scuffed it ah i'm lying right these double doors i thought i was picking like the like the skull town oh no somebody landed here i don't have a weapon okay i have a charge driver hooch james come down and save you or what somebody's calling me it's the ai there's the did i not pick up an awesome accelerant i'm trying to it's broken i suck same way [Music] foreign this guy got jeeps oh gucci amigo wait what's my passive oh i actually don't know oh you can check death boxes to see where they are that's why i should be a play tester i would have known i did not i told you what it was nope right guys i didn't take the armor from that close one i missed every shot with the wienerman and then i hit every shot with the mozambique oh that's the yeah that's the way it goes wait so if i use my old um does it get used like the second i press my alt or does it give me like a second to aim it no you have to yeah you have to aim it you can press it and see how far you can go and stuff and and if you press it you get your sword can you can you like knife somebody with it no i don't think so how are they gonna send an airline for ash maybe two swords oh imagine that just runs around dual wield that'd be pretty cool all right what are the rotations you're you're already inexperienced uh well we came from we came from northwest and we were running southeast so i think we're going to the opposite way what is this what's what's what what are these there that is the uh plant okay the plant okay i've got a car smg would you like it no it's are you oh we should have had some more games we should have what had some more games that valkyrie flew on flew onto me i would delude this by the way we can go in the ropes yeah i was i'm still in like the cycle mode wait how do i get up there uh you just sort of go up there a little bit someone's gonna revive i think i think this is where people kick off okay yeah we gotta find the we gotta find the fragment i think it's that place yeah i'll be honest i think it is isn't the crafter extended heavy okay that um valkyrie that flew onto me the first time she's in the air can't shoot and from a full re45 clip with a level one meg i landed one bullet so that's where i promised you whatever you did was nowhere near as bad as i don't even know if i'm gonna upload this game at this point i'll just sort of blow the screen blah wow what happened oh so all those red dots are the uh like little spider nests i think some of them are prowlers i don't know did you say you think yes i don't know the ones with the spider picture is the spiders let's play dust i've got to play for one hour nice playtester guys you guys got here ea i play for one hour really impressed sorry didn't ask them what the dots meant that's the first question i would have asked yep hey that's why i'm not a play tester i asked many questions i think you asked the right questions and they're scared of it yeah yeah i think that's what it is they're terrified of the answers where are you going mate this is the way to go over this way nope look at this push in the spider nest i hear i'm kind of sad they put so many of these like these strawberries everywhere and you can't interact with them they should be like little healing things yeah you should be able to eat them like on fortnight uh-huh and then you eat like a build too yeah you should be able to build like walls and like if i wanted to do it quick i'd do it in like i'd sort of invent this technique right build and then like rotate 90 degrees yeah right here hold that you could call that a cranking 90s oh you know what mate it's a good idea behind me this team ah she's won oh god okay the guy is dead guy huge purple on me this team right behind us i'm taking this i'm taking the port i forgot that she could take that wait did you kill the top no about back here by me oh i don't know what dude i got like a hit marker maybe he left or something i don't know i think you stunned him then he just walked out of it and i saw a death box there and you said a voice on it made me think there was no one left so i got confused i'd like to apologize somebody had a car yes one of them oh they're open up top are they up top i can hear doors are they i broke one they yeah they pulled up top how would a me a human get up here 155 that's huge i might tell that port then that's another team i think or maybe they have a few i don't know no not the same get back if you can trying to help from here i can't really get thirty do you got shot in the back by someone mounting this door 134 on one i they're just they're just happy that's so hard i have a i have a redzone i can go inside and yeah go inside i'll try and cover him a lot too i'm coming inside right here there's a there's a bottom oh yeah you have to aim it you'll see can i just put it in the air will it put me in there no no i don't think so all right we gotta kill this team up top i was just wasn't really sure how that works yeah you know there's a rope behind them so if you just yeah i'm thirsty me okay you can't that is the most op roof i don't think you can actually climb on there oh that's uh that's really broken at least you know how the ashok works then i mean it makes it obvious that you didn't watch my videos but you know that's fair enough you know i watch your videos it's okay um i told you that i don't like watching new content yeah i told you this yeah no you said i don't like watching your content that's what you said to me well yeah true but also not true trying to figure out if there's any difference between the two car modes uh what do you mean like the heavy and yeah because i've got i've got a i've got it decked out heavy and decked out light as well so i don't see him oh wait no it's not neutral airdrop she's flying more to these oh oh both team both teams both teams apricot oh so all these are the nests yeah the spot is gonna shoot us now did you see i didn't know i didn't know good luck tell me you didn't shoot the spider nest nope are they all behind what the heck is this guy up to what are you doing you absolutely maniac man but yeah he just altered behind me he's on this rash killed him are you nearly cracked oh close did you just give her a shield so i did i was like heal up quick yes 100 win record on this map let's go now i know what the spider nests look like yes you do and what the giant strawberries look like and where they are on the map uh-huh they are everywhere they do be everywhere oh i was about to do uh see those farming no it's a good uh it's a good email that one
