hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing one of my favorite legends in season 11 valkyrie for obvious reasons there's just one balloon tower on storm point and valkyrie has an inbuilt balloon tower for incredibly fast rotations and a quick way to find your next gun fight so far he's a little bit of a hater in the second game but i feel like we got big value out of my ultimate so just just ignore him don't listen to him so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends go into the wall duck inside a little bit yet one of my favorite things to do on this map is to land on the opposite side these were the grabs candies because people just don't oh i never actually thought about that it's really good dude that's smart wings up i feel like i'd mess that up no it's really easy oh they hear me did they do that oh god yeah they did i got one nice job that's kind of crazy wow i haven't tried the pk this season even though i got buffed it's a video i need to do that was my video today do you want it no no you're good i'm doing a bulk thing at the moment yeah i like it the pika is actually really good because i never liked damage before it feels like the the original do you know when people were saying that oh where did that come from oh yeah he's rude awake got the right one too dude ash is so brutal in what way her voice lines all the gameplay the voice side that squad was so pitiful it wasn't even fun killing them or something oh yeah like it's so incredibly disrespectful and i love it like i'd get banned if i said that they'd ban me i mean probably you deserve it oh yeah i'm going straight down by the way ah ankles disintegrated no ankles left they're in the middle i'm using the car for some reason reloading was like 60 health under fire oh they're way in the middle 140 gold on one of them the guys cracked again please don't and grab that gold armor i missed every shot i took it on the rails guys cracked here ashley's really weak i don't know where she went oh he's going for the punch are you good good i was um spinning around that stupid post it's been i've walked around the purse like three times oh my god mate this is what this place is by the way constant i'm so down with it the guy closest is a crazy teammate we're having a real back and forth here and i love it oh yeah i'm just qualified someone else is 100 gonna turn up i hope so i'm banking on it when it happened in my video i said it was like uh it's like playing cod zombies right yeah no for sure they just kept coming but they'd always be respectful and they went third party they'd just turn up afterwards so get ready for it so it's not like all zombies no but like in the way that there's waves you know right but yeah we're respectful about it yeah the zombies are respectful too right here 120 something but that's because i did a glitch and i went to the doctors yeah he's stuck bless him oh he's getting chased here white care for that first team where the valkyrie was yeah where oh he's here he's here he's here i stun him he's one that was a good awkwardness couldn't push yeah he did nice i've got the other guy pretty weak so he might have chilled but he won't have that much health i don't think he's dead [Laughter] i went to wall jump off this wall like i slid in to go wall jump and i didn't take into account the things on the wall so i like i did like a weird little climbing i hate that with the walls like text i said you mean you're bumping into the whatever these things are yeah the prop playing tanks so i just like i did a hang ten on them was it was it according to plan but that's my deal yeah it made it work valkyrie is so good when you land up top like that look at this have you popped the valkyrie all from the very very top no not not yet that's about the size as i've done it we got to do it next game you got to see what it's like it's ridiculous they're hiding behind there back to 100 right beneath you oh he was he was behind now in front that guy he's back here right no he's this way mate unless it's a different team i thought you got shot from here no he shot me from this way recharging for 39 but he's just running gold helmet oh my man you have four frags oh there you go should have used that's so respectable was it a fuse i didn't even realize i have no idea who it was actually i don't even remember he hit a lot of nades though he's currently screaming at his teammate to get his banner oh i wish i had my i mean we got a bunch of people here it's gonna be great i have my ultimate i'm nice okay some free high ground oh my god the price of shop hello oh god oh he's nearly cracked he's nearly cracked he ran to the right i just saved your life thank you mate in the lobby loads apparently oh he's kind of crazy with it yet whoa what he caught me while i was gonna climb three i got radar lock and then he tried to get back is that charged up recharging can you kill me from this parallel ah no this guy is god's gift to gaming is this shroud son who is this he's got that bad boy charged up may that hurt bro this guy is like that was with an rd45 i'm gonna touch your product he's pushing it really hard he's under your building he's patted on your roof there's another new team here now hoping they don't see me bro this guy wow wow a lot of people firing i don't see anything and everything inside is unloaded i just don't know how to navigate through this place yet fox 3 sending it home like ten headshots i don't think he missed reloading bad someone said i don't even think i've had one average game the guy's been weird behind uh where we just came from i'll just basically kill myself down we can go inside and take the rope maybe no i don't know how to get over there quick i think i think we just i think we just run yeah i think so there's that thing again lightning rod i think it's supposed to no no no i think it does nothing no i think it takes the lightning it has no purpose it has a purpose electric it's only purpose is to be loud yeah just a good job of it too oh reloading wings reloading nice hopefully we can just go downhill and then just see someone with my passive i actually really like valk i don't know why you're such a hater i've literally said it like 50 times no just don't like the way she makes your movement you don't have movement it doesn't bother me i don't even bother moving look at this when you're going downhill though look at the distance if you're traveling with a small child this is a blood sport it's crazy you still like really can't see anything though everything's blocked off by these yeah kind of rocks and how close you have to be for my passive spot people because i don't think it goes infinite i'm gonna go to the right do you see any death is death that's these death boxes on the radar anything um hey people i think you're closer to him like north it's not on me oh you're not you're not i think they're in here fighting proud as me it's like huh sorry i got confused so confused i got a crater by the way staring away nice wings out please don't find me prowlers chasing me they kind of do sound like people sometimes yeah they do it definitely maybe maybe i should wait to hear shots and then use these to get over there i don't even know because the only reason valkyrie is good on any other map in my opinion is because you could like think uh jump towers if there wasn't jump towers and you can only use her all i feel like she just she wouldn't be on its very good it's crazy oh i saw something shut up he was over there by you as it goes to your left i think it was uh west but i don't know hmm we have to go that way anyway don't we so fire time back wait i actually did a kind of a cool play i like ported from this room into the next room i like that what through the windows or what yeah that's clean see valkyrie is good guys two more kills it helps it it definitely helps 100 i do think i should wait to hear gunshots first though because then it gives you an aim lightning fraud i'm done oh did they take the gravity leaves yeah repairing damages i know my old either scary i'll tell you what though i've shot three crater bullets this game two headshots and a body shot it's not bad this guy had a load out he had a gold mastiff and a spitfire brother there's only one squad left where was he looting it's uh i mean sure yeah we ain't got nothing else to do i feel like they would have ran over here if they were on buildings went on this side of the map so it has to be east it has to be so i think they might have come oh there we go on the radar yeah all right took the thing already across the map oh yeah actually oh my god yep i'm across i'm out i'm coming i am coming back no oh god just tap straight tap strafe i have my own i can't i can't i'm already here this is a disaster reloading nice literally every crib shot you
