here was a guy's it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course so the season 5 gameplay trailer drops here earlier on and we have so much info to go over here and winterberg done I'm going to have an intense a ranked gameplay for you afterwards as well so Kings Canyon not just school time is going to be massively different huge changes are coming to the map it actually looks unreal let's start with the obvious one here school town it's completely gone demolished in its wake stands a huge crane structure which is holding up what looks to be the school that gives school Tony's name and they've started excavating the site already you can see they jumped out the balloon further in the distance but interestingly you can access this tower from a number of different ropes it isn't just the one that's directly beneath eventually enough in the gameplay that I've got for you today I actually dropped at school town and I was talking about how I doubt it's going to be massively different and I thought it was going to be somewhat like they did weed balls edge where they just made it a little bit different capital but it looks like school towns gone it's gone forever potentially now another massive map change is actually in the opposite corner of the map in the northeastern quadrant towards relay there are more cranes that are so many buildings to loot of and fights at and interestingly enough this looks like it could be the next score tank we need a replacement and this could be it now this next area looks like it's not too far away from Wraith labs you can see the portal leading up to the sky not too far away potentially they are actually harnessing gate forwards resources but again there are plenty of buildings to loot up in and fight acts on day one here actually show this area in action and the middle pylon actually charges up gibraltars ultimate from nine percent all the way to max you can land here you can win this area and you can charge up your ultimate before you leave and you get your ultimate for free before getting into the next gunfights so next up we actually have the new legend low but of course now I'm not sure if this is actually an animation of her heirloom here because it looks like it's actually just her placing her ultimate dame so as you place the day when she says that the shops open for business and a pulse of light explodes from the cane itself and this explosion of light lets people know that it's been placed shops open for business could be a selection of link that you could choose from like a death box it could actually be the loot in the area from the pulse of light where you place it down where you think there's a load of loose in that area and it collects all of a few to choose from a regular ability is the teleport with a bracelet of course they fly off the cliff trying to escape that ambushed when they were trying to use the mobis ultimate energy teleports onto dry land with her bracelets now this is the area that we will talk about a little bit more in a minute with the new game mode but the teleport itself looks unbelievable imagine those pesky Watsons and of course sticks inside buildings you can't get through the door very easily at all but know that actually going to have to keep an eye on the windows as well imagine is paired with a revenant ultimate you just fly into the building causing as much damage as you can with lobha and then the whole team can brush through the doors and I know that requires Lobo to be paired up on the same team as the guy who killed my parents but still it'll be an elite strategy it might be worth it now next up we have what I assume to be the new game-mode and there are a number of reasons I think it is actually new game-mode it could be in the regular game like the bloodhound trials but it appears as though it's more of a sophisticated PvE even more so than the blue tone trials so the team is run along and a new quest becomes available it's called the broken ghost and they start the quest they discover clues by looting up they find themselves a treasure pack and then they need to find the hidden artifact somewhere on the map they need to protect it they need to survive the hunt and then they can escape now the timer at the top here says that it's nearly four and a half minutes and also it turns into nighttime Kings Canyon and his time - now both of these things make me think that it's actually more of a sophisticated separate game mode and it won't work in a regular game because the storm would come in and you would die regardless and once they survive the onslaught a ship comes in an evac ship comes in to pick the team up to escape and they survive and all it says after that is uncover the mystery this will be what I assume to be an ongoing story throughout the season where we find more and more clues and hints as it goes on so there we have it the season 5 gameplay trailer I actually thought it was incredible the team has done such a good job especially given the current global circumstances and I'm sure many of them if not all of them are working from home at the moment it looks incredible I can't wait to play on Tuesday so thank you for watching leave me your comments and thoughts in the comment section down below and I'll see you all with some ranked gameplay here in five and a half seconds my friends skort enemies my friends we are back at it again I'm not entirely sure for how long we're going to have to say skort entities but today I'm so looking at the trailer back what is this good loop of wingman and the blue shield I never get good Lou that's cool tank but yeah I don't think it's gonna be destroyed I think partially destroyed it's gonna be a similar situation as to what happened with capsule systems you can still fight back still catalyst it exists I can reimagine Veronica like a remix of scraps or CT pretty sure that is what's gonna happen with us we score 10 here so it's cool 10 G's for rape security still wanting to see some financial we'll see I guess I not have a me just because I'm firing through a window nice we got us I say we do you fair though 45 damage of the wind event is kind of a lot was it it was a team I don't even have an assist I must have been because I his arm shield thing that is ridiculous picture probably so ridiculous you don't get an assist if you shoot their IDs you'll only need shop another I don't know if I find any my friend kini amigo maybe I'm o2 stats for a wingman re scrapping the distance there you go ammo here making contact scrapping over this way my friends they don't sound crazy at the moment is for some reason no one landed at school team apart from one team market parrot the fight is done lies dead what shame all right well the fights he's definitely not dead in the pieces I've just gone the long way round they're fighting scrap K if I should have known it I'd oversight of my wingman my biggest issue here I'll kind of leave up coz I don't happen oh but he lies here this is good we can just press them massive up these guys'll have shields and that absolutely messed up at the moment rice got revised back once more I'm serving you in teammates I've done so much a I think that had time to heal annoying link but it should be like an affair to be activity should not have been that different now we have these Vantage from the very start to fight there we just didn't apply the pressure quick enough they did go back to so if they got a revive off that would have been her end maybe they didn't even get a revival I'm not sure finally hbox with your boys wingmen I can actually see it on fire I know it's hit the same thing as me all right nice and I got myself an Evo she'll be 230 damage and I get myself a radiator shield that's a lifeline package which means there's a team probably on the big hill but to be honest that's if you want to scrap in this game on Kings Canyon there are a few place you want to go to scrap page bunker and this hill this hill always has someone seen on it you already have it this is gonna be fine I think and I get a bit of pug damage please I've seen a little bit of women damage I look great in my shields because it'd be real nice to have red shield before I push up there one scrap on fire here against the pie though it's now time video when they came third parties oh my why'd you be messed up yes level one Evo shows we should just get over there I don't think I've ever been that bamboozled in my life but to be fair in my defense I still thought I can hear his footsteps Frank let's go through I think my name's Pat one of them those who's gonna do the way that's oh they're scrapping Oh coming teammate it's some poor call going on never never bamboozled me again your teammates it's the party's really doing I don't have but but he might see what the ones that got third party just because they're the same how the building better can they revive him the Gibraltar which sucks cuz he's got gold shield and he's just gonna heal the real fast but near my teammate and I've got a gold bag just heal teammate time to make too much noise just tail friends where's the third party gone we folks on the team in the building and that other team isn't pushing upon them stupid I'm not sure this is even worth it we can get our teammate back before the before the storm comes in yeah we should be fine the storm stopped moving this is Luna these helis always pop enough I might call it pop off he'll are you guys are know what I mean especially in ranked because people tend to play a little bit more conservative I need to be fed me included because I usually I'll be brushing in there we've seen how we did have an opening if we didn't get third party though I think we're okay I've seen five my teammates tie to that third part in that in the third pie runoff so here I hear him on top as well I think it's just this one team let's hope yeah okay he's gonna have it food one's got a hammock one's got a skate that's not what if it isn't worth it okay one of my teammates doesn't even have any shields it's not just in respawn I've got to I need I need at least a few myself I think we can take this how do I have four kills I feel like I've got about ten off thousand damage uncle their friend to you let's write back it's a terrible idea my step I these guys and said hopefully I should be a proper third-party stone rather than this somehow turning up late and being the third party sorry I've been the one that got third party so I don't know how it happens another skater police where he should be a tremendous amount of fun to fight but here we go any more than five aside for kills here so care package landed yeah I believe so because it's not on the radar hopefully this is like a musket or something that should be decent replacements oh devotion I'm like um bit too far here there's a team you can call to me that'd be tremendous I'm fatty son there's another team up there I'm coming come on we have to get you I'm afraid that's unfortunate so the respawn beacon hither or the inside Oh are we sit up there are we stop move still on the Popoff Hill I'm low be fantastic time the g7 and the havoc you can't blame for using the best guns I mean I've got an honor to not in his devotion here just try and get over this way Bancroft know all of your old stuff back we've had nothing for the last five minutes so try finish the killed maybe I don't know if you can actually stay alive that guy's gonna get a revive like that's happened four times already this game but I've done or what I can do there way there's two teams next to each other once again and they're not really fighting let's just chill here for a second let them fight they found each other lady mo here okay thank you we shouldn't get involved I can't stay here too long they're fine at least that fights nature the name [Music] that's gonna get himself another revive of course for the 12th time this game are they not fighting a team and they just I think they were just first in asserts until the ring closes luckily it's not far I want to know every team these on team of top two teams download it sounds like three people that's imagine if it was two two is achievable three when at this close is so difficult teams that are not fighting whatsoever you're gonna have to assume I mean I'm pretty close to the safe zone so I don't have to move that much as long as these guys don't see ones they don't see me I don't think they would look down here [Music] count it imma gonna I mean how much damage did I do that game 32 points in response to revives I mean it's just a full team mates so annoying because I downed that I'd empty sky already if it's just two of them I can stand and fight I can't stand it fine get hit by three people think I'll finish we finish fourth anyway so annoying it's so known when they don't fight but they like you've have to fight eventually the two teams download just weren't interested in having a scrap whatsoever I feel like we were in a scrap for the past 15 minutes good game that an extreme amount of fun there all right the journey to Diamond continues my friend
