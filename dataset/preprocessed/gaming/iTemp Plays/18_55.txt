hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing ash now ashley is one of my favorite legends to play on storm point because you can see where the gunfights are taking place and plan your next move which is so important to do on storm point if you intend on finding more than three people in the same game also this past weekend there was an lgs tournament i'm sure many of you are aware and ash got so much play time i really think she's an underrated legend i love her ultimate it is so good i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends reloading the guy up here we have 45 seconds to cross a great distance oh we routed that squad hardly a challenge that's how you do it wherever this horizon is she just ran that's so good i got my kills you know that's all that matters oh yeah she has come back maybe she got banned already maybe their teammate left i don't know all right let's see i don't know people in checkpoints they might be dead i don't know might as well go that way so many valves and so many horizons there repositioning box busted why don't we talk about this more i don't know she's busted but she's annoying now valkyrie's busted you can say ah she's not that's not a very good title though you have to say she's busted they don't cascade as well did you just run all the way over here just to cut in and not check i mean if they're still like there's no way they're sitting there though right and people don't cascade and they have to come this way i never trust your calls um you're going that way or about to run back if there's one thing there they'll have to come this way yeah they're going to third parties on the back yeah let me turn around and blast them there you go i'm not gonna shoot because they're gonna sit on the top of the rope that's cringe do i go up there yes or no ah sure you're alone though they will be found drag out thermite house how's that not in him quite a few oh my god who the heck this guy i think you're good 63 on the one below they're nice this will bind them there's one surviving somewhere do you reckon he rest or probably think i bound one i did so hopefully they just revive they are reviving how is this other team not pushing them oh she's one they're gonna steal that kill it's fine shields are depleted this is one the maggie's down [ __ ] is just flying in the air that's the separating yeah they didn't kill the maggie 70. i picked up a purple extended like is he on my gun no i'm getting tired of people using the sense now they must have been watching the algs you know car everyone's been watching that lgs if they're using the sentinel oh yeah you didn't you were just flying in the air what do you mean you're tap strapping someone's been pretty easy to how did you not hate then you didn't tap straight what do you mean it was just like it was just there exactly it should have been really easy to hear healing oh that how how is that easy because it's a regular trajectory you don't have to you can win afk that's just a common thing that you'd be doing huh just just going through ash portals in the air yeah yeah cause i saw them craft underneath me so it was like a last-second thing i respect it i was i was with the mid-air yeah that sucks oh i have to cook dinner tonight oh i'm actually livid you might be the laziest person on the planet that's the hardest thing about playing wait on he's he's preparing food i hate it ah care package sweet you hate doing everything no true i like i just want to play runescape and just say yeah are you playing runescape no i'm not but that's what i want to be doing how does that make sense i i'm not playing it because i'll be addicted i don't want to be addicted there's no way that you get addicted to runescape i'd sit there and play for ice you you can't casually play runescape you can't you've never honestly you've never played it trust just trust me and i and i never know you you shouldn't i won't i i will not good because you can't they've i'll tell them to ban you if you try i'm gonna ask you all to the roof okay moving here oh god that'll get me they're chilling down low looting they're not up there don't worry where are they i don't even know [Music] i do i can't get in there there's no way i can't get in there he's got a fuse altered better what's even more depressing about this is that we killed this fuse at the start of the game and then the horizon that got away at the start of the game respawned the fuse and then they killed us unbelievable that's corsica do you hear these courses of course you're going right now i'm out put it over here how did they escape this steam's trying to push me yeah not so fast it's time to bind you what's it's last inhaled 20 flesh i think you just finished a bat though i don't know again i mean this is ludicrous man trapped yeah it's a fun guy fun dude there was a there was another team where did they go oh they're still over there chilling you know they're just chilly these ties bind we're close to the ring we have one minute wingman here now you're a big man man healing i'm a win-man man he's head glitching over there oh where 45 seconds until we've got time for behind there's no light at all i've got 108 i can drop some come back come back or something that's big that's big oh if only it was that easy i really don't understand how this team hasn't taken advantage of the fact that we've been shot one of the teams the entire time two separate teams they're just kind of challenged maybe they'd like to fight with anna you know i am not recording okay enemy there oh there is nothing you better have a good game i think i played oh uh recharging shields right here enemy at that location wait i need a loot ammo or not i have more heels there sort of find each other above i think so calls good calls it's not even my fault uh his audio is so bad you said michael was perhaps this is unbelievable it's impossible to be fed up how would you put that in a game like vertical audio how do you make it sound like they're up top unless your headset has like different speakers for that i don't know how you do it the games have done it fine who whoa where somewhere fortnite literally has are you kidding me are you kidding have you ever played fortnite have you ever played four nights i actually played it unlike you and you're zero killed every game five and a half million views yeah for doing nothing yeah you didn't even play the game that's how smart i am that's as smart as i am you average like point zero i have a 5kd on that game i'm cracked yeah no you have a 5kd because you don't shoot anybody that makes no sense mate behind a canopy i was talking about my one clip on the other guy it's crazy there's no way you're you're talking down on a give you that just stood still and the result no i'm just wet the first guy cinder kill me this guy that proves everything i need to know do you think this first goal don't fall now you'll actually be capping the fact that you think that there's nothing in this game than fortnite you that is delusion that is pure no not the audio is better but there's still no vertical audio that's what we're talking about oh that doesn't even make sense i'm an ai shell but it doesn't have any uh vertical they're paying me i'm an ea okay so are they up top or down low you don't know because the vertical audio sucks are you saying that like i don't know that nah i'm nowhere near you like i'm i'm on kc i mean they're just holding ons i need help i don't know i'm coleman i'm literally playing this game solo how are you still looting here cover me i'm using a thing are they on the roof what's the comms like i mean are they where they're chasing me though don't worry about it down hold on i need to heal recharging uh can you please take this gold bag here level four will be caught outside the ring if we don't move well done this backpack here enemy close my favorite kind of yes i know you're gonna go down like a hundred times that's why i'm dropping the bag it's making my life harder as usual you're making your own life hard you're not even recording me you're playing you're literally playing for fun right now playing for a good time this is also true i wonder how nervous people get when they're in end games like some teams you know like the teams that are just camping and they have like blue armor like they have to just be terrified oh yeah i've been i've been there in other games you know when i first started playing h1 i was i was just i signed a bush terrified i used to get me yeah at the start yeah i still get like that in solo sometimes not because of the game but because i feel if i lose this gameplay i'm gonna be livid i mean you never even you never even learned how to build in fortnite so there's no way you know that feeling wait a minute yes i did i know i could nineteen all totally the most intense fights were the high build fights i've been involved in those no you have not very high skilled ones though you need to watch some more build you need to that's fan behavior you're a big fan huh yeah i'd be watching your stuff you're a big foreign fan big item place for an iphone huh i just like watching all the awful games all the classes started all the classics originated from they're on my lobo oh my god that's why i always close my eyeballs now at least oh i was going to ask shots up there but once up top aren't they yeah you weren't even recording mate what do you get yeah i was gonna say this is your game so i don't care about you okay don't throw for yourself okay yeah yeah i can't change this into single fire i'm i'm getting livid shields are depleted recharging i mean they're gonna have to move so which one is that valve recharging shield the things that you do anymore this is really cringe for me you are a professional professional what not anything good recharging since when's the crypt on the roof man i can't do java brought by any chance i've got no heavy yeah come here in the back thank you oh my god these guys watched a lot of algs this weekend they just completely landed in seven spots he's one these guys aren't the best there's a problem you gotta [Laughter] i really tried to throw that game intentionally through i was seriously trying my best you're actually trying your hardest to throw that come on man even when i said don't throw
