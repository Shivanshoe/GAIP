hey what's going to twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more black ops cold war of course i'm here today to show you my favorite setup in the entire game i'm going to go over this really quickly and i've got two gameplays for you so it's the type 63 it's here in the tactical rifles and the attachments that i use are the axial arms three times scope we've got the agency silencer we've got the 16.4 rapid fire barrel we've got the 30 round mag and then we have the micro force rear grip and because this is like my meaning to long range gun i have it overkilled or law breakered up with a ak-74u and on this i use the agency suppressor the 9.5 paratrooper the 4 grip the 40 round mag and also the mic force free grip there as well and the type 63 specifically i do think they're going to nerf this gun it's ludicrous it's an absolutely ludicrous weapon but anyway on to the games my friends ah i was this long to get into a game and my audio wasn't self right this is the first route that i like to do on my game is just so incredibly lagged good grief i can't even hear myself think there we go it's my little rush route that i do the start it can get counted because sometimes they do the same thing and they come further up and then they shoot you whilst you're going with the rope oh too slow and on way too slow friend you have to be quicker than that that's pretty clicker as if it's never gonna happen i need to be there for this exact thing hopefully people come this way oh it's my overclock class this is the these are the two best guns on the game you've got the dominant mid-range gun in the type 63 and then you've got the dominant close range gun you can do you can deal with that teammate i'm looking this way you've got the dominant ak saying for you oh i couldn't see you ben 999 what's that is that stoner with these three times on it jeez is it brick licker what's the head shot i'm going for a triple headshot feed he's definitely here but i just think they're above just get a hot reloading come across pretty clicker oh so close but we know where he's gonna be he's been licking these bricks over here people definitely still oh i'm so close to michael i actually really enjoy this map once you get used to it once you know where to sit to get some to get some kills to get some action he must have killed that guy because he's no longer looking that way there's no way to be that weak and not looking that way not checking it you know can we have an agreement not to use the field mic because listen to it listen to it when you guys tried the duo you guys tried to do it the exact same time but unfortunately your time was a little bit off if their time was a little bit better they would have been fine there i think but it was not off capacity getting life out of me losing d i know i'm using this a lot the aksing for you had a fair few kills at the the type 63 still though i need to kill this guy hopefully you bought me and you've turned around all right well i've got my artillery we need to stop we need to stop using the field mike's people i was never going to work rick licker still up there though licking some bricks one would assume oh i needed to get back in there so fast you need to use the same for you to get close enough to push the mid-map so you can then play the type 63. i like this see who's coming across that helicopter can't use it for some reason someone's already called one in i guess this is why this is the combo friends this is why this is the dream combination oh a little bit of a spawn flip once more this is the second time it's flipped he's fine at us absolutely outrageous weapon that's where you can't even contest this weapon at that range i don't know if i'm gonna be able to get this guy he's literally standing still for some reason it's kind of difficult no i was switching guns that's not fair how could he had armor on then did he just spawn like is that a spawn protection thing there's no way you spawn mid map unless i shot someone through the wall that did respond because it is possible to swarm back there see that if you're not stuck don't tell me my teammate survivors he survived my sniping teammate survived that we weren't even in the gunfight me and him weren't gone fighting and we've somehow i'm devastated personally oh please don't be camping this i know you're on the right here well it's an enemy gun [ __ ] wait what who's got that they've been dominated i mean this is a decent spot to seat sorry bricklayer i think someone's gonna try and flank me though oh my word i don't want to use my tropicana juice yet we've got a lot of points and i'm on a little bit of a streak so i'm gonna make i held it like it's a different system it i didn't want to use it just yet but it's a different system that's not my fault people i don't think it's gonna be as useful on this map compared to the one but we'll give it a go i'm getting a bunch of markers i don't know who i think marker in there anyone want to show up on the radar i mean i just want to spray i guess i don't know who's tanking those many that many shots with this there's no way there we go here we go got an angle on the spawn now i'm gonna pretend like i'm not here i know my chopper gun is faded please don't push that is it fine am i still live over there i'm still breathing this is good news i need to defend myself hey who's this as if what are you trying that for this guy's close to me i love the tropical in this game it is so powerful it seems to last a long time i can't see who i'm firing at here i've done like a full rotation there we go this is what i was trying to use the first time uh i'm gonna pop one on a as well i was still alive my streak is still going knocking a few people it's a nice little headquest for people that come up oh my god oh chill chill i need to reload everyone calm down reckon that's not going this way there's no way he's coming this way i wasn't expecting so many people to come over if i stayed in my head glitch i don't mean all right shall i jump up bit of a crazy streak right now we've got a decent amount of time left in the game too but of course with the time left have we switched to spawns my whole team's over here please don't kill me with that my teammates are kind of close so i'm a little bit nervous and we took the artillery targeting oh clicker you're looking who's running me i don't know what's happening i'm scared i think someone's on like a oh there we go attack chopper beautiful call that in i think someone's on like one of the machine guns over there maybe i can't even get to the main the main boat that's my 11th streak it was up top oh i was getting close to my second chopper gonna helicopter i don't think the chopper is on according i don't know how i'm not really earning that many points towards it this makes sense artillery we may be screw magrude over this way oh good grief can anyone see anything because i can't that's my team why are you challenging that you're actually a lunatic i'm pretty sure you're a psychopath yeah they they're smart changed and they have a traffic which i did not know it's 24 and 17 is that is that attack chocolate worthy i mean you could go on a seven streak in a regular game 55 and 14 nearly 10 000 damage by the way i went on a few like 10 11 12 streaks the same for you is probably still the best one in the game if you're running around and playing these like closed corridors but on this on this 12v12 mode the time 63 is gonna cause you some issues it's gonna cause you some problems they are definitely gonna nerf this gun guaranteed then 999 with the street ben 999 he's pointed out the bag nice game everyone all right team we are back and i've got my class the type 63 overkill it's not called overcome this game but it's still overkill you know what i mean uh with a ak sense for you just because close range hey hey chill chill chill everyone i'm trying to use i'm trying to rappel up top this is the slowest rappel of all time making sure no one else is trying to do to me that right yes someone's already kicking off in a gunship at the moment where is everyone has anyone seen these people they went over to e they're not on the main ship yet where are they secure what are you doing back there great spawn fake jake what's going on jake huh they're not be there still jake there he is you're lucky i missed you're lucky i'm bad there you go good job teammate i get the elimination for that still pretty sure someone is over here securing me get up real quick so it's also on the radar here before i don't know if anyone came across losing c down low one what you you guys are psychopaths i don't know what you're expecting to hear i like that bunch of lunatics okay that's why you use um oh someone's on this flag okay someone's there too because i couldn't tell you i just need to get out of here i just need to reset i need to reload chill chill big boat guy i don't know where you are all right i'm going to ping this so i know they are someone's coming across a bunch of people still and i there's someone he's across i knew he'd come back these guys have been dominated here it's a beautiful head glitch when they come up jake is literally one shot if anyone would like to shoot him there's a guy over there awesome lucky where is where did jake go i think it's a found out about this spot now unfortunately oh i was on a 13-13 streak absolutely devastated but i'm so close to my chopper gonna i've got my attack chopper currently out on the map dominating the sky is killing absolute nobody from what i can remember i don't think he's shot one person yet slightly disappointing as if do not know what gun i'm using here i don't not mean to do this i might go back up top you can have c honestly feel free i don't like c he makes no sense to me whatsoever we lost charlie makes zero sense i can show the back oh they got d there's a fever i got two kills there by the way that's how good this gun is did you get that guy up top i didn't get any elimination credit for it that's my chopper gonna be soon into the game i've got a chopper gonna mainly because these guys just haven't challenged whatsoever for some reason i'm entirely sure why i'm gonna try and continue my streak for now what's up everyone are we spawning here now i'm confused why are we spawning here there's still some people in over this way right i'm seeing stuff on the radar then there's definitely people here still i'm gonna go get this guy i need to remember to always i always do the wrong order like if you want to switch your streaks you have to use the d-pad up and down first in other cards you could hold it to the right and then choose it that way someone is on c but as i said before it's the most confusing flag on the entire game it makes absolutely no sense see flag you can just like swim down low another one and we own c which is good artillery targeting detective someone is above did you get him teammate i think he did i'm gonna i'm gonna trust him artillery targeting artillery i'll launch that hopefully my team has got ghosts he's right next to me i'm gonna try and capture this if i can someone is close though oh my shooting what's going on are you still alive there i don't know if he's even still alive is he reloading i can see his way there oh come on you gotta change that french thank you literally point down the stand sorry i mean i killed him though i killed him you know what i'm going to my chopper going right i'm 29 and two i'm putting on a show we are halfway through this game i've done nearly 9 000 damage no window camping nozzy finds either nosey plans allowed people i'm getting a bunch of markers so many markers hey no boats ah they're actually kind of difficult to hit a speedy boys i'm trying to snipe my chopper gonna get out of here i told you these guys are psychos look at them i don't understand why you do that without cobler dude now there's someone taking b i can't see uh they're all far away i'm not gonna get those kills you do basically like a full lap of the entire a full lap of the entire map which is actually kind of good it lasts kind of a long time and even at this range you can still put some damage in see told you i wasn't lying just fell into the ocean i think with cold blooded and he still dies i mean you'd be truly devastated there's not much you can do with that point is there someone's up top careful oh should be careful didn't listen that's how he stole that turret it's almost over it's almost blasted him he just stopped he just stopped and accepted his fate i need to get over to their flag but it's kind of tough i don't want to swim i want to take i want to take a rope i'm risking it i'll wait this one there i'm risking it this party's in there anymore because we've got jack up top i don't know it's okay okay well okay well obviously just rap held into our own spawn hey teammate are they still on c yes oh i found him and i got both my streaks at exactly the same time that was a chopper on his artillery someone's already used it this real quick all right we've changed the spawns spawns have been successfully flipped people everyone turn around that's why artillery's nice sometimes you get a little pink so you know which way to look i didn't reload my gun i had like four bites i literally can't see i'm still hitting people that's a good place but i always managed to get over there nice 49 and four they only had 300 points it could have gone on for a little bit longer i had a really nice streak to start and unfortunately i didn't get a second chop we're gonna this he's playing the game by hiro one two three some nice long-range snipes there i'm not gonna try and punch your name again it was a disaster the first time around a nice little 12.25 kd cycle over to my eliminations per death ratio there you go 12.25 my average kd is 4.76 in the last 10 games that is pretty solid if you ask me some good games today yeah thank you for watching i do appreciate and i'll see you all in the next one bye
