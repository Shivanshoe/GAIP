he was the guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are hot dropping straight into school team and I was actually playing octane in this video and the reason I chose octane is because one path one was taken and so is Bangalore but I wouldn't have chosen Bangalore anyway if you're playing Kings Canyon after dark you may have noticed that there are digital threats absolutely everywhere on this map and of course one of the best things to do as Bangalore is to get yourself a digital threats throw some smoke down at your enemy and then just run at them so you can see them and they can't see you probably that is they also have edges your threats because everyone has one so your smokes are borderline useless and I just love high mobility characters so octane was my second choice here you got a lot of speed up you got a little jump mechanic so hopefully you enjoyed today's video if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to join our temp on I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends school tone amis my friends school town after dark maybe with the squad I'm playing a bit of octane please give me a good that's what I asked my friends there we go Oh - goodness Zoop - good good I thought it's change character halfway through at the gun fight he just sucked his team 1800 fortunately no shields all right see I can actually compete when I get a decent gun at the start of the game I've had a few games here where I've been struggling I'll be stroking mozambique's no weapons I'm going to use shields on here annoyingly pet peeve number one using shields on a level one shield it's just tonight still just feels wrong it's a foolish endeavor being led third person that doesn't have any shields prepended won the gunfights Dawber I'm not going to those I don't let the digital throw knee and the Pearl has in my opinion surviving yeah the ferry's got the muzzle flash lock the smoke frame I'll just lock the smoke just so they can't finish the job it's gone for the revive team I always go for a finishing move that is brutal that man is upset much like I was shot from above good job a team that very much appreciates it here I'll try and look more for a body shield but the Pathfinder also needs one so I may as well just use the shield cells I was trying to say that the paler has a coil of muzzle flash and muzzle flash on this map is even worse than regular maps because the visibility is already quite difficult and I do not like the digital threat on the Prowler so before people comment why don't use that I'm terrible with it I'm afraid that's the Slade the cookie crumble sometimes that's the way life goes so I'm gonna stick with the flat line I'm gonna stick with the g7 Skousen although that's still the flat line hipfire is still really good close range and hit wise great because you get that increased strength so you're also a more difficult to to shoot I do need a g7 is one of those guns Spitfire as well perhaps to be tragic without assigning two times four times variable on the gun scrap another team I know Kings Canyon I wasn't trying to walk through that let's go and get involved I mean we've all got level one shields here but if we third-party well enough we can just take their shields which I assume they're coffee they're shortened we do can't get much worse than level 1 1 & 1 it's only up from here amigos looking about octane is you can still get high ground resulting that's a DoubleTap g7 scape a terrifying noise here especially especially after dark nope can't hit me okay I'm too fast I'm octane that was a little bit greedy perhaps I should have filled up a little bit for it before challenging it I mean it's never won shields but I've got ten shield cells in the steel factories it's worth it see what I'm a big octane funding I'm gonna take the gold sniper sites I am absolutely awful with that site Scarn here barn door down here what did these guys go where did his teammates go for start and then where did the enemies fo'get they were fighting Lester just run off into the sunset well it's okay because at least the bank law has upgraded her shields now she's got the Batphone he's got police shields - maybe I should have lit a little bit more oh here we go I forgot about these or things they're linked ich snow robots I'm a big fan of all tobacco that reports them in the distance this is the same team and they've just run off this far and got themselves into a defense crap try some of whites on water treatments unbelievable scenes oh there we go crypto drone that looks out of place on this map never before seen before today Michelle bus in Seattle someone's closer so for the penis teammates yeah okay yeah that's got the best stripes I've ever seen oh my gosh thank you uh Scott level three shots now okay you guys are tense bizzy's the plan you guys go up ahead and take some of the damage because if I take too much damage I'm not screwed and I'll poke them from the sides with the p7 oh here we go a grand total of zero shots landed another zero shots landed at least the grenade exceeded five damage though my plan is failing I need to learn some shots for me to be to be useful but I see no challenge that I think I think we'll be okay should have revived to begin we need to get them off my Bangalore and they'll try and draw their attention elsewhere nice teammate they'll double kill from Bangalore there all right I'm coming over Pathfinder Bangalore need to heal up I musta got so many C's there but I don't like that's that's what I was trying to do you know I was trying to be the support side back a different angle just trying to weaken people take their shields off there are only three scores left I mean the Sony's closing in pre match that does make sense plus a lot of people are playing crazy on acoustic I mean if you haven't played yet whatever reason if you've been on unable to everyone pretty much nice at school cent if you've ever landed elsewhere and on Kings Canyon at night after dark I guess you'll know that it's a bit of a natural struggle to find people any my rounds yes thank you times classic throwdown why not that have been good for the Prowler maybe I should have picked that up for this side of the game what's up you need energy rains 20 in here right yeah 20 this is something so satisfying about that it's definitely not faster especially when your octane you could just boost yourself you know take a little steam shot go roar faster the loot but there's something so satisfying about that is that elliptic it is indeed to gobble to know my friend that's the good stuff if that's what you'd like to see I was the precision choke that's what wants to go back in there I knew there was something in now wants to pin gate all right three squads left I have eight kills prob about four assists but I'll take it that's life sometimes and we are tuning up water treatments care package coming down drink closes in an in a second as well so soon as the spring footy closes we'll know if we are in the right spot gold shields for the teammates please massa fancy it's unthinkable for some reason what do you think working I can't think you guys I'll see I'm sure the new untether massive because if you didn't I - go inside fancy yeah you dropped your devotion I can't if that's the Mastiff I should have take me for the flatline I think ultimately my friend she woke up top the zones honest Oh what am i doing I'm not paying we both could use our Ultimates I could have just learnt down to begin with and mine comes back fastened and pathfinders I think - alright well that's very useful and game this is the best high ground that's left so we should sit up here my friends and we should Scout the horizon if you can actually see anything and then it easy Li's gosh-darn dark isn't it good grief they'll have to rotate to us eventually and find each other is the last two teams you know what that means it means we should get the hacking freak involved mimi goes see what supplies boy that's the news they're so scrappy not even better they've mined someone's a Samus which it is well I don't think that weight teammates to speak careful so better he fire Oh God is it just the two was he 3 aah splat fine and you'd be screwed you gain cover team out probably just revive you I'm gonna bet [Music] this don't know [Music] while I still got this music home by the way I still got I don't even like the Christmas music that much I'll keep forgetting to take it off it's only took me about three weeks like the Pathfinder boxing gloves off as well all I could hear when I was playing was beep beep beep boop like that her end I always forget is what I'm trying to say 11 kills 2,200 damage 200 damage a kill not too bad I'll take that three kills connect the Pathfinder three kills coming out the Bangalore with 800 damages upon they pushed up as well in that game don't do not forget in school town I went down I got proud from above I slug that was some good team player I messed up at the end my god like I could have revived the Bangalore if she was behind the boxes I would have revived it but then maybe I should have waited for it to push behind the boxes you know I just hit the Ray through another hundred and I thought I could jump up there I couldn't I messed up completely and to be honest I should have been punished more for that but I'll take it it's a victory or a ranked number one it's my second win back on Kings can you know if you enjoyed that one thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
