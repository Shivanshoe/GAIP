rank on the road to masters we are playing with janks and zeus so our team was zeus was playing in australia me in the uk and janks in canada it would be difficult to place three people further away from each other than that three players three continents one dream thanks for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends there is nobody here if somebody wants to loot like this stuff and rotate it i'll land on the right here rich and i'll do all this bad stuff okay i'll leave this middle building if that top team alludes two things and comes out of practice [Laughter] there's no way dude they have so much loot over there i thought i was pretty sure that oh play is laggy is that exactly why spotted lakes is the biggest poi on this map right it has surely i didn't i didn't actually see them but that just dropped so like that they just picked it up all right i'm gonna go to the balloons calvin they're at the building way out there like they're at the building they're taking they're going through this kind of split i'm down the ladder for the land on this on the far right side all right i just got beamed i hit the bloodhound for a bit though i need to crack swan off purple i'm bubbling up one on one bloodhound one purple on another yeah i'm pushing up getting his back the other two are going to be going to the building they're weak okay balance cracks nice [Music] i'm gonna kill him [Music] [Music] that was sick oh my word team got seven yeah so it was true again low but getting over this way behind that for 21 plus i think she's running up the hill to here she came back through i'm gonna let you guys chase it back to the portal he's in the building what's in the building send it back to me yeah oh she didn't even bother you to sit there looks like that was the last one i have eight batteries designed to recharge probably dragon football here in case you want more [Music] over there oh give me that oh that all just hitting me i thought that was yours that's my fault [Music] i'm using a hemlock with it three times and i'm just not feeling it one minute i feel like the bruiser is better yeah i feel bad like i feel like i'm doing i'm missing way too many of my bursts if i had a bruiser i wouldn't miss you should fill that mate no we're supposed to be t we're one mine oh my god wait timothy they're on the other side of that building i gotta go about it right absolutely for that guy all right okay [Music] yes i didn't get all that yeah there's no it's like a bit rng i think is it 2x here i'm gonna look just for the early push from this team i don't see it i'm gonna back up and bubble jenks back up i don't think they're going to come into this shooter right shoot a rocket out of the open horizontally are these guys horrible are they just stupid he's going up top what you're gonna talk about i'm not gonna eat his office i just tried the thing i just read it here for again flesh got here oh he's already down i'm gonna drop down and look for it okay let's get on that guy they're all behind that i'm gonna hold behind that i'm gonna the best part one super flash i might get it off with my old hand i should

open they're right in the middle hey charlotte in the background everybody's still on purple i don't know my ultimate huge good job well played guys i only got one kill out of that but like 700 damage i did nothing yeah i didn't really do too much it took me about to get there is there also a purple bolt in that oh i'll say nothing this is their soul off and he's trying to get banners he's probably just going to run and realize he can't believe it nearly cracked behind this he saw life for sure nice he died [Music] i hate to see a fellow octane go down like that but i mean you did third party us no he didn't actually they helped him say third party the team technically true okay all right true then i really feel bad he was a fellow warrior i needed some cake they were dying anyway what were they doing i don't know they were really committed to trying to third us but i don't know why they just got out shots like every single time and just kept coming back he's doing the spitfire i must have him like three times nothing i have 230 damage i have 247 yeah i'm down to look for a third yeah you're kicking me off wait what kicking me off you find a new third oh no no it's out of fear it's got the least damage actually you got the least damage see yeah i've got 17 more so no shot bro i feel like where this is a different bite to like what the knocks are on it seems like a long range we are already inside the ring love tab session on the i see him on the roof there the actual pipes going down here target spotted do you want to team shot him like get ready i only want the top here yeah it's just any still you gotta talk about one two three now i don't know i missed that but yeah they're gonna come in bottom floor if unless they're running i yo huge name huge hit on them 100 100

yourself i need to lose heavy too play 30 volts this bro can i hit this box for heavy is there heavy no no no no i checked this guy the charge is destroying me all right i'm going to the other building just walking it oh there's heavy remember this building you can get shot from both windows yep wait where'd that decoy come from it must come from so far it was just dancing i really want a bloodhound right now like i wish i could just scan want to see an eagle player all right which one of us is getting crazy it's going to be one of us it's going to be me while i'm crafting bats right now i'm gonna craft some ammo oh this guy i'm getting shot all right you got no business doing that ultimate accelerant here okay six squads twelve people just ski blitz all right that's going to res might be they're going to fight down there they're going to push that this way wait hold that thought an enemy out there charge rifle guys you guys want to pat on this charge rifle team i'm already like just having a look up here you do you think do you think i'm gonna stay here i'm gonna hold this make sure we don't get this spot taken this is a good spot to hold can i move up here i might fall off here apparently you can't walk along that i don't like it look at me go mate look at me go full team just building we yeah we get you down you already killed this one hey source that's all i'm just gonna hold this area make sure nobody takes the spot horizon be careful uh charge awful guy could probably get line of sight on any charging shield oh this there's a free spawn on us i can make it i can make it i can make it level 4. no i got a pat on them and there's a golden i'm gonna result doing this that chase me they're chasing a little bit recharging shields yeah i'm holding this door

i'm scared to push out with that armor i'm not going to bother yeah it's not it's come on come on i know this is going to be i'm just going to shoot bushes give me a second you killed him only two enemies i'm pushing this guy killing him i'm kissing him along as well oh my god i absolutely him i just heard him grapple yeah he's in the bubble he's one hp nice guys the way i died was like actually tragic as well like that bone like forces you off in certain spots and like i was trying to not get forced off but it just happened it was precarious i expected him to be underneath the building like now the little part i heard him but it's like outside on the edge
