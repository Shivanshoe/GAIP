hey what's up guys it's welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i have a game that happens all the time or at least the intro of the game does but the later part of the game does not and it's just when everything falls apart you land hot your teammates get split up or all fighting different people you're trying to first ferrara switches at one side of the poi your teammate on the other side of the poi is getting thirsted himself and sometimes you've just got to pick up the pieces also i've done some edits in this video to make it more obvious when i'm speaking to my teammates and i just make my banner a little bit bigger in the bottom left if you think that's too distracting let me know but anyway thank you for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends contact there you go right nice all right i love landing here because if someone lands here like that you get the kills and then all you do is you take that thing oh that's huge just given my shields i don't think i have any lights i do not i don't say thank you here we go wait thank you thank you your gratitude is great wingman here i'm gonna use it [Music] what a great guy nice job i'll be there in a second i have to phoenix scanning the area that's our pleasant spanner it should be ours to protect half a minute i am blue thunder thank you i've got 30 seconds to get your banner i'll try victory trust in the old father my wounds taking a moment to recharge my shields marking our surroundings marking our surroundings defeated the whole squad oh my god taking a moment thanks i don't know what's going on let us go this way i can get you back oh my word your boy's alive your boys alive and kicking alive and kicking that is that was a lot of fun good grace that's why i love the wingman if you're landing your shots you you weaver like a you with a headshot in there too you're doing some good damage i think i could have got teammates banner before i dropped down the first time that's the annoying part there but when i came back up there was a full team and man i just had to try and survive i think i tried cascades i bathe in the blue this is ludicrous i don't know if we can fight them they're just they just got uh causing traps careful zone maybe possibly attacking us they should bring this team out that's their teammate i think reloading i talk an enemy's life good kill a few more anyone passes through here we'll know i've got his back it's the second team here actually care for the second team i see somebody studying is close let's go this way give me one moment scanning the area we just have to leave these guys this is ludicrous you know they can see inside with course traps all they want i'm pretty sure that was their teammates they can get better this guy's enjoying this guy's having a great time i guess we third part of this but as soon as we third by this this team's gonna come down with the with the call stick and oh god what do we do here reloading the ring is moving for life fighters no one is inside scanning the area shut down i don't want to fire recharging my shields actually down that guy questions i bathe in the bluff oh father give me sight marking our surroundings team nice oh my god well there's a team that went through here i assume it's the causing team with their teammates banner which is great because they didn't shoot us in the back honestly we need to even heat them that much but as long as they're shooting the guy as long as i shoot me even i'm not teammate it's fine that's all i need to do you keep me i'm going to go down low and sneak out there oh this is a terrible terrible soft being frag grenade scent oh father give me sight just topping off my shields the fight is not even multiple squads attack i'm in trouble just topping off my shields with you what's the best play what's the best play here i mean they're just leaving why are they just leaving have the ammo to keep contesting this i'm hoping they're okay it's not light here they're padding away and it's just this team over there what do you think are you saying they would have stayed up top taking a moment to heal up and fencing anyone passes through here we need to be ready to uh third party these guys all right so i think we just have to go around the side here no one's going for the care package which is good i guess again let's know where they are level two they're not really fighting each other that's the thing neither team's really committed to this fight yet look over here a few more meters to the ring and still a minute to go can't sneak that way we are not alone a is once we killed that guy we should have backed up we needed to help the we needed to help that team this is a maybe crave it wants to play it's three i don't know if we win this teammate that's huge [Music] no i needed that so bad go teammate to 1v1 i think mate big clutch oh my god we've won that game that's huge you are the apex champion ggs guys ggs oh man that was great and the uh the watson clutched up and the lifeline stayed the entire time that was great what a team ggs man that was so much fun
