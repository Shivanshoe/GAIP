celebration i was going to land trevor then i saw hot drop fragment you know i would have been very upset literally no one has so many people here about the hot dog okay how would you be oh i thought you were landing up top i i didn't know yeah it's not clean one shot leader oh sorry mate that's indeed my fault i'll paint one if you can dude i'm so bad i'm taken down someone's around me like healing somewhere i don't even understand where my board just went i think i landed on you i think i shot before you landed i'm just bad i need some light rains if you haven't found any i have something there's something there's somewhere thank you is there people over there uh yes i'm scanned from this way too i don't mind going to the third party yeah i don't i'm gonna go to the third place with you right on me though i go back shall we right under me oh i'm here we got ourselves a fight i shot two sentinel bullets and she emptied out like a full magazine of uh another spitfire like how bad is this gun this is this gun is so just awful to use when you could have just done the same with a bow and fired like five bullets so much fun though can't help it yeah just it is fun i found a gold online shield come on nice something four story come on boy i'm a melee come on power mech here real quick okay come on come on then i think that's second floor one's behind me hundreds in there they're just hiding in corners one second i'm pretty confused second floor yeah yeah incoming i don't know where these guys are they're not foreign um verizon was still down yeah oh i'm uh gold this is my purple back here i really should have swapped like 10 times yeah he's only needs 200. that's not bad what's your favorite rhoda in the game um like right now or just of all time let's do both because you're going to say prayer for all time right was my favorite back in the day but now i like uh i like flatline 301 or flatline vault um i got vault online that's your wingman oh they're flying right in front i fell oh my god so laggy i'm dead well that sucks like 15 kills that sucks come on bottom me too i always land this bomb door although you get either yet i don't know he put him for 114 that's cracked sorry oh we just i feel like i've joined all the pieces of lucy's game target we should go this way swap my guns again this guy has the uh the flat line oh the battle pass one yes i always say i'm not gonna do it and then i still do it it's so difficult oh team on me all the way up top i'm going to let you leave good sir because your teammates here i go shots fired i'm coming back this guy's just gonna keep running fire damn it i should have got my kill oh uh it's a different team i guess non-existent let's get some more ammo yeah this is loads of different teams i'm just kidding going around picking up all the energy i'm going [Music] recharging shields what what's the lifeline oh that's that really threw me off my shields guess i'm the new kill leader go me man this is an absolute disaster of a game it definitely is against 30 30 from over here i think nice best leave no kill i mean where's this guy that's healing oh no they're pushing yeah from both angles i'll show you oh i have nothing the other thing is on the back too i don't know how you're alive but i haven't re-45 yeah they started fighting each other pushed once i have reform nice that's clutch i don't know how you stayed alive right i didn't yeah because there were so many teams focusing us that i just i hid until they started firing each other basically what the heck was that the entire thing was an absolute disaster i don't even know if that was good grief man 10 seconds i have a vault on an re so at this range i'm not sure how useful i'm gonna be how do i know i'm i just had the idea right because i've i don't use my hats to heal this up and i was going to switch my red armor to gold armor so i can double the effectiveness of the shield cells i'm using on the red armor and then i realized you just had that thought for like a quick second just a quick second i thought i'm a genius this is peak efficiency i mean it's not that's not the worst idea i've had worse ideas i don't understand where once a year might be something good this week single tap devote oh sorry i had to shout out for like half a second you're good you got that though yep are they shooting at somebody oh that's mario they were hold on i'm gonna get two to four times for this two to four times i'm a triple take oh nice i suck man what's going on i thought the triple tank was pretty much heat scan these people i think it's just one guy oh oh man come back nice hey someone has a rez i did see a shield back there but don't worry i don't know if we actually thirsted him though like we did he had a red shield but maybe his teammate did too oh yeah i don't know how to do that big jump off that rope i always try but i have no idea what i'm doing uh are you talking about the like a little side jump the one might send you really high in the air i don't understand how to do it supposed to like do it like i think to the left of it or to the right of it and then like double double tap yeah like you jump and then i think it's like double interact something like that i don't know yeah i've never looked up a video to try and man i did that with wall jumps i didn't bother to even look at the video i thought you needed to like crouch when you hit the wall so i'd always try to do that but obviously that never worked yeah what i mean it's pretty easy though though jumping's really yeah but i just never bothered to look it up the wall jumping pretty easy yeah yeah i couldn't even get inside guys that was a game mate absolute disaster involved in i don't know how we survived that i really don't i mean i did it until you did as soon as my grapple like when i was trying to flank that life as soon as it hit something way too close to me and i messed it up i got all flustered and since then i didn't like what happened you know just weren't happy with that i was not
