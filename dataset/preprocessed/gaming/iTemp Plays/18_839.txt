hey wassup guys its rich for I'll come back to another video today we are playing small apex legends of course today we find ourselves for the legendary Sentinel The Sentinel sniper that was released in season 4 there is a catch though it comes with the 4 x 10 x variable scope and it just so happens that I am bad with the four times 10 x variable scope so I do struggle or be whatever I'll take what I've performed it look better than I was expecting I actually landed some shots and we landed a disruptor own shot in there as well so keep an eye out for that I just wanted to thank you guys so much for the recent support I really do appreciate it if you're new around here and you haven't subscribed yet what are you doing my friends subscribe join the art empire so thanks for watching I'll see one in five and a half seconds oh my friends you know what I would I would say this is my favorite job planet harvest irides I haven't thought of a catchy name for yet I mean scrap to City reign supreme school town didn't need a catchy name it was already free catchy scratch cave was decent you know rest in peace crap cave but plenty half to death I've done nothing so far you need to get a little bit creative with I think wait how could I really do just pick everything up don't I what am I got here giving that back I might want to flatline or something my friend Holly do thank you very much very much appreciated my knees at body shield I tell you what though I've lunch here fair few times recently and there's been not a soul and this is fairly early on the drop that's my passive I started running quick and there's no one around weird alright well there is a scrap at least you guys know where it is it is indeed in the distance it's a scrap in the distance the two requirements not sure on what team it's gonna be I mean our fate in this way after I'll come over because nothing is happening over here at the moment yeah I'm playing Bangalore the first time this season because my mains this season are revenant and then Pathfinder and obviously I was the last pick revenue and path mind overtaking Bangalore is not a bad third option they're not coming over are they get off the rock good grief come on team they're not interested this may be this may not be a good idea I may have to stay away a little bit no that's all coming there's two of them one's a pathfinder she's bad news for me because they Pathfinder could easily catch up to me it's got a plan himself through damage team he's using he's using a Phoenix kit for like 40 health they come in a cargo bus there we go miss grappling he's coming this is good news here we go we can get involved name if I was Pathfinder I would have got involved a long time ago but sometimes you just got to play a little bit smarter have the same level as same level of mobility say that healing jugglers listen there's a paucity in a look at this getting their friend there you go yeah sylveon you don't need me I'm taking the purple shorts oh you didn't even know this guy had purple shields cuz I took it off so the revenues would be got purple shield to see to the caravan let me takin him now you stuck in the lava ten seconds what was he doing what's the only gonna start that animation I will take the off your hands and receive it - Milotic tentative to useless now when it's the new gun and it's legendary it's our war museum did you have any armor fleece no he did notice missed it oh I'm not good with this with this scope it's too much for me I've used on PC before before it's like a for 10 times isn't it I've used on PC and it was pretty good sniping on PC like long range on pcs Rudy fun and a little bit easier than close range close range on console is a lot easier than PC it's like the opposites look at the state of this scope good grief give me some good light this is for the thumbnail here we go behind the scenes here that's the shot there we go beautiful it's it's a bit mental though isn't he it's a bit it's a bit overkill for this kind of weapon I mean it is a ball action if you guys the care package I could have a legendary sniper and then a devotion I just don't play mouse and keyboard again not not to post or anything because it would take so long to get to a level where I'd be able to get consistent gameplays I used to play Mass and keyboards power rails loads like the first barrier I played was mass and keyboard as h1z1 back in the day I was jeez go name but I reckon I was pretty good I had some good shots but I played amazing keep with you the day and my muscle memory was completely gone it's gonna take some warming up again not to play like Call of Duty or something a bit easier where you can practice your shooting it'll be easier where is that he was that my friend stream the car go back down I'll tell her I'm like caveman spongebob then you're joining commit someone's closer ice sugar juice is my result I think it's knocking too don't use a machine got that's cheating I'm sniping got stuck into two guys triple take the point so ID point it's revenue every level on shields thankfully I'm an attempt in this night there was ludicrous nice job team attempting that's nine for that range was ludicrous alright this is gonna take some getting used to please do not hand me in the comments okay I've used this scope maybe twice in my entire life and it's difficult to be born it's real difficult over here I'm doing defense because this is a third party here I'm charging up and wasting the shield battery it's not waste if I hit this guy and you're nine I was a pathfinder this guy would piece any seams I'm not going there's a good idea his friends coming down too difficult this so difficult to use careful teammate Bangalore's miss Besser should help a little bit miss smoke again so he can heal up shooting when you miss that many shots you may as well just back up nice and it's two chasing here nice teammate doesn't cuz they come up I wish I was pathfinder sniping as pathfinders way better you can get yourself some advantageous positions I'm sliding off the mounting teammates coming back you can get yourself into some really good positions as Pathfinder and you can escape your someone gets closest Bangalore I can't chase I can't chase people if I hit them like that revenant mer 109 damage couldn't get there in time to work to finish the kill nice you don't work it's using her since not a yes but over there get the heck in freak involved acoustic traps don't say I'm off teammate don't get too close sweet hanging out up in the door I know who's any avoiding that council this arrangement okay I'm gonna need I got to thank please someone stand still that's a clown headshot now's a Clairol hecha I'm sure of it you're not gonna chase that my teammates to come in can I see through the smoke with a scope you can't on you I'm for too long I saw him in the corner I'm sure I saw gold Armour and purple armor when I shot then imagine if that was a crabber that would have been like a double kill but the sense now you can find on the floor obviously is not going to be twice as good at the crater that would be ludicrous so it'd probably be a game breaking I would argue especially on PC tell what though I'm happy of actually managed to land a shot there okay five kills two spectators and one scrap in the distance that's not bad that is not bad at all can't hear anymore some reason no one died did they they're just launching their needs that's why I can hear it they're all going into their bags to get the grains out a separate fight that must be a separate fight right least you're going in on committee music I don't who that's that mice teammate nice I saw that guy Ryan his converse his converse with pika add the barn with the car cybers Ryu and him in the same team I thought the two shots the first two shots are going to meet and they heat and then I thought the last shot was going to hearing it missed what's going on here it's back what have you go lucky shows off twice now oh there's another sniper I forgot so let's quickly baton [Music] please gone so no way one of them one of the squaddies I only get crossfire that's the problem ID teammate are you gonna commit let's go [ __ ] smoke [Applause] once it get too aggressive I think shot 137 attempting to push up they surely would have healed up by now but my team has gone on a bit of a flank so if I can maybe get into a position to take advantage of that if he pushes up I need to get involved with wise he's dead this will appear we shouldn't we just shouldn't we've got if we if we stand back here we've got every vantage from the storm let's do that I think even the photos to look as well horn you've landed that shot have you nice Chris Kyle over here good news is they were going outside the safe zone towards the enemy team Bologna's this is turning to a massive snipe place and there we go there's a third party I was waiting for [Applause] oh my god the sky its Houdini I say we get back to leader I think they're dead right that's them surely that's them that's then I mean I don't think that a kill in the last five minutes of the of the game there but I'll tell you why thinking back I did I did way better than I was expecting with that sniper I'm not good with a 410 time scope as I said I've used it twice may main be as a push three times 2100 damage were round in Europe were giving ourselves a little bit of it a little bit slack they I'll take it the support sniper I took a risk in picking that up cuz I knew I wasn't going to perform that well but you know fortune favors the brave my friends you pick up the gold sniping that well not for the Gibraltar he he died unfortunately with the gun but I picked it up in Aidid well but I advise picking it up if you're on PC probably worth a try if you're on console if you're maybe put you're probably better than me with it so give it a go and report back cuz I Intel with that scope but still doing pretty good anyway thank you for watching I do appreciate a see you on the next one [Music]
