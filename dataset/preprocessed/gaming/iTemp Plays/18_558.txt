hey what's up guys it's welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be using the most fun gun in the game the sentinel it isn't the best it isn't going to win you any tournaments but my word landing three or four successive shots with this weapon in a team fight is one of the most satisfying things that you can do on apex legends and by the way a little bit of a christmas miracle here my g fuel code is 30 off right now you can grab yourself a tester kit if you've not tried g-fuel before or you can stock up on your favorite flavors
