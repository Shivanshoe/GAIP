hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course so in season six we saw ourselves some pretty big changes to the armor system on apex legends all armor was replaced by evo shields and all the shields were reduced by 25 and i liked this change personally if you don't find good armor you will be able to make this awesome after a few fights however the time to kill did change massively this season this was half because of the armor changes and reduction in the shields but half as well because of the overall power of so many of the weapons so they added the vault which was uh it's an incredibly good submachine gun they removed the devotion from the care package and it kept the same power which is ludicrous they buffed guns like the hemlock and the burst by prowler the turbocharger is back in the loophole so the havoc is melting people i mean even the triple take got a crazy buff with the fire right it's got an inbuilt precision choke and high stacks of sniper ammo as well it just feels like so many of the guns in this game are really good now which is nice but when combined with the lower armor values you would just get evaporated in some gunfights now respawn have come out and they've said that they are reversing the 25 shield reduction across the board however the evoshield change is the same this is great news in my opinion the gold armor is going to be useful again and you will have that split second longer to react to incoming gunfire and i think it's a great change and probably hits the sweet spot of the armor changes that they were looking for now just be aware of the next time that you're playing because this is going live today so you do not want to be caught out your red evo is going to be massively tanky again be careful for those gibraltars with red evo again my word you've got the arm shield you've got the 45 passive and then you've got the 125 red evo shield on there too anyway let me know what you guys think of this change down low in the comments and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah we need to get stuck in let's get those evos up nice and i'll lend that door all right we gotta at some point we have to craft three devos three turbo chargers let i guess like with the new crafting it's like really enabled like slower play as well like people can just sit around and just move and craft like all games yeah yeah he has you can put damage on your evo shield too so you're not you're not suffering that exactly yeah yeah yeah that's what we were doing the last time i played for sure um parties i think that's two teams actually usually glass is pretty sad let me do it oh i was gonna scan but i'm of course those scans were huge it was nice to do much women oh someone above me that's already in the ring it's a bit dangerous with like blue towns as well because you can just see where you are that's oh they're they're loving stuff there's two blue evos by me broken broken rich money he was launching stuff out there there's two of him over this way oh no he was just a decoy another blue evo here if anyone needs okay uh you're you're by yourself vic yeah i think i knew right the third blue evo here a guy down there uh i don't know i don't think so there's one more though somewhere i hear him like this way somewhere i don't know if he's up top or down low but he's east all right i think he's down there safe anything good on any of them uh scorpio if you're uh oh i'm not i'm not give me half an hour oh my god you scared me that's scary um okay there was more shots down east see this is our bread and butter yeah we're just so so professional that this is the only place we can i just couldn't take the other game seriously you know yeah i need more on the line yeah there's someone in this place i need to be in bronze lobbies uh there's one guy in front of me nice job let's go now we're moving oh my god it's the sack to just just get everything going what's the alienator then that the ultimate easier did i like that name better or what that's actually really cool is that the like go to smg like for pickups um i would use that as like a placement holder until you find a natural one gotcha yeah it's sort of sad just hold it say that yeah it just holds it it used to be that for the r99 but now it's a care pack you don't need it wait yeah one it's an assault rifle is it a different gun but it's definitely burned in the alternator or the other even like even in close range probably okay i would i would say so i would say so just fire the alternate is so slow it's just a little consistent little guy in the ultimate yeah doesn't do much damage it just kind of tickles them noted this is this is so refreshing playing with people who know everything it's so refreshing because yeah like if you don't keep up with the matter you're left behind things change all the time so much in this game too yeah every day they'll change a good even if they're like adding in a new town takeover they'll change like different weapons and fine-tune them and stuff it's always changing yeah lifeline's really scary right now too with the reza's so they just revived here was it bottom or yeah people that just respawned but at the same time i do not care ah they they would have done this they absolutely wouldn't even want me oh they saw some gold he shot a back assorted do you guys fancy yeah you lose that extra value on the last one object over there so i guess in a way um so you're about because it can't get to four it can't go red can it so in a way you're probably better getting the evo i think so for picking up gold yeah until you find red is pretty useful yeah still useful i had a purpose i'd probably just hold on to that oh god i'm gonna die oh no i'm not with you okay nice give him a wall there's another team at all that he's okay yeah yeah reloaded oh god is it in the air oh no we're good i'm gonna leave this guy if you give me a sec behind us i don't know what's happening yeah there's a lot of people here on us it's kind of loony pushing i'm coming over they're all on me they're all on me uh one more on me cracked just this way i can't see nothing sorry that's my uh cast no you're chilling i've got the right stuff okay i'll get him fine hey i'm chilling i'm scared i'm scared i think there's another thing nice job hey look at us oh my god they were alive oh what's this oh volkkai yeah let's go vault spot hunting there's one there let's go to this area oh they'll be on your map actually so uh a vault and then an r301 is like a decent that's a good setup yeah for sure i should probably get probably get like a one two times on the r301 i don't know if i spot one there's a one two times right there one you fancy i got one i got one nice just need a bit of energy i'm sure there's some here somewhere uh are you going to leave this gold vic um what is it your gold your gold armor that you had oh yeah yeah because i've got purple either there's an x-ray of 60 rounds there's fancy i use the cold i think the only time i like using the gold is because you don't have to really carry batteries yeah just drop my batteries and just carry cells true yeah good for the team two okay usage uh i need some energy ammo right i dropped 60. did you beat this oh no take these 68 energy thank you i'm good yeah it should be right um okay so the nearest vault is we can't wait we can't yeah can't get to it can we it might be open as well that one's the most popular one it doesn't let you does it oh it doesn't let you tell unless you have the vault key right yeah i have it but i don't see oh no no yeah it's it's in the it's by the guy so it's pointing me down oh oh my god this dude there's no audio on it i think he was just chilling the gong or more somewhere yeah i thought he was aiming at me well this is the worst player back again fell down oh there's someone um okay i i don't want to drop down on him and lose his high ground yeah they run run did we get there we can cross the bridge just cross the bridge that's it i'm gonna loop this box real quick one second oh i fell down looking at the map but i should be okay oh the guy ran off yeah i don't know where he went went like more that way there's a while ago north as well yeah we might just want to hold north i think wait till he's no he's right behind this right behind his right that's probably that solo guy isn't it he's running left oh yeah oh he's should we go for the zip up i'm just going up yeah yeah i'm with you i'm with you all right i'll go up i just love my ultimate then going up i'm gonna try and go with their heads oh there's a team there too yeah i'm going um i'm going over carefully that broke one lobo one's down with you there's another team upside down that's a really hard push i'm gonna get some ammo real quick i'm getting shot i'm just i'll bounce back up coming back out i don't want to play i think they got raised okay oh there's more on me definitely you're gonna get shots off again this team nice all right i'm back on actually got a divo oh my word that's scary thank you so much uh we got one minute then we gotta go there was another team on north that was trying to push on the train tracks gotcha that's good work we all like i said i'm all late here that was nice we all those guys they all survived hot res actually i think that was the team i think that's the resin looking for a bit more light if any of these boxes have some uh there's light on the top one um oh if you're not taking this divo oh yeah wait that's a gold vault what you can take that i'm chilling with what i got it's okay i just run out of uh run out of lights there's more loot here 200 light i left my r3 up top just need some shield batteries if there's anything um i have two i can drop you one zero that'd be nice these guys have none uh i said he goes on we gotta leave all right that's like all the loot you could ever want and what you're like full on like i have never seen i think that's the one thing about this season is there's so much the the loot there's so much uh more good dude it's so much more condensed they're far yeah like pretty much every gun's good everyone's gonna cry there's also a team over there do you want to take the left side yeah yeah yeah i'm i'm wrapping left on this team yeah i'm sorry i'm just getting this private going all day as well through his eyes i'm going even further left i'm gonna get to the wall i'm gonna move okay smoothie they got they have really good angles too so be careful all the way around yeah we can get all the way around they don't actually see me okay so i'm gonna jump on this building behind them i'll put a bounce pad here nice nice all right they're about to die one's he's instead don't throw anything because they have a they're getting shot in the back they can show the back i got yeah i ain't got enough of that come on who shot them um over there we can just uh just don't hold these guys three squats there's one more squat somewhere else as well i'm gonna get some bats there's one right here let's find one as well i wonder where that's going actually we need to go towards these guys do you want to early first yeah i can do this they snipe this to give me one sec yeah i'll winch up if you want i can put a jump pad
