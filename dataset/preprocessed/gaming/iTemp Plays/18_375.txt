hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i don't know if you guys know this but my friend so far plays on some weird settings linear was not enough for this man he decided that he would make his settings even more difficult by using the advanced look controls for controller and i attempted to use a copy of his settings this video and it was one of the worst experiences of my entire existence so i hope you enjoy it thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends controller and then advanced look controls you're gonna be like put it on steady yeah uh yeah yeah okay then turn it on yeah uh dead zone one percent one okay huge outer threshold two percent yep response curve one percent and then uh yaw speed uh 380 and then speed at 350 and then all of the all of the wrestle the ones on that uh row zero uh that one's 130. and then uh pitch speed is uh 130 as well and then it's uh zero per zero percent all the way down and i mean obviously just make sure your aim assist is actually on yes that always helps i think right now the controller man this is atrocious oh yeah it's gonna be rough there's no way you play on this man i do right but i play on a plane i'm doing my best to aim at this big building in the middle and i can't i should uh i should i should play on your settings too all right first thing you want to do go to steady and just go to steady every single these are the worst things i've ever seen i'm not lying i was gonna make content about this but i might you have literally seen me play what do you mean by that yeah but you got a different controller i played i played these settings on the dual shark too for a little bit no you didn't your screen never bounced around like this my screen is bouncing i'm not i'm not it's making me seasick what do you what do you mean bouncing like my control every time i move the controller it drifts in a different direction because you gotta keep it standing keep it steady with your thumb are you saying i've got to try and aim with with this oh the ads isn't isn't too bad i like the eds a lot i'm not touching my controller i look at these people look at it let's just zoom in okay this is not my fault if you are using a scuff controller you're gonna have to use though it might be that 350. uh yeah but i mean if you lower it then it's not my settings i can't even throw this name properly i'm actually going oh let's go mates dude what did i tell you are you one of them nerds what am i talking about i can't first i literally can't first i'm missed watch this oh wow let's go that box just got demolished come around the corner and it's just getting sprayed into the floor it was a nearly a one clip though i'm the damn guy that didn't have a shield though let me know if you see any energy sprayed into the horizon yeah because he's just so plain on the sticks he's probably shooting rocket launchers at uavs i'm missing just annoying with that as soon as i um completed that challenge i went into a game and i destroyed four uavs in five rockets but before that okay the settings the settings these guys are almost as bad as me this got a 2014 but i think he was just i think he was reloading i'm increasing the threat the dead zone the dead zone's going to like eight that's like default no default he's like oh i mean big struggle um just trying sorry just trying to film facts and these other rappers be mumbling okay that wasn't bad um well i'm just i mean struggling and mumbling is a bit of a stretch you know it's a work in progress i think you just end it there i think that's what happens drop the mic you just end it that was good though it wasn't it wasn't too bad you know i knew he tried to uh take ownership of the doom clan once upon a time are you just is this just you being sarcastic are you serious no when they were like i kind of know what happened but that lady was looking to like pass ownership and i was like real kid sounds funny for a little while yeah i was thinking i could do that why didn't you join an org  people don't know this but actually orgs are for nerds yeah but if g2 asks you right now to join you're a nerd real quick huh uh yes absolutely i am i'm putting a pad down here getting that with me hopped in that whip popping in the whip ski don't worry the two times coming two times here uh getting my patent booster you know where they are please i'm hoping i'm hoping i'm hopping oh god this is kind of a big okay okay okay okay five flash life lines one my aim was atrocious that'll do like 16 people left if you if you land somewhere no one is you're just screwed on this map there's nothing you can do so bad that that place is close to the drop as well like what you want us to do game i'm still using it because i dropped that massive bar yeah that was a big one i bet you're expecting it to be way worse than it was oh i was impressed i was i was actually impressed i like it's it progress mate my name used to be ricardo and my rap name so it was just ricardo that's it and i wrote just one rap i told you about this didn't i wrote one rap when i was about eight do you know what the lyrics were i think you told me but i remember it was um ricardo yo repeated about eight times that's and that's it that's as far as i got i don't know how you didn't keep going i don't know how i wasn't signed i actually got so mad that i thought they don't deserve me this is just the end of your career right there yeah i'm gonna keep my rhymes myself it's a struggle i'm still my uh my bars mate i see your post it was a struggle wasn't it was that one of your boats it was the end of one of my rhymes well

thought is that your is that your rap name little anime eyes yeah that little enemy eyes low enemy ice oh ice yeah iced chat to the squad it should boil anime eyes obviously in fact and these other rappers spitting lies i see you but you see you're kind of just recycling the same bar i know i feel about that pretty sure you have like a post-it note on your monitor that's just has that bar which is multiple variations it's the best ball go with me that smile that's as far as i've written because that's you can't it's all downhill do you start with that bar where'd you go are you getting punched jump down i'll uh bow and arrow them here we go that happened on your head yep don't worry you got me with a bow and arrow without leaning 16 gold armor a 99 and a havoc oh my god my life is a

playing arenas every once in a while richard you are throwing away a lot of your talent because you would be insane just pick a g7 every round you would destroy we have one person we have one person with uh that plays range does poke damage that's you and then um and then we have uh me who's like the controller up in close guy and then we just need like one other cracks one of their little decent players and we're we're good we're good looking imagine randoms just don't do it if a team that i'm on beat one of the competitive guys i think they could ever live that day why you act like you're not good at the game you're good at the game i'm alright i'm even better on linear my orange i've gotta have a convertible my rmg today's been outrageous but usually it's trash are you fighting i'm
