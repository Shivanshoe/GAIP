hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are testing out the habit today which got some some buffs in season 13 for some reason uh well it was only one buff it reduced the recoil at the start of the pattern which was the most difficult time to control the recoil on this gun however i don't remember it ever being that bad i actually quite like to have it last season the reason i didn't use it is because yeah you can have a little bit of ammo at the start of the game but as soon as you start shooting people the ammo gets used up and no one else is ever using energy no one uses the devotion they nerf the triple take and the vault is in the care package so it's difficult to get ammunition for energy you always end up having to switch it out which is actually what happens at the end of this game i couldn't find any energy what i'm saying is bring the vault out of the care package and more people would use the havoc as well in my opinion i don't mind though because i'm a bit of a havoc kind of saw myself hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all five and a half seconds my friends that's much towards this spot i am going quadruple bins i'm going double beans because me and octane are gonna share it that's fine as long as i get a good okay alternator top three best guns to land on i should make a list havoc is also up there um what else maybe the maybe the mastiff no so many thermites i didn't get the bag i mean i think it's havoc or maybe flat no no no it's flatline alternator so easy to walk with people when you drop on those guns they don't use all the ammo in the world you don't need extended mags yeah let me know in the comments if you disagree i've got 30 30 alternators a decent setup here we go little havoc have we wanted to test this out properly as soon as he got a buff in season 13 i actually thought he was fine how it was but there you go friend i heard a lift is that them yes yes three dry as they say in germany i would assume people have said that before look at the bust over here i'll waste my two thermites get this guy bully this one never mind his teammates have his cover go shield go nice teammate there you go he's an absolute mess this is a mess good job team that squad is cooked i firstly thinking i needed an armor switch but it was just a thermite that tickled me so it was a waste of time i should have shot the people standing up octane says well played hey i like this guy thanks octane i've got some extra energy for me here which is nice because you never find energy anymore since the vaults in the care package no one uses the devolution you don't really see the havoc that much and you only occasionally see a chore take so it's just tough because even when you kill people there's not really a high chance they're going to be using energy i mean you can't move for uh heavy this season so much heavy let's use that gravity a little tip from me here i wouldn't have switched to a car ignore that if i uh didn't have an extended mag alternator in no mag is way better than a car with no mag imo look at that but people have to be over the side of the map because the entire ship dropped stormcatcher so we are probably rocking up on some people with three red armies at the moment probably triple pred there we go there's someone on the rope all right heads up they might be going for crafting materials they might be coming back no his teammate's gone too i've got a plan hello amigo hello amigo is behind this guy just got to keep him busy get him octane there we go nice i mean that is just one of the the best baits you've ever seen champion eliminated outsmarted outplayed bamboozled outmaneuvered hoodwinked oh my god using a triple tape nice team there we go i do feel kind of bad when you run through and see the devastation i mean this team all survived i need to hop up turbo charger just in case you see it you know i mean we've all we've all been there we've all landed at stormcatcher with the rest of the lobby and it's a christmas miracle if you stay alive let alone your entire team that was going for over there it's gonna be a purple arm we've all got purple but it might have a turbo so could be worth it oh my god it's a gun why couldn't you have been evolved come on man let's camp out over here just go through the tunnel i mean most most times i i'd switch out the havoc for a g7 i think that looks incredible but i don't often get to use the g7 but i'm trying to make a video on the havoc so i can't switch it out teammates didn't take it either i just left a g7 on the floor that makes me sad g7 is getting no love spotted a team up top as well god makes me wish i was playing horizon you can just horizon cue your entire team up there and they're screaming grood my blue knockdown is actually pretty big on newcastle i'm going to be honest with you i'm not going up the rope there's no way i'm going up there on the way amigos he's healing this must be the rampart oh good god nice let me get my shield back look how much shield he took off me god did 75 damage in two shots sheila's busted attention this guy's purple was more advanced than mine which is kind of embarrassing a nice look there by any chance is he just one probably doubtful right someone's out there it's a race portal fight i'm not going to chase these two guys across the map especially in octane just seems like a complete waste of time and also he'll he'll just make it to the um the gravity cannon and then you don't want to follow them because it's just death you know speaking about bad pushes look at this 45 degree angle up here oh my god i missed i missed a lot he's got a mastiff nice teammate are we good to myself i was mad and then i realized that my teammate i mean i didn't get a shot on the horizon pretty much and my teammates saved my life killing that guy so none of that stuff was mine i think there's only two of them or there are only two of them but we sort of have to push we've got two seconds on the zone we may as well get up here you've got that's a sick joke okay all right well that could have won us the gunfight especially my teammate has a mastiff hello i'm gonna stick the rest because zones coming in nice perfect it's got a heat shield humongous someone did that to me before the exact same maneuver reinforcing my evil shield like you think they've dropped down when they go around the boxes but there's a little ledge there you just go around the side and it doesn't matter how much health you've got if they're not looking at you if they're not shooting at you you could have three thousand health or you could have three health it doesn't matter it's gonna try and help your team fortunately there is a very convenient rope placement here oh look another horrendous hill on this map it does make me feel like i should never land on the south side of this map like if you land on the north you just get a hill advantage like this i mean look at it it's almost 45 degrees it's so mental and no one wants to take that gravity lift because people just sit on the other side of it i know it's a little bit too much if you ask me anytime around over here i know don't hate the player well i think the r9 is superior it's at least more satisfying let this guy go thank goodness i am fortified i would be dead careful it's doing the tree stump tactic is he turning at the nearest tree stump you can't see him he's got hammers not today trees up man 121 okay careful he's got hammers don't challenge that one please and it's a little slow sometimes but team i assume i thought that was the octane's team but there were three of them it was what's up right i knew we'd gone straight back to his death box no keep running you're looking i've only got an smg i've got zero in it as i said at the start of the game i knew it's gonna be a problem buster over there protector keeping you safe most of here get your game face going to do damage to his health oh man the thing in these situations you can crack someone think you're a big advantage but and they just pop a bat and you're even footing all of a sudden i always look to try and do at least like 20 to 30 like health damage sorry friends i need your gun that's one more kill if you do a bit of a health damage as well okay i'm trying to get fancy with it then you know that you've always got an advantage if they only pop a bat because they're not most the time they're not going to pop a phoenix key most of the time they don't have the time to puff on you know but sometimes just cracking someone can be a bit deceiving where is this last guy you've got to think he'd go for banners but we chase him up the hill oh energy he sneaked back without a scene or what oops could have been a bit of foliage okay i was going to try and deny his respawn but now give me the two times i don't know do you get here is that a crater good job teammates wonderful i love this guy what a great guy wonderful i tell you what it was wonderful that was a gg i mean the havoc's busted if you can be bothered to craft ammo i would seriously suggest using this gun whenever you find it it is so good i honestly didn't think it needed a buff 2600 damage three revives wonderful wonderful teammates you know what what more could you ask for in the game of apex legends gg is all round thank you for watching see you on the next one bye
