hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are continuing our ranked grind and this mode feels so much better this season than public games for me the game state is healthier the fights are cleaner and it's just more it's just more fun in general i know i'm only in gold at the moment and i can definitely make masters again but the games are still really fun and we will get there i will try and work on another one hour of ranked video again if you guys want one because you guys showed it so much support the last time and two because i need to speed up my ranked progression to get into the big boy leagues so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends amigos we are back at barometer got a flat line i will take that off your hands and fb20 things you love to see all right jack told me there's a guaranteed purple in the middle and i did not know that until he told me big scrap missed the shot put that one someone stole the kill who stole it i've gone the wrong way that's the problem how do i get down there i'm trying to i'm trying to get to you that was their name but without the without that first h was more of a cease which doesn't really make any sense i don't know what that means i've got the kill credit though shotgun both here level three i'll control one of these teammates phoenix get here that's way better than the small hills no don't small hill choose the phoenix i'm going to carry now stop it oh my god that is some patience from ash i don't know how you can just not use the phoenix kit just taking the sniper stuff that's all i didn't contribute to that at all now she's using it you run out of patience fair enough ignite listen it's fine we've all been there i you know what i don't want to go this way i've got no amber to kill him the prowlers have actually scared me off unbelievable i saw someone out there close good job teammate i understand right i think down here nice job my teammates got ready to do the team this shields should be that phoenix gate so close top give me a second i need shields oh we need to get out of here this is horrendous we have nothing let's relocate here please get over here basically a naked longbow and a pretty much a naked flat line i have four i can drop you some here we go okay i can drop a two in the back we go too far was going to get him so i tried to like delay and then it was going to crack him but i guess he just rolled off into the sunset i don't know where it went oh did that pull from there's no way that's that's that port won't go that far eh how many teams are here and how come it feels like throwing shoe nurse i guess it always feels like that i have a red dot this isn't fair i can't see why i have no shields this is one of the worst days i can't see that's the problem give my shield to recharge repairing damages reloading awesome darn it why is that guy the most random angle could have pushed them easy there hold on some idiot put that bangalore off down i thought i killed that big scan good job we can't stand there for me here giving my shields giving my shields a recharge packaging [Music] i'll see ya maybe i should how far is this i might get gold this is gonna be tough it's gonna be very difficult this whole game has been difficult round three closing on we need to get going any heat shields this guy have any no oh god it's hurting beautiful do not have any health they must have syringes hopefully it's got more syringes i've only got one i can give you a i've got two med kits maybe this guy that's some please oh god i was looking for heat shields too but i think we're okay yeah gold was definitely the play here that's fine i think i think i should still get him yeah he's fine he's hurting no good grief one minute ah yes good job ebay couldn't get teammates banner we were getting chased across the map yes we survived we got chasing to this storm that bad i need light the last two teams are fine we should just go we should just go mind you it's probably a long range fight if it's over this way someone's probably sat up top they are here you go teammate syringe here yeah one of the teams is a sat up top we need to sneak around like this way or something let's go this way i don't know i don't want to take the risk going in the open that much just don't shoot him let's check out this area what if these teams get pushed off the top we can't challenge them we can't challenge team up top i misspot challenge who cares we have to hope ring takes them off there if we have pathfinder uh if ash was alive we could if we got one of them weak or something but it's like one rope up there i follow what you do okay smile fast smile face are they still safe up there let's go this way forget that every spawn over there hopefully they push it yeah they're still up there the ring is this corner is safe you can tell because like look at the ring you see hold on let me go to the look at the mini map you go like here see how it starts glowing this corner stops going into a safe here we don't want them to hop down because then we'll have to have a gunfight if they know we're here maybe they won't jump down kind of thing i know it's a tricky spot we don't want to destroy one of the teams too bad we want to kind of yes easy good job man huge nice win big patience there oh maybe we won that game i was struggling with a one-time longbow for like 53 minutes horrendous horrendous endeavor good job though team we played that really well it's a shame we couldn't get ash back nice well i had 14 kills when when did i get 14 kills i didn't even look at my kill counter how many kills do i get at the end if you ask me how many kills i'd finished that game i'd have maybe said eight
