test test test test test test i am here how do i get to the packs i got 24 event packs all right so if you're watching this on vod uh bear with me a second you might have to skip a little bit ahead because i haven't streamed on youtube in about 18 months it's still saying private easy actually private because i swear i changed it to public am i talking to myself we'll find out soon we'll see if anyone joins oh someone's liked it so that probably means that someone's here because i didn't like it hey it says we're live i mean william you're the first one here mate why did you say private i don't understand i understand what happened i haven't streamed in like the longest time so if you are watching this on vod on demand on my channel you might want to skip ahead like two or three minutes because we're about to open up all of the event packs we're gonna get ourselves the valkyrie heirloom no it's not all right there's a there's a bunch of people here there's a lot of people here look at this it's the gang are the audio levels okay can you hear me okay next to the apex uh music it's very difficult for me to judge it from my end it's kind of tough there's 19 of us on mine it says there are 451 concurrent viewers already like i don't know how that's happened i've been live for about eight seconds did he have the right thumbnail because the thumbnail i was using on my private streams and i was testing was like a season eight thumbnail i assume it's got the right thumbnail otherwise someone would have come and said how you idiot you got the wrong thumbnail you know hello everyone hello hello hello welcome to my youtube stream yes you're good you good audio is great ah i mean that is what i like to hear i've already i've pre-purchased the packs look i have 24 packs but don't worry because that's the pack so i've got 378 regular but i'm not going to open those don't worry i'll i'm going to okay today's video this stream the reason i'm doing this stream and i never usually stream is because uh tomorrow i go away on holiday and i've got so many things to do i've got a lot i've got a lot of things to do i've got a pack i've still got one video to edit i've got a travel game tomorrow so i thought for this update what i'm going to do is i'm going to stream i'm not going to have to worry about editing making another thumbnail for this uh because after you stream it just goes on to your channel then people can just watch it from there and i thought that would be easier so that's what we're doing today jake with the five dollars hey rich i love your stuff i just had to get out of a five-year relationship and i just really need some positive vibes any advice possible jake first of all thank you so much for the the five dollars i am very sorry to hear that i've advice i've never i've never had to go through that personally but time time heals all the wounds my friend you'll be fine you'll look back at this you'll be you'll be good don't worry open the reggaetons too there's no way i'm gonna open 378 packs on stream like if the holiday is the worst i mean it can be alright so is this was that an event pack i think it was so i got this skydiving equipped if you don't know how the event packs work the middle one is always the event skin skydiving mode whatever the middle one is is from the event the other two can be random anything it can be any kind of skin when you edit your own videos i do everything no one else is involved in in my creative process no it's not a pay-to-win peacekeeper skin a scand however whenever i do these openings i always equip the middle one because i've just bought it you know it's all made as well snap tracker hey listen we got into the good stuff already there we go whoa is that new wait is that part of the why is it on the lip wait i'm confused let me have a look hold on hold on everyone everyone chill out where do i even get to the event i can't i don't know what's going on no not that the actual event thing here we go why was that on the left they've messed it up usually it's in the middle and now i don't know what's going to be part of the pack what isn't part of the pack so those skins did look very cool though i must admit all right md just donated nine pounds and didn't even say anything slammed it on the table that's gonna be new thank you so much for the nine pounds md equip that to the wheel he's boxing whatever that is isn't your birthday soon my birthday was on sunday i just had my birthday that is a beautiful hemlock skin what the iron sight's like not too shabby look you've always got to look for the iron sights i mean i'll use it either way but sometimes you get two from the event in a pack is that true michael i never knew that i never knew i thought you were guaranteed one only one yes that's new skin it does look cooler oh here we go good grief that's actually a really cool skin chrome dome it's like an icy icy chrome kind of deal i mean i need i hopefully there's a havoc skin in this event because my havoc is gonna move he's absolutely like bottom five skins in the entire game happy birthday thanks guys i mean it's a few days ago but thank you so proud of skin always got equipped ones from the event how old are you you don't know i'm 28 which is unbelievable who's this guy that's not a new skin is it oh it's the oh it's an emote it's gonna say that's the skin i've already got it's a pretty cool thing i guess is this party event too i can't even equip it here what are you talking about i think is the update mine was like 10 gigabytes oh here we go here's the good stuff mozambique here we've got an ash skin this is this is a nice skin i must say this isn't a sponsored apex stream either by the way so if i see a skin i don't like i'll say hey that's some hot trash but i do like that one md just donated a further four sorry four pounds fifty he said lola didn't know how to type the message out so just slam the desk happy birthday and thanks for the stream good to watch it after crazy thank you thank you so much mate i do appreciate that you just got scammed you just got scammed out of uh the original i think it's nine panes look at this fuse skin animal instinct get that on there no way which is 55 i mean i i mean i don't know maybe i listen you're not supposed to know that oh wait i'm going to use this r9 scheme with that gibby skin i just got now that'll be good people are done i forgot if i even had a super chat on michael ford the five dollars you are guaranteed one but it is possible to get two from the single pack sorry it's kind of awkward me reading because it's it's really fun my monitor with this on is really far i can read i swear look at a banner frame oh sometimes you get two michael

real nice skin though this these skins are real shiny has anyone noticed that it's a common theme good rock buses for your rich if you're going to do that with your drink i'd wait uh i'd pray for you

what's next mad maggie skin i don't know if i like this one non-state actor what does what relevance does that name have to do with this she's got the spines of a stegosaurus what's that got to do with non-state is that law related or what the vault skin i mean i prefer mine it's not part of the event so i'll leave that on okay i'll just say like is this a car yeah it is okay i mean it's not

prepared should shouldn't i hold on i got this don't worry we're back i mean i'm glad i'm in the range want to show off the heirloom but also because i haven't played in in so long i'm gonna be so bad at playing today just a full warning i'm not winning a single game on stream idiot okay i don't do the uh inspect here we go this idiot there's such a good job of the animations such a good job we will be playing some games after this what time is it there it is half past six p.m oh here we go get one of the rockets on the go too another problem with the um the games today i'm getting my excuses out early i'm actually really bad at playing valkyrie like on maybe bottom 10 percent of valkyrie players in the entire world you know did i already watch that animation sorry i'll keep looking at the chat when i do it i think i've watched that one and that one it's the same and this one scenic and that one we've seen that come on give me it give me a rare one i can put it on ready and get like ten thousand karma like mirage gets his pork chop out you know make sure my controller config's the same it is we should be good give me a second i just need to warm up just gotta run around run about a little bit i don't know if anyone else does this when they're getting attachments from there you just fan let me look at what you're grabbing just spam all right let's play some games let's play some games can you show your lc settings uh i don't use alc my settings are very like nothing you know that's they're just i play five four classic response curve no dead zone and then for the optic it's everything's the same but i do play this is different so my triggers so i aim downside with like the bumpers um and i fire with the bumper so the bumpers and the triggers are switched and my melee and crouch switch and that's it and then my other settings are in steam i could play control but i don't like being locked into control i don't know what control do you use i use a scuff uh you've got to spend 500 to get the shards that's not true it's not 500 it is a lot though do you have to unbind hit your mobility oh sorry mobile from your d-pad to inspect weapon um no no you don't richie's steady hey listen i used to use steady i know today is about the element but i would love to know your tap strafe settings all right the way you tap straight for controller you have to play on pc i'm pretty sure and the way i do it i watch an ill spooky video i think it's from like a year ago um and you basically have to go into the steam custom bindings it's very difficult to say in words just go and watch an ill spooky video just just type it on youtube the gaming pasta hold on where's valkyrie yes forgot to play it i really appreciate your genuine appreciation for each of your donations received no matter how big or small there keep it thank you so much the gaming pastor i when i say pasta pasta i sound like i'm saying pasta they're pronounced the same though right i'm pretty sure they are thank you very much my friend grey fox 86 with the five dollars hi temp i've been watching you so far for a while and you both got me to play apex on controller knowledge thanks for the good content thank you so much for the donation i don't think i've if i've missed anyone donating or super chats or anything please let me know you guys choose i'm nervous i haven't streamed about 18 months i haven't played in about three years who's better your so far so far that guy's real bad it's oh it's rotated to me again i gave away the junk master to whoever it was they gave away to the other guy and then they gave it way back to me was there no sound are you the only guy that said that so i assumed i'm pretty sure that's a you only problem although he probably can't hear me i can say whatever i want about this guy he can't hear me i didn't even want to land here i was looking at chats oh god it's the worst drop of all time yeah yeah yeah get in here team i've got a phoenix getting a medkit little pk action that's not going to go down well oh this uh the car and the wingman and the crafts are on there i forgot about that i'm sorry sorry the the sound is fine for me all right perfect anyone got a sight for hemlock i'm not going under shot otherwise is there an idiot up top yes or no yes there is okay let's team up against this guy unless you're running me in which case i will shoot okay they're facing anyway don't worry about it i have no heavy heavy ammo five spear kills minimum all right i can do six i'll do six i can't have long gun fights i have 20 bullets is there oh this is huge did they have any heavy no i'm dropping down i should have stayed up top sending the payload and i'll make it there we go we're good what did he say first his keyboard didn't work or something oh hello never leave your wingman this guy had all brilliant the heavy i needed get that needs to race although someone's going to come back for the um bananas surely i'm falling down we could just revive let's just revive teammates in shambles oh buddy i'll body block don't worry how do you tap straight from controller you've got to look up an ill spooky video it's a steam custom binds no problem are you posting this video i it will go as a vod after the stream yes am i dead yes or no no i'm fine this guy probably ran off into the sunset it is incredibly useful i will say that like the tap strafing you can just be so evasive it's so good it's busted have i got anything for you guys i can't be seen any stuff i've spawned i think i heard rumors you can go into the water and like use this for spear fishing and you get the fish and then you ate it for health that's something fortnight would do have you guys played fortnite within the last year you go in that game you're fighting wildlife most of the time it's just it's just wildlife everywhere you're fighting like pigs i think there's a cow running around you can go fishing you can get attacked by a shark it's crazy oh god teammate oh we've gone down as well this is huge i don't want to use my bat look at this this guy just keeps killing us man i know the team was that their teammates oh no teammates like this pathfinder is too evasive don't go in that teammate risking it ignoring damage they climbed yourself up there is a secondary team pretty sure unless that was my team at the shine but i thought he was reviving which is live i'm i'm live we can't hear you i do not believe you ah they're all coming i've got no shields and i've got no armor lead assistance as a secondary team i'm gonna [Applause] i wish i had my theme we can here yes see i didn't fall for it and it's your bats be careful oh my god i could do more heavy i guess do you have heavy yes we are thriving please use your tactical oh don't worry i'll use it i was thinking about it but then we're inside of so much and then i like every time i use my tactical as as valk i end up just stunning myself my teammates have gone down about 12 times each but they are very patient so we're good we might need to balcom here what do we say there's no cross progression either because like um this flatline skin that i've got on it's the it's the belfast skin but it's not mine i got it from sun at the start go that way and i've got it on my playstation account but i don't have it on pc but where are we going here he said there were people that way i don't know if he was lying was he lying i mean the zone has got a mini on it do we want to be here he's the real he's the real question i don't know if there's anyone here i think i've been lied to i was just going to go cascade just go this way everyone goes to cascades heatsink is called energy look at it such a beautiful ski and the iron sights you can't take the light three times on the iron sights and the skin are so good and it's the only flatline skin with these iron sights can you expect the airline yes if i oh how do i do it i get attacked by a prowler though thank you do you like how do you like the alien i think it's actually a really cool airline a lot yeah i think it's aggressive you know makes you feel powerful so i don't like about mirage's heirloom it's not it's no aggression to it i have no meds [Music] uh bruce my previous youtube stream was uh february 2021 so you can expect a stream for me you know every year and a half i think i think is the uh the usual time frame i aim for every 18 months or something you i could know that it's lightning do you have work hey thank you my friend thank you for joining the stream today very much appreciate it yeah we should just go safe let's just go this way i don't know where anyone is raj alim is blunt force i think it's true you just back in with the bottom part you have three med kits you are correct i didn't know i had any this sucks i don't want anyone these i'll hang out this way oh scrap italian bandit out there let's let's falcao alkaline falcult can we clear this i don't know maybe we shouldn't alt how are you playing i don't know an update in that there's an update i've downloaded it they got a gold bag over here careful if there's a lifeline around that's actually kind of scary because she got buffs this patch here we go what's this oh my god oh god please i have two snipers no you gotta stop someone's got a crater charging is lifeline good now uh the changes didn't seem crazy find a farm this idiot lady khan who got farmed nice whack him yeah i'd have to say i mean did we go and fight them it's dirt nasty i love the i love the name remember to like this trick nasty you're an absolute legend thank you what a hero this man is i'm so i really want to just run down here there's not much cover on this side though and they do have a crater which is kind of intimidating i've got this tree is covered though so we're all good another team oh no no no no no i knew this was happening that's why i wanted to move from here i need to provide covering fire he's got a green skin on and he's in the tropical foliage he's invisible where is he you've got to stop getting teammate you're right behind him he broke him kill him spam hold on hold on no hold on no bam no he's gonna die sorry teammate we might die from that to be honest i saw the opportunity and i took it however they're not pushing us because [Music] is i was so close to an heirloom kill i just gotta patch myself this is their own oh they're running away this is horrendous thanks for putting this down guys i don't like this team at all like they just keep running away we've got a crab on the left there's a guy here okay i don't want to talk about that no that didn't happen [Music] please help please i mean maybe i should have just flew back you know i should have maybe just flown back and just popped a bat but i think the mirage is gonna get a little bit closer then maybe i should have tried to first of the pk it's quite possible all right time is back this is the last team are you telling me i didn't have any support there is that what you're telling me i mean i missed too many shots but i downed one and i hit the other one for at least four so if you can't capitalize off a big four damage then i don't know what you do oh this man's got no aim system playing pc good shot still maybe perhaps nice try did you operate all right i actually i'm actually pretty happy considering i haven't played in like four days that's my first game in four days i actually don't mind we have our apex champions i shouldn't have tried to thirst for the pk i should have popped a bat and my plan would have worked if he wasn't a valkyrie because my plan was to jump down and then fly back up and then pop a bat because they'd have to climb and unfortunately there's a valkyrie that chased me you know it happens did you use that that's enough did i mix i think i missed a super chat thank you jake for the ten dollars mate thank you very much very much appreciated very much appreciate it your teammate sucks no i think what happened was my mirage was sticking with the horizon so the horizon could get some loots and i think i just didn't realize that they were sticking together and i was making like a solo play i think we lost that game actually when i was the one who chased the maggie um to downer i don't think it was worth it i think i could have just stayed up top i'm probably just won just like old times dad carnick with the two canadian dollars can i get uh oh yeah yeah times three combo what do you mean what do you mean oh yeah yeah ah i mean that that was two so i'll just oh yeah yeah there you go what's the team saying who are these bad boys how kind of you to roll out the red car get ready moving up let's explore this way yes i agree thank you dead oyo what's your pc setup i can't remember the name of my processor it's like a 32 core ryzen i can't remember which one it is i've got a 30 90 64 gigabytes of the finest ram on the market no okay okay jill i wanted that sup chill please i'll go this way then you've got to leave me alone i'm marked there's nothing i can do how long does this last there we go oh yeah well you shot ha i mean i know i took like two stacks i don't think i took all of it i didn't take all of me did i i'm sure i have 40 i took two stacks uh see that he's in there i'll go this way i can try and shoot this guy in the back as he's pushing up this isn't good this lifeline is slightly annoying hello yeah i'll see you they're reviving the horizon no i've got a p20 i don't know what you want from me i'm dead oh no he's punched me okay well how much all right what'd you do i fine let's see quite a lot okay she has to do quite a lot i think that three times might have been punishing me if i took the three times off the hemlock it might have been a bit easier jay wilson love your videos bro thank you for the two dollars jay i miss one as well drex ten dollars big fan love the content keep it up thank you very much uh drex that pathfinders grappled up top collided with me mid-air and punched me out the sky i mean it was an impressive an impressive feat you gotta admit lifeline needs a buff have her hold more bats and cells um she did get a buff this season i'm not season this uh update i don't know if you're sorry um the drone heals infinitely it still lasts 20 seconds though uh the heel range is doubled which sounds amazing but you used to be able to push the drone around no i just need to get there what else was it i think her care package was reducing call name i think she needs more buffs i'm pretty

little building here portugal bro famously between spain and france i'm not sure that's true someone said manchester's red mate i'm a west brom fan i don't care what color manchester is be green don't care and also it's blue i'm gonna die oh my god oh teammate be careful you gotta be careful i got two guns i'm really bad with we're inside the next ring where's my name the problem is we can fight this team but there's gonna be another team there's gonna be another squad here this is a really bad fight this is a terrible terrible fight yeah i don't have anything mate i'm big struggling myself did we get my kill they're still down there then saw the razor running start blasting i think the mozambs actually bend the knee right i told you there's another team i didn't hear a gosham thing though i mean we just took too long to fight them i had two terrible guns uh oh i've got two more mostly torso and also zoltar clips with the two with the dollars each thank you very much what did you do before becoming a youtuber i was a student and then i did youtube straight from uni so i this is my only ever career is the evil 8 the worst gun in the game i thought the p20 and mozam are more reliable i fully agree i think the the eva is probably my my least favorite gun how's the events it's pretty cool i like the heirloom stuff any advice my 11 year old son who just stared at streaming um i mean it's cliche advice but you just gotta have fun with it if you don't find it enjoyable you'll never stick it out long enough to to turn it into anything you know so as soon as you stop having fun it's probably not worth carrying on you know maybe try the new event i'll reserve the controls back isn't it i forgot about that nice one did you study i did maths and stats your content is unmatched thanks tristax just like old times dad why are you so charming you stream more oh thanks jp i appreciate that either he's trash yes it is how many how much time per day do you spend on roblox not long not too long if i need to record a number then really like 20 minutes do you use instagram i have one uh item please i have one post from four three and a half years ago so definitely worth following keep up to date with all the stuff that i'm doing someone said also buy an expensive computer you don't need one you can stream straight from consoles to start with when i started like content creation where are we when i started content creation it took me eight hours to render a video and eight hours to upload it like it was impossible for me to upload daily i was 15 i had the worst pc in the world and the worst internet in the world but it was fun it was so fun i'm landing here i've i've got a feeling that you should have broke away maybe wouldn't be fine over the same r9 but it's okay because i went down here and i've got nothing okay well we are screwed i don't have a gun i got a gun i got the bullet train longbow come on before someone shoots me in the back actually i should probably take that terrified of these bins oh that is a terrible idea let me know yeah i can't that like the animation of me flying up there just sucks i can't find them yeah they're reviving but then if i get up here guess what the other guy's gonna shoot me you see nice teammate that's huge this might be the biggest phoenix you've ever seen it's pretty easy for me to climb up it's less noisy less telegraphed i think the animation's probably quicker when i get up here one hey went back up top amazing i lost the high range another sad day for team temperature on hello on the way all right we won for a second i thought we were screwed but it worked out i heard someone no no all right hey we survived drop this is on but this is this is unheard of i died off drop oh maybe i did here's someone probably not from that farther they are pushing questionable decision signed up teammate unless you're afk he could have landed down here just sprinted down could he not what am i supposed to do now like i'm just screwed i don't know what he's doing i don't know why he's in it i am big scan so close that was actually kind of close i should have probably flown maybe i should have went with teammate because she's a watson but to be honest we would have survived that if the newcastle didn't land in front of all three of them and i shouldn't have tried to stay and help him that's my mistake it's okay though it happens maybe he spotted a gun that he wanted i don't know project 69 with the five dollars much love since modern wolf f3 thank you so much me migo uh the sean 701 with the five dollars i wish i played apex like you thank you so much for the five dollars to sean i have died off drop six games in a row maybe seven it could it could have been seven but thank you so much for the five dollars we're having fun with it that's all it counts shariq mahmood you are my fave almost stopped playing apex then started watching yours and surface videos here with the good work brother love from canada with the seven canadian dollars thank you so much mimigo uh crafter line mag you know what if i crafted a light mag instead of respawning we probably would have been fine because i think i could have one clipped the path you know i think could have been fine there bye brixand thank you for chanting today i think you've been here from the start i appreciate you uh i appreciate you coming over here maybe some arena gamepl this is the game it's bruce fully gracious that's he's brutal i prefer stats to um i thought stats was more more fun i thought stats was easier than the maths part to be honest what's going on okay we've split up is this crypto an absolute demon i don't know possibly oh god please let me get one of these please let me get one of these don't worry it's just one of the boys that's the problem no i tried to thirst him i gotta leave because the crypto is across the map i mean i'm i'm happy i killed that bangalore she was bouncing she was super gliding and she was capturing i mean it sucks because there's a lot of people there if the crypto came with us that would have been a lot of fun it's the hardest course in uni what stats is arthur on the ground yes daniel the new crafter is wingman and car so the arthur one and the uh what was the gun that was in there is it the rampage they're on the ground now actually like the sentinel isn't the best gun in the game but for some reason dropping on one is actually really fun like an iron sight sentinel at the start even people for like 70. it's amazing all right i'm done eating so time to play some myself gigi's me migo remember to like the stream y'all it's dirt nasty back at it again the donation 7.77 good luck on the games i hope you have better games than i have been having why'd you have a watson pack oh it's absolutely no idea i really couldn't i really couldn't tell you what are you drinking right now water [Music] i'll take it from here where am i taking us hello doctor let's make a varsity play for the deck okay hell yeah how can i make videos from xbox uh i've got no experience of that myself but there should be a way to upload videos directly from xbox there should be some youtube tutorials how is the heirloom a lot of a lot of fun i like it i think it's really good hello from phoenix isn't phoenix but it's like 800 degrees in phoenix right now like living in an oven am i wrong phoenix arizona shotgun bolt here level two later champion i don't think so we've got to run back we gotta get back over the other way gotta get over here here we go this is where i've been going wrong kevin you haven't been using this before uh wish i kept the frown now but it's all the way back there nothing i can do perfect here we go spitfire here i left uh supplied me nothing but who cares yeah arizona that place is a tornado what's it called volcano let's go have a scrap big fan from brazil thank you so much giovanni up on the other one all of valkyrie's here i'm just delaying my team they were up top i hit all three with the need well i think they all are switched so we're kind of screwed don't die no got a pk okay i should know i didn't mean to jump i didn't mean to divulge it like that i might be able to kill this guy teammation went up top by himself but then again i've got double picked by two players on console with point six amc's this is always gonna be tough nice try guys that sucks man if i didn't jump i probably could have downed the path but it would have made a difference look at you all live look at me go alec look at me go i'm dying off drop every game every single game it's impossible i don't even feel like i'm playing that bad you know it happens though that's the apex life hello kg the good news is we've had valkyrie every single game so there you go speed isn't life it just makes life go faster well kellen kind of sucks do you think i actually kind of like i will it both to guide us i haven't found my limit this guy's playing by himself what's this god saying why i get timed out no one's time jack i don't think i can see you got imperial force where you taking us this is the game this is it right here big big two-kill win from me here big two kills would love to see you play fifa for my first time donating it's weird oh sure that's the second time you donated someone oh there's a team here oh god i uh i haven't played favorite ages but i thought if i was ever gonna stream on twitch i'd love to um play fifa's like a secondary game just for a laugh i feel like it would be so funny quick let me get the bat uh you need that that's fair enough i missed oh no i want it to stop i was going to punch him i was so focused on trying to get just the right amount of damage to punch him and i fired a tiny too much i wanted to hit him with the with the heirloom did you change your news now on apex uh yeah i play on steam so you can just change it in steam recharging one team's over that way there's no way i can reach i can't cancel this it's impossible hold on there you i love it you mean to open the door but it's fine because the revenant drops though don't like these site oh god where did the revenue go here we go i've been standing here for a long time let me down i tried good job okay where's he the pink this is the longest i've survived since my first game this is monumental absolutely monumental hey i'm good i mean i'm not i have four cells but whatever i like pushing limits as much as the next guy good val cult maybe i don't know i might say that taylor bellavia nine we're sorry with the ten dollar donation thank you so much taylor let's see that trigger finger is wingman time only the trigger thing for the wingman i can't craft a wingman i can't change the r9 when you open packs that makes a lot of sense yeah it doesn't look good i've never been good with the ring ones there wasn't a crafter there okay that's good that's good i wondered because i don't have a light mag there's one in the crafter there you go tremendous oh it's the frost one isn't it yeah i remember now please please recharging shields that's not us is it was that that way is that you guys there's another team here this is only gonna be purple armor i'll tell me i'll take it you crafted a wingman don't break me please please please are they getting griefed my teammates have left me i only have long range and these guys have wingmen i'm gonna have to get closer what are we doing here team i was standing over there you didn't want to go that way such a bad map it's sometimes it's fun that's a thing like sometimes it's annoying if you can't if you can't find the people to shoot there's a lot of people left in this particular game i have no idea where this team went get him nice i knew it was repeating i was only two of them that's probably why they were running away and stuff oh no i should have arms reached it's my last bat i need to stop jumping nice job teammate what a demon my teammates are using um spitfires and they are absolutely pepping people and i love it i'll be back they can't see me i'm in the shrubbery okay they've locked to say there's nothing we can do okay that sounds like a fun time okay here they're not gonna push you that recharging shield we do have to go look at valkyr to over this and then ahead of them we could do i want to do my teammates are doing whatever they want to do i'm going to follow it get a punch kill mate i've been trying theo i've tried a few times and i've died because of it but i'm gonna i'm gonna stick with it we can scan this area do you guys want a vowel cult yes or no level three let's scope this quadrant down here my friend i will read the message right after this oh god please accuracy this game has been uh questionable it's been pretty bad take it take it take it take it take it see what happens they're not gonna take it are they oh they took it the last one go i thought i heard of rampart sheila spinning up but evidently it was all in my head i'm running out of energy as well i wanted to switch i'm going to switch to this so much so much white bullets look at this it's 500 enough yes or no i don't know if it is wait was that the that wasn't a causing team though right what happened to the quarter team two of the squads left we have a chance of winning a game it could happen it could happen pretty sure i'm getting carried by my team this game i'll be honest with you no idea with these i mean i think one of the teams might be the caustic team that was trying to keep us over there that could have been them oh here they are this is terrible this is bad i'm so bad this is so awkward i can't find this stupid hill nice shots man my teammates are definitely carrying this game i'm running around like a headless chicken on the right is a different team or is it just someone to come over this way hey you guys rush that i've sent my valve to way too far nice in this game oh that is not good i need to stop top maybe winds up no charging on my shields oh oh my god seconds i think the other team might have respawned i have no bat i need to loot quick that's all the same team the other team probably respawned give me this give me this you need to heal teammates wings out careful blue turn that other team might have really spawned i don't know i'm gonna respawn over here this is safe right yeah it's safe that's gonna stick it there's a lobe of running around somewhere i don't know if she got banners and respawned i don't know i have one bat stop right there oh my god don't give me that i'm not taking that crater no way sense for um i'll try to take that then you can sit back oh they did respawn i mean they're kind of trapped over there i think let me see let's scope this quadrant down here that why isn't the ping on the ground craven octane you got to get them i've only got one bat as well so it's kind of tough i don't waste too many bullets ultra finder i should have i should have there's a lot of loot that way too but it's gonna be in the zone in a second yeah i think i should have flown i haven't used a single orb this game no i use oh nice any chance i can get an angle bloodhound i focus the bluetooth that's not good we've got to try and fire him get this guy there you oh father go me sight let me fly jungle sucks just trying to get him off there hey yeah yeah yeah i genuinely don't feel like i've played that well that game to be honest but with one and i think i did like 2700 damage so i'll take it that's a gg my book [Music] i know i miss a lot of donations there i apologize but i was listening i was in the moment 2600 damage teammate look my teammates were popping off they were actually doing so well two rise one respawn yes nice i didn't i didn't get any of the heirloom though there's no heirloom kills but i'm happy with the win oh i missed donations apologies which ones are i got taylor uh george robertson love the videos that stands me every day i see you have managed to find more content producing this game it's listen george it's tough also can i get an answer on a postcard for old time's sake george thank you so much for the 20 pound donation man you don't have to do that thank you so much dmtlk with the 20 mx mx is mexico right ola rich i'm scared to say this in spanish it could be rude but it says tacos at the end so i'm assuming it's about tacos thank you so much for the donation my friend i really do appreciate that and then we got a darren nakamura with the two dollars donation for the full team right thanks darren thank you guys hey that's there we go okay you survived the early game change the r9 skin i'm going to keep it the same hey i got a 12 kill win what's this guy doing you got 13 or above come on am i not the look at all the champion suits wait where's the new place oh there's a new place i forgot no the new place is over there all right are we going underneath i don't care if i'd get zero damage for the rest of the stream now because i i wouldn't i'll let you guys grab that i'm gonna eat off the edge like this i'm not playing valk i'm playing watson why mom watson is someone else valk yeah we got another valk okay that's no man be honest don't always play that my bad apologies i mean the highest of highs you know from winning the game to uh the low suppose thank you very much won't happen again oh we're playing multiple playing watson we're playing electric fence lady all right we've got a second chance here we can redeem ourselves i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming this that could be friendly gas and they took that road someone said don't say throne because you didn't get your mane where are these people are we just doing uh i'm dancing over this way get out of here call stick that charge of rampage i love it reloading when's the gun look over here oh this isn't the place i thought it was where the heck is the door i can't get in this is the worst day of my life i've done 17 damage there we go huge absolutely nothing i could do that i will stabilize it but i don't deserve it why did the guy take it i did 100 damage and i fell off the map oh come on oh thank goodness this is his dry land i thought i jumped off the map again take the bow you don't want to see me use the bow check trust me outside the ring would be pointless just fire those missiles into the crowd what the heck where are these people i'm scared we are not alone look over here yeah face back plays david get in the team oh god this isn't why online with you the team is getting trying does anyone know what's happening [Applause] leave me alone no no that was such a stupid game i didn't have extending mags for my guns okay i could have killed the lifeline and i probably could have killed that right there at the end if i had an extended line there were there were three teams shooting at us when did the stream start i started streaming um one hour and 38 minutes ago good grief i am i don't know if you saw when i was in the smoke i tried to put a fence down if i managed to get that fence down it actually would have stunned all of them because no one in that smoke knew what was happening i was shooting the ground trying to find the lifeline revive you know i was such a disaster wanna fly i make a great wingman that was fun though it was a disaster but it was still fun where are you going for holiday i am going to grace excellent time to destroy more opponents should have taken the bomb trey i i would have got a 20 bomb with that bow i think he might be right oh here we go it's the gang takeover i'm gonna try and land there cameron my previous teammate my previous drum master didn't want to land there no no come on i know it's far away i think you might be right jeeves i feel that you are completely correct i didn't get that i want it oh my god flatline here extended heavy mag a minimum of eight teams wait i want my purple back oh that guy's purple please jump down please come down please someone jump down this guy's one i really shouldn't have dropped i shouldn't have dropped but i wanted the purple i got greedy uh because it should be somewhat weak just just shoot them get the barrel out of there i got so greedy a lot of coffee i can't believe i'm standing still thank you a lot of cough a lot of splits running around here six three two at least now enough to use this any med kits they're instant reviving i got so greedy i really shouldn't have to pretty much had no shield against the guy that takes 15 reduced damage he was never going to work out sorry amigo that kind of sucks so bad it's just you see me but i've got faith done leave i knew he's gonna leave i knew he was out of there oh my god just about i haven't pointed that guy twice gosh darn octane man come on all for purple i know i really wanted it though any heavy wings out backpack here level two rings close and it's a good thing i only have 30 seconds left thank you so much trs i appreciate that we just falcon let's just go and fight someone we're down to teammate who cares unfortunate timing uh estates might be poppin let's go this way yeah yeah yeah we are on the same zip wavelength i am i want to fire this guy from here i don't really have that many bullets how dare you stop it stop it let's look that i think it seems they know too and we got a team behind us remember there's not me anything here it's not heavy yeah just get stuck on that man yeah just tank four missiles because i stuck on this wooden thing i'm getting stuck on everything two teams on me oh gosh on the back although i did miss too many shots i didn't miss way too many shots way too many shots i didn't get shot in the back for the bow the bow guy oh what i played the entire game so bad i was playing so bad that game it's okay though who cares i got a dollar from justice piazz thank you so much i've got 25 qar i'm not sure what that is but i appreciate it and from hk he did it twice thank you so much hk and then i also got uh ten dollars from a lathan goatee plum you and jags and so far inspired me to play fx thanks for the wonderful concert thanks so much mate uh did we die no this guy's still going i think he i think he might be dead hang on okay he's pulling up he's pulling up a fight he's put up a good fight another arm switch perhaps that is so lucky that's right if we had an octane teammate still in the game perhaps we could have done something he's rich is it a smurf account no i don't i don't use smurfs i don't use smurf against i when did i start playing on pc this is when i used to play mouse and keyboard back here 2.9 3.3 was it season seven i started playing i think this is when i started playing on pc mainly season seven i'm such a bad valkyrie good grief every time i use my ability i stun myself i can't fly properly i wish i was playing path these rare live streams are precious i appreciate your content rich thanks so much and keep it up thank you so much jim i appreciate that do you like def leppard um i don't know many of their songs i've heard of him of course but i don't know uh i couldn't name any of their songs you know if you need it i can get it anything for my family arena i can't play a ring i'm afraid i was banned off a marina for being too good i said we need to let someone else be number one so they banned me got me out of there try lifeline i could do the hunters have sent which just want to let you know that i like valve i i do like valk she's a an exceptionally good legend but i feel like i'm bad with valkyrie you know i think i need some more practice [Music] ten dollars from hunter appreciate all the good content it's made me a better player whether i'm watching your killer plays or commenting on what not to do peace pal thanks so much for the ten dollars and also i'll read this after hooded thank you so much though give me one sec we're probably gonna die from spawn maybe not maybe not i think we might be okay i'll read it after this game now don't let me forget oh i'm so bad at the longbow i wish this was a cent enough this one underneath that just my teammates i walk into like a fall anything going on in here someone is arm switching recharging champion didn't win that dog fight they'll die you need to stream more i've actually been enjoying the stream a lot this has been a lot of fun i always get so nervous before i stream but like five minutes after i press go live it's just it's nothing you know we're just chilling out it doesn't matter we're just having a good time guys it's just so difficult i don't know if anyone else uh streams or there's any of this stuff but pressing go live is so difficult it's just daunting oh i forgot the life one thing was here yeah yeah yeah yeah here we go gotta get involved here oh the fact you fly your spear forward they're up top hello first damage are we good nice i'm gonna cease on that how's all me there is another scene behind us right so why did we all leave everybody my kill oh we should not just my kill man i'm dead my teammate killed the guy too a huge i think there might be some more people coming i don't know i wish the fault wasn't in the game that's why i missed the most i missed the vault i missed the g7 oh you can stand here teammate you'll get healed need health no kids i dropped about 84 syringes and you can stand here does that not work do you need to charge it up or something i've not been here before yeah defend up top open up the shop i probably could have punched i have no idea what i'm doing in here how do i get up top again is that the respawn nice i'm lost guys how do i get up top i have no bats this is such a cool place you're loading another bogey there are so many teams here oh my teammate disconnected oh wait there's a low brawls nice choice i have alcohol i'm going to chill here for a sec because i've got a med kit for syringes and a phoenix so we can last out lastly zone for a little bit recharging shields [Applause] come back to his low bar we might just have to valk up without uh another i have a level one extended sucks who's gay keeping us here i can't stand on this just debate i think we just foul colts i don't know how to get it to charge up and now that the zone's there i doubt you could just stand in the zone oh my god there's a team right here it's about the same idea they are sat behind rampart shields would you consider being an apex coach i'm not good enough to be a coach you could just go to someone who is bad you know hold on there are two people stop there what are they doing thanks amigo thanks a bunch oh my god okay huh oh my god i'm dead it was the same team it's a shame the um the bangalore went down there we could have easily killed that team i shouldn't have stuck the race i shouldn't have took the race they were just waiting for us how long would this team just sat there with the shields man a darn it i tell you what though find out that lifeline place was really fun that was really fun uh someone said stop telling rich what to do i think that was um yeah it was gcb my mod thank you so much i don't know what people wanted me to do there was i missing something should i have pressed the button what should i have been doing oh yeah i forgot hooded dude let's go over chicken i really play apex anymore

little bubble action bubble big bubble nice oh god i should have kept my blue armor just now i should get the blue armor as long as he doesn't use the um the respawn but fine he's only slightly annoying don't worry about it reloading one sec using my phoenix kid shut the door not doing too bad we're doing i think which kind of sucks honestly if you put on the edge we could like peek over at the same time where's where's the spot where's the squad where's the squad i've got a gym i'm gonna be honest i thought all three of us were still up there like i was expecting some some help i should have just backed up i think i had 1500 damage dammit i played that's so bad if i knew we'd backed up i wouldn't have stuck there i wouldn't have stuck there we could easily kill that team so close man that's right that's right someone said rich do you know candice you're gonna get me with that one you're gonna get me with that one nev i've never seen that one before that was a fun game though we still did a lot of damage who cares thank you so much k7 jill i mean usually i'd stream for two hours on you oh like when i do these youtube trains but i'm having a lot of fun here i'm not gonna be on

pretty much full health i'm scared yeah i'm coming in for a flank all right we're still alive i wasn't expecting to get a second chance in this game but here we are chase had the teammate my level 8 absolutely carry me which who wins the world cup absolutely not england not england i'm afraid i'm afraid guys breaking news it is not coming home i just no i just got word but it's not coming home this year which is a shame incoming care package hello this is my box i remember this that was a good time peacekeeper here i hate no bolts it sucks without a bolt it sucks what's the tree why is the tree so loud which photos go this way honestly r301 i here of wanted some loot sorry oh greedy i'm going to push from this angle i was looking at chat this is your guy's fault i can't believe you've done this oh my god we're screwed i'm actually gonna go down here if i can such an awful place yeah here comes the horizon i am dead yeah i mean my loot kind of sucked and they were all shooting at the same time so it was kind of tough that high ground there is fake it's such a bait it's such a bait of high ground there's there's no cover up there and if you peek over you can't shoot through those railings easily so you have to like fall commit it it's it's so tough that area i didn't want to run away because i didn't have many um healables i had no bats left and in prolonged fights if you don't have any bats it's better just to commit to a fight but unfortunately they do sound good me you know it happens rich do you watch anime if you do which one is your favorite okay i've watched one anime i watched uh the one where they're stuck inside that game what's it called let's look inside the game i think it's called uh now what's it called i can't remember the name of it you probably know it though it's very it's very mainstream it was good though i've tried to watch other ones but i can't get into the it's the voice acting they go to mental with the voice acting in anime everything's everything's so dramatic and it's kind of annoying do you still mention danny murphy absolutely no danny mills danny mills because i can't be playing too long how about we play we'll have our last game well we'll play like two or three more maximum nothing depending on how long this game is if we win this game we'll end it on high sword art that's the one that's the only one i watched jumanji jumanji yeah i haven't i haven't played any unicorns because i'm the best played watched i mean you found me so far i'd rather not say lucky just in case in case we get i've been to lifeline's place like once it sucks let's land at this building a nice chill drop any guns need a weapon i'm in need of a weapon i mean he counts but he doesn't at the same time this will be i have about 18 throw balls this guy is he sat on the stairs he wasn't moving he's just sat there i still did a good amount of damage to be honest considering the circumstances this guy he sat on the stairs because he heard two footsteps insta race get the insta race on the go yeah first big first angle nice shots good job good job well played is grease on vacation how you fit in a plane what do you mean by that louis what lucy what do you mean by that is it because i'm just such a unit because that's that's actually kind of true all right all right i'm going to see forward now if i die to another stair camper the stream's over there's no more stream oh god oh no all right nice try well per person that person i can't believe that man i actually had decent i actually had decent loot i'm annoying aren't you a giant i'm i'm six too like i'm not a giant i'm only i'm 62. it's fine i thought you got me confused with someone else you know he's built like slenderman now i've put weight on android i am i used to be i'm 62 and i used to be like 123 pounds for the longest time at six two but now i'm like i peaked at like 164 i'm back down to like 161-ish because i was ill for like two weeks but i'm starting to pick it back up again so not too bad like i'm still i'm still skinny but we're getting there i'm no longer slender man you know i'm a little bit better than that now matthew jackson donate two dollars you rock are you lds i feel like that's a bait it doesn't if that's a bait that doesn't count because i said it was a base ldf what could that mean uh we are uh in the fight for our lives this is mine this is mine this is mine i'm leaving the hemlock oh i took both of them i'm so sorry hello yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry teammate i didn't mean to steal oh he's got stuff i don't feel too bad we're good wings i think we should go this way all right i'm going to go that way it's going to stick with him i'd rather go up top because then if you win the gunfight up top you've got high ground like if you go this way yeah then you get shot from up top you know what i mean like i thought we should have just went that way we should just went either way but it's i mean it's whatever there's so many people here anyway let me in we've got a challenge nice no i don't want this confirmed splash on whole squad i thought back it up back it up terry back it up terry they do be coming this way hey that helps anyone aim for about 300. nice teammates oh this is a terrible time to do that sorry sorry recharging shields we're doing decent oh okay we're not doing decent we are not doing decent it how is she not dead fuse you've got to be whacking this guy a fuse you've got to be you got to be you've got to be shooting this man but it's okay because it's a it's a random it's it's a load of three sets playing it's a load of three stacks they've got all matching names a lot of matching names going on it's really cute bless them they've gone to discord they said guys it'll be sick if we have some matching clan tags or matching game attacks it'll be intimidating to our opponents they won't know what to do and i'll tell you why it works because we died to him so it's a fair play come on man like he was popping off as well that was fun really well we did well however what i will say is we we should have went up top to begin with all right last game here last game last one this has actually been such a fun stream such a fun stream all right let's see what people were saying all right hold on hold on matthew jackson said that thank you matthew jackson wrote that out for us

didn't miss a single bullet i was doing decent damage to this man and he's just what me in the head look at this uh yeah blue and i had white though i think that that's true so maybe that was the
