hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are here to buy kryptos heirloom and i challenge you to name a better heirloom in the comment section because it's an impossible challenge this is the new greatest heirloom in the game it's a sword it's incredible i absolutely love it it's a bit of a shame it's our legend that i almost never play but maybe now that i have this i will want to play crypto more because it's unbelievable and whenever there is a new heirloom i always try my best to use it to kill the last guy so we do have a bit of a fist fight at the end so well worth sticking around for so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends stick with me stick with me okay stick with me oh i already don't like this stick with me already not a fan ah we got this i think someone's lying to me with this by the way i'm like on this main part some good stuff here look i'm going to left a little bit all right i'm going to fight him adding an extra pair of eyes a mirror look at that we know where he is nearly cracked on blue now he is he switched to another blue you hear that oh yeah let me get this collated uh well i didn't know he's gonna be popping off extended line level two should you grab that helmet don't care neither round one oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that gold one's got white cracked oh my just watching they're just taking in the show i don't know if they were i don't know if they were taking their sights i feel bad but i gotta get out of here wait i should probably take oh i just left behind a purple shotgun volte oh there's one of that poi yeah yeah i mean you gotta go back that way i like this spot to be honest with you i just never land here yeah that's kind of weird the new kill leader destroys kill the other team okay oh my god i need to jump off the map oh really i don't know this area at all i don't know about mastiff if that helps i can told you i think i've got 175 damage on my office which is actually kind of clean that's kind of big and this guy had had my uh purple shotgun ball as well had three phoenix kids if you want that one they killed the other team i guess they did i mean i got a few kills from that i got three oh nice signaling my drone should we take this yeah take the thing pick the thing okay it's a little it's a little scary i've never taken before oh my god oh no it's it's going that way that's kind of sketchy oh let's stop in this car let's hop in the whip do you have any i have two bats we're good i love these things i have none but it's fine getting my eyes in the sky was that without you yeah it didn't leave me behind it oh can you use it yeah yeah i'm trying to get some nice b-roll shots oh okay let's go let's go oh my god oh my god look at this yeah look at this are you too fast you better be it kicks me out my drone if we get shot don't worry keep up this is sensational you're too fast man cruising we're just going for a cruise put the car on top of the drone and i'll lift you up oh it's kind of working no okay this is i'm recording my drone hold on i'll tell you if there's anyone nearby no yes one one team i mean where are you going jumping out i'm getting hit i'll leave this here status report status update they're still behind the rock ones need the water wheel you ready pad's ready yeah yeah yeah they're running back they're running away okay i'll get a good shot go go go go go go lucky what the heck is going on well you're live just run away one's right here kind of unlucky is he trying first uh yeah they are they it's fine i'm like one hp so just play alive there's no way i'll get you right no let me know if i should come back actually i'll come back i'll come back and come eat the strawberries for some nutritional value that's advice you probably could oh yeah you're if there's my beating the peppers the lemons the bananas they kill them like right here i see him i see him okay right behind this i see one of them they're upside down 86 in the copter speaking 20 players game loads as well getting an angle on the right did he crack that guy she's gone guy it's just that race wherever she went she fazed this way oh my god that was close where did they even come from i don't know i'm in the zone the edge of the zone is here so i heard a load of braces i was like did i just down the low back i slowed down myself i was confused yeah i was another squadron a lot of squadrons involved yeah yeah let's jump on one of them i didn't kill him i think he left did they both just leave uh well she got she got thirsted i already downed her oh okay okay so yeah oh that figures this is like storm point has the potential to be like so good for pubs because i had like no damage going into top 14 and now i've got like two thousand yeah i feel like that happens a lot of store important it happens all the time the end game can be really fun yeah oh i'm gonna go down oh i maybe could have made it out without using that all right two squadrons left should we take this i'm absolutely named if we die i'm still blowing it this is one that always messes me up i never make it like if i don't okay i'm ready this time i don't know all right oh they opened a care pack and they did not take this purple oh that means they've got at least purple at least i need to stop being peeing myself i saw someone no you got pat i do i think okay just don't even pee yourself i'll i'll try what i could do is put the put my drone at the top of the building right here give me a second come on come on care package coming in hey she can see me i'm i'm screwed i'm screwed up was it horizon yeah yeah perfect that did not work i'm dude it's so hard to use this legend switching to drone view i'm distracting him you can't block a door with that that's so crazy i really don't want to use my last bat i only have one more battery yeah i have 19 cells though no i mean like weren't they i didn't know if they were fine at you or not there it didn't look like it yeah they're still in that same as well they're all they're not going to move trust me charging on my shields my charge better run out get rid of their door i hate your dog they haven't been able to lose [Music] quick where's the last team these guys are loving this they're both just holding their bullets i could open i could sneak around with my drone and open that door you have a termite yes crank it and then push push the door and just fire through it which one no no dude they ran they have no shields you just swapped to a blue armor yeah on the bloodhound dude do them blow it up dirty no no no no no nice they switched that so they could switch back just to die because i've empty where on earth is this last team all right i've got an idea i'm gonna escape what a mess yeah find them fine and find them here we go here we go scouting scouting operation operations operation find the last guy wait where was that this is going to drop him out i was going to draw him out i saw him but i didn't see him he made that noise like i could
