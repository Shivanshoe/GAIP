hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be using the three times flat line today but i'll leave it in single fire mode now there's something i need to clear the air about here so so far and i joke consistently about owning strike packs which are these little cheating devices you can use to rapid fire weapons on fps games amongst other things these are just jokes i've been making fps videos for 11 years on youtube and my trigger finger has been good the entire time i get these comments a lot saying that i use one so i thought i would just say that actually no i do not my friend you are wrong and maybe i can make another hand cam video soonish it's been it's been a while it's been over a year since i've made one but anyway i've got two videos for you today or sorry two games in one video and i hope you enjoy them both if you're new here to the channel please be sure to subscribe to help me reach my goal of one million subs and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends if you're just like playing for fun yeah yeah yeah i'm using the flatliner three times and i have to use a single fire leader okay oh it's because i've been winning so much this game like today very understandable are you actually going to challenge that i'm going to say hello oh my god are you up top yeah i'm staying fight it up kill him i'm big chilling there's more a last one down boom boom that the horizon tactical is perfect it just launched me i wondered how you got up there that's why i was like are you up top like what's that so unfortunate i i i saw like two dudes fighting i thought it was 1v1 and i turned the corner there's a full team that could not kill one guy he just rocked a blight yeah and then i turned into the one guy what games could i beat you um i'm pretty sure i'm better than you at four guys i mean anything where there's not a gun you'll beat me except for honor i'm gonna beat you on that eventually i don't know we don't have guns in england so when you're like six they teach you how to sing a sword they teach you how to like dole and stuff yeah yeah you actually have to do that wait till it needs this if you if you have a if you have if you get into a fight with somebody do you have to like slap him with a with a glove yeah yeah that's the respectful way to do it okay that's they actually do that over there right yeah all right what did you have there is that not common practice i don't know what people do here if you were just mean they would just like suplex you over there yeah i'll just sue you yeah that's the problem that's what why i've never actually beaten anyone up you want to get in trouble i'm scared of the legal repercussions yeah how are the prisons over there are the prisons bad over there are they they they're pretty tame and i would know some of them would be bad i would like we still have bad people we have lunatics yeah yeah but like i mean the the the like the care and stuff for the prisons it's not like norway i don't know if you've seen like norwegian prisons they get like a tv but they're presented oh yeah i know what you mean okay okay okay it probably isn't that much different from like the states i would imagine right oh they're in here in the bluth my friend they in the blue where are they they're not in here oh they are in here they're all the way on the other side i'm miles away mate i'm literally going to get zero kills zero bomb coming in from your boy nice oh so close mate honestly so close to the races
