hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are back with some ranked in diamond the first game that i have for you has an amazing ending to it and the second game i actually kind of struggled now if you yourself are struggling in your ranked games it's always a great idea to watch them back and see why you had some difficulty and now that i've done that with the second game i'm pretty sure it's because of the setup that i was running which was the r301 and the vault now of course this is an amazing kit to have like there's nothing wrong with those two weapons and it's actually the setup that got me through planet rank really quickly by myself if you remember but in diamond i found that with my play style if i don't have a ranged weapon like a marksman or a sniper then i really struggle to affect the game and help my team at all diamond is just so different to planning in terms of play styles and competition but fortunately we had an amazing teammate who clutched up a number of times but i still thought it was interesting to show this in the rant journey because it wasn't just like the other games that i've had in diamond that i've shown you anyway which was us just succeeding all the time at diamond games aren't like that like of course with climbing steadily but diamond three nearly diamond two at the moment so it's not too much of a problem but diamond does give us some problems you know especially because it's just me and so far and we're running with random people it's not all plain sailing but thank you for watching i do appreciate and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i bought that album when i was like 12. that was such a good album it was great actually so good ace would feel good we still not have like we don't have anything comparable to that even nowadays i feel like they just they created a sound and they're the only ones to like kind of stick with it i didn't look where people were landing all right i just i'm getting punched over here i don't have a gunfight they're gonna come over i have a vault i cannot [Music] come here you guys are actually trash tick-tock sensation linked great name tick-tock sensation oh that's literally i was like wait what do you think you're reading something tick-tock sensation linked okay like a self-awareness now he's really curious how how how many followers he has if he's actually if it's like an ironic name i think it's a self-aware ironic name do we take this yep i'll be oh hold on in

good names if you can yeah i've got a few needs i won't have my all we gotta we gotta try and spray this team yeah i definitely they're gonna come around that right side just lovely stuff cracks crack

god i'm just holding this last second i'm holding it so last second letting him fight as much as possible oh i avoided that she needs to help heal all she can face out i guess nice job one more time no he's he's using that field he's nearly cracked behind that shield on the right that team's dead cracked both cracks broken i try him that i think i'll play it oh my god i'm nice to you i didn't head shine i don't know why i said that but he was weak so same effects yeah you lied you lied and i'm nearly through i was saying all the words unacceptable man as soon as you damage someone i just want to just want to stim over there around the corner but you're just gonna have beams like it's not possible no you do i know you do that i'm glad you i'm glad you did it you saw me go halfway i was like nope yeah i need backs though you said you need bats has it back soon do you have robots huge thank you you are coming home with me tonight the anxiety that i get every time i scan a beacon is unmatched i mean it's pretty tough get ready there's an enemy close by i have one back you know they call me i'm fine uh here give me another fire okay oh my god that charge rifles and stuff up there i'm fine that's my first one that's good okay well now you really either on that i don't know do you fight these guys i mean i hit one for 47 33 i mean 86 one nice i'm trying to put some shots into the teammate i have pad wait once all the way left just want them to come off that i'm recharging my shields fight's already taken its time there's gonna be other teams coming in once a while yeah they'll hit us too so 71 headshot one's got white up there yeah the other one has blue 45 broke one they're shooting at me i have an off three vault will you destroy these dudes yeah we're close i have no idea just get rid like just tank all of their bullets until they can't shoot anymore another team yeah yeah so kind of take this fight anymore like even if we padded up top no i say we just kind of vibe out for a little bit i can't take a level one shot i can't take a level one battle stabilized from this i have it's so sad i don't need anything around that i don't know where that other team is still up there that charge rifles they don't want to move seems probably gonna back up i can pad but they're not even that weak no no no it's not worth it [Music] down here there zero in south contact this guy just completely ran away i've never separated because the bangalore was this way check check if she's in here oh this one here just cracked i'll maybe knock him out that low bolt is honestly so huge it's so massive in this we could just i know that my field i have three cells i've got a death box around this corner though i might just go and boot it just want it dark shot death button they took all the cells is there none in the uh the lower wall i took uh some stuff i needed there's so many teams here and everybody's just kind of like split chilling should i put my pad down just so like i'm gonna put my pad down here if we need to it's there and now it's like regening you know i guess i guess you i can't shoot your bad right no you can't this is the duo right that's the duo we could honestly send this yeah we jump on top of the top floor top floor grenade okay you guys uh you guys hold over there and i'm just gonna make sure that nobody comes through this tunnel on the way a little bit of spice grenades can you watch out behind us yeah they're training they're training i'm gonna shoot this enemy out there i broke this down that one be right it's a safe zone path has creeper and he has a white armor it's waiting for the combo 66 on one of them but still still two squads oh yeah there's only one with a squad okay there's no no one can go down that's that's the thing wait how do i 4kp did we not knock the divi what is that oh my god i'll get 2kp from this though shortly way way behind this minus minus hopefully earlier he just went out of my range he just went out of my range what a dumb character needs something just be wrong with the solar rays it's a solar rate i'm pretty sure know where you're going come on let me get a kill rate wait i'm gonna die you are gonna hate shield uh that was close i was twice i think so yeah you've got once nearly cracked that's cracked i don't have any bullets is it two or is it three it's three i'm pretty sure well actually i've only seen two of them i think it's two i don't know three three oh my god of course i almost broke one of them yeah i just played your life just play live stream how many nicest he's inside he's about to rest he's resigned he popped out he popped the bat nice job dude what plays the logo oh oh my god i would have been so mad at myself if we would have lost that i'm like you've got to like we've got a peak and have a gunfight at some point so it's like it's just a risk every time though isn't it it's just how it is i think i crouched into it oh big pretty big clutch true let's do it too
