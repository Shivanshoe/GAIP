triple taker was unbelievably good you were landing headshots for 126 damage unfortunately they didn't have the headshot multiplayer on this but i'm still landing over 100 damage for a headshot on this thing it's actually so good i'm gonna start picking it up especially because you don't even need any attachments for this weapon to be viable i have two games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you so much for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh i got two two purple light mags before founding good that's pretty unbelievable and i'll take this oh my loot is sensational and my rhymes are recreational using gravel trying to find the line i don't know where it is that's my teammate you scared me wait wait wait wait wait i need the i need

have that many light bullets i'm going to be honest good job team i mean there's 16 people left before the zones even started here good grief i got a shotgun bolt if anyone needs that shotgun you need arrows why did they even record a voice line for that i've already looted that battery times there were still things i missed in there sensational all right i'm feeling this is my first game of the day i'm feeling good extended heavy man yeah yeah yeah i'm down let's go roll out gank my teammates and demons what are we talking about what we're looking like okay not bad oh my god nice quads down

another team behind them oh teammates in the absolute jeopardy here giving my shields a recharge i'm taking shots people see me this guy's a demon using my phoenix get it on the roof big roof tactic they saw me gosh darn it i broke an enemy shield setting up a zipline [Music] i'm glad i picked up the three times that's all i'm saying and i don't really have any energy careful phase we are kind of popping off any energy tremendous i need some light too we get some extra shields perfect all right i heard people firing this way i think kind of need to get involved although it sounds like a bit of a sniper fight so far uh these are the last two squadrons fighting over this way might just want a third party as fast as we can we are not alone look over here all right well i am watson so i've got no uh escape tools so i do need to be somewhat cautious they did get her down so they're probably going to play a bit more need to aggressive my shields is that mirage yes it is donnie what the heck the sort of flying squirrel took this pathfinder can't lie to the gang enemy over there yeah that's why that's why i'm intimidated [Music] they're judging my shields what happened to the lover i know i know she's dead but like did they get her banner is what i'm saying oh god it's terrifying idiot i wasn't even the sensible guy i could sit here for half an hour and get a 4k oh my god oh my god i
