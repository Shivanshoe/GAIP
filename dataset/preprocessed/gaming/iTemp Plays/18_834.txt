hey miss of course it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing the joys game-mode it was supposed to connect yesterday they must have had a few issues actually pushing it out onto the game so it came out today and this is actually going to be what I think is my first apex Legends duo's victory we did have this game-mode back in November but I was away on holiday for most of it it's unfortunate I didn't even get to play many games I don't think I want a single game there it's okay because it's back and also interesting if you're interested in a pattern of skin things they'll bring them back at two of the original Valentine's Day skins they have the plat finder banner and they also have the longbow skin in there as well so can we stand on them last year you can now pick them up have to do a few challenges on Jos game mode I think is but anyway hope you guys enjoy the video if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to the channel if you know T and I'll see you all in five more seconds me amigos or a mirage or voyage II these my friends as expected there are a fair few oh my gosh I seen more than I expected I expected a fair few I didn't expect this may I throw one right off the get-go that's your back this is a waste of bullets I've committed name it's gonna drop down see ya thanks for playing I didn't nearly click me without as well okay I've committed a lot here it's again that killed someone to the armor I have tar bullets Stephanie just gonna climb back on your toes use me as drone for some reason sounds up there fine beneath there we go there's armor I didn't even need to kill someone I had nothing to get it either gonna be drunk it seems still so you know he's out the actual drone state just follow me around on there why tell me so sorry teammate I'm so used to people just finishing the kills my apologies friend it's been very patient here she's refreshing say the least take this there is as a token of my apology thickness says I just want to fly in on it which very often is the case because this is a balloon download I've got some when he's coming back on top their bodies it's probably the critter audition but at this fly off no that's definitely a scrap can you put the scrap and hold also get this please teammates from pinned down I'm jumping down to one each what's our level to extend it might get you killed not been in level two extend it Mac I've got the level two shields done see I want to leave with this body actually our party would have let's be honest I probably would have still taken a look soon as you took my level two one if indeed I've this quite another one anyway and he had four Medicus it's a lot of med kits rockin specimen right munition that's fifteen that's decent this is my main weapon because I've still got this to be a derp charge rival here we go that's decent that takes off about two or three seconds I think it's three seconds on your pathfinders ability which is the best ability on the game shield battery up top as well apparently Arthur L won wingman combination but he's not back in some of the cooldown eleven seconds I think it's fourteen by default one of the best pieces of equipment for a pathfinder thanks I mean you're I would switch it out wait a second give me that way better I would switch out for a gaunt body shield obviously because that's just overpowered it's way too good but it don't help me decent all secondary Peter link from a cargo but alright we survived mirage boy harsh unbelievably we're here enjoy as well which is refreshing because as I saw the player chose is probably a little bee a few people to contend with easy to 1v2 than it needs to 1v3 obviously sustained numbers work talking to one be to summon up a fire head now my teammates at you pretty quite some I might take this thermite get firmer toast I don't need to for name and I'm not means it alone anyway how is that last shot connected in called a loss type and fight had I not aim for the head you push headshot multiplier but it's then it's gone I'll star careful it's a caustic okay well whilst you are Chokin on our guests I'm gonna here look at least he didn't use that beforehand because that that confront would have been far more difficult if he threw any traps or assaulted beforehand that would have been a lot harder to navigate I'm not sure I would have been out to get up top all right I'm on the search for an extended cab you make it possible and even though there are people to lose these supply pins would disappear when the train leaves south or it may not work if there's a gold finger here yes there was this is the one my team I was looting I'm not sure we had much of an opportunity and maybe he did he's gonna make it he's fine trains leaving there you go do you see that my teammate I mean it was pretty much a 1v1 because even though my team I died was let's talk two of them I was able to shoot you the one in the back at the same time so it turned into a 1v1 because a if that was a team of three are doing far more difficult is it gonna be another hand obviously isn't it yes it is that's not what the fight is is it really I miss the days of turbo charger I'm gonna come and say a gosh-darn look the turbo charger it's one of those things that I would if I found Li I definitely pick it up and just carry the rest the game and hope that I found a havoc or devotion alright we're at the edge of the Ring there's people gonna be coming that way we could just sit here for a lobby my ping wasn't it didn't mean less Rashad I feel I like it though I appreciate the aggression my eyes are still fighting this song I haven't got long left until it closes in are you sure this is a good idea teammate we're also gonna be in a storm if we do this yeah yeah I thought so too I'll make sure that's the right angle there we go it's a toilet in grapple after that as well these guys are still fighting someone bled out that means that most probably his teammate died as well so hopefully these and then wine that's all scrappy never huh it's not worth going in there if I'm ultimate I think I think I've risky but we know they have to come out this angle it's either this way or through the mountain I know she was going to be this way what if we just hide and then they come out the storm then they start healing and we jump out I think is due interested they're still fighting good grief there we go the ym clan I don't cook ooh and Ethan the only thing I'm worried about here is the fact that there is a big of the loner they could just fly over our heads with and then we are the ones been trapped in the storm for the next rotation this seems we've tactics Hey look at him you know he knows as well the dweebies tactics of all-time but they're free kills I don't just go he's down one of them that's the kill reader where's his teammate attend she's gonna come through the ball right Tenley's be careful he's not he's low on health if he gets shot a few times he's for Taylor haha this is ludicrous we've sunk so much time into this though there we go this is literally there's some time fallacy somebody's called something sunk time investment that's something like that I dunno well you've come in so much time that you don't wanna give up because you've already made 35 minutes or something isocitrate protest this isn't gonna be a fun gun fights these purple shields Gibraltar and I donated yes you'll see nine damages shots get in a storm that was one kill that that was probably what the three minutes I'd like to apologize that team because those are some dweeb tactics and also I'd like to apologize to myself because I've let myself down there one peel for three minutes what uh what a waste of time my teammates now having to old to get out of the storm watch there'd be someone waiting for us at the edge of the storm - that'll be Carmen what can we hope for devotion perhaps gold bodies your purple body she'll be nice ensemble probably because the people I've killed here I've been in a storm oh that's another level for helmet going for level three stock of any center great first of all time it would've been decent if I didn't already have one I want a devotion for his I'm going for it I guess he's he's done been sign the storm another care package like this one's gonna have a devotion and I love curry body shield it's cause I'm gonna be me too easy no it's fine oh we got intervention well this one's too good so my tactic now is literally just to five people if possible if I see someone on grappling I saw some movement this way there we go I thought ants the devotion is not good at this range though but I've got an for receiver okay 237 Zander 66 that equates to a ton of damage and I've got a devotion and I've got a dream it's alright though there's no love sorry shield there's the level four barrel stabilizer as well so now I don't have much muzzle flash on my throne one this is a beautiful setup if only I had a level four shell if this would be the most open set of a lot of people aren't biggest fans of r3o ones but um I'm a big fan here it's like a do-it-all weapon especially when you're going on Voorhis either eight seven I can carry seven around it's ludicrous - alright four spots left on the kill leader with seven kills so now I think we should do yeah there's a scrap in the distance see you guys about it I'm gonna keep the storm again one side we've always a dweeb you know st. the guys are coming this way this storm hurts - that is unloaded should i why do you go I think supply then here the witness of that fight happens come this way anyway well it's week old I'd say this is a waste of time Molly what are these supply beans oh there we go LD might be something to it this way a stiff killer it's good to try and track the game attacks it's a nice alternate it's good to track them because if we kill someone here that's not called as if you like that's not gonna miss Tarawa and they're not called active killer I'll know that there someone else down here somewhere and they both died in the storm that is two kills that we would have got swing I'm paying that I'm on nine kills right name and that's a bumpy one in terms of spots this is it Mimi goes my first ever Joyce winning my teammates actually tracking him I forgot he was but out there we go he's found him the flying devotion I thought they were gonna be closer to me I'm just terrible with the crane but I'm not doing it it's gonna do this instead screw Magoo French I know you never once but did you see how quickly Batman's face penalties [Music] that's 11 kills because we killed those two people in the storm remember champions literally didn't even see them not sure I can give myself credit for those but if we did see them all we would have needed is one shot and would have got killed credit for those skills - revives a 15 minute victory here only 1400 damage or just about but I guess what happens enjoys because people don't get revived enough like if you damage someone on this game mode you can rush them you know because there's only it's like a 2v1 in that situation usually you know they've got two people to cover them this game mode you can flame them with the devotion and your teammates there to follow up as well hopefully my first ever Joy's win I think gets a plane which when Joe is there before some habbo that one thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one
