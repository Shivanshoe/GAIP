hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now we've got a short intro here sometimes we have those days we all have those days

watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends facts factual statement from me that's exactly what is going to happen i'm landing triple beans 112 damage here i come come on give me a good gotta have it friends i'm scared to run in there because what if i don't reach my 112 damage target then i've embarrassed myself you know i can't be doing that stop it the heck i'm getting beams easy easy switch this guy's using all his ammo think about spawning him with the l-star is that the spawn with any bullets in the clip you know my name is closer charging my shields purple my the reason i ran in there to begin with a lot of damage my name is this gamer behind me when i was running the doors i wasn't gonna run in like an idiot i'm too tilted to play it happens we've all been there we've all been there amigo oh i had a phoenix kit for him oh god now i can't drop it because it's like well why don't you drop that for me three seconds ago when i needed it i'm hoping for a vault uh you know no one's using energy right he's using energy you need that back got an extended energy mag here level three thank you no problemo what's in the crafter today shotgun bolt uh i think we go this way let's explore this way i think anyone's gonna be over that side of the map i need optics for an assault rifle you trash chill come play with the boys you trash now come on rampa that is no that's no energy to have i just voice cracked you offended me that much you know that's how emotional you've got me just come chill with us come on don't ping when i already pinged oh sorry don't ping what i already pinged four well that place has seen activity i didn't like his pink location is all i'm saying i didn't like his pink location really trash i mean my both my teammates are too tilted right now i've got to try and i've got to try and keep the peace i apologize profusely praise ends too sarcastic it's like these it's lilies but it might actually anger him even more i don't know if my peace agreements will uh my peace offering even is gonna work we'll see a little bit behind i've got i've got nothing on my mlock oh whoa she got the punches oh she got the punches oh they've got to escape that's not fair i've got a naked hemlock against a scout i still don't have a site for this bad boy stabilizer here level two optics here she's gonna rob this because she absolutely hates me she despised me where is he there it is thanks i'm getting shot in the back opening fire on the air pretty sure reloading enemies okay thank you good friends come on big big no come on let's be friends let's let's be friends please we can do this no please round two please ramp up no come on brampton please come on i'm no i'm sorry okay come here please i'll take it pkr9 pk massive there you go here i see him that's gonna do much about it do that i need bella loot though maybe a shotgun boat i need a shotgun okay i have two no ball p uh shotguns i'm gonna give my best shot hello heavy i can't get in i'm gonna be honest all right i have six kills and 600 damage okay well i need that doesn't mean i can't find a level one or a level two in these boxes surely because nobody mastiff is kind of tough to use can't lie by quite tough i mean a borderline impossible for me i feel like shopkins are all about rhythm do they know when your neck shots come in the no bolt i mean all three mozam whatever it's kind of difficult to use anyway but all three main shotguns oh nice nice nice i like this idea noise i got like 200 that time i'm about to drop a 20 bomb with 2 000 damage i think thanks uh i need a bit heavy i need heavy ammo energy i'm okay heavy oh thank you my thanks uh oh she she's tweeting out death boxes countdown they might be coming over this way i like it superior to my my flatline this particular range i'm trying like there's not much i can do yeah this is pointless i'm just going to take damage oh there we go i can't reach it i can't really tell them i cracked them it's too long now they definitely popped a bat position revealed by ash i have to be that way agreed i'll see you on loot in there i need i use my ultimate they're just going to wait they're going to waste it that's the problem uh the reason i didn't want to actually play too aggressive on that team is because i thought we're gonna get third party from the other one the ones that scanned us because we were so close to them level four this guy whether these box guys really fall all the way down here over oh i should have kept that skin what am i doing my thanks replicator calming down my friend my deepest thank yous okay well i've only got 21 cells so i'm absolutely devastated anyone here yes they're taking the zip this is perfect i am dan's got over there i said i should have followed you i want this person to fly down on us it's gonna fire down and if that's the problem they crafted a i think about for me a shotgun bolt which is perfect i've switched i have switched i don't need 32 bullets it wasn't the most glorious play i made on that horizon on the left but if i didn't get rid of them you saw what they were doing already they got an angle on us and they were shooting from up top so i couldn't let them get the free high ground you know i had to take him out for the team it was a tactical play and he worked out beautifully so fast an open heart sees oh if there's another one i definitely knock down that's me a gold knockdown situation right they go you have to make it cinematic you have to make it cinematic gg real rich oh hey i'm always tabbed out at the start of games by the way i'm always just on youtube or twitch or apex on some random website that's the second time in two days that's happened what played guys oh i like the ashken part of the event i think it looks kind of sinister uh yeah i mean i stole some kills i stole some kill i didn't deserve this is a thirteen it's also why i didn't really want to shoot the last guy with the mastiff because i didn't deserve 13 let no 14 you know that would have been taking the mickey at that point gg though
