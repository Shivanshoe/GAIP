i'm pretending to be a decoy it's working so far it's working i don't know if you can see this please kill them they're so desperate are you kidding me i'm literally just walking past people wait what hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some mirage having an absolute blast i'm not doing the usual is mirage good kind of video as we've already talked about his buff in season eight this was like two weeks ago now it's old news that his decoys have footsteps now i would describe mirage as the funnest non-competitively viable character in the game you can try some goofy tactics and just see if they work and have a good time so thank you for watching guys remember to follow my twitch channel for some upcoming streams it's going to be the first link in the description and i'll see you all with some mirage gameplay in five and a half seconds my friends come up this way milanda with you right side i'm allowed on this little wedge i'm gonna land on this wooden ledge yeah yeah okay okay dude have fun richard you have fun it's almost right you have fun i don't know if you met this ledge with me oh yeah after i said i'm landing on this ledger like i'm landing on the floor did you manage to find it did you pick them online right by the way um maybe but i have a light gun so it's all right now all right enemy killed i took care of it don't worry yeah thank you you have to find in that mountain of loot i found it oh my god these people i kill it some of these things i don't need devo spitfire that's the ramp itself this is just a golf knock down chill in here no one's found it man of culture i'm gonna argue that it's better on um on octane because you can stim and you don't lose your mobility on that gold that's all you eat thanks don't mention it all right you're a big big fan i mean i have 11 cells and no bats so that's the dream i have no better than 14 cells now i have 16 cells oh my i'm going to god energy i'll let you know i think i've saw some i don't know where it is you know when you just like your brain doesn't track it level two yeah no no worries use that future future reference standards here we go i needed both those what did you do thank you what do you need that stock i didn't have a stop but it's fine it's just to stop what uh well what you picked up the stock right no no no no definitely not ah definitely not uh did you pick a three or a pick up at 301 at the beginning of the game yeah yeah okay then yeah i didn't make it yeah i don't know which ledge you spoke about you know in the world with a lot of ledges there's only one actual ledge in that hole i thought you were trying to get like up top up top there's no way you can light up not possible i thought we could stick together spawning with mozambs you know to protect each other's back anywhere i mean i do have double lmg now so i'm happy what's in the craft you know as a select fire all right not a select fire uh what is that called skull piercer a little uh oh wingman attachments this is not a very good loadout if i'm being honest oh my god let's reposition here firing oh painless knocking at the door he's one was it did he make it all the way to the back door no is this one right here oh i need a little half on the way uh you see the big scrap right yeah yeah yeah oh god two devos if i could get another turbo that would be that's so disgusting absolutely insane i need it oh my god i hate your decoys my apology families are my own teammates at this point a hundred percent i i the only reason i realized because my amos is locked on him this is a good back i'm gonna look through all these gold boxes maybe there's another turbo eyes on that factor we need a low bar i have seven bats that's too many bats i know one of these please right here turbo oh dude faster faster faster oh wait what no dude wait wait wait wait nice that's what you get what did i do no i mean like this is when i'm not playing octane you can't expect the pads to be top on fire that is oh scorpio extended i thought it was going to be a your second turbo oh no teammate gone there on the left i can't make it there that quick oh boy for me i think your raising is good i agree with you i like you i i just like hit fire stim and then just let it spin and it's is that the uh slogan yeah yeah yeah yeah just let it spin hit fire steam then let it spin spin yeah 100 um the turbocharger is the rarest item in the game oh oh hey let's check it over there got one here go ahead like a step yeah yeah somebody say 100 fighting to my death oh my god okay i actually love this is actually so much fun i still can't find one for you i know it's the rare side in the game as long as i had one that's that's fine as long as i have one why is the massive so gosh darn good oh dude it's just so broken and i'm not whoa whoa whoa did you get this you said this to some like an eagle what's that on gta like customs los santos customs look at this is it all blacked out for you oh yeah yeah yeah yeah whoa but the maps you do when you just you've just achieved your ultimate octane form they just you get custom pads wait no once you've thrown ten thousand pads you should get a gold pad gold plated pad from los santos customs you should be able to design your own i imagine i think this place needs a little more it's always risky when people when they put that in games like on black ops 2 the emblems that you would see oh yeah did you find one let's go overboard no it was a gold mag oh my god i'm never going to find one it's it's so hard i'm reversing him i'm reversing him there he goes i love controlling those it's so much fun uh respawn what you are a mess oh there's a team here there's a team here nice sir thank you you are the best the greatest i have ever seen so is that my box of top oh my god i didn't even see this dude oh gg leader right here i nearly threw the game it was so so close that was a great ending for this game what's my full name it was your dodgy pad you are the apex challenge it was on uneven ground you sent me finding my direction my pads take skill to use so you just got to step it up oh that was funny i think i may have had the portable respawn beacon i think i don't know maybe possible maybe three he may just i just don't think he liked you at all
