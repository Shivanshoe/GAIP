oh i missed i don't have bubble hail and gibraltar because i'll see it rich pick up my craver do it for me in spirit you ready dirty guys clean hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some pathfinder my old mane who hasn't had much love recently but fortunately there are some pathfinder buffs on the horizon including the removal of low profile and also a new passive now this information was seen on a recent reddit ama with an apex dev by the name of daniel clayne explaining the plans to remove low profile and also gives more details about the new spyglass passive that they've been talking about as well which would give pathfinder more of a escaped feeling for the team which is what he is supposed to be the passive would allow him to zoom in when not holding any weapons to scale to further ranges to gather info for the team uh it's a pretty cool passive which fits his intended use but i'm definitely more excited for him losing the low profile debuff this will be huge for pathfinder now if you aren't aware low profile legends take five percent more damage and their entire hit box apart from their head of course takes damage as if you would have hit them in the chest meaning there is no reduced damage for limb shots and i don't know if you've looked at pathfinder recently but this guy has a very high leg to overall body volume ratio he's like 50 percent leg mastiffs hit you for 120 every time it's tough out there as a pathfinder main let me know what you guys think about this slight buster pathfinder i think he's still in a decent spot he just needs a little bit of a nudge and removing low profile will definitely allow us to play path more and more so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends controllers i don't have the the dexterity to use more than one i honestly don't uh you just gotta get used to
