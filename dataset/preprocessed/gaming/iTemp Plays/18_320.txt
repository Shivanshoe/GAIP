hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are three stacking some ranks which should actually be the default when you're playing ranks let's be honest so the team is me so far and fixed our and we are currently on the road to diamond and beyond ranked this season is a bit of a mess at the moment because of sia but apart from that i am really enjoying it it's back on world's edge the competition this season seems higher than ever in these mid ranks the games are really fun and i'm sure you guys will enjoy the video thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends and with gold friends who are also gold on n a servers and it was just i was not uh we got we got it we yeah they're top floor oh no okay no it's it's definitely me this guy's got blue isn't this corner these times are coming though yeah okay watch it watch my head watch my hand john look at my behind today for anyone watching on my stream i'm streaming by the way oh yeah dude rest i think he's i think he's uh he's coming up inside all right and this is why i'm in safe hands what kind of weapons we we revive and work at the moment uh but the proud is getting a nerf like today i think wait this one here yeah let's move this way i think he's in the gondola 64 cracked he's gone re-45 careful oh i just missed him that he's gone guys um yeah prior is ridiculous l-style is ridiculous but then you got the classics you know you got your arthro-1 that's good still yeah down the stairs i think this way [Music] he was above this guy he's just behind us he's still up there nice yeah he's not there i can put our bounce back so we can get on the roof that's a good idea i mean desperate need of a shotgun if anyone sees one oh my goodness this guy that come from flipped me okay he's got two teammates i finally jumped down yeah we fell down all the way up thank you thank you you need that armor thank you i'll try my first fee watching the side i'm watching why is it so active here i swear we dropped like late yeah we did i think that happens to be on water third parties third parties are crazy oh where's the closest rise over here right here does no one have a shotgun vault i'm devastated wait for the gondola it's the ping and the lack of warmer all right are we on n a we're in new york yeah i'm on a i'm on a hundred but it's not it's not awful yeah how do the servers on this work like they do on uh like war zone where it's like the less players the harder the service so surely actually like around now like uk would be good no yeah you think it was yeah i know you mean because on war zone if there's fewer players they tend to be better yeah and there's less options for them right yeah but i guess they're trying to jump on us by the way okay i'm watching this later i'm gonna run back oh my god what am i doing to these people they're the ones down i just like 150 of this guy there's uh there's luffy uh here for you oh snap i'm going to the old boxes but i will come back yeah to see if it hurt me yeah 240 for a volt where are all the backpacks though i just robbed level two i'll be honest i just robbed it and then run off i mean you did all the damage so it's it's acceptable all a lot thank you you're welcome uh if you find an extra one time scoop it uh what's it for i've got like it's not a classic i gotta do the one the circle one uh what are you using i'll throw one so i can drop it easy ah don't worry i mean i'm just kind of you got a hemlock me all right the ones are really low which my left on my left i'm trying to get up top can you show that all it's in the open right it's they loved it just beneath us it's like here i don't want to get peaked i'll try this right this way all right all right i'm on the position right octane's really weak one's coming up i'll change he's going to the front door if you want some kps right here take himself nice i was trying to just chase him see the space in the kill feed yeah yeah that's right once you see that i've never seen those that's great that was him um i have six bats and also a gold armor would you guys like some bats um i have three so i need a backpack uh you've got no one has a backpack why does no one have a backpack maybe yeah maybe that box i'll be honest a great one i don't know if you can live with that okay all right i've got some stuff so for you guys what is like an apex like is it like a high kill game like with i guess i guess that's what you're going for or like what's content for you guys or like an entertaining one i guess oh for me like the standard change like before it was more about because the lobbies lasted longer so it was quite easy to average like 14 15 kills a game if you just you didn't have to go crazy for that amount of people but now it's more about like entertaining gunfights because i'll just put two games in the same video so it's not a problem yeah yeah for sure yeah yeah those high kill games don't really do anything anymore unless they're like something you know like off a brand new legend or they're like some type of world of record other than that people don't really people don't really care about those uh big games anymore that's what i found yeah my world records really pop off when i get those and then yeah you got all you got a lot of those yeah my regular like 30 kill games are just like no one cares about third kill anymore you know people are people are sick of them at this point so i played seven kilowatts instead yeah 30 kills individually yeah i've done a few of those recently over the last two days mate yeah i'm lying thing though if you're getting like 12 kills every game on average how can you find out more zone back in the day obviously now i just played with really good people it's nothing to do with the fact that i fell off at that yeah my feeling i used to drop marv's model for three if i play it again it's not because i'm bad now it's because everything else changed yeah it was just like if you got the right lobby there's already one on me oh no he drops i think he's here i fell down yeah yeah i got stuck in that exact same spot [Applause] like i fell down the mountain to heal because like i've jumped on by two people and there was a horizon ultimate on the floor that she messed up uh so far could you put your voltskin on this ball please it's very important um i you're asking a lot from me right now right what's his balls game it's like uh he bought like the tier 100 on the valpas so i'm going to make a video before he does because he hasn't managed it yet if you post that video today absolutely it's actually rendering i didn't realize they were like pay to win skins until yesterday like by is my other account rich oh my god no she'll smurf oh yeah oh get rolled get rolled oh sad now you're right though the uh the r99 like the little circle is horrendous and the wingman the fat skins on the wingman are also over oh here right here that's nearly cracked there's a guy down low just down here he's got p20 help it's cracked on the way one's got a prowler it's gonna heal i don't have all the light ammo yeah yeah there's two on the right there's a path with a p20 on the left no i can't make it are we gonna go i should i go in or not uh you can do i'm just healing i think i'm getting started i guess i'm gonna stop another team i'm coming i need to grab some ammo first i'll be there in a sec i'm just taking my time i have no shield cells but i'm coming they're uh low balls in up there i've done good damage bunch of knights you got purples you can't send that i'm i'm backing up i'm back and i have no shield cells so there's no way i don't hit that i need shield oh i got caught out i'm not there rich i'm not there i'm gonna fight it down yeah i tried to die i have no shields mate but i can try and distract for you they're reviving oh they're the other team's the other team's going up there okay okay here we can just leave i'm not desperate for a kill do you have any cells mate um here's your sauce i'm gonna climb up the uh other side okay i'm gonna pop syringe with you this is broken they just rise and defuse oh my shots are registering so late yeah oh my god 160. no look at that by the way yeah that was beautiful so what what i did there is quite a high level strat for a new um afx players what you do is you die and you get thirsted and then you watch your really good teammates and you learn from them and it's it's it's sometimes intentionally it's definitely one of the chats to one of them that's my tactic i'll be watch most of honest games that's what i do that's a item special right there i meant it that's right someone's here there more yeah there's more climbing up oh no i fell i'm i'm back i'm back i don't know what floor he's on oh god he's got the pain he's got the thing what am i doing what are you doing get some light rains i just took a level one extended energy from this that is the saddest retrieve so down bad right now what's wrong with you oh wait there's no do you have all the light levels yeah i have i have 97 spare ah that's fine i'm gonna pick up this uh eva okay i hear someone yeah ref team at the red hair loom i broke one just are they drunk horizon's cracked i need to back up i have no big heels yeah this might be another team here there's another team there's another team the horizon is really weak i'm just going to chill i'm just loving it yeah that's him over here oh i'm low on light from the uh is the black market empty oh yeah if anyone if any of them die we can just use that though they just all split i don't know why everybody just scattered yeah over here some sort of center now they're firing people over this way too yeah i'm gonna go i'm gonna go this building up here what's on my left i'll write from the topic if you wanted to use that um are you good oh they're in the inside next building that we're pushing now what happened was it bad no no no no no i said in my shot so like registering like five seconds oh it was hilarious so you're dissing my first i was like i'm pretty sure i hit most of that that yeah i keep forgetting that i'm seared i'm so bad over here we have to go this way anyways you probably have to switch after this because i got my 22rp yeah probably grappling uphill you just you can't get anywhere or resin right in front of me weirdly get it on like a rock that like slingshots you exactly i guess flush too that's all you guys there's someone on the hill above you i'm going to team another team yeah i'm going to poke back let's go finish it found me i did not see that guy oh i'm flying i'm flying yeah yeah keep it going perfect finish the kill she's cracked as well the lifeline's cracked i'm flying i'm flying over here i don't know if you see this i'm going to get to you as well oh no i'll just run this right i'm dead there's no way oh use my shield i'll distract him he's not pushing when you're down you can basically move around at walking speed yeah i've had that yeah it happened above the floor yeah oh my god there this is really moved they're just if you can drop down they can't get you yeah yeah yeah there's still that guy over the back somewhere but oh my god run away um i can't loot this guy killed over here i don't see them they they backed off now no they're still here they're here uh i have no i have nice house no bats yeah could you eat something down like three down here please yeah here you go where's the gibby oh you finished it i finished the giveaway finishing i might go get your stuff kill them 172. i just need ammo i'm blowing ammo okay nice 10 seconds come on do i head over to you yeah it's just fine coming it's just one marsh or something what are they running this way huge how's to offer my moral support this guide so many bats extra two battery here i didn't need a bit of light but i assume there's some here yeah same i'm fine now i got my problem i'm gonna change to a rampage oops that's the wrong gun i'm gonna change to wingman for reasons i haven't quite explained to myself [Laughter] you're gonna land every shot throw yourself in there sometimes yeah careful zone oh i need to giving my shields a recharge switch guns there's no light ammo exists apparently what was the thing i said the other day that was i don't think it was worthy of repeating i don't think it was hilarious if you know cause then you would remember it was like wait a minute no it's an actual person i thought it was a decoy though not the same on the right sorry that was my call uh do you still need shields i have four bats and i have uh yeah i'm just gonna shield salam now i'm gonna go oh there's any cracks here it's padding nice this other team is coming uh behind where we were all right here are guys going to res yeah where is it oh that it's a full team underneath careful nice job all right here they're in bubble i killed an enemy we're watching this other team yeah yeah kathleen see it's cracked down now i didn't manage to finish the kill it's getting devoed there's another i dropped a rampage but i'm not sure if that's nah that's not really my copy give me the uh give me the wingman here you go yeah okay i hit my shots but i think i've uh i've done what i've done what there is to do with that gun you know my work you've achieved everything you can yeah you're just looking for the next challenge you know oh yeah care package oh god a rich do you have a wingman skin please i can't do this yes yes yes yes that is the worst thing oh my god i disagree with you no just just drop it all right you're gonna die quick where's my stuff mates all over the place is that my skin that's horrible uh it's just like the def no even the one that i have on this account is terrible too all the default ones are just really bad somewhere yeah i might be over here a massive mountain apparently it's right over the top i like this angle uh you want to go like over there yeah there's two guys going up that road i can bounce paddles over here i'm sorry all right it's fine either or right behind him and over here careful 126. i guys need a crack too does he challenge after i've won 2016 uh yes i'm let me go for the rest there's still somebody on high ground from like a different team recharging shields oh my god someone's got a crater i'm not sure which side it was i think it's uh yeah there's still a team uh there's still team up there at the very top but they're not moving i'm gonna i'm gonna try and kill these guys alright here i'll go with you rich do you want to i'm scanned they scan me from a player they have craig right i think you go you guys are alone i'm trying to i'm trying to kill this yeah i think we just rotate let's yes it's uh octane i can put a pad i miss that fraction last squad has a crabber perform oh my god good grief i don't want to stand still my mystic oh oh dear oh they're becoming my keep it coming from oh god oh god i'm coming we're coming there they're they're really just they're just they're just holding that but they stopped the craver so we're coming that's tough yeah i'm down as well there's a zip you know there's a zip down like inside of them i'm gonna go for a weird flag give me a second he's trying to come here behind him i'll either distract them or kill them well they have to fall off they have to fall off oh okay oh yeah they do never mind yeah that one but you mate i think i think it will work might as well yeah there's no point yeah it's they're going to move late because they're just they're still trying to shoot me one's dropping a little bit one drop one drops see it's cracked octane's nearly cracked that's crap i'm here nice where's the other one inside uh inside one of them is inside i think something there's another guy somewhere i think it's two i think it's two yes two all the damage that's full send it yeah second in the first so far but now we're going into plat lobby so it's gonna be a little bit more tough actually you know what you know that was my warm-up game yeah yeah this is just warm-up games oh nice gg we love that oh my goodness damage boys oh my i love to see it it's actually like absurd how much teamwork there is in this game oh yeah it's just completely different from war zone yeah yeah definitely
