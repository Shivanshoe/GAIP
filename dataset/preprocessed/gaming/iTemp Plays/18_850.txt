Rossi never seen came at the woodwork man that was difficult your teammate risk or up in Gibraltar and your Sat appear I don't understand how this happened our mouths okay I'm switching it up this guy's already landed here it is then here down low so if I get a good up top which I have not like one of these and I got one of these he's all do someone was in here we need to mess him up somewhere where do you go I'm here I'm helping nice my garage down the enemies aren't availed from from over this way is because I jumped too late and they would have given us just such a terrible spawn know if you can't get it good there's not one I didn't know and we would not be not to get any goodness I'm afraid they can't meet you from me I seem to have run away prematurely here I'll come back I'm gonna sneak it let's look some leaks and I've come back nice damage that means is one more uno mas it's hurting it's really turned me bad not game like myself over to where was it caught at that place its containment its containment and I could have check the math quick it's a lot of stuff going on I'm gonna I've left my - I need some help here I'm not gonna need them I'll print just die straight up represent - up top he was all the way up top briefed in longboat scrap that way let's never get over to the existing scrap and trying to avoid the charge rifle slash long buddies me that it's over these I don't really need a pink nose and the reason I don't explain them is because they're absolutely everywhere if you played your funny nose thank you friend please one of those it stood a scrap over this way I want to get my teammates up top the Biddle way see feel is just me but I want my teammates to get up here as well what's up they are well they've got to where we were unless it's actually in here hey hey stop that Onoda you don't see me not coming for you and my whole squads coming for you look at these guys no we did not connect at the right time you think can you do this is just random guard oh this is Cheney I think it's call I would have run off into the sunset if there was one that is straight back where we came from again we've done a lot of running around here there Kenny it's guys going to grapple Oh God we know there's a like a team that way to my teammates weak nice I'm coming we got triple time man whole squads now we just have to be careful to play man these I have one shield and I'm going straight back into the action I'm not sure if this is the right play hopefully I don't get triple to this cuz we we absolutely will get you getting triple our damage on the back though yeah I don't want to go that way I need shields she needs health come back teammate there you go hopefully we can just chill for a second I let these guys find each other there you go you use a manky friend I'm just going to use it okay would you stand there for a second there's definitely team beneath us was definitely team weapony for summers reviving unless he was that the Pathfinder it's going to revive from that lifeline perhaps 22 people laugh it's good grief all right well containment has been an absolute wild right and if anyone needs that some hay the balls won't go and me so I'll say that much there's some of these syringes throw balls have been absolutely key in the destruction of some of these teams here okay that's you got you got a sore leg you got a super day you know I think we play that really well sometimes you just got to play smart we let those guys sort of damage each other a little bit when the time is right we got high ground we tickle them they fell over and died both teams are like that that was juggling I won so you guys Tommy that means let's go I think I think I think that's what he said oh I can't remember now my French lessons could've just taken the zip wire yes could've but I didn't want to okay I wanted to use the old grapple of justice great work there by the way by my teammates absolutely tremendous performance from the squad that may be a lifeline one but it hasn't taken it which would be weird hey life flow ones don't do that don't they show up like that come on Oklahoma Dharma okay might need those okay she picked enough that's fine cold armor I think she look to see are we just rushing people I'll tell you what I won't mind just cutting the video until the last two teams after we've seen a corner for Ashley's game but these guys want a rush they want to rush a dark of these corridors good grief I'm speaks French I'm speak I think no none over this way I can a lot of people stretch to school team which means they would have been down there somewhere whether the thing came it I think it came from this way I had crossed a containment so I'm pretty sure that's what it was so I jumped late and I had to double back to whatever this place is called well she can't really help see much no one when you discover this Lobby a bit of this this actually demolished nice a police clutter up heard you got this to me one oh my god teammates I've never been I've never been killed so fast before nice job I thought I threw it all away Thank You teammate oh good god yes I thought they'd be running away I thought they'd be fleeing the scene but it's not what happened possum pickles some throw balls out a full shield battery so I need those as much three squads left I missed a lot like double headshot by a by a wingman awesome man like I don't even know what that was I my name is shir what noise I made I don't even one I was gonna try and recreate it right there blood I don't want it I don't have really leaves that ever again that was that's quite the melt in those ways please can we go look at this world record attempts although I ran the map ah I felt I fell short thought I heard someone shoot somebody's that way but they need to start it'll be okay to just go he's pretty useful oh here we go here we go k1 teens up top one teams down low cray bets oh my god don't take it thanks I don't know if this is a good idea this is boring about on here I can barely see friends I can barely see is it male we could honestly we could easily sit back and just chill here and put handed we're gonna get ourselves pinched it's gonna get ourselves pinched that's the thing oh that's nothing to him it tends to all of it last I've seen done I'll do that's pretty help to a lot there we go messing up dodging balls man machine sight but you want no I should go oh come on oh my word I thought that last trade the shop was it I thought that was the last crazy shot now for some reason I thought that was our bangalore smoke as well yeah it was not he was absolutely not our Bangalore ultimate I needed got absolutely destroyed at the end of that game cher take the team what an absolute solid unit we were 20 squad kills I didn't even do a thousand average what what do you mean I did a decent amount maybe I should have finished more kills you know I think that still counts awesome damage it what at least it would have ticked me over the thousand damage mark but I got more kills and my teammates combined but I got the least amount of damage um not gonna just have an opportunistic you know greed possibly potentially I prefer opportunistic that's what I'm saying thank you for watching I do appreciate it absolutely tremendous squat down Kings Canyon it feels good to be back my friends I'm gonna try our best to get a load of the games for you on this map that'll last us hopefully for a little while every now and again I'll just throw it all or what's that art it's
