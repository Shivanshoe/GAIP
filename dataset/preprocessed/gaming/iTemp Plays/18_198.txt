hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and apex has been getting crazier recently everyone lands at the same places and i'm guilty of these i love me a bit of scrappy talk but over the last few months it's progressively just been more and more hectic every game and this game was a tale of survival amongst the action so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends everyone's been stealing broken recently you know yeah market it's making me really mad there's some point almost there what's your friend say yeah i have no bullets oh another squad another squad yeah i have literally no bullets at all i'm literally stuck in a corner i'm literally stuck in a corner rich i am stuck i can't get out wait i killed her [Laughter] i can't get out i can't get out what thanks i don't know if they're mate help me get me out of here oh god i'm gonna die i'm gonna give me an arm or something he's my third revive i've got nothing i'm stupid i am not even trolling i am a step pro hello come on there's another team coming in oh my god no matter where we land man good job lifeline which they did pretty well so that's my kill i mean i'm on the other side of the map now at this point yeah yeah slowly no shields i have a i've randomly got a sentinel oh is it gone me hello i missed uh survive lord knows i'm trying oh my god how are we alive right now you were stuck in a corner i've been i've literally been revived three times if i go down again i'm dead yeah stop going down i'm trying switching oh nice job tempo oh okay i have one cell oh my god climbing up oh my god mate i'm gonna use my one cell then i'll come over i just ate that bk shot i have no shield each shield zero shield each packaging surprisingly but where might be bomb we've full four i don't know how we're alive mate this is mental the lifeline closes up so much yeah yeah she definitely did i don't know how she survived i when i was stuck in the corner like this wraith ran ran in there and she tried hiding in the corner she just hid right in front of me and i just like shot her are they yeah anyway almost down though excuse me wait there's one on my head one is a charge rampage okay next teammate this lifeline's a beast they uh revolted i'll go up top oh that way down low they're everywhere we're down again different team oh my god the raves they have all on me sent two of them back i have to run i have to run i've got all three revs i've got nothing for teammate yeah yeah i've got three of them send back i do back up back back up i don't have any i don't ever make it i have two oh man i'm gonna have to leave her she's clutched up i'm gonna have to come back here you go here you go i gotta go i'm gonna charge up real quick i'm gonna try and run into it on thursday are they finding somebody else he's gone lifeline's won i got a whole team on me have no energy so yeah i got a whole team on me i'm just it's literally 1v4 right here that's mental so i had no bullets awesome is up here oh my god i have to heal oh my god this game's been mental i was trying to first with the sentinel and then i hit the shield it just takes so long to first i may sort of just die oh god mobile respawn this is humongous i have three med kits we've got a lifeline i've heat shields you drop your med kit on there oh it dies like that i've never seen it before nice thank you all good that rev team was scary there's a ah there's an r9 in there with base no lights but at times he's carrying light so you should be okay and there's so many boxes there trying to lose my box we've got a minute 40. like that's ages oh my god we gotta go far farther i genuinely start running in the next sort of 10 seconds i'm on my way it's horrible like this rotation because it's so awkward to get around like the tunnels over here you know i don't have any heat shields should have got some yeah i have some rings closing in think it's going down is that the right play down to harvester i think so i think go this way are you how many heels have you got i can drop your med i've got one med king force syringe okay i'm gonna drop them for you on the um train track okay what no i got i have plenty of meds i have uh like six syringes okay i just want i won't have to use them at all i'm already out of it i mean i don't even know if i'll be in the zone oh yeah you're fine someone just ash cute here watch my back oh mate we're contesting for this they could be altered i'm almost there i'm not there yet are there a navy oh god nice job okay oh my god she's oh my god she got oh no that's so bad did we just go either way it's fused he's gonna keep doing that i think we just got either way i've got a heat shield mate i think we just run uh yeah i don't have much but i'll follow you i have one med kit four syringes that was so unfortunate when she went up on your tactical she like got put on the top of the cliff and then i couldn't get up there now going to drop it i have to drop my headshot here in a sec i think i'm fine though you did really want to push up there oh this is the last team here i think this is the last team i'm gonna respawn right here well honestly that kill on the ash was huge oh they hate me where's the audio he's still in your bubble he's gonna burst his teammates here i'll crack him i need to heal though oh these is right under you it could be so awake i'm going to try and stay on your line as well because he's going to try and thirst okay yeah i'm going to drop a name he's pushing right he's pushing right yeah nice job did you hear that no no yeah i think they they must have seen us coming to the respawn but the thing is if they did they just shot me because i was like seen on it i don't know i didn't hear him at all yeah no i didn't hear him at all he i think he was a scratch there good job good clutch oh that was both of you guys i didn't do a thing i stole it are you kidding me we'd have died we'd have died at the uh just as we were in the zone there at the end we'd have died there hundred percent oh yeah i was just out here [Laughter]
