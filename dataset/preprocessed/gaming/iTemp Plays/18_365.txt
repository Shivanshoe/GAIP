all right guys we are here at the genesis event as you can see there is a takeover active called legacy map set back into the original king's canyon and world's edge during the genesis event these legacy maps will replace the map rotation in play apex for the duration of the event ranked will obviously remain unchanged because that would be a little bit weird to do um mid-season so we have this which is the free reward in the genesis event you can read this if you like seems like a big paragraph uh i'll skip to the i mean you've got trackers for who who's the track is for valkyrie oh i have 177 valkyrie kills got a little is that octane's mask looks like that octane scheme we've got a watson skin here very colorful very colorful i believe this is these are the three rewards aren't they charge rifle skin everyone's favorite gun the old dweeb machine called the feudal glory oh it's supposed to be like a it's like a royal one and then we have the either eight kinetic energy this is actually kind of nice my problem with the other e-brake legendary skins is there's a lot of clutter on the sides and sometimes it can get in the way especially that reindeer either aid skin but that is not why we are here we are here for the where is it where do i buy the where do i buy the heirlooms and stuff where's the heirloom oh here we go i found it here it is this is why we are here dead man's curve the revenant melee weapon skin i love how it opens up and closed like that i guarantee this has got some incredible animations tied to it i'm not going to look at the skins for this event just yet i'm going to buy all the packs and now we have 24 and then once we've opened up all the 24 we can get our hands on the heirloom so we now have 277 facts i'm saving them for a big video i'm trying to get to level 500. um is this part of the event or is this i don't know if this is even part of the events because it's still the shark thing i don't think this is part of the event hold on we've got another we've got all the packs to open up here there we go these are the event packs now so i mean i've got some crafty materials a new vault skin you know what i've got to get rid of the uh crocodile skin i'm putting that on all right the first of 24 packs here for the genesis event we get a legendary but there's a high chance again a legendary guaranteed one event skin per pack i haven't seen any of these skins this is a glorious omatsuri fury and we get the tracker for valkyrie this event as well so i mean it's looking like a good a good event for you valkyrie maids out there which i'm sure there are many off because she's a fun legend to play next up we have a sentinel skin that looks outrageous are you kidding me i love this gradient orange and yellow on the on the barrel of the gun i believe that's called a barrel if not i'm sure 300 people will correct me in the comment section got ourselves another legendary event skin the event skins are always in the middle by the way so you can get legendary still uh for the other two uh chances that you get per pack beautiful flatline skin i'm so sad i don't have the battle pass flatline skin uh on my pc account so i only transitioned to pc in like i don't know season six maybe season five season six something like that there's the revenant skin that we saw in the trailer for this event synthetic shinobi it's got like a japanese sort of vibe this whole event doesn't it i mean because that's a bonsai tree i mean it was that and it's fairly obvious right i'm sure the people picked up on that before i did and i've embarrassed myself here a little weapon charm little transformer looks like the horizon skin oh you can't you can't apply the uh the weapon charms from in here so i'm actually really nervous recording this video because as i'm recording this england are playing against germany and the second half has just kicked off and it's nil nil as i'm recording this by the time this video is uploaded the game is probably finished or very close and i am absolutely freaking it i i missed what the event i think is a skydive email i was talking about football hot potato it's fusing his grenades he loves his grenades and he's blown himself up we're gonna start spinning through these packs though because we've got 24 double legendary double legendary here we go event legendary is the crypto skin called inconspicuous oh okay we saw this in the event trailer as well and the other one i got is for watson fly by wire not the not the greatest legendary i've ever seen i'm sure we'll get i'm pretty sure watson had i know she had in their free awards didn't she so i'll apply that once i've unlocked it here's the transformer skin for horizon unfortunately they have nerfed her i mean i'm sort of glad that they did nerf her because i hated playing against horizons she was just way too mobile in the air but i'm applying it anyway for those few games where i do play horizon i feel like i'm rocking back like i've got this thing that when i record myself sometimes when i watch it back i realized i'd rock back and forth in my chair um and i have no idea why i do it and because i'm nervous at the moment because the football game i assume i'm doing something similar i mean this is an event skin it's not the greatest octane skin i've ever got but it is part i mean if you put one pack for the event and you got that octane skin you'd be slightly disappointed when there are these other skins on offer the useful triple take skin what's it called death rap seems a bit violent i won't call this a death wrap but you know another of the legendary events i've got an arthur one skin on the left i like that sort of like a galaxy i actually kind of like that cosmos he's the gibby skin he's got his army on he's ready he's got he's got his arm shield he's free 75 health every three seconds the reason we all hate playing against skivvies next up we have a candy cane longbow skin very festive are we sure this is part of the same event because this looks like a christmas tree i'm putting on when i do my when i eventually open up all of these apex packs this is gonna be like a two hour video all right this is going to match my it just looks like a toy doesn't it i mean it's got the little wheels there too it's got it's got three wheels on it's like a little tricycle it's going to match my horizon skin and i'll put that with a gun charm on there that looks like a transformer as well a full matching transformer outfit here's the pathfinder skin for the event very camouflaged in a field would not spot this guy at all if you're looking to play stealthy um play best friend with a little pause on there this is the skin that you want it takes a while to open up 24 packs and i've got 260. so it might the video that i'm planning might take a while oh legendary banner flame banner frame not banner flame this is for fuse i'm always using him or one of my favorite legends to play and we get a weapon charm this wasn't part of the event because it's on the left this was part of the event next up another legendary it's the loba skin that we saw in the events petty theft it's a decent skin i'll put it on i don't have too many lobe skins so crypto banner frame he's in his outfit because i've applied that skin as well very inconspicuous decrypted he's called got a wraith skin which is absolutely horrendous i'll put it on next pack i think we started on 280 so we're looking at 256 for the heirloom opening hemlock skin beautiful oh it's got like a little oh it's got a little duck face cuteness overload i love it put it on there einstein's looked exactly the same beautiful transest what's the word transescent it's not it's not a word is it i've tried another legendary but for grabs here's the bangalore skin that we saw in the trailer as well got the helmet on got the g7 scoped i mean beautiful put that on well my prediction was wrong i thought we were at the heirloom we must have started past or lower than uh oh no because we had a few of the shark thing oh my god a new volt skin a new vault skin this is tremendous because i'm i'm kind of getting sick of that crocodile one i've been using for the last three seasons this is a legendary vault skin no it's not it's an epic but it's still nice he's still betting the crocodile skin that i am getting sick of this could be the alien one more skins i mean it's only good news legendary g7 scout i didn't realize there was a legendary g7 scout in this i've got the reactive one and this kind of looks similar but it's nice i like it oh i was i was completely wrong with my prediction of the heirloom opening havoc skin tremendous got the blue uh going to purple and then into the to the pink at the end there beautiful color gradient very colorful events i will say two legendaries always a good day when you get a double legendary first up we have the pk this is far better than my breeze of breach of peace one that i have i'm throwing on pal 9000 the event skin that we have is a banner pose almost too easy uh with logan and the other legendary was this r99 but it's got the circular sight you see i'm not putting that on you can't shoot an r99 with that circular sight hey it's the alien one here we go i'm just gonna bask in the glory for a second that is a tremendous banner pose for revenant there on the right-hand side what is the intro quip it's all menacing is the dead man's curve that we've already previewed but it is absolutely tremendous heirloom i will should i replace the feasts i kind of like the feasts ah yeah go on why not we'll throw it on and then we have this abanapos with his heirloom an absolutely tremendous heirloom i'm going to load up into the fine range i'm so nervous to check the football score oh my word i don't want to know we played well first half i thought how do i inspect on pc what's the button oh it's n here we go here's some of the animations sliding down the hill oh my goodness i love how like slow the animation is like he's so oh god this is the coolest hair loom in the game i don't care what anyone say this is the new number one i'm not sure what the old number one was but this is the new one open it up idiot chop him up i feel i feel like this is doing 200 damage a hit that's how brutal this heirloom is need my armor i missed there you go that is the new revenant heirloom thank you for watching i do appreciate it make sure you sub into the channel if you're new because i've got some more gameplay of the genesis event genesis
