hey what's up guys it's free welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are taking a first look at season 13 of apex we have a load of new info and footage and the first thing i want to mention is the giant monster point of interest that's new to storm points in the previous trailer we saw the legends fighting this behemoth and on ea's website they said it was coming to storm point now for some reason i expected it to be alive when it arrived i'm not sure what was gonna happen i don't know how that's gonna work but this makes way more sense that it's dead because we saw them killing in the trailer that does make a lot of sense now it appears to be on the northern part of the map i think it's just north of checkpoint down the hill the monster itself looks like it's been excavated already there are pathways beneath it with what i assume to be a load of loot to fight for there are regular buildings dotted around this as this would be where the workers would be this is a work site and they're harvesting i assume the organs or they're just trying to clean it up at this point i'm not really sure maybe they're doing research on this beast i don't know now this poi looks great and it will definitely give more life to that part of the map the northern part of the map at the moment this area is heavily dominated by checkpoints and mills but i do like those pois as well alongside this new point of interest is a map update elsewhere these small pods on the beach on the coastline which you can enter and fight swarms of robot guards from titanfall to earn better loot kind of like a mini bloodhound trials i assume there might be some of these on every part of the map next up we get to see newcastle in game his abilities look amazing his passive allows him to drag down teammates and i think he's reviving them as he's dragging them with the revive shields as well this revived shield is white and then another part of the trailer it looks like it's blue so perhaps it uses that person's knockdown shield as a reference to what level of shield newcastle will revive with now i do feel bad for lifeline mates though they must be absolutely livid his ability his shield is deployable it's surprisingly tall for some reason and you can redirect it here he uses it to negate an incoming mad maggie ultimate and send it back where it came from and finally his ultimate looks like a real life saver quick to deploy actually big enough to provide cover for your entire team and you still have your regular ability shield on top of that too newcastle looks like an amazing defensive legend in the battle pass section of this trailer we get what appears to be a level 100 spitfire skin this pretty much guarantees it coming out of the care package i'm not really sure what they're going to replace it with usually they try and replace it with the same kind of weapon to keep things balanced so maybe the devotion maybe the rampage but i think the rampage is going in the replicator it could be something like the wingman i hope he's not the wingman i love the wingman three of my favorite guns might go in the care package warded up the scout and the vault if they take the wingman i'm gonna quit i'm gonna play warzone until one of them comes out so that is our first look of gameplay for season 13 of apex legends i'm incredibly excited for this to come out i hope you guys are as well i have a great game of apex here for you to enjoy so i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends an enemy landed near me their final mistake opening fire i'm out of heavy ammo somebody on the roof yep someone dropped two i'm out of light ammo we're inside the next ring superior position i need a bit of light but apart from that i'm good what do you think is over here okay i can make use of that i hope you don't need that door [Music] do i have time for affinity they're taking a bro i think they left yeah they're shoots two bullets and then runs i think that was the plan that was the game plan that wasn't surprising 301 here maybe he's going to respawn his teammate they are fighting on the other end of the gravity lift cannon lift cannon thruster this way all right i'm on my way right here i can ash portal maybe on top of the roof i mean i'm nowhere near so yeah but you can like use it for luck oh look at this look at this you can already hit it though tails yeah and might be using that i suck okay she's gone so much i can't get up there saw you there i'm lagging like my game keeps getting it get up did you hear that shot like one wingman shot yeah i don't know where though do you think he was up this way because i thought it was this way i think so i don't know if it was like inside or not though oh yeah enemy far don't let them slip away park star out time to bind you they stole my fuse kill there's a team to the left and the right what's going on there's nearly cracked right in this corner he ran outside from here i didn't realize no to die enemy shield cracked does it also team outside is yeah what is going on with you saying you don't have bats when you have bats every time recharging that's a lot of bats i'm not even getting that red and don't care no i took it back okay so i thought i didn't have any bats but i do i think that's the pressurized yeah him that kind of sucks they should have stayed in third place though i mean you haven't done it once have you no i don't know i'm just spamming the buttons i'm spamming jump crap i don't know what the heck i'm doing it's like when this game came out to warbands i thought you needed to crouch when you hit the wall as you can imagine my face planted every wall i don't know what i couldn't be bothered to look it up ah you need uh you need steady to what bounce ah i should be fine then oh no oh no oh there 30 seconds ago they're gonna be coming like here meet me here would they have gone right through draken it was a while ago oh right here just spotted someone out there and then one across 30 seconds before the ring closes i shattered an enemy's shield reloading octane's one no we got him yeah he was nice that's the only one you it's the okay that devo sounds just like the worst time i mean it's it's pretty dumb i don't even want to turbo oh my god poor guys it looked like they were having a good game yep until they met the diva i have 35 bullets in my that's that's the problem yeah that's the crafter right here for care package just to the left absolutely not just no you have there's only two squads left they're not going to fight for that absolutely not let's get yourself a you know 120 bullets i would rather die with no ammo and then complain about it okay well i saw you craft a fight on a stream the other day so nope don't know what you're talking about i literally saw it you deleted the video you must be embarrassed about crafting that was pretty embarrassing i'm not gonna lie replicator dropping of course you've got pad i've we can probably make that building if we combine forces my attention is needed elsewhere i mean they'll be further in this right okay what do you mean i'm not going up there they're way too far away turn this way okay you are actually what they're all the way up here you said like five times you're gonna pop it and you never pop it where needs to be gavin be bowed is the right dead oh yeah bad what do you mean about that are you angry at me for using a pad but not i'm absolutely angry at you oh well i don't know to say teammate you are the apex champions i saw a death box just disappear yep hey
