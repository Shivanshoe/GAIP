hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be talking about season 11's new legend and new weapon which have been revealed today in the background i have some of the tales from the outlands trailer the drop today going on there's a link to that in the description if you want to watch it without me talking all over it and it's all about season 11's new legend ash who've seen before in apex in the first quest series a long time ago that might have even been like 18 months ago now it was a long long time ago now ash is a robot but she has a human mind she was a titan pilot and she was badly injured and her mind was transferred to a robot body i have this info from the apex legends wiki and it's actually reminded me that i need to finish my titanfall 2 let's play so i have this information down for myself apologies to those that were watching the time for two let's play it's been a long time since i've posted my last episode on that but i think my next episode is where i will be fighting ash and hopefully taking her down so apologies to everyone there it was actually me that killed it and put us in this situation also on ea's website is the new weapon coming into the new season the car smg this is such a beast of a gun on titanfall 2. if you played titanfall 2 you've used this gun and you have dominated with it guaranteed because it's like the vault that we already have but better this is going to mix up things in the meta i'm certain of this it's got low recoil high damage and great hip fire everything that you would want from an smg and i can't wait to get my hands on it be sure to subscribe to the channel here for more season 11 news as it comes out thank you for watching and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends the purple armor okay this is why this spot's the best i got both guns no punching today guys tina's probably got through the guy him for like 110. no punching too fair though they didn't land on us to punch us they landed at the same time and i got both guns so there's an octane turning around somewhere i really want that med kit he's gonna take it that's fine i need help i mean i could use syringes yeah oh there we go thanks guy thanks beautiful very much appreciated mate gets me back up and healthy because this octane is probably lurking around here somewhere i don't know where he went there's someone here i need to be here across is 100 hide in here somewhere that's my after i want some shield bats got a brand new bag what he got his teammates banner no way he isn't just creeping in one of these i'm not even sure what you'd call them donuts let's go on donuts extended energy mag here level three whenever you come to a state late it's either that the fight is either still going on or it's just a graveyard there are so many boxes here and fortunately for me and the teammate i am a lobo what we got no shield bats no attachments i can use that's a tragedy you are coming home with me tonight i don't think i even took you who cares not a problem maybe we should have landed estates i mean it was clearly popping off there when i got two kills 800 damage i'm fine with that if you want to fight on olympus as well at this stage in the game you just run to the middle fountain you'll find someone over this way everyone understands what's going on it's like you land somewhere you have a fight and then everyone goes fancy here oh you can see me yeah keep chasing me i've got high ground here and i've got a teammate they may be lulled into a full sense of security here there's a fight going on behind them though i think they've retreated i think i'll shoot them in the back teammates kind of close by yes okay yeah come inside then outside in the shadows oh my god put this gun in the care package i'm low drive so many bullets that's fine i put the pressure on it's got no knock down shield so it's given the pressure of two it's got red that means he's not reviving at least we just need to push this together like with easy 1v2 if we just there together just hold hands it's the key to victory on this game especially using a devotion oh my lord flatline arthro 1 is honestly an underrated combo but the flatline may as well be an smg the hip fire is so good oh my lord i let him leave the team's closing in i'm just gonna get up top i messed up i don't know how i didn't want the bangalore they couldn't have got father surely come see the merchandise no bats i mean i've got two already but that's that's atrocious these are some low impact low protonates right here it is keeping me topped up on the on the ammunition though when these guys aren't closing in the zone's gonna move us this way anyway so i guess we just leave i guess we just move i was gonna say move first but these guys left 35 minutes ago i guess we just moved second i don't know how they would have snuck past though i don't understand how they would have got past the team at hammond labs well i guess they did up this is a weird angle to try and skynaid because i've already got some elevation on them oh there we go whacked him one recharging my shield i'm on load my tummy to mania we could just hold them okay i didn't realize he got one one shot he's got this guy he's cracked in his full red shield you got it there you go teammate here we go beautiful i was trying to play too safe tim is a maniac i mean he's playing uh he's playing octane i should have known i should have known his tendencies i don't know how but i'm nearly on 2000 damage i actually don't even know where that's come from when i one clipped a few people in inside like the tunnels i guess but one clipping people doesn't get your damage you know if you want if you want a damage farm you get a g7 you get a charge rifle you see a range you don't kill people you just you make them weak and you let them pop a phoenix kit pop some shield bats maybe and then you start shooting them again but i don't know 2000 damage here seems a little bit more than i deserve not sure why i've risked that this isn't even a good way to go i think we take the jump tower care package on the way whenever he ends at gardens it always ends in the same place i'm not talking about the rings i just mean the team that survives is usually the team that sits all the way up top but i don't think you can reach it from this jump tower you can't care package land on the left amazing that's a little cheeky peak maybe someone's coming over this way i see someone over there it's wake this way my i said we keep this guy alive honestly the guy will drive back or you could just full auto devon that that works too that way i feel like i shouldn't have let them know we were here they would have walked up the ramp and we would have just had such ultimate high ground but now they're wary of us you know now they're not gonna walk up the ramp like a a pair of fools they're gonna they're gonna walk around or something enemy there see this is why i should not have let them know that we were hanging around the place and they're going to boost and now they're going to get the high ground too darn it i knew this was going to happen we should have just sat up on the high ground there's someone over there oh there's already someone there i wanted to kill this guy took my kill but i definitely did not deserve i'm still angry about it though yeah my teammates sound like he was ripping them apart with the spitfire so it could be this guy with the gold knocked down or it could be the other guy knocked someone's killed him with a spitfire that is brutal here we go another re45 flatline this guy is playing off metal i tell you what i appreciate it that's the combo of dreams right there uh i've got some good news i've got some bad news the good good news is with the ones with the high ground the bad news is we are getting pushed off the high ground real soon i don't even know where these guys are and i'm scared they have a crater absolutely shredded i have one shield cell and i've missed the pad again we have 45 seconds and the next ring is right there don't leave anything good behind we've got 30 seconds to get to the next ring if you go recharging my shields bats might be a little bit excessive i can always get those back with my ultimate as well one's pushing up i was turning single fire this is a tragedy i got basically i'll forget it he's probably popped a bat by now my cat is in front of my monitor i thought you were a decoy i can't really get there tell my teammate sounds like he's absolutely popping off with his space fire hello did i get 3000 damage i mean it might be one of the least deserved 3000 damage games of all time i actually don't know where all my damage came from like genuinely i don't know where it came from i don't feel like i thirsty that many people i did 3054. 11 kills got the three assists in there as well teammate was absolutely popping off with the spitfire he's left he was a gg though gigi's all-round
